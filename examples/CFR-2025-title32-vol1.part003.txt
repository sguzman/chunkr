CMMC Level 2 certification assessment and affirmation requirements.
(a)
Level 2 certification assessment.
To comply with Level 2 certification assessment requirements, the OSC must meet the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. An OSC undergoes a Level 2 certification assessment as detailed in paragraph (c) of this section to achieve a CMMC Status of either Conditional or Final Level 2 (C3PAO). Achieving a CMMC Status of Level 2 (C3PAO) also satisfies the requirements for a CMMC Statuses of Level 1 (Self) and Level 2 (Self) set forth in §§ 170.15 and 170.16 respectively for the same CMMC Assessment Scope.
(1)
Level 2 certification assessment requirements.
The OSC must complete and achieve a MET result for all security requirements specified in § 170.14(c)(3) to achieve the CMMC Status of Level 2 (C3PAO). The OSC must obtain a Level 2 certification assessment from an authorized or accredited C3PAO following the procedures outlined in paragraph (c) of this section. The C3PAO must submit the Level 2 certification assessment results into the CMMC instantiation of eMASS, which then provides automated transmission to SPRS. To maintain compliance with the requirements for a CMMC Status of Level 2 (C3PAO), the Level 2 certification assessment must be completed within three years of the CMMC Status Date associated with the Conditional Level 2 (C3PAO).
(i)
Inputs into the CMMC instantiation of eMASS.
The Level 2 certification assessment results input into the CMMC instantiation of eMASS shall include, at minimum, the following information:
(A) Date and level of the assessment.
(B) C3PAO name.
(C) Assessment unique identifier.
(D) For each Assessor conducting the assessment, name and business contact information.
(E) All industry CAGE codes associated with the information systems addressed by the CMMC Assessment Scope.
(F) The name, date, and version of the SSP.
(G) CMMC Status Date.
(H) Assessment result for each requirement objective.

M usage and compliance, as applicable.
(J) List of the artifact names, the return value of the hashing algorithm, and the hashing algorithm used.
(ii)
Conditional Level 2 (C3PAO).
The OSC has achieved the CMMC Status of Conditional Level 2 (C3PAO) if the Level 2 certification assessment results in a POA
M and the POA
M meets all CMMC Level 2 POA
M requirements listed in § 170.21(a)(2).
(A)
Plan of Action and Milestones.
A Level 2 POA
M is allowed only in accordance with the CMMC POA
M requirements listed in § 170.21.
(B)
POA
M closeout.
The OSC must remediate any NOT MET requirements, must undergo a POA
M closeout certification assessment from a C3PAO, and the C3PAO must post compliance results into the CMMC instantiation of eMASS within 180 days of the CMMC Status Date associated with the Conditional Level 2 (C3PAO). If the POA
M is not successfully closed out within the 180-day timeframe, the Conditional Level 2 (C3PAO) CMMC Status for the information system will expire. If Conditional Level 2 (C3PAO) CMMC Status
expires within the period of performance of a contract, standard contractual remedies will apply, and the OSC will be ineligible for additional awards with a requirement for the CMMC Status of Level 2 (C3PAO), or higher requirement, for the information system within the CMMC Assessment Scope until such time as a new CMMC Status is achieved.
(iii)
Final Level 2 (C3PAO).
The OSC has achieved the CMMC Status of Final Level 2 (C3PAO) if the Level 2 certification assessment results in a passing score as defined in § 170.24. This score may be achieved upon initial certification assessment or as the result of a POA
M closeout certification assessment, as applicable.
(iv)
CMMC Status investigation.
The DoD reserves the right to conduct a DCMA DIBCAC assessment of the OSC, as provided for under the 48 CFR 252.204-7020. If the investigative results of a subsequent DCMA DIBCAC assessment show that adherence to the provisions of this part have not been achieved or maintained, these DCMA DIBCAC results will take precedence over any pre-existing CMMC Status. At that time, standard contractual remedies will be available and the OSC will be ineligible for additional awards with CMMC Status requirement of Level 2 (C3PAO), or higher requirement, for the information system within the CMMC Assessment Scope until such time as a new CMMC Status is achieved.

CMMC Level 3 certification assessment and affirmation requirements.
(a)
Level 3 certification assessment.
To comply with Level 3 certification assessment requirements, the OSC must meet the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. An OSC undergoes a Level 3 certification assessment as detailed in paragraph (c) of this section to achieve a CMMC Status of either Conditional or Final Level 3 (DIBCAC). A CMMC Status of Final Level 2 (C3PAO) for information systems within the Level 3 CMMC Assessment Scope is a prerequisite to undergo a Level 3 certification assessment. CMMC Level 3 recertification also has a prerequisite for a new CMMC Level 2 assessment. Achieving a CMMC Status of Level 3 (DIBCAC) also satisfies the requirements for CMMC Statuses of Level 1 (Self), Level 2 (Self), and Level 2 (C3PAO) set forth in §§ 170.15 through 170.17 respectively for the same CMMC Assessment Scope.
(1)
Level 3 certification assessment requirements.
The OSC must achieve a CMMC Status of Final Level 2 (C3PAO) on the Level 3 CMMC Assessment Scope, as defined in § 170.19(d), prior to initiating a Level 3 certification assessment, which will be performed by DCMA DIBCAC (
www.dcma.mil/DIBCAC
) on behalf of the DoD. The OSC must complete and achieve a MET result for all security requirements specified in table 1 to § 170.14(c)(4) to achieve the CMMC Status of Level 3 (DIBCAC). DCMA DIBCAC will submit the Level 3 certification assessment results into the CMMC instantiation of eMASS, which then provides automated transmission to SPRS. To maintain compliance with the requirements for a CMMC Status of Level 3 (DIBCAC), the Level 3 certification assessment must be performed every three years for all information systems within the Level 3 CMMC Assessment Scope. In addition, given that compliance with Level 2 requirements is a prerequisite for applying for CMMC Level 3, a Level 2 (C3PAO) certification assessment must also be conducted every three years to maintain CMMC
Level 3 (DIBCAC) status. Level 3 certification assessment must be completed within three years of the CMMC Status Date associated with the Final Level 3 (DIBCAC) or, if there was a POA
M, then within three years of the CMMC Status Date associated with the Conditional Level 3 (DIBCAC).

M and the POA
M meets all CMMC Level 3 POA
M requirements listed in § 170.21(a)(3).
(A)
Plan of Action and Milestones.
A Level 3 POA
M is allowed only in accordance with the CMMC POA
M requirements listed in § 170.21.
(B)
POA
M closeout.
The OSC must remediate any NOT MET requirements, must undergo a POA
M closeout certification assessment from DCMA DIBCAC, and DCMA DIBCAC must post compliance results into the CMMC instantiation of eMASS within 180 days of the CMMC Status Date associated with the Conditional Level 3 (DIBCAC). If the POA
M is not successfully closed out within the 180-day timeframe, the Conditional Level 3 (DIBAC) CMMC Status for the information system will expire. If Conditional Level 3 (DIBCAC) CMMC Status expires within the period of performance of a contract, standard contractual remedies will apply, and the OSC will be ineligible for additional awards with a requirement for the CMMC Status of Level 3 (DIBCAC) for the information system within the CMMC Assessment Scope until such time as a new CMMC Status is achieved.
(iii)
Final Level 3 (DIBCAC).
The OSC has achieved the CMMC Status of Final Level 3 (DIBCAC) if the Level 3 certification assessment results in a passing score as defined in § 170.24. This score may be achieved upon initial certification assessment or as the result of a POA
M closeout certification assessment, as applicable.
(iv)
CMMC Status investigation.
The DoD reserves the right to conduct a DCMA DIBCAC assessment of the OSC, as provided for under the 48 CFR 252.204-7020. If the investigative results of a subsequent DCMA DIBCAC assessment show that adherence to the provisions of this part have not been achieved or maintained, these DCMA DIBCAC results will take precedence over any pre-existing CMMC Status. At that time, standard contractual remedies will be available and the OSC will be ineligible for additional awards with CMMC Status requirement of Level 3 (DIBCAC) for the information system within the CMMC Assessment Scope until such time as a new CMMC Status is achieved.
(2)
Affirmation.
Affirmation of the Level 3 (DIBCAC) CMMC Status is required for all Level 3 certification assessments at the time of each assessment, and annually thereafter. Affirmation procedures are provided in § 170.22.
(b)

(2) The OSC must submit an affirmation of compliance into SPRS, as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(c)
Procedures
—(1)
Level 3 certification assessment of the OSC.
The CMMC Level 3 certification assessment process includes:
(i)
Final Level 2 (C3PAO).
The OSC must achieve a CMMC Status of Final Level 2 (C3PAO) for information systems within the Level 3 CMMC Assessment Scope prior to the CMMC Level 3 certification assessment. The CMMC Assessment Scope for the Level 3 certification assessment must be equal to, or a subset of, the CMMC Assessment Scope associated with the OSC's Final Level 2 (C3PAO). Asset requirements differ for each CMMC Level. Scoping differences are set forth in § 170.19.
(ii)
Initiating the Final Level 3 (DIBCAC).
The OSC (including ESPs that voluntarily elect to undergo a Level 3 certification assessment) initiates a Level 3 certification assessment by emailing a request to DCMA DIBCAC point of contact found at
www.dcma.mil/DIBCAC
. The request must include the Level 2 certification assessment unique identifier. DCMA DIBCAC will validate the OSC has achieved a CMMC Status of Level 2 (C3PAO) and will contact the OSC to schedule their Level 3 certification assessment.
(iii)
Conducting the Final Level 3 (DIBCAC).
DCMA DIBCAC will perform a Level 3 certification assessment in accordance with NIST SP 800-171A Jun2018 (incorporated by reference, see § 170.2) and NIST SP 800-172A Mar2022 (incorporated by reference, see § 170.2) and the CMMC Level 3 scoping requirements set forth in § 170.19(d) for the information systems within the CMMC Assessment Scope. The Level 3 certification assessment will be scored in accordance with the CMMC Scoring Methodology set forth in § 170.24 and DCMA DIBCAC will upload the results into the CMMC instantiation of eMASS. Final results are communicated to the OSC through a CMMC Assessment Findings Report. For assets that changed asset category (
i.e.,
CRMA to CUI Asset) or assessment requirements (
i.e.,
Specialized Assets) between the Level 2 and Level 3 certification assessments, DCMA DIBCAC will perform limited checks of Level 2 security requirements. If the OSC had these upgraded asset categories included in their Level 2 certification assessment, then DCMA DIBCAC may still perform limited checks for compliance. If DCMA DIBCAC identifies that a Level 2 security requirement is NOT MET, the Level 3 assessment process may be paused to allow for remediation, placed on hold, or immediately terminated.
(2)
Security requirement re-evaluation.
A security requirement that is NOT MET (as defined in § 170.24) may be re-evaluated during the course of the Level 3 certification assessment and for 10 business days following the active assessment period if all of the following conditions exist:
(i) Additional evidence is available to demonstrate the security requirement has been MET;
(ii) The additional evidence does not materially impact previously assessed security requirements; and
(iii) The CMMC Assessment Findings Report has not been delivered.
(3)
POA
M.
If a POA
M exists, a POA
M closeout certification assessment will be performed by DCMA DIBCAC within 180-days of the Conditional CMMC Status Date. Additional guidance is located in § 170.21 and in the guidance document listed in paragraph (d) of appendix A to this part.
(4)
Artifact retention and integrity.
The hashed artifacts used as evidence for the assessment must be retained by the OSC for six (6) years from the CMMC Status Date. The hashed artifacts used as evidence for the assessment must be retained by the OSC for six (6) years from the CMMC Status Date. To ensure that the artifacts have not been altered, the OSC must hash the artifact files using a NIST-approved hashing algorithm. Assessors will collect the list of the artifact names, the return value of the hashing algorithm, and the hashing algorithm used and upload that data into the CMMC instantiation of eMASS. Additional guidance for hashing artifacts can be found in the guidance document listed in paragraph (h) of appendix A to this part.
(5)
Level 3 certification assessment with the use of Cloud Service Provider (CSP).
An OSC may use a cloud environment to process, store, or transmit CUI in performance of a contract or subcontract with a requirement for the CMMC Status of Level 3 (DIBCAC) under the following circumstances:
(i) The OSC may utilize a CSP product or service offering that meets the
FedRAMP Moderate (or higher) baseline. If the CSP's product or service offering is not FedRAMP Authorized at the FedRAMP Moderate (or higher) baseline, the product or service offering must meet security requirements equivalent to those established by the FedRAMP Moderate (or higher) baseline in accordance with DoD Policy.
(ii) Use of a CSP does not relieve an OSC of its obligation to implement the 24 Level 3 security requirements. These 24 requirements apply to every environment where the CUI data is processed, stored, or transmitted, when Level 3 (DIBCAC) is the designated CMMC Status. If any of these 24 requirements are inherited from a CSP, the OSC must demonstrate that protection during a Level 3 certification assessment via a Customer Implementation Summary/Customer Responsibility Matrix (CIS/CRM) and associated Body of Evidence (BOE). The BOE must clearly indicate whether the OSC or the CSP is responsible for meeting each requirement and which requirements are implemented by the OSC versus inherited from the CSP.
(iii) In accordance with § 170.19(d)(2), the OSC's on-premises infrastructure connecting to the CSP's product or service offering is part of the CMMC Assessment Scope. As such, the security requirements from the CRM must be documented or referred to in the OSC's SSP.
(6)
Level 3 certification assessment with the use of an ESP, not a CSP.
An OSC may use an ESP that is not a CSP to process, store, or transmit CUI in performance of a contract or subcontract with a requirement for the CMMC Status of Level 3 (DIBCAC) under the following circumstances:
(i) The use of the ESP, its relationship to the OSC, and the services provided are documented in the OSC's SSP and described in the ESP's service description and customer responsibility matrix.
(ii) The ESP services used to meet OSC requirements are assessed within the scope of the OSC's assessment against all Level 2 and Level 3 security requirements.
(iii) In accordance with § 170.19(d)(2), the OSC's on-premises infrastructure connecting to the ESP's product or service offering is part of the CMMC Assessment Scope, which will also be assessed. As such, the security requirements from the CRM must be documented or referred to in the OSC's SSP.
§ 170.19
CMMC scoping.
(a)
Scoping requirement.
(1) The CMMC Assessment Scope must be specified prior to assessment in accordance with the requirements of this section. The CMMC Assessment Scope is the set of all assets in the OSA's environment that will be assessed against CMMC security requirements.
(2) The requirements for defining the CMMC Assessment Scope for CMMC Levels 1, 2, and 3 are set forth in this section. Additional guidance regarding scoping can be found in the guidance documents listed in paragraphs (e) through (g) of appendix A to this part.
(b)
CMMC Level 1 scoping.
Prior to performing a Level 1 self-assessment, the OSA must specify the CMMC Assessment Scope.
(1)
Assets in scope for Level 1 self-assessment.
OSA information systems which process, store, or transmit FCI are in scope for CMMC Level 1 and must be self-assessed against applicable CMMC security requirements.
(2)
Assets not in scope for Level 1 self-assessment
—(i)
Out-of-Scope Assets.
OSA information systems which do not process, store, or transmit FCI are outside the scope for CMMC Level 1. An endpoint hosting a VDI client configured to not allow any processing, storage, or transmission of FCI beyond the Keyboard/Video/Mouse sent to the VDI client is considered out-of-scope. There are no documentation requirements for out-of-scope assets.
(ii)
Specialized Assets.
Specialized Assets are those assets that can process, store, or transmit FCI but are unable to be fully secured, including: Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, Operational Technology (OT), Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), Restricted Information Systems, and Test Equipment. Specialized Assets are not part of the Level 1 CMMC Assessment Scope and are not assessed against CMMC security requirements.
(3)
Level 1 self-assessment scoping considerations.
To scope a Level 1 self-assessment, OSAs should consider the people, technology, facilities, and External Service Providers (ESP) within its environment that process, store, or transmit FCI.
(c)
CMMC Level 2 Scoping.
Prior to performing a Level 2 self-assessment or Level 2 certification assessment, the OSA must specify the CMMC Assessment Scope.
(1) The CMMC Assessment Scope for CMMC Level 2 is based on the specification of asset categories and their respective requirements as defined in table 3 to this paragraph (c)(1). Additional information is available in the guidance document listed in paragraph (f) of appendix A to this part.

(2)(i) Table 6 to this paragraph (d)(2)(i) defines the requirements to be met when utilizing an External Service Provider (ESP). The OSA must consider whether the ESP is a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and whether the ESP processes, stores, or transmits CUI and/or Security Protection Data (SPD).
Table 6 to § 170.19
(d)(2)(i)
—ESP Scoping Requirements
When the ESP processes, stores, or transmits:
When utilizing an ESP that is:
A CSP
Not a CSP
CUI (with or without SPD)
The CSP shall meet the FedRAMP requirements in 48 CFR 252.204-7012
The services provided by the ESP are in the OSA's assessment scope and shall be assessed as part of the OSA's assessment.
SPD (without CUI)
The services provided by the CSP are in the OSA's assessment scope and shall be assessed as Security Protection Assets
The services provided by the ESP are in the OSA's assessment scope and shall be assessed as Security Protection Assets.
Neither CUI nor SPD
A service provider that does not process CUI or SPD does not meet the CMMC definition of an ESP
A service provider that does not process CUI or SPD does not meet the CMMC definition of an ESP.
(ii) The use of an ESP, its relationship to the OSC, and the services provided need to be documented in the OSC's SSP and described in the ESP's service description and customer responsibility matrix (CRM), which describes the responsibilities of the OSC and ESP with respect to the services provided. Note that the ESP may voluntarily undergo a CMMC certification assessment to reduce the ESP's effort required during the OSA's assessment. The minimum. The minimum assessment type for the ESP is dictated by the OSC's DoD contract requirement.
(e)
Relationship between Level 2 and Level 3 CMMC Assessment Scope.
The Level 3 CMMC Assessment Scope must be equal to or a subset of the Level 2 CMMC Assessment Scope in accordance with § 170.18(a) (
e.g.,
a Level 3 data enclave with greater restrictions and protections within a Level 2 data enclave). Any Level 2 POA
M items must be closed prior to the initiation of the Level 3 certification assessment.
DCMA DIBCAC may check any Level 2 security requirement of any in-scope asset. If DCMA DIBCAC identifies that a Level 2 security requirement is NOT MET, the Level 3 assessment process may be paused to allow for remediation, placed on hold, or immediately terminated. For further information regarding scoping of CMMC Level 3 assessments please contact DCMA DIBCAC at

§ 170.20
Standards acceptance.
(a)
NIST SP 800-171 R2 DoD assessments.
In order to avoid duplication of efforts, thereby reducing the aggregate cost to industry and the Department, OSCs that have completed a DCMA DIBCAC High Assessment aligned with CMMC Level 2 Scoping will be given the CMMC Status of Final Level 2 (C3PAO) under the following conditions:
(1)
DCMA DIBCAC High Assessment.
An OSC that achieved a perfect score with no open POA
M from a DCMA DIBCAC High Assessment conducted prior to the effective date of this rule, will be given a CMMC Status of Level 2 Final (C3PAO) with a validity period of three (3) years from the date of the original DCMA DIBCAC High Assessment. DCMA DIBCAC will identify assessments that meet these criteria and verify that SPRS accurately reflects the CMMC Status. Eligible DCMA DIBCAC High Assessments include ones conducted with Joint Surveillance in accordance with the DCMA Manual 2302-01 Surveillance. The scope of the Level 2 certification assessment is identical to the scope of the DCMA DIBCAC High Assessment. In accordance with § 170.17(a)(2), the OSC must also submit an affirmation in SPRS and annually thereafter to achieve contractual eligibility.
(2) [Reserved].
(b) [Reserved].
§ 170.21
Plan of Action and Milestones requirements.
(a)
POA
M.
For purposes of achieving a Conditional CMMC Status, an OSA is only permitted to have a POA

(b)
POA
M closeout assessment.
A POA
M closeout assessment is a CMMC assessment that assesses only the NOT MET requirements that were identified with POA
M in the initial assessment. The closing of a POA
M must be confirmed by a POA
M closeout assessment within 180-days of the Conditional CMMC Status Date. If the POA
M is not successfully closed out within the 180-day timeframe, the Conditional CMMC Status for the information system will expire.
(1)
Level 2 self-assessment.
For a Level 2 self-assessment, the POA
M closeout self-assessment shall be performed by the OSA in the same manner as the initial self-assessment.
(2)
Level 2 certification assessment.
For Level 2 certification assessment, the POA
M closeout certification assessment must be performed by an authorized or accredited C3PAO.
(3)
Level 3 certification assessment.
For Level 3 certification assessment, DCMA DIBCAC will perform the POA
M closeout certification assessment.
§ 170.22
Affirmation.
(a)
General.
The OSA must affirm continuing compliance with the appropriate level self-assessment or certification assessment. An Affirming Official from each OSA, whether a prime or subcontractor, must affirm the continuing compliance of their respective organizations with the specified security requirement after every assessment, including POA
M closeout, and annually thereafter. Affirmations are entered electronically in SPRS. The affirmation shall be submitted in accordance with the following requirements:
(1)
Affirming Official.
The Affirming Official is the senior level representative from within each Organization Seeking Assessment (OSA) who is responsible for ensuring the OSA's compliance with the CMMC Program requirements and has the authority to affirm the OSA's continuing compliance with the specified security requirements for their respective organizations.
(2)
Affirmation content.
Each CMMC affirmation shall include the following information:
(i) Name, title, and contact information for the Affirming Official; and
(ii) Affirmation statement attesting that the OSA has implemented and will maintain implementation of all applicable CMMC security requirements to their CMMC Status for all information systems within the relevant CMMC Assessment Scope.
(3)
Affirmation submission.
The Affirming Official shall submit a CMMC affirmation in the following instances:
(i) Upon achievement of a Conditional CMMC Status, as applicable;
(ii) Upon achievement of a Final CMMC Status;
(iii) Annually following a Final CMMC Status Date; and
(iv) Following a POA
M closeout assessment, as applicable.
(b)
Submission procedures.
All affirmations shall be completed in SPRS. The Department will verify submission of the affirmation in SPRS to ensure compliance with CMMC solicitation or contract requirements.
(1)
Level 1 self-assessment.
At the completion of a Level 1 self-assessment and annually thereafter, the Affirming Official shall submit a CMMC affirmation attesting to continuing compliance with all requirements of the CMMC Status Level 1 (Self).
(2)
Level 2 self-assessment.
At the completion of a Level 2 self-assessment and annually following a Final CMMC Status Date, the Affirming Official shall submit a CMMC affirmation attesting to continuing compliance with all requirements of the CMMC Status Level 2 (Self). An affirmation shall also be submitted at the completion of a POA
M closeout self-assessment.
(3)
Level 2 certification assessment.
At the completion of a Level 2 certification assessment and annually following a Final CMMC Status Date, the Affirming Official shall submit a CMMC affirmation attesting to continuing compliance with all requirements of the CMMC Status Level 2 (C3PAO). An affirmation shall also be submitted at the completion of a POA
M closeout certification assessment.
(4)
Level 3 certification assessment.
At the completion of a Level 3 certification assessment and annually following a Final CMMC Status Date, the Affirming Official shall submit a CMMC affirmation attesting to continuing compliance with all requirements of the CMMC Status Level 3 (DIBCAC). Because C3PAOs and DCMA DIBCAC check for compliance with different requirements in their respective assessments, OSCs must annually affirm their CMMC Status of Level 2 (C3PAO) in addition to their CMMC Status of Level 3 (DIBCAC) to maintain eligibility for contracts requiring compliance with Level 3. An affirmation shall also be submitted at the completion of a POA
M closeout certification assessment.
§ 170.23
Application to subcontractors.
(a) CMMC requirements apply to prime contractors and subcontractors throughout the supply chain at all tiers that will process, store, or transmit any FCI or CUI on contractor information systems in the performance of the DoD contract or subcontract. Prime contractors shall comply and shall require subcontractors to comply with and to flow down CMMC requirements, such that compliance will be required throughout the supply chain at all tiers with the applicable CMMC level and assessment type for each subcontract as follows:
(1) If a subcontractor will only process, store, or transmit FCI (and not CUI) in performance of the subcontract, then a CMMC Status of Level 1 (Self) is required for the subcontractor.
(2) If a subcontractor will process, store, or transmit CUI in performance of the subcontract, then a CMMC Status of Level 2 (Self) is the minimum requirement for the subcontractor.
(3) If a subcontractor will process, store, or transmit CUI in performance of the subcontract and the associated prime contract has a requirement for a CMMC Status of Level 2 (C3PAO), then the CMMC Status of Level 2 (C3PAO) is the minimum requirement for the subcontractor.
(4) If a subcontractor will process, store, or transmit CUI in performance of the subcontract and the associated prime contract has a requirement for the CMMC Status of Level 3 (DIBCAC), then the CMMC Status of Level 2 (C3PAO) is the minimum requirement for the subcontractor.
(b) As with any solicitation or contract, the DoD may provide specific guidance pertaining to flow-down.
§ 170.24
CMMC Scoring Methodology.
(a)
General.
This scoring methodology is designed to provide a measurement of an OSA's implementation status of the NIST SP 800-171 R2 security requirements (incorporated by reference elsewhere in this part, see § 170.2) and the selected NIST SP 800-172 Feb2021 security requirements (incorporated by reference elsewhere in this part, see § 170.2). The CMMC Scoring Methodology is designed to credit partial implementation only in limited cases (
e.g.,
multi-factor authentication IA.L2-3.5.3).
(b)
Assessment findings.
Each security requirement assessed under the CMMC Scoring Methodology must result in one of three possible assessment findings, as follows:
(1)
Met.
All applicable objectives for the security requirement are satisfied based on evidence. All evidence must be in final form and not draft. Unacceptable forms of evidence include but are not limited to working papers, drafts, and unofficial or unapproved policies.
(i) Enduring exceptions when described, along with any mitigations, in the system security plan shall be assessed as MET.
(ii) Temporary deficiencies that are appropriately addressed in operational plans of action (
i.e.,
include deficiency reviews and show progress towards the implementation of corrections to reduce or eliminate identified vulnerabilities) shall be assessed as MET.
(2)
Not Met.
One or more applicable objectives for the security requirement is not satisfied. During an assessment, for each security requirement objective marked NOT MET, the assessor will document why the evidence does not conform.
(3)
Not Applicable (N/A).
A security requirement and/or objective does not
apply at the time of the CMMC assessment. For example, Public-Access System Separation (SC.L2-3.13.5) might be N/A if there are no publicly accessible systems within the CMMC Assessment Scope. During an assessment, an assessment objective assessed as N/A is equivalent to the same assessment objective being assessed as MET.
(c)
Scoring.
At each CMMC Level, security requirements are scored as follows:
(1)
CMMC Level 1.
All CMMC Level 1 security requirements must be fully implemented to be considered MET. No POA
M is permitted for CMMC Level 1, and self-assessment results are scored as MET or NOT MET in their entirety.
(2)
CMMC Level 2 Scoring Methodology.
The maximum score achievable for a Level 2 self-assessment or Level 2 certification assessment is equal to the total number of CMMC Level 2 security requirements. If all CMMC Level 2 security requirements are MET, OSAs are awarded the maximum score. For each requirement NOT MET, the associated value of the security requirement is subtracted from the maximum score, which may result in a negative score.
(i)
Procedures.
(A) Scoring methodology for Level 2 self-assessment and Level 2 certification assessment is based on all CMMC Level 2 security requirement objectives, including those NOT MET.
(B) In the CMMC Level 2 Scoring Methodology, each security requirement has a value (
e.g.,
1, 3 or 5), which is related to the designation by NIST as basic or derived security requirements. Per NIST SP 800-171 R2, the basic security requirements are obtained from FIPS PUB 200 Mar2006, which provides the high-level and fundamental security requirements for Federal information and systems. The derived security requirements, which supplement the basic security requirements, are taken from the security controls in NIST SP 800-53 R5.
(
1
) For NIST SP 800-171 R2 basic and derived security requirements that, if not implemented, could lead to significant exploitation of the network, or exfiltration of CUI, five (5) points are subtracted from the maximum score. The basic and derived security requirements with a value of five (5) points include:
(
i
)
Basic security requirements.
AC.L2-3.1.1, AC.L2-3.1.2, AT.L2-3.2.1, AT.L2-3.2.2, AU.L2-3.3.1, CM.L2-3.4.1, CM.L2-3.4.2, IA-L2-3.5.1, IA-L2-3.5.2, IR.L2-3.6.1, IR.L2-3.6.2, MA.L2-3.7.2, MP.L2-3.8.3, PS.L2-3.9.2, PE.L2-3.10.1, PE.L2-3.10.2, CA.L2-3.12.1, CA.L2-3.12.3, SC.L2-3.13.1, SC.L2-3.13.2, SI.L2-3.14.1, SI.L2-3.14.2, and SI.L2-3.14.3.
(
ii
)
Derived security requirements.
AC.L2-3.1.12, AC.L2-3.1.13, AC.L2-3.1.16, AC.L2-3.1.17, AC.L2-3.1.18, AU.L2-3.3.5, CM.L2-3.4.5, CM.L2-3.4.6, CM.L2-3.4.7, CM.L2-3.4.8, IA.L2-3.5.10, MA.L2-3.7.5, MP.L2-3.8.7, RA.L2-3.11.2, SC.L2-3.13.5, SC.L2-3.13.6, SC.L2-3.13.15, SI.L2-3.14.4, and SI.L2-3.14.6.
(
2
) For basic and derived security requirements that, if not implemented, have a specific and confined effect on the security of the network and its data, three (3) points are subtracted from the maximum score. The basic and derived security requirements with a value of three (3) points include:
(
i
)
Basic security requirements.
AU.L2-3.3.2, MA.L2-3.7.1, MP.L2-3.8.1, MP.L2-3.8.2, PS.L2-3.9.1, RA.L2-3.11.1, and CA.L2-3.12.2.
(
ii
)
Derived security requirements.
AC.L2-3.1.5, AC.L2- 3.1.19, MA.L2-3.7.4, MP.L2-3.8.8, SC.L2-3.13.8, SI.L2-3.14.5, and SI.L2-3.14.7.
(
3
) All remaining derived security requirements, other than the exceptions noted, if not implemented, have a limited or indirect effect on the security of the network and its data. For these, 1 point is subtracted from the maximum score.
(
4
) Two derived security requirements, IA.L2-3.5.3 and SC.L2-3.13.11, can be partially effective even if not completely or properly implemented, and the points deducted may be adjusted depending on how the security requirement is implemented.
(
i
) Multi-factor authentication (MFA) (CMMC Level 2 security requirement IA.L2-3.5.3) is typically implemented first for remote and privileged users (since these users are both limited in number and more critical) and then for the general user, so three (3) points are subtracted from the maximum score if MFA is implemented
only for remote and privileged users. Five (5) points are subtracted from the maximum score if MFA is not implemented for any users.
(
ii
) FIPS-validated encryption (CMMC Level 2 security requirement SC.L2-3.13.11) is required to protect the confidentiality of CUI. If encryption is employed, but is not FIPS-validated, three (3) points are subtracted from the maximum score; if encryption is not employed; five (5) points are subtracted from the maximum score.
(
5
) OSAs must have a System Security Plan (SSP) (CMMC security requirement CA.L2-3.12.4) in place at the time of assessment to describe each information system within the CMMC Assessment Scope. The absence of an up to date SSP at the time of the assessment would result in a finding that '
an assessment could not be completed due to incomplete information and noncompliance with 48 CFR 252.204-7012.
'
(
6
) For each NOT MET security requirement the OSA must have a POA
M in place. A POA
M addressing NOT MET security requirements is not a substitute for a completed requirement. Security requirements not implemented, whether described in a POA
M or not, is assessed as 'NOT MET.'
(
7
) Specialized Assets must be evaluated for their asset category per the CMMC scoping guidance for the level in question and handled accordingly as set forth in § 170.19.
(
8
) If an OSC previously received a favorable adjudication from the DoD CIO indicating that a security requirement is not applicable or that an alternative security measure is equally effective (in accordance with 48 CFR 252.204-7008 or 48 CFR 252.204-7012), the DoD CIO adjudication must be included in the system security plan to receive consideration during an assessment. A security requirement for which implemented security measures have been adjudicated by the DoD CIO as equally effective is assessed as MET if there have been no changes in the environment.
(ii)
CMMC Level 2 Scoring Table.
CMMC Level 2 scoring has been assigned based on the methodology set forth in table 1 to this paragraph (c)(2)(ii).

(3)
CMMC Level 3 assessment scoring methodology.
CMMC Level 3 scoring does not utilize varying values like the scoring for CMMC Level 2. All CMMC Level 3 security requirements use a value of one (1) point for each security requirement. As a result, the maximum score achievable for a Level 3 certification assessment is equivalent to the total number of the selected subset of NIST SP 800-172 Feb2021 security requirements for CMMC Level 3, see § 170.14(c)(4). The maximum score is reduced by one (1) point for each security requirement NOT MET. The CMMC Level 3 scoring methodology reflects the fact that all CMMC Level 2 security requirements must already be MET (for the Level 3 CMMC Assessment Scope). A maximum score on the Level 2 certification assessment is required to be eligible to initiate a Level 3 certification assessment. The Level 3 certification assessment score is equal to the number of CMMC Level 3 security requirements that are assessed as MET.

Profit reduction clause.
Appendix to Part 173—List of Contractors for Whom Certification is Required

# Authority:
10 U.S.C. 2202.

# Source:
53 FR 42948, Oct. 25, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 173.1
Scope.
(a) The purpose of the Competitive Information Certificate is to provide the Contracting Officer sufficient information and assurance to support award of a contract in those circumstances where certification is required.
(b) Although a Competitive Information Certificate provides reasonable assurance to the Government, the possibility remains that even a diligent internal review by the contractor may fail to identify illegal or improper actions. The purpose of the Profit Reduction Clause is to ensure effective protection of the Government's interest in making contract awards when a Competitive Information Certification is required. The Profit Reduction Clause is required in all competitively awarded new contracts over $100,000 when a Competitive Information Certificate is required prior to award.
§ 173.2
Competitive Information Certification.
(a) The Competitive Information Certificate is required prior to award of all competitively awarded new contracts of a value exceeding $100,000 to contractors subject to the requirement.
(1) Corporate activities required to provide the Certificate are corporations or corporate divisions which have been the subject of search warrants, or as to which other official information indicates such certification should be required, and their subsidiaries and affiliates. A list of contractors from whom certification is required is maintained and published as required under authority of the Department of Defense Procurement Task Force.
(2) The requirement to provide the Certificate may be further limited to certain divisions or subsidiaries, contracts or programs upon the basis of official information, furnished by the contractor or otherwise, sufficient to establish to the satisfaction of the Department of Defense that the investigation is so limited. Such information may include copies of search warrants, subpoenas and affidavits from corporate officials concerning the scope and conduct of the investigation. The sufficiency of such information is solely within the discretion of the Department of Defense.
(3) Contractors from whom certification in certain instances is required will be relieved of the certification requirement when the Department of Defense determines that information developed in the “Ill Wind” investigation has been resolved in such a manner that certification is no longer required to protect the interests of the Government.
(4) A Certificate will not be required prior to the exercise of options or noncompetitive award of contracts. This does not limit in any manner the Government's ability to inquire into, or require information concerning, the circumstances surrounding an underlying competitive award.
(b) With respect to information disclosed under paragraph (1) of the Certificate, the offeror must attach to the Certificate a written statement detailing what information was obtained, and how, when, and from whom it was
obtained. This information shall be evaluated at the levels prescribed by the contracting component to determine whether award of the contract should be made to the offeror. If during this review it is determined that the offeror may have obtained an unfair competitive advantage from the information and that there is no other reason for denying award to the offeror, the reviewing authority shall consider whether action may be taken to neutralize the potential unfair competitive advantage. Any decision to deny award to an offeror based upon information disclosed in the Certificate shall be reviewed and approved by the Service Acquisition Executive.
(c) This certificate and any accompanying statements required, must be executed by the offeror's corporate president or his designee at no more than one level below the president's level.
(d) If a contractor from whom certification is required is uncertain as to whether competitive information otherwise required to be disclosed was generally available to offerors, the uncertainty should be resolved by disclosure.
(e) Contracting Officers may continue to accept Certificates of Business Ethics and Integrity complying with the Interim rule in lieu of Competitive Information Certificates.
(f) The Competitive Information Certificate shall be in the following form:

# Competitive Information Certificate
(1) (Name of the offeror) certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that
(i) With the exception of any information described in an attachment to this certificate, and any information the offeror reasonably believes was made generally available to prospective offerors, the offeror has not knowingly obtained, directly or indirectly from the Government, any written information or oral extract or account thereof relating to this solicitation which was
(A) Submitted to the Government by offerors or potential offerors in response to the Government's solicitation for bid or proposal;
(B) Marked by an offeror or potential offeror to indicate the information was submitted to the Government subject to an assertion of privilege against disclosure;
(C) Marked or otherwise identified by the Government pursuant to law or regulation as classified, source selection sensitive, or for official use only; or
(D) The disclosure of which to the offeror or potential offeror by a Government employee would, under the circumstances, otherwise violate law or regulation.
(ii) The offeror named above
(A) Determined the prices in its offer independently, without, for the purpose of restricting competition, any consultation, communications, or agreement, directly or indirectly, with any other offeror or competitor relating to (
1
) those prices, (
2
) the intention to submit an offer, or (
3
), the methods or factors used to calculate the prices offered;
(B) Has not knowingly disclosed the prices in its offer, directly or indirectly, to any other offeror or competitor before bid opening (in the case of a sealed bid solicitation) or contract award (in the case of a negotiated solicitation) unless otherwise required by law;
(C) Has not attempted to induce any other concern to submit or not to submit an offer for the purpose of restricting competition.
(iii) The offeror has attached an accurate description of the internal review forming the basis for the certifications provided herein.
Corporate President or Designee.
§ 173.3
Profit reduction clause.
The following profit reduction clause is required in all competitively awarded new contracts over $100,000 when a Competitive Information Certificate is required prior to award.
Profit Reduction for Illegal or Improper Activity
(a) The government, at its election, may reduce the contract price by the amount of any anticipated profit determined as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section; if

# Subpart B—Policy
§ 174.4
Policy.
It is DoD policy to:
(a) Act expeditiously whether closing or realigning. Relocating activities from installations designated for closure will, when feasible, be accelerated to facilitate the transfer of real property for community reuse. In the case of realignments, the Department will pursue aggressive planning and scheduling of related facility improvements at the receiving location.
(b) Fully utilize all appropriate means to transfer property. Federal law provides the Department with an array of legal authorities, including public benefit transfers, economic development conveyances at cost and no cost, negotiated sales to state or local government, conservation conveyances, and public sales, by which to transfer property on closed or realigned installations. Recognizing that the variety of types of facilities available for civilian reuse and the unique circumstances of the surrounding communities does not lend itself to a single universal solution, the Department will use this array of authorities in a way that considers individual circumstances.
(c) Rely on and leverage market forces. Community redevelopment plans and military conveyance plans should be integrated to the extent practical and should take account of any anticipated demand for surplus military land and facilities.
(d) Collaborate effectively. Experience suggests that collaboration is the linchpin to successful installation redevelopment. Only by collaborating with the local community can the Department close and transfer property in a timely manner and provide a foundation for solid economic redevelopment.
(e) Speak with one voice. The Department of Defense, acting through the DoD Components, will provide clear and timely information and will encourage affected communities to do the same.
(f) Work with communities to address growth. The Department will work with the surrounding community so that the public and private sectors can provide the services and facilities needed to accommodate new personnel and their families. The Department recognizes that installation commanders and local officials, as appropriate (
e.g.
, State, county, and tribal), need to integrate and coordinate elements of their
local and regional growth planning so that appropriate off-base facilities and services are available for arriving personnel and their families.
§ 174.5
Responsibilities.
(a) The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics shall issue DoD Instructions as necessary to further implement applicable public laws affecting installation closure and realignment implementation and shall monitor compliance with this part. All authorities and responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense—
(1) Vested in the Secretary of Defense by a base closure law, but excluding those provisions relating to the process for selecting installations for closure or realignment;
(2) Delegated from the Administrator of General Services relating to base closure and realignment matters;
(3) Vested in the Secretary of Defense by any other provision relating to base closure and realignment in a national defense authorization act, a Department of Defense appropriations act, or a military construction appropriations act, but excluding section 330 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993; or
(4) Vested in the Secretary of Defense by Executive Order or regulation and relating to base closure and realignment, are hereby delegated to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.
(b) The authorities and responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense delegated to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics under paragraph (a) of this section are hereby re-delegated to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment).
(c) The Heads of the DoD Components shall ensure compliance with this part and any implementing guidance.
(d) Subject to the delegations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretaries concerned shall exercise those authorities and responsibilities specified in subparts C through G of this part.
(e) The cost of recording deeds and other transfer documents is the responsibility of the transferee.

# Subpart C—Working with Communities and States
§ 174.6
LRA and the redevelopment plan.
(a) The LRA should have broad-based membership, including, but not limited to, representatives from those jurisdictions with zoning authority over the property. Generally, there will be one recognized LRA per installation.
(b) The LRA should focus primarily on developing a comprehensive redevelopment plan based upon local needs. The plan should recommend land uses based upon an exploration of feasible reuse alternatives. If applicable, the plan should consider notices of interest received under a base closure law. This section shall not be construed to require a plan that is enforceable under state and local land use laws, nor is it intended to create any exemption from such laws.
(c)(1) The Secretary concerned will develop a disposal plan and, to the extent practicable, complete the appropriate environmental documentation no later than 12 months after receipt of the redevelopment plan. The redevelopment plan will be used as part of the proposed Federal action in conducting environmental analyses required under NEPA.
(2) In the event there is no LRA recognized by DoD or if a redevelopment plan is not received from the LRA within 9 months from the date referred to in section 2905(b)(7)(F)(iv) of Pub. L. 101-510, (unless an extension of time has been granted by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment)), the Secretary concerned shall, after required consultation with the governor and heads of local governments, proceed with the disposal of property under applicable property disposal and environmental laws and regulations.

# Subpart D—Real Property
§ 174.7
Retention for DoD Component use and transfer to other Federal agencies.
(a) To speed the economic recovery of communities affected by closures and
realignments, the Department of Defense will identify DoD and Federal interests in real property at closing and realigning installations as quickly as possible. The Secretary concerned shall identify such interests. The Secretary concerned will keep the LRA informed of these interests. This section establishes a uniform process, with specified timelines, for identifying real property that is available for use by DoD Components (which for purposes of this section includes the United States Coast Guard) or is excess to the needs of the Department of Defense and available for use by other Federal agencies, and for the disposal of surplus property for various purposes.
(b) The Secretary concerned should consider LRA input, if provided, in making determinations on the retention of property (location and size of cantonment area).
(c) Within one week of the date of approval of the closure or realignment, the Secretary concerned shall issue a notice of availability to the DoD Components and other Federal agencies covering closing and realigning installation buildings and property available for transfer to the DoD Components and other Federal agencies. The notice of availability should describe the property and buildings available for transfer. Withdrawn public domain lands which the Secretary of the Interior has determined are suitable for return to the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior (DoI) will not be included in the notice of availability.
(d) To obtain consideration of a requirement for such available buildings and property, a DoD Component or Federal agency is required to provide a written, firm expression of interest for buildings and property within 30 days of the date of the notice of availability. An expression of interest must explain the intended use and the corresponding requirement for the buildings and property.
(e)(1) Within 60 days of the date of the notice of availability, the DoD Component or Federal agency expressing interest in buildings or property must submit an application for transfer of such property to a Military Department or Federal agency. In the case of a DoD Component that would normally, under the circumstances, obtain its real property needs from the Military Department disposing of the real property, the application should indicate the property would not transfer to another Military Department but should be retained by the current Military Department for the use of the DoD Component. To the extent a different Military Department provides real property support for the requesting DoD Component, the application must indicate the concurrence of the supporting Military Department.
(2) Within 90 days of the notice of availability, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should survey the air traffic control and air navigation equipment at the installation to determine what is needed to support the air traffic control, surveillance, and communications functions supported by the Military Department, and to identify the facilities needed to support the National Airspace System. FAA requests for property to manage the National Airspace System will not be governed by paragraph (h) of this section. Instead, the FAA shall work directly with the Military Department to prepare an agreement to assume custody of the property necessary for control of the airspace being relinquished by the Military Department.
(f) The Secretary concerned will keep the LRA informed of the progress in identifying interests. At the same time, the LRA is encouraged to contact Federal agencies which sponsor public benefit conveyances for information and technical assistance. The Secretary concerned will provide to the LRA points of contact at the Federal agencies.
(g) DoD Components and Federal agencies are encouraged to discuss their plans and needs with the LRA, if an LRA exists. If an LRA does not exist, the consultation should be pursued with the governor or the heads of the local governments in whose jurisdiction the property is located. DoD Components and Federal agencies are encouraged to notify the Secretary concerned of the results of this consultation. The Secretary concerned, the Transition Coordinator, and the DoD Office of Economic Adjustment Project Manager are available to help
facilitate communication between the DoD Components and Federal agencies, and the LRA, governor, and heads of local governments.
(h) An application for property from a DoD Component or Federal agency must contain the following information:
(1) A completed GSA Form 1334,
Request for Transfer
(for requests from DoD Components, a DD Form 1354 will be used). This must be signed by the head of the Component or agency requesting the property. If the authority to acquire property has been delegated, a copy of the delegation must accompany the form;
(2) A statement from the head of the requesting Component or agency that the request does not establish a new program (
i.e.
, one that has never been reflected in a previous budget submission or Congressional action);
(3) A statement that the requesting Component or agency has reviewed its real property holdings and cannot satisfy its requirement with existing property. This review must include all property under the requester's accountability, including permits to other Federal agencies and outleases to other organizations;
(4) A statement that the requested property would provide greater long-term economic benefits for the program than acquisition of a new facility or other property;
(5) A statement that the program for which the property is requested has long-term viability;
(6) A statement that considerations of design, layout, geographic location, age, state of repair, and expected maintenance costs of the requested property clearly demonstrate that the transfer will prove more economical over a sustained period of time than acquiring a new facility;
(7) A statement that the size of the property requested is consistent with the actual requirement;
(8) A statement that fair market value reimbursement to the Military Department will be made at the later of January of 2008, or at the time of transfer, unless this obligation is waived by the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary concerned, or a public law specifically provides for a non-reimbursable transfer (this requirement does not apply to requests from DoD Components);
(9) A statement that the requesting DoD Component or Federal agency agrees to accept the care and custody costs for the property on the date the property is available for transfer, as determined by the Secretary concerned; and
(10) A statement that the requesting agency agrees to accept transfer of the property in its existing condition, unless this obligation is waived by the Secretary concerned.
(i) The Secretary concerned will make a decision on an application from a DoD Component or Federal agency based upon the following factors:
(1) The requirement must be valid and appropriate;
(2) The proposed use is consistent with the highest and best use of the property;
(3) The proposed transfer will not have an adverse impact on the transfer of any remaining portion of the installation;
(4) The proposed transfer will not establish a new program or substantially increase the level of a Component's or agency's existing programs;
(5) The application offers fair market value for the property, unless waived;
(6) The proposed transfer addresses applicable environmental responsibilities to the satisfaction of the Secretary concerned; and
(7) The proposed transfer is in the best interest of the Government.
(j) When there is more than one acceptable application for the same building or property, the Secretary concerned shall consider, in the following order—
(1) The need to perform the national defense missions of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard;
(2) The need to support the homeland defense mission; and
(3) The LRA's comments as well as other factors in the determination of highest and best use.
(k) If the Federal agency does not meet its commitment under paragraph (h)(8) of this section to provide the required reimbursement, and the requested property has not yet been
transferred to the agency, the requested property will be declared surplus and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this part.
(l) Closing or realigning installations may contain “public domain lands” which have been withdrawn by the Secretary of the Interior from operation of the public land laws and reserved for use by the Department of Defense. Lands deemed suitable for return to the public domain are not real property governed by title 40, United States Code, and are not governed by the property management and disposal provisions of a base closure law. Public domain lands are under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior and administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) unless the Secretary of the Interior has withdrawn the lands and reserved them for another Federal agency's use.
(1) The Secretary concerned will provide the BLM with information about which, if any, public domain lands will be affected by the installation's closure or realignment.
(2) The BLM will review the information to determine if any installations contain withdrawn public domain lands. The BLM will review its land records to identify any withdrawn public domain lands at the closing installations. Any records discrepancies between the BLM and Military Departments should be resolved. The BLM will notify the Secretary concerned as to the final agreed upon withdrawn and reserved public domain lands at an installation.
(3) Upon agreement as to what withdrawn and reserved public domain lands are affected at closing installations, the BLM will initiate a screening of DoI agencies to determine if these lands are suitable for programs of the Secretary of the Interior.
(4) The Secretary concerned will transmit a Notice of Intent to Relinquish (see 43 CFR Part 2370) to the BLM as soon as it is known that there is no DoD Component interest in reusing the public domain lands. The BLM will complete the suitability determination screening process within 30 days of receipt of the Secretary's Notice of Intent to Relinquish. If a DoD Component is approved to reuse the public domain lands, the BLM will be notified and BLM will determine if the current authority for military use of these lands needs to be modified or amended.
(5) If BLM determines the land is suitable for return, it shall notify the Secretary concerned that the intent of the Secretary of the Interior is to accept the relinquishment of the land by the Secretary concerned.
(6) If BLM determines the land is not suitable for return to the DoI, the land should be disposed of pursuant to base closure law.
(m) The Secretary concerned should make a surplus determination within six (6) months of the date of approval of closure or realignment, and shall inform the LRA of the determination. If requested by the LRA, the Secretary may postpone the surplus determination for a period of no more than six (6) additional months after the date of approval if the Secretary determines that such postponement is in the best interests of the communities affected by the closure or realignment.
(1) In unusual circumstances, extensions beyond six months can be granted by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment).
(2) Extensions of the surplus determination should be limited to the portions of the installation where there is an outstanding interest, and every effort should be made to make decisions on as much of the installation as possible, within the specified timeframes.
(n) Once the surplus determination has been made, the Secretary concerned shall follow the procedures in part 176 of this title.
(o) Following the surplus determination, but prior to the disposal of property, the Secretary concerned may, at the Secretary's discretion, withdraw the surplus determination and evaluate a Federal agency's late request for excess property.
(1) Transfers under this paragraph shall be limited to special cases, as determined by the Secretary concerned.
(2) Requests shall be made to the Secretary concerned, as specified under paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section, and the Secretary shall notify the LRA of such late request.
(3) Comments received from the LRA and the time and effort invested by the LRA in the planning process should be considered when the Secretary concerned is reviewing a late request.
§ 174.8
Screening for properties covered by the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994, cross-reference.
The Departments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development have promulgated regulations to address state and local screening and approval of redevelopment plans for installations covered by the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-421). The Department of Defense regulations can be found at part 176 of this title. The Department of Housing and Urban Development regulations can be found at 24 CFR part 586.
§ 174.9
Economic development conveyances.
(a) The Secretary concerned may transfer real property and personal property to the LRA for purposes of job generation on the former installation. Such a transfer is an Economic Development Conveyance (EDC).
(b) An LRA is the only entity eligible to receive property under an EDC.
(c) The Secretary concerned shall use the completed application, along with other relevant information, to decide whether to enter into an EDC with an LRA. An LRA may submit an EDC application only after it adopts a redevelopment plan. The Secretary concerned shall establish a reasonable time period for submission of an EDC application after consultation with the LRA.
(d) The application shall include:
(1) A copy of the adopted redevelopment plan.
(2) A project narrative including the following:
(i) A general description of the property requested.
(ii) A description of the intended uses.
(iii) A description of the economic impact of closure or realignment on the local community.
(iv) A description of the economic condition of the community and the prospects for redevelopment of the property.
(v) A statement of how the EDC is consistent with the overall redevelopment plan.
(3) A description of how the EDC will contribute to short- and long-term job generation on the installation, including the projected number and type of new jobs it will assist in generating.
(4) A business/operational plan for development of the EDC parcel, including at least the following elements:
(i) A development timetable, phasing schedule, and cash flow analysis.
(ii) A market and financial feasibility analysis describing the economic viability of the project, including an estimate of net proceeds over the planned life of the redevelopment project, but in no event for less than fifteen years after the initial transfer of property, and the proposed consideration or payment to the Department of Defense. The proposed consideration should describe the methodology for payment and include draft documents or instruments proposed to secure such payment.
(iii) A cost estimate and justification for infrastructure and other investments needed for redevelopment of the EDC parcel.
(iv) A proposed local investment and financing plan for the development.
(5) A statement describing why an EDC will more effectively enable achievement of the job generation objectives of the redevelopment plan regarding the parcel requested for conveyance than other federal real property disposal authorities.
(6) Evidence of the LRA's legal authority to acquire and dispose of the property.
(7) Evidence that:
(i) The LRA has authority to perform the actions required of it, pursuant to the terms of the EDC, and
(ii) That the officers submitting the application and making the representations contained therein on behalf of the LRA have the authority to do so.
(8) A commitment from the LRA that the proceeds from any sale or lease of the EDC parcel (or any portion thereof) received by the LRA during at least the first seven years after the date of the initial transfer of property, except
proceeds that are used to pay consideration to the Secretary concerned under paragraph (h) of this section, shall be used to support economic redevelopment of, or related to, the installation. In the case of phased transfers, the Secretary concerned shall require that this commitment apply during at least the first seven years after the date of the last transfer of property to the LRA. For the purposes of calculating this reinvestment period, a lease in furtherance of conveyance shall constitute a transfer. The use of proceeds to pay for, or offset the costs of, public investment on or related to the installation for any of the following purposes shall be considered a use to support the economic redevelopment of, or related to, the installation—
(i) Road construction;
(ii) Transportation management facilities;
(iii) Storm and sanitary sewer construction;
(iv) Police and fire protection facilities and other public facilities;
(v) Utility construction;
(vi) Building rehabilitation;
(vii) Historic property preservation;
(viii) Pollution prevention equipment or facilities;
(vix) Demolition;
(x) Disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous waste generated by demolition;
(xi) Landscaping, grading, and other site or public improvements; and
(xii) Planning for or the marketing of the development and reuse of the installation.
(9) A commitment from the LRA to execute the agreement for transfer of the property and accept control of the property within a reasonable time, as determined by the Secretary concerned after consultation with the LRA, after the date of the property disposal record of decision. The determination of reasonable time should take account of the ability of the Secretary concerned to provide the deed covenants, or covenant deferral, provided for under section 120(h)(3) and (4) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)(3) and (4)).
(e) The Secretary concerned shall review the application and, to the extent practicable, provide a preliminary determination within 30 days of receipt as to whether the Military Department can accept the application for negotiation of terms and conditions, subject to the following findings:
(1) The LRA submitting the application has been duly recognized by the DoD Office of Economic Adjustment;
(2) The application is complete. With respect to the elements of the application specified in paragraph (d)(6) and (d)(7)(i) of this section, the Secretary concerned may accept the application for negotiation of terms and conditions without this element, provided the Secretary concerned is satisfied that the LRA has a reasonable plan in place to provide the element prior to transfer of the property; and
(3) The proposed EDC will more effectively enable achievement of the job generation objectives of the redevelopment plan regarding the parcel requested than the application of other federal real property disposal authorities.
(f) Upon acceptance of an EDC application, the Secretary concerned shall determine if the proposed terms and conditions are fair and reasonable. The Secretary concerned may propose and negotiate any alternative terms or conditions that the Secretary considers necessary. The following factors shall be considered, as appropriate, in evaluating the terms and conditions of the proposed transfer, including price, time of payment, and other relevant methods of compensation to the Federal government:
(1) Local economic conditions and adverse impact of closure or realignment on the region and potential for economic recovery through an EDC.
(2) Extent of short- and long-term job generation.
(3) Consistency with the entire redevelopment plan.
(4) Financial feasibility of the development and proposed consideration, including financial and market analysis and the need and extent of proposed infrastructure and other investments.
(5) Extent of state and local investment, level of risk incurred, and the LRA's ability to implement the redevelopment plan. Higher risk assumed and investment made by the LRA
should be recognized with more favorable terms and conditions, to encourage local investment to support job generation.
(6) Current local and regional real estate market conditions, including market demand for the property.
(7) Incorporation of other Federal agency interests and concerns, including the applicability of other Federal surplus property disposal authorities.
(8) Economic benefit to the Federal Government, including protection and maintenance cost savings, environmental clean-up savings, and anticipated consideration from the transfer.
(9) Compliance with applicable Federal, state, interstate, and local laws and regulations.
(g) The Secretary concerned shall negotiate the terms and conditions of each transaction with the LRA. The Secretary concerned shall have the discretion and flexibility to enter into agreements that specify the form of payment and the schedule.
(h)(1) The Secretary concerned may accept, as consideration, any combination of the following:
(i) Cash, including a share of the revenues that the local redevelopment authority receives from third-party buyers or lessees from sales and leases of the conveyed property (
i.e.,
a share of the revenues generated from the redevelopment project);
(ii) Goods and services;
(iii) Real property and improvements; and
(iv) Such other consideration as the Secretary considers appropriate.
(2) The consideration may be accepted over time.
(3) All cash consideration for property at a military installation where the date of approval of closure or realignment is before January 1, 2005, shall be deposited in the account established under Section 2906(a) of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Pub. L. 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note). All cash consideration for property at a military installation where the date of approval of closure or realignment is after January 1, 2005, shall be deposited in the account established under Section 2906A(a) of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Pub. L. 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note).
(4) The Secretary concerned may use in-kind consideration received from an LRA at any location under control of the Secretary concerned.
(i) The LRA and the Secretary concerned may agree on a schedule for sale of parcels and payment participation.
(j) Additional provisions shall be incorporated in the conveyance documents to protect the Department's interest in obtaining the agreed upon consideration, which may include such items as predetermined release prices, accounting standards, or other appropriate clauses designed to ensure payment and protect against fraudulent transactions. Every agreement for an EDC shall contain provisions allowing the Secretary concerned to recoup from the LRA such portion of the proceeds from a sale or lease by the LRA as the Secretary concerned determines appropriate if the LRA does not use the proceeds to support economic redevelopment of or related to the installation during the period specified in paragraph (d)(8) of this section. The Secretary concerned and an LRA may enter into a mutually agreed participation agreement which may include input by the Secretary concerned on the LRA's disposal of EDC parcels.
(k) The Secretary concerned should take account of property value but is not required to formally determine the estimated fair market value of the property for any EDC. The consideration negotiated should be based on a business plan and development pro-forma that assumes the uses in the redevelopment plan. The Secretary concerned may determine the nature and extent of any additional information needed for purposes of an informed negotiation. This may include, but is not limited to, an economic and market analysis, construction estimates, a real estate pro forma analysis, or an appraisal. To the extent not prohibited by law, information used should be shared with the LRA.
(l) After evaluating the application based upon the criteria specified in
paragraph (f) of this section, and negotiating terms and conditions, the Secretary concerned shall present the proposed EDC to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment) for formal coordination before announcing approval of the application.
[76 FR 70880, Nov. 16, 2011]
§ 174.10
[Reserved]
§ 174.11
Leasing of real property to non-Federal entities.
(a) Leasing of real property to non-Federal entities prior to the final disposition of closing and realigning installations may facilitate state and local economic adjustment efforts and encourage economic redevelopment, but the Secretary concerned will always concentrate on the final disposition of real and personal property.
(b) In addition to leasing property at fair market value, to assist local redevelopment efforts the Secretary concerned may also lease real and personal property, pending final disposition, for less than fair market value if the Secretary determines that:
(1) A public interest will be served as a result of the lease; and,
(2) The fair market value of the lease is unobtainable or not compatible with such public benefit.
(c) Pending final disposition of an installation, the Secretary concerned may grant interim leases which are short-term leases that make no commitment for future use or ultimate disposal. When granting an interim lease, the Secretary will generally lease to the LRA but can lease property directly to other entities. If the interim lease (after complying with NEPA) is entered into prior to completion of the final disposal decisions, the term may be for up to five years, including options to renew, and may contain restrictions on use. Leasing should not delay the final disposal of the property. After completion of the final disposal decisions, the term of the lease may be longer than five years.
(d) If the property is leased for less than fair market value to the LRA and the interim lease permits the property to be subleased, the interim lease shall provide that rents from the subleases will be applied by the lessee to the protection, maintenance, repair, improvement, and costs related to the property at the installation consistent with 10 U.S.C. 2667.
§ 174.12
Leasing of transferred real property by Federal agencies.
(a) The Secretary concerned may transfer real property that is still needed by a Federal agency (which for purposes of this section includes DoD Components) to an LRA provided the LRA agrees to lease the property to the Federal agency in accordance with all statutory and regulatory guidance.
(b) The decision whether to transfer property pursuant to such a leasing arrangement rests with the Secretary concerned. However, a Secretary shall only transfer property subject to such a leasing arrangement if the Federal agency that needs the property agrees to the leasing arrangement.
(c) If the subject property cannot be transferred pursuant to such a leasing arrangement (
e.g.
, the relevant Federal agency prefers ownership, the LRA and the Federal agency cannot agree on terms of the lease, or the Secretary concerned determines that such a lease would not be in the Federal interest), such property shall remain in Federal ownership unless and until the Secretary concerned determines that it is surplus.
(d) If a building or structure is proposed for transfer pursuant to this section, that which is leased by the Federal agency may be all or a portion of that building or structure.
(e) Transfers pursuant to this section must be to an LRA.
(f) Either existing Federal tenants or Federal agencies desiring to locate onto the property after operational closure may make use of such a leasing arrangement. The Secretary concerned may not enter into such a leasing arrangement unless:
(1) In the case of a Defense Agency, the Secretary concerned is acting in an Executive Agent capacity on behalf of the Agency that certifies that such a leasing arrangement is in the interest of that Agency; or,
(2) In the case of a Military Department, the Secretary concerned certifies that such a leasing arrangement
is in the best interest of the Military Department and that use of the property by the Military Department is consistent with the obligation to close or realign the installation in accordance with the recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.
(g) Property eligible for such a leasing arrangement is not surplus because it is still needed by the Federal Government. Even though the LRA would not otherwise have to include such property in its redevelopment plan, it should include the property in its redevelopment plan anyway to take into account the planned Federal use of such property.
(h) The terms of the LRA's lease to the Federal Government should afford the Federal agency rights as close to those associated with ownership of the property as is practicable. The requirements of the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 570) are not applicable to the lease, but provisions in that regulation may be used to the extent they are consistent with this part. The terms of the lease are negotiable subject to the following:
(1) The lease shall be for a term of no more than 50 years, but may provide for options for renewal or extension of the term at the request of the Federal Government. The lease term should be based on the needs of the Federal agency.
(2) The lease, or any renewals or extensions thereof, shall not require rental payments.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(2) of this section, if the lease involves a substantial portion of the installation, the Secretary concerned may obtain facility services for the leased property and common area maintenance from the LRA or the LRA's assignee as a provision of the lease.
(A) Such services and common area maintenance shall be provided at a rate no higher than the rate charged to non-Federal tenants of the transferred property.
(B) Such services and common area maintenance shall not include—
(
i
) Municipal services that a State or local government is required by law to provide to all landowners in its jurisdiction without direct charge, including police protection; or
(
ii
) Firefighting or security-guard functions.
(C) The Federal agency may be responsible for services such as janitorial, grounds keeping, utilities, capital maintenance, and other services normally provided by a landlord. Acquisition of such services by the Federal agency is to be accomplished through the use of Federal Acquisition Regulation procedures or otherwise in accordance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.
(4) The lease shall include a provision prohibiting the LRA from transferring fee title to another entity during the term of the lease, other than one of the political jurisdictions that comprise the LRA, without the written consent of the Federal agency occupying the leased property.
(5)(i) The lease shall include an option specifying that if the Federal agency no longer needs the property before the expiration of the term of the lease, the remainder of the lease term may be satisfied by the same or another Federal agency that needs property for a similar use. (“Similar use” is a use that is comparable to or essentially the same as the use under the original lease, as determined by the Secretary concerned.)
(ii)(B) If the tenant is a DoD Component, before notifying GSA of the availability of the leasehold, it shall determine whether any other DoD Component has a requirement for the leasehold; in doing so, it shall consult with the LRA. If another DoD Component has a requirement for the leasehold, that DoD Component shall be allowed to assume the leasehold for the remainder of its term. If no DoD Component has a requirement for the leasehold, the tenant shall notify GSA in accordance with paragraph (h)(5)(ii)(A) of this section.
(A) The Federal tenant shall notify the GSA of the availability of the leasehold. GSA will then decide whether to exercise this option after consulting with the LRA or other property owner. The GSA shall have 60 days from the date of notification in which to identify a Federal agency to serve out the term of the lease and to notify
the LRA or other property owner of the new tenant. If the GSA does not notify the LRA or other property owner of a new tenant within such 60 days, the leasehold shall terminate on a date agreed to by the Federal tenant and the LRA or other property owner.
(B) If the GSA decides not to exercise this option after consulting with the LRA or other property owner, the leasehold shall terminate on a date agreed to by the Federal tenant and the LRA or other property owner.
(6) The terms of the lease shall provide that the Federal agency may repair and improve the property at its expense after consultation with the LRA.
(i) Property subject to such a leasing arrangement shall be conveyed in accordance with the existing EDC procedures. The LRA shall submit the following in addition to the application requirements outlined in § 174.9(e) of this part:
(1) A description of the parcel or parcels the LRA proposes to have transferred to it and then to lease to a Federal agency;
(2) A written statement signed by an authorized representative of the Federal agency that it agrees to accept the lease of the property; and,
(3) A statement explaining why such a leasing arrangement is necessary for the long-term economic redevelopment of the installation property.
(j) The exact amount of consideration, or the formula to be used to determine that consideration, as well as the schedule for payment of consideration must be agreed upon in writing before transfer pursuant to this section.

# Subpart E—Personal Property
§ 174.13
Personal property.
(a) This section outlines procedures to allow transfer of personal property to the LRA for the effective implementation of a redevelopment plan. Personal property does not include fixtures.
(b) The Secretary concerned, supported by DoD Components with personal property on the installation, will take an inventory of the personal property, including its condition, within 6 months after the date of approval of closure or realignment. This inventory will be limited to the personal property located on the real property to be disposed of by the Military Department. The inventory will be taken in consultation with LRA officials. If there is no LRA, the Secretary concerned shall consult with the local government in whose jurisdiction the installation is wholly located, or a local government agency or a State government agency designated for that purpose by the Governor of the State. Based on these consultations, the installation commander will determine the items or category of items that have the potential to enhance the reuse of the real property.
(c) Except for property subject to the exemptions in paragraph (e) of this section, personal property with potential to enhance the reuse of the real property shall remain at an installation being closed or realigned until the earlier of:
(1) One week after the Secretary concerned receives the redevelopment plan;
(2) The date notified by the LRA that there will be no redevelopment plan;
(3) 24 months after the date of approval of the closure or realignment of the installation; or
(4) 90 days before the date of the closure or realignment of the installation.
(d) National Guard property under the control of the United States Property and Fiscal Officer is subject to inventory and may be made available for redevelopment planning purposes.
(e) Personal property may be removed upon approval of the installation commander or higher authority, as prescribed by the Secretary concerned, after the inventory required in paragraph (b) of this section has been sent to the LRA, when:
(1) The property is required for the operation of a unit, function, component, weapon, or weapons system at another installation;
(2) The property is uniquely military in character and is likely to have no civilian use (other than use for its material content or as a source of commonly used components). This property consists of classified items; nuclear, biological, and chemical items; weapons and munitions; museum property or
items of significant historic value that are maintained or displayed on loan; and similar military items;
(3) The property is not required for the reutilization or redevelopment of the installation (as jointly determined by the Secretary concerned and the LRA);
(4) The property is stored at the installation for purposes of distribution (including spare parts or stock items) or redistribution and sale (DoD excess/surplus personal property). This property includes materials or parts used in a manufacturing or repair function but does not include maintenance spares for equipment to be left in place;
(5) The property meets known requirements of an authorized program of a DoD Component or another Federal agency that would have to purchase similar items, and is the subject of a written request by the head of the DoD Component or other Federal agency. If the authority to acquire personal property has been delegated, a copy of the delegation must accompany the request. (For purposes of this paragraph, “purchase” means the DoD Component or Federal agency intends to obligate funds in the current quarter or next six fiscal quarters.) The DoD Component or Federal agency must pay packing, crating, handling, and transportation charges associated with such transfers of personal property;
(6) The property belongs to a nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) of the Department of Defense; separate arrangements for communities to purchase such property are possible and may be negotiated with the Secretary concerned;
(7) The property is not owned by the Department of Defense,
i.e.
, it is owned by a Federal agency outside the Department of Defense or by non-Federal persons or entities such as a State, a private corporation, or an individual; or,
(8) The property is needed elsewhere in the national security interest of the United States as determined by the Secretary concerned. This authority may not be re-delegated below the level of an Assistant Secretary. In exercising this authority, the Secretary may transfer the property to any DoD Component or other Federal agency.
(f) Personal property not subject to the exemptions in paragraph (e) of this section may be conveyed to the LRA as part of an EDC for the real property if the Secretary concerned makes a finding that the personal property is necessary for the effective implementation of the redevelopment plan.
(g) Personal property may also be conveyed separately to the LRA under an EDC for personal property. This type of EDC can be made if the Secretary concerned determines that the transfer is necessary for the effective implementation of a redevelopment plan with respect to the installation. Such determination shall be based on the LRA's timely application for the property, which should be submitted to the Secretary upon completion of the redevelopment plan. The application must include the LRA's agreement to accept the personal property after a reasonable period and will otherwise comply with the requirements of §§ 174.9 and 174.10 of this part. The transfer will be subject to reasonable limitations and conditions on use.
(h) Personal property that is not needed by a DoD Component or a tenant Federal agency or conveyed to an LRA (or a state or local jurisdiction in lieu of an LRA), or conveyed as related personal property together with the real property, will be transferred to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office for disposal in accordance with applicable regulations.
(i) Useful personal property not needed by the Federal Government and not qualifying for transfer to the LRA under an EDC may be donated to the community or LRA through the appropriate State Agency for Surplus Property (SASP) under 41 CFR part 102-37 surplus program guidelines. Personal property donated under this procedure must meet the usage and control requirements of the applicable SASP.

# Subpart F—Maintenance and Repair
§ 174.14
Maintenance and repair.
(a) Facilities and equipment located on installations being closed are often important to the eventual reuse of the installation. This section provides maintenance procedures to preserve
and protect those facilities and items of equipment needed for reuse in an economical manner that facilitates installation redevelopment.
(b) In order to ensure quick reuse, the Secretary concerned, in consultation with the LRA, will establish initial levels of maintenance and repair needed to aid redevelopment and to protect the property for the time periods set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. Where agreement between the Secretary and the LRA cannot be reached, the Secretary will determine the required levels of maintenance and repair and its duration. In no case will these initial levels of maintenance:
(1) Exceed the standard of maintenance and repair in effect on the date of approval of closure or realignment;
(2) Be less than maintenance and repair required to be consistent with Federal Government standards for excess and surplus properties as provided in the Federal Management Regulations of the GSA, 41 CFR part 102;
(3) Be less than the minimum levels required to support the use of such facilities or equipment for nonmilitary purposes; or,
(4) Require any property improvements, including construction, alteration, or demolition, except when the demolition is required for health, safety, or environmental purposes, or is economically justified in lieu of continued maintenance expenditures.
(c) Unless the Secretary concerned determines that it is in the national security interest of the United States, the levels of maintenance and repair specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be changed until the earlier of:
(1) One week after the Secretary concerned receives the redevelopment plan;
(2) The date notified by the LRA that there will be no redevelopment plan;
(3) 24 months after the date of approval of the closure or realignment of the installation; or
(4) 90 days before the date of the closure or realignment of the installation.
(d) The Secretary concerned may extend the time period for the initial levels of maintenance and repair for property still under the Secretary's control for an additional period, if the Secretary determines that the LRA is actively implementing its redevelopment plan, and such levels of maintenance are justified.
(e) Once the time period for the initial or extended levels of maintenance and repair expires, the Secretary concerned will reduce the levels of maintenance and repair to levels consistent with Federal Government standards for excess and surplus properties as provided in the Federal Management Regulations of the GSA, except in the case of facilities still being used to perform a DoD mission.

# Subpart G—Environmental Matters
§ 174.15
Indemnification under Section 330 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993.
Section 330 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Pub. L. 102-484, as amended, provides for indemnification of transferees of closing Department of Defense properties under circumstances specified in that statute. The authority to implement this provision of law has been delegated by the Secretary of Defense to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense; therefore, this provision of law shall only be referred to or recited in any deed, sales agreement, bill of sale, lease, license, easement, right-of-way, or transfer document for real or personal property after obtaining the written concurrence of the Deputy General Counsel (Environment and Installations), Office of the General Counsel, Department of Defense.
§ 174.16
Real property containing explosive or chemical agent hazards.
The DoD Component controlling real property known to contain or suspected of containing explosive or chemical agent hazards from past DoD military munitions-related or chemical warfare-related activities shall, prior to transfer of the property out of Department of Defense control, obtain the DoD Explosives Safety Board's approval of measures planned to ensure protectiveness from such hazards, in accordance with DoD Directive 6055.9E,
Explosives Safety Management and the DoD Explosives Safety Board.
§ 174.17
NEPA.
At installations subject to this part, NEPA analysis shall comply with the promulgated NEPA regulations of the Military Department exercising real property accountability for the installation, including any requirements relating to responsibility for funding the analysis. See 32 CFR parts 651 (for the Army), 775 (for the Navy), and 989 (for the Air Force). Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as releasing a Military Department from complying with its own NEPA regulation.
§ 174.18
Historic preservation.
(a) The transfer, lease, or sale of National Register-eligible historic property to a non-Federal entity at installations subject to this part may constitute an “adverse effect” under the regulations implementing the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800.5(a)(2)(vii)). One way of resolving this adverse effect is to restrict the use that may be made of the property subsequent to its transfer out of Federal ownership or control through the imposition of legally enforceable restrictions or conditions. The Secretary concerned may include such restrictions or conditions (typically a real property interest in the form of a restrictive covenant or preservation easement) in any deed or lease conveying an interest in historic property to a non-Federal entity. Before doing so, the Secretary should first consider whether the historic character of the property can be protected effectively through planning and zoning actions undertaken by units of State or local government; if so, working with such units of State or local government to protect the property through these means is preferable to encumbering the property with such a covenant or easement.
(b) Before including such a covenant or easement in a deed or lease, the Secretary concerned shall consider—
(1) Whether the jurisdiction that encompasses the property authorizes such a covenant or easement; and
(2) Whether the Secretary can give or assign to a third party the responsibility for monitoring and enforcing such a covenant or easement.

§ 175.5
Notice to DoD relating to a third-party claim.
(a)
Where to file a notice to DoD of a third-party claim.
(1) Notice to DoD of receipt of a third-party claim, or intent to enter into, agree to, settle, or solicit such a claim, must be received by the Deputy General Counsel at the following address: Deputy General Counsel, Environment, Energy, and Installations, 1600 Defense Pentagon, Room 3B747, Washington, DC 20301-1600, (703-693-4895) or (703-692-2287).
(2) Delivering or otherwise filing a notice of a third-party claim with any other office or location will not constitute proper notice for purposes of this part. Requesters should be aware that all delivery services, and particularly that of the USPS, to the Pentagon can be significantly delayed for security purposes and they should plan accordingly in order to meet any required filing deadlines under this part; use of a commercial delivery service may reduce the delay.
(b)
Individual notices.
A notice to DoD of a third-party claim must be filed separately for each person or entity that is filing the notice. Notices may not be filed jointly for a group, a class, or for multiple persons or entities.
(c)
Means of filing a notice of a third-party claim.
A notice of a third-party claim must be submitted in writing by mail through the USPS or by a commercial delivery service. While the Deputy General Counsel will affirmatively acknowledge receipt of a notice of a third-party claim, it is recommended that a requester, whether using the USPS or a commercial delivery service, mail its notice by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or equivalent proof of delivery.
(d)
Information to be included in a notice to DoD of a third-party claim.
A notice to DoD of a third-party claim must include, at a minimum, the following information:
(1) A complete copy of the third-party claim, or, if not presented in writing, a complete summary of the claim, with the names of officers, employees, or agents with knowledge of any information that may be relevant to the claim or any potential defenses. The third-party claim may consist of a summons and complaint or, in the case of a third-party claim from a governmental regulatory authority, a notice, letter, order, compliance advisory, compliance agreement, or similar notification.
(2) A complete copy of all pertinent records, including any deed, sales agreement, bill of sale, lease, license, easement, right-of-way, or transfer document for the facility for which the third-party claim is made.
(3) If the requester is not the first transferee from DoD, a complete copy of all intervening deeds, sales agreements, bills of sale, leases, licenses, easements, rights-of-way, or other transfer documents between the original transfer from DoD and the transfer to the current owner. If the requester is a lender who has made a loan to a person or entity who owns, controls, or leases the facility for which the request for indemnification is made that is secured by said facility, complete copies of all promissory notes, mortgages, deeds of trust, assignments, or other documents evidencing such a loan by the requester.
(4) A complete copy of any insurance policies related to such facility.
(5) If the notice to DoD of a third-party claim is being made by a representative, agent, or attorney in fact or at law, proof of authority to make the notice on behalf of the requester.
(6) Evidence or proof of any claim, loss, or damage alleged to be suffered by the third-party claimant which the requester asserts is covered by section 330 or by section 1502(e).
(7) In the case where a requester intends to enter into, agree to, settle, or solicit a third-party claim, a description or copy of the proposed claim, settlement, or solicitation, as the case may be.
(8) To the extent that any environmental response action has been taken, the documentation supporting such response action and its costs included in the request for indemnification.
(9) To the extent that any environmental response action has been taken, a statement as to whether the remedial action is consistent with the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (part 300 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations) or other applicable regulatory requirements.
(10) A complete copy of any claims made by the requester to any other entity related to the conditions on the property which are the subject of the claim, and any responses or defenses thereto or made to any third-party claims, including correspondence, litigation filings, consultant reports, and other information supporting a claim or defense.
(e)
Entry, inspection, and samples.
The requester must provide DoD a right of entry at reasonable times to any facility, establishment, place, or property under the requester's control which is the subject of or associated with the requester's notice of third-party claim and must allow DoD to inspect or obtain samples from that facility, establishment, place, or property.
(f)
Additional information.
The Deputy General Counsel will advise a requester in writing of any additional information that must be provided to defend against a claim. Failure to provide the additional information in a timely manner may result in denial of a request for indemnification or defense for lack of information to adjudicate the claim.
(g)
When to file a notice to DoD of a third-party claim.
(1) A requester must, within 15 days of receiving a third-party claim, file with DoD a notice of such claim in accordance with this part. Failure to timely file such a notice, if it in any way compromises the ability of DoD to defend against such a claim pursuant to section 330(c) or section 1502(e)(3), will result in denial of any subsequent request for indemnification or defense resulting from such a claim. Requesters who take action in compliance with any such third-party claim, or any part of such claim, without first providing DoD with a notice of such claim in accordance with this section do so at their own risk.
(2) A requester must, at least 30 days prior to the earlier of entering into, agreeing to, settling, or soliciting a third-party claim, file a notice to DoD of such intent in accordance with this part. Failure to file such a notice will compromise the ability of DoD to defend against such a claim pursuant to section 330(c) or section 1502(e)(3) and will result in denial of any subsequent request for indemnification or defense resulting from such a claim.
(3) A requester may, if it believes more immediate notice to DoD is desirable or less than all the information required by paragraph (d) of this section is immediately available, contact the Deputy General Counsel using the phone numbers in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Any such contact does not constitute compliance with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section unless and until the Deputy General Counsel subsequently provides written confirmation that the notice constitutes such compliance. Such written confirmation may be provided by electronic means.
(h)
No implication from DoD action.
Any actions taken by DoD related to defending a claim do not constitute a decision by DoD that the requester is entitled to indemnification or defense.
(i)
Notice also constituting a request for indemnification or defense.
Notice of receipt of a third-party claim may also constitute a request for indemnification or defense if that notice complies with all applicable requirements for a request for indemnification or defense.
§ 175.6
Filing a request for indemnification or defense.
(a)
Where to file a request for indemnification or defense.
(1) In order to notify DoD in accordance with section 330(b)(1) or section 1502(e)(2)(A), a request for indemnification or defense pursuant to section 330 or section 1502(e) must be received by the Deputy General Counsel at the following address: Deputy General Counsel, Environment, Energy, and Installations, 1600 Defense Pentagon, Room 3B747, Washington, DC 20301-1600, (703-693-4895) or (703-692-2287).
(2) Delivering or otherwise filing a request for indemnification or defense with any other office or location will not constitute proper notice of a request for purposes of section 330(b)(1) or section 1502(e)(2)(A). Requesters should be aware that all delivery services, and particularly that of the USPS, to the Pentagon can be significantly delayed for security purposes and they should plan accordingly in order to meet any required filing deadlines under this part; use of a commercial delivery service may reduce the delay.
(b)
When to file a request for indemnification or defense.

the United States to provide the requested defense.
(c)
Means of filing a request for indemnification or defense.
A request for indemnification or defense must be submitted in writing by mail through the USPS or by a commercial delivery service. While the Deputy General Counsel will affirmatively acknowledge receipt of a request for indemnification or defense, it is recommended that a requester, whether using the USPS or a commercial delivery service, mail its request by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or equivalent proof of delivery.
(d)
Individual requests.
A request for indemnification or defense must be filed separately for each person or entity that is making the request. Requests may not be filed jointly for a group, a class, or for multiple persons or entities.
(e)
Information to be included in a request for indemnification or defense.
A request for indemnification or defense must include, at a minimum, the following information:
(1) A complete copy of the third-party claim, or, if not presented in writing, a complete summary of the claim, with the names of officers, employees, or agents with knowledge of any information that may be relevant to the claim or any potential defenses.
(2) A complete copy of all pertinent records, including any deed, sales agreement, bill of sale, lease, license, easement, right-of-way, or transfer document for the facility for which the request for indemnification or defense is made.
(3) If the requester is not the first transferee from DoD, a complete copy of all intervening deeds, sales agreements, bills of sale, leases, licenses, easements, rights-of-way, or other transfer documents between the original transfer from DoD and the transfer to the current owner. If the requester is a lender who has made a loan to a person or entity who owns, controls, or leases the facility for which the request for indemnification is made that is secured by said facility, complete copies of all promissory notes, mortgages, deeds of trust, assignments, or other documents evidencing such a loan by the requester.
(4) A complete copy of any insurance policies related to such facility.
(5) If the request for indemnification or defense is being made by a representative, agent, or attorney in fact or at law, proof of authority to make the request on behalf of the requester.
(6) Evidence or proof of any claim, loss, or damage covered by section 330 or by section 1502(e).
(7) In the case of a request for defense, a copy of the documents, such as a summons and complaint, or enforcement order, representing the matter against which the United States is being asked to defend.
(8) To the extent that any environmental response action has been taken, the documentation supporting such response action and its costs included in the request for indemnification.
(9) To the extent that any environmental response action has been taken, a statement as to whether the remedial action is consistent with the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (part 300 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations) or other applicable regulatory requirements.
(10) A complete copy of any claims made by the requester to any other entity related to the conditions on the property which are the subject of the claim, and any responses or defenses thereto or made to any third-party claims, including correspondence, litigation filings, consultant reports, and other information supporting a claim or defense.
(f)
Entry, inspection, and samples.
The requester must provide DoD a right of entry at reasonable times to any facility, establishment, place, or property under the requester's control which is the subject of or associated with the requester's request for indemnification or defense and must allow DoD to inspect or obtain samples from that facility, establishment, place, or property.
(g)
Additional information.
The Deputy General Counsel will advise a requester in writing of any additional information that must be provided to adjudicate the request for indemnification or defense. Failure to provide the additional information in a timely manner may result in denial of the request for indemnification or defense.
(h)
Adjudication.
The Deputy General Counsel will adjudicate a request for indemnification or defense and provide the requester with DoD's determination of the validity of the request. Such determination will be in writing and sent to the requester by certified or registered mail.
(i)
Reconsideration.
Any such determination will provide that the requester may ask for reconsideration of the determination. Such reconsideration shall be limited to an assertion by the requester of substantial new evidence or errors in calculation. The requester may seek such reconsideration by filing a request to that effect. A request for reconsideration must be received by the Deputy General Counsel within 30 days after receipt of the determination by the requester. Such a request must be sent to the same address as provided for in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and provide the substantial new evidence or identify the errors in calculation. Such reconsideration will not extend to determinations concerning the law, except as it may have been applied to the facts. A request for reconsideration will be acted on within 30 days from the time it is received. If a request for reconsideration is made, the six month period referred to in section 330(b)(1) and section 1502(e)(2)(A) will commence from the date the requester receives DoD's denial of the request for reconsideration.
(j)
Finality of adjudication.
An adjudication of a request for indemnification constitutes final administrative disposition of such a request, except in the case of a request for reconsideration under paragraph (i) of this section, in which case a denial of the request for reconsideration constitutes final administrative disposition of the request.

§ 176.1
Purpose.
This part implements the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act, as amended (10 U.S.C. 2687 note), which instituted a new community-based process for addressing the needs of the homeless at base closure and realignment sites. In this process, Local Redevelopment Authorities (LRAs) identify interest from homeless providers in installation property and develop a redevelopment plan for the installation that balances the economic redevelopment and other development needs of the communities in the vicinity of the installation with the needs of the homeless in those communities. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reviews the LRA's plan to see that an appropriate balance is achieved. This part also implements the process for identifying interest from State and local entities for property under a public benefit transfer. The LRA is responsible for concurrently identifying interest from homeless providers and State and local entities interested in property under a public benefit transfer.

Federal Register
publication of available property described at § 176.20(b). For those installations that began the process described in this part prior to August 17, 1995, HUD will, on a case-by-case basis, determine whether the statutory requirements have been fulfilled and whether any additional requirements listed in this part should be required. Upon the
Federal Register
publication described in § 176.20(b), the LRA shall:
(1) Publish, within 30 days, in a newspaper of general circulation in the communities in the vicinity of the installation, the time period during which the LRA will receive notices of interest from State and local governments, representatives of the homeless, and other interested parties. This publication shall include the name, address, telephone number and the point of contact for the LRA who can provide information on the prescribed form and contents of the notices of interest. The LRA shall notify DoD of the deadline specified for receipt of notices of interest. LRAs are strongly encouraged to make this publication as soon as possible within the permissible 30 day period in order to expedite the closure process.
(i) In addition, the LRA has the option to conduct an informal solicitation of notices of interest from public and non-profit entities interested in obtaining property via a public benefit transfer other than a homeless assistance conveyance under either 40 U.S.C. 471

(A) Learn about the closure/realignment and disposal process;
(B) Tour the buildings and properties available either on or off the installation;
(C) Learn about the LRA's process and schedule for receiving notices of interest as guided by § 176.20(c)(2); and,
(D) Learn about any known land use constraints affecting the available property and buildings.
(iii) The LRA should meet with representatives of the homeless that express interest in discussing possible uses for these properties to alleviate gaps in the continuum of care.
(4) Consider various properties in response to the notices of interest. The LRA may consider property that is located off the installation.
(5) Develop an application, including the redevelopment plan and homeless assistance submission, explaining how the LRA proposes to address the needs of the homeless. This application shall consider the notices of interest received from State and local governments, representatives of the homeless, and other interested parties. This shall include, but not be limited to, entities eligible for public benefit transfers under either 40 U.S.C. 471
et. seq.,
or 49 U.S.C. 47151-47153; representatives of the homeless; commercial, industrial, and residential development interests; and other interests. From the deadline date for receipt of notices of interest described at § 176.20(c)(1), the LRA shall have 270 days to complete and submit the LRA application to the appropriate
Military Department and HUD. The application requirements are described at § 176.30.
(6) Make the draft application available to the public for review and comment periodically during the process of developing the application. The LRA must conduct at least one public hearing on the application prior to its submission to HUD and the appropriate Military Department. A summary of the public comments received during the process of developing the application shall be included in the application when it is submitted.
(d)
Public benefit transfer screening.
The LRA should, while conducting its outreach efforts, work with the Federal agencies that sponsor public benefit transfers under either 40 U.S.C. 471
et. seq.
or 49 U.S.C. 47151-47153. Those agencies can provide a list of parties in the vicinity of the installation that might be interested in and eligible for public benefit transfers. The LRA should make a reasonable effort to inform such parties of the availability of the property and incorporate their interests within the planning process. Actual recipients of property are to be determined by sponsoring Federal agency. The Military Departments shall notify sponsoring Federal agencies about property that is available based on the community redevelopment plan and keep the LRA apprised of any expressions of interest. Such expressions of interest are not required to be incorporated into the redevelopment plan, but must be considered.

Where the balance determined in accordance with § 176.30(b)(4) provides for the use of installation property as a homeless assistance facility, legally binding agreements must provide for the reversion or transfer, either to the LRA or to another entity or entities, of the buildings and property in the event they cease to be used for the homeless. In cases where the balance proposed by the LRA does not include the use of buildings or property on the installation, the legally binding agreements need not be tied to the use of specific real property and need not include a reverter clause. Legally binding agreements shall be accompanied by a legal opinion of the chief legal advisor of the LRA or political jurisdiction or jurisdictions which will be executing the legally binding agreements that the legally binding agreements, when executed, will constitute legal, valid, binding, and enforceable obligations on the parties thereto;
(ii) A description of how buildings, property, funding, and/or services either on or off the installation will be used to fill some of the gaps in the current continuum of care system and an explanation of the suitability of the buildings and property for that use; and,
(iii) Information on the availability of general services such as transportation, police, and fire protection, and a discussion of infrastructure such as water, sewer, and electricity in the vicinity of the proposed homeless activity at the installation.
(4) An assessment of the balance with economic and other development needs.
(i) An assessment of the manner in which the application balances the expressed needs of the homeless and the needs of the communities comprising the LRA for economic redevelopment and other development; and
(ii) An explanation of how the LRA's application is consistent with the appropriate Consolidated Plan(s) or any other existing housing, social service, community, economic, or other development plans adopted by the jurisdictions in the vicinity of the installation.
(5) A description of the outreach undertaken by the LRA. The LRA shall explain how the outreach requirements described at § 176.20(c)(1) and § 176.20(c)(3) have been fulfilled. This explanation shall include a list of the representatives of the homeless the LRA contacted during the outreach process.
(c)
Public comments.
The LRA application shall include the materials described at § 176.20(c)(6). These materials shall be prefaced with an overview of the citizen participation process observed in preparing the application.
§ 176.35
HUD's review of the application.
(a)
Timing.
HUD shall complete a review of each application no later than 60 days after its receipt of a completed application.
(b)
Standards of review.
The purpose of the review is to determine whether the application is complete and, with respect to the expressed interest and requests of representatives of the homeless, whether the application:
(1)
Need.
Takes into consideration the size and nature of the homeless population in the communities in the vicinity of the installation, the availability of existing services in such communities to meet the needs of the homeless in such communities, and the suitability of the buildings and property covered by the application for use and needs of the homeless in such communities. HUD will take into consideration the size and nature of the installation in reviewing the needs of the homeless population in the communities in the vicinity of the installation.
(2) Impact of notices of interest. Takes into consideration any economic impact of the homeless assistance under the plan on the communities in the vicinity of the installation, including:
(i) Whether the plan is feasible in light of demands that would be placed on available social services, police and fire protection, and infrastructure in the community; and,
(ii) Whether the selected notices of interest are consistent with the Consolidated Plan(s) of any other existing housing, social service, community economic, or other development plans adopted by the political jurisdictions in the vicinity of the installation.
(3) Legally binding agreements. Specifies the manner in which the buildings, property, funding, and/or services on or off the installation will be made available for homeless assistance purposes. HUD will review each legally binding agreement to verify that:
(i) They include all the documents legally required to complete the transactions necessary to realize the homeless use(s) described in the application;
(ii) They include all appropriate terms and conditions;
(iii) They address the full range of contingencies including those described at § 176.30(b)(3)(i);
(iv) They stipulate that the buildings, property, funding, and/or services will be made available to the representatives of the homeless in a timely fashion; and,
(v) They are accompanied by a legal opinion of the chief legal advisor of the LRA or political jurisdiction or jurisdictions which will be executing the legally binding agreements that the legally binding agreements will, when executed, constitute legal, valid, binding, and enforceable obligations on the parties thereto.
(4)
Balance.
Balances in an appropriate manner a portion or all of the needs of the communities in the vicinity or the installation for economic redevelopment and other development with the needs of the homeless in such communities.
(5)
Outreach.
Was developed in consultation with representatives of the homeless and the homeless assistance planning boards, if any, in the communities in the vicinity of the installation and whether the outreach requirements described at § 176.20(c)(1) and § 176.20(c)(3) have been fulfilled by the LRA.
(c)
Notice of determination.
(1) HUD shall, no later than the 60th day after its receipt of the application, unless such deadline is extended pursuant to § 176.15(a), send written notification
both to DoD and the LRA of its preliminary determination that the application meets or fails to meet the requirements of § 176.35(b). If the application fails to meet the requirements, HUD will send the LRA:
(i) A summary of the deficiencies in the application;
(ii) An explanation of the determination; and,
(iii) A statement of how the LRA must address the determinations.
(2) In the event that no application is submitted and no extension is requested as of the deadline specified in § 176.20(c)(5), and the State does not accept within 30 days a DoD written request to become recognized as the LRA, the absence of such application will trigger an adverse determination by HUD effective on the date of the lapsed deadline. Under these conditions, HUD will follow the process described at § 176.40.
(d)
Opportunity to cure.
(1) The LRA shall have 90 days from its receipt of the notice of preliminary determination under § 176.35(c)(1) within which to submit to HUD and DoD a revised application which addresses the determinations listed in the notice. Failure to submit a revised application shall result in a final determination, effective 90 days from the LRA's receipt of the preliminary determination, that the redevelopment plan fails to meet the requirements of § 176.35(b).
(2) HUD shall, within 30 days of its receipt of the LRA's resubmission send written notification of its final determination of whether the application meets the requirements of § 176.35(b) to both DOD and the LRA.
§ 176.40
Adverse determinations.
(a)
Review and consultation.
If the resubmission fails to meet the requirements of § 176.35(b) or if no resubmission is received, HUD will review the original application, including the notices of interest submitted by representatives of the homeless. In addition, in such instances or when no original application has been submitted, HUD:
(1) Shall consult with the representatives of the homeless, if any, for purposes of evaluation the continuing interest of such representatives in the use of buildings or property at the installation to assist the homeless;
(2) May consult with the applicable Military Department regarding the suitability of the buildings and property at the installation for use to assist the homeless; and,
(3) May consult with representatives of the homeless and other parties as necessary.
(b)
Notice of decision.
(1) Within 90 days of receipt of an LRA's revised application which HUD determines does not meet the requirements of § 176.35(b), HUD shall, based upon its reviews and consultations under § 176.40(a):
(i) Notify DoD and the LRA of the buildings and property at the installation that HUD determines are suitable for use to assist the homeless, and;
(ii) Notify DoD and the LRA of the extent to which the revised redevelopment plan meets the criteria set forth in § 176.35(b).
(2) In the event that an LRA does not submit a revised redevelopment plan under § 176.35(d), HUD shall, based upon its reviews and consultations under § 176.40(a), notify DoD and the LRA of the buildings and property at the installation that HUD determines are suitable for use to assist the homeless, either
(i) Within 190 days after HUD sends its notice of preliminary adverse determination under § 176.35(c)(1), if an LRA has not submitted a revised redevelopment plan; or
(ii) Within 390 days after the Military Department's
Federal Register
publication of available property under § 176.20(b), if no redevelopment plan has been received and no extension has been approved.
§ 176.45
Disposal of buildings and property.
(a)
Public benefit transfer screening.
Not later than the LRA's submission of its redevelopment plan to DoD and HUD, the Military Development will conduct an official public benefit transfer screening in accordance with the Federal Property Management Regulations (41 CFR 101-47.303-2) based upon the uses identified in the redevelopment plan. Federal sponsoring agencies shall notify eligible applicants
that any request for property must be consistent with the uses identified in the redevelopment plan. At the request of the LRA, the Military Department may conduct the official State and local public benefit screening at any time after the publication of available property described at § 176.20(b).
(b)
Environmental analysis.
Prior to disposal of any real property, the Military Department shall, consistent with NEPA and section 2905 of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended (10 U.S.C. 2687 note), complete an environmental impact analysis of all reasonable disposal alternatives. The Military Department shall consult with the LRA throughout the environmental impact analysis process to ensure both that the LRA is provided the most current environmental information available concerning the installation, and that the Military Department receives the most current information available concerning the LRA's redevelopment plans for the installation.
(c)
Disposal.
Upon receipt of a notice of approval of an application from HUD under § 176.35(c)(1) or § 176.35(d)(2), DoD shall dispose of buildings and property in accordance with the record of decision or other decision document prepared under § 176.45(b). Disposal of buildings and property to be used as homeless assistance facilities shall be to either the LRA or directly to the representative(s) of the homeless and shall be without consideration. Upon receipt of a notice from HUD under § 176.40(b), DoD will dispose of the buildings and property at the installation in consultation with HUD and the LRA.
(d)
LRA's responsibility.
The LRA shall be responsible for the implementation of and compliance with legally binding agreements under the application.
(e)
Reversions to the LRA.
If a building or property reverts to the LRA under a legally binding agreement under the application, the LRA shall take appropriate actions to secure, to the maximum extent practicable, the utilization of the building or property by other homeless representatives to assist the homeless. An LRA may not be required to utilize the building or property to assist the homeless.

§ 179.1
Purpose.
The Department of Defense (the Department) is adopting this Munitions Response Site Prioritization Protocol (MRSPP) (hereinafter referred to as the “rule”) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2710(b). Provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2710(b) require that the Department assign to each defense site in the inventory required by 10 U.S.C. 2710(a) a relative priority for response activities based on the overall conditions at each location and taking into consideration various factors related to safety and environmental hazards.
§ 179.2
Applicability and scope.
(a) This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Defense Agencies and the Department Field Activities, and any other Department organizational entity or instrumentality established to perform a government function (hereafter referred to collectively as the “Components”).
(b) The rule in this part shall be applied at all locations:
(1) That are, or were, owned by, leased to, or otherwise possessed or used by the Department, and
(2) That are known to, or suspected of, containing unexploded ordnance (UXO), discarded military munitions (DMM), or munitions constituents (MC), and
(3) That are included in the inventory established pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2710(a).
(c) The rule in this part shall not be applied at the locations not included in the inventory required under 10 U.S.C. 2710(a). The locations not included in the inventory are:
(1) Locations that are not, or were not, owned by, leased to, or otherwise possessed or used by the Department,
(2) Locations neither known to contain, or suspected of containing, UXO, DMM, or MC,
(3) Locations outside the United States,
(4) Locations where the presence of military munitions results from combat operations,
(5) Currently operating military munitions storage and manufacturing facilities,
(6) Locations that are used for, or were permitted for, the treatment or disposal of military munitions, and
(7) Operational ranges.
§ 179.3
Definitions.
This part includes definitions for many terms that clarify its scope and applicability. Many of the terms relevant to this part are already defined, either in 10 U.S.C. 101, 10 U.S.C. 2710(e), or the Code of Federal Regulations. Where this is the case, the statutory and regulatory definitions are repeated here strictly for ease of reference. Citations to the U.S. Code or the Code of Federal Regulations are provided with the definition, as applicable. Unless used elsewhere in the U.S. Code or the Code of Federal Regulations, these terms are defined only for purposes of this part.
Barrier
means a natural obstacle or obstacles (
e.g.
, difficult terrain, dense vegetation, deep or fast-moving water), a man-made obstacle or obstacles (
e.g.
, fencing), and combinations of natural and man-made obstacles.
Chemical agent (CA)
means a chemical compound (to include experimental compounds) that, through its chemical properties produces lethal or other damaging effects on human beings, is intended for use in military operations to kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate persons through its physiological effects. Excluded are research, development, testing and evaluation (RDTE) solutions; riot control agents; chemical defoliants and herbicides; smoke and other obscuration materials; flame and incendiary materials; and industrial chemicals. (This definition is based on the definition of “chemical agent and munition” in 50 U.S.C. 1521(j)(1).)
Chemical Agent (CA) Hazard
is a condition where danger exists because CA is present in a concentration high enough to present potential unacceptable effects (
e.g.
, death, injury, damage) to people, operational capability, or the environment.
Chemical Warfare Materiel (CWM)
means generally configured as a munition containing a chemical compound that is intended to kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate a person through its physiological effects. CWM includes V- and G-series nerve agents or H-series (mustard) and L-series (lewisite) blister agents in other-than-munition configurations; and certain industrial chemicals (
e.g.
, hydrogen cyanide (AC), cyanogen chloride (CK), or carbonyl dichloride (called phosgene or CG)) configured as a military munition. Due to their hazards, prevalence, and military-unique application, chemical agent identification sets (CAIS) are also considered CWM. CWM does not include riot control devices; chemical defoliants and herbicides; industrial chemicals (
e.g.
, AC, CK, or CG) not configured as a munition; smoke and other obscuration-producing items; flame and incendiary-producing items; or soil, water, debris, or other media contaminated with low concentrations of chemical agents where no CA hazards exist. For the purposes of this Protocol, CWM encompasses four subcategories of specific materials:
(1)
CWM, explosively configured
are all munitions that contain a CA fill and any explosive component. Examples are M55 rockets with CA, the M23 VX mine, and the M360 105-mm GB artillery cartridge.
(2)
CWM, nonexplosively configured
are all munitions that contain a CA fill, but that do not contain any explosive components. Examples are any chemical munition that does not contain explosive components and VX or mustard agent spray canisters.
(3)
CWM, bulk container
are all non-munitions-configured containers of CA (e.g., a ton container) and CAIS K941, toxic gas set M-1 and K942, toxic gas set M-2/E11.
(4)
CAIS
are military training aids containing small quantities of various CA and other chemicals. All forms of CAIS are scored the same in this rule, except CAIS K941, toxic gas set M-1; and CAIS K942, toxic gas set M-2/E11, which are considered forms of CWM, bulk container, due to the relatively large quantities of agent contained in those types of sets.
Components
means the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Defense Agencies, the Department Field Activities, and any other Department organizational entity or instrumentality established to perform a government function.
Defense site
means locations that are or were owned by, leased to, or otherwise possessed or used by the Department. The term does not include any operational range, operating storage or manufacturing facility, or facility that is used for or was permitted for the treatment or disposal of military munitions. (10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(1))
Discarded military munitions (DMM)
means military munitions that have been abandoned without proper disposal or removed from storage in a military magazine or other storage area for the purpose of disposal. The term does not include UXO, military munitions that are being held for future use or planned disposal, or military munitions that have been properly disposed of consistent with applicable environmental laws and regulations. (10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(2))
Explosive hazard
means a condition where danger exists because explosives are present that may react (
e.g.,
detonate, deflagrate) in a mishap with potential unacceptable effects (
e.g.,
death, injury, damage) to people, property, operational capability, or the environment.
Military munitions
means all ammunition products and components produced for or used by the armed forces for national defense and security, including ammunition products or components under the control of the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, the Department of Energy, and the National Guard. The term includes confined gaseous, liquid, and solid propellants; explosives, pyrotechnics, chemical and riot control agents, smokes, and incendiaries, including bulk explosives and chemical warfare agents; chemical munitions, rockets, guided and ballistic missiles, bombs, warheads, mortar rounds, artillery ammunition, small arms ammunition, grenades, mines, torpedoes, depth charges, cluster munitions and dispensers, and demolition charges; and devices and components of any item thereof. The term does not include wholly inert items, improvised explosive devices, and nuclear weapons, nuclear devices, and nuclear components, other than nonnuclear components of nuclear devices that are managed under the nuclear weapons program of the Department of Energy after all required sanitization operations under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011
et seq.
) have been completed. (10 U.S.C. 101(e)(4))
Military range
means designated land and water areas set aside, managed, and used to research, develop, test, and evaluate military munitions, other ordnance, or weapon systems, or to train military personnel in their use and handling. Ranges include firing lines and positions, maneuver areas, firing lanes, test pads, detonation pads, impact areas, and buffer zones with restricted access and exclusionary areas. (40 CFR 266.201)
Munitions and explosives of concern
distinguishes specific categories of military munitions that may pose unique explosives safety risks, such as UXO, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(e)(5); discarded military munitions, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(2); or munitions constituents (
e.g.,
TNT, RDX), as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(3), present in high enough concentrations to pose an explosive hazard.
Munitions constituents
means any materials originating from UXO, discarded military munitions, or other military munitions, including explosive and nonexplosive materials, and emission, degradation, or breakdown elements of such ordnance or munitions. (10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(3))
Munitions response
means response actions, including investigation, removal actions, and remedial actions, to address the explosives safety, human health, or environmental risks presented by UXO, discarded military munitions (DMM), or munitions constituents (MC), or to support a determination that no removal or remedial action is required.
Munitions response area (MRA)
means any area on a defense site that is known or suspected to contain UXO, DMM, or MC. Examples are former ranges and munitions burial areas. An MRA comprises one or more munitions response sites.
Munitions response site (MRS)
means a discrete location within an MRA that is known to require a munitions response.
Operational range
means a range that is under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of the Secretary of Defense and that is used for range activities, or although not currently being used for range activities, that is still considered by the Secretary to be a range and has not been put to a new use that is incompatible with range activities. (10 U.S.C. 101(e)(3))
Range
means a designated land or water area that is set aside, managed, and used for range activities of the Department of Defense. The term includes firing lines and positions, maneuver areas, firing lanes, test pads, detonation pads, impact areas, electronic scoring sites, buffer zones with restricted access, and exclusionary areas. The term also includes airspace areas designated for military use in accordance with regulations and procedures prescribed by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. (10 U.S.C. 101(e)(1)(A) and (B))
Range activities
means research, development, testing, and evaluation of military munitions, other ordnance, and weapons systems; and the training of members of the armed forces in the use and handling of military munitions, other ordnance, and weapons systems. (10 U.S.C. 101(3)(2))
Unexploded ordnance (UXO)
means military munitions that:
(1) Have been primed, fuzed, armed, or otherwise prepared for action;
(2) Have been fired, dropped, launched, projected, or placed in such a manner as to constitute a hazard to operations, installations, personnel, or material; and
(3) Remain unexploded, whether by malfunction, design, or any other cause. (10 U.S.C. 101(e)(5))
United States
means, in a geographic sense, the states, territories, and possessions and associated navigable waters, contiguous zones, and ocean waters of which the natural resources are under the exclusive management authority of the United States. (10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(10))
§ 179.4
Policy.
(a) In assigning a relative priority for response activities, the Department generally considers those MRSs posing the greatest hazard as being the highest priority for action. The priority assigned should be based on the overall conditions at each MRS, taking into consideration various factors relating to safety and environmental hazard potential.
(b) In addition to the priority assigned to an MRS, other considerations (
e.g.,
availability of specific equipment, intended reuse, stakeholder interest) can affect the sequence in which munitions response actions at a specific MRS are funded.
(c) It is Department policy to ensure that U.S. EPA, other federal agencies (as appropriate or required), state regulatory agencies, tribal governments, local restoration advisory boards or technical review committees, and local stakeholders are offered opportunities to participate in the application of the rule in this part and making sequencing recommendations.
§ 179.5
Responsibilities.
Each Component shall:
(a) Apply the rule in this part to each MRS under its administrative control when sufficient data are available to populate all the data elements within any or all of the three hazard evaluation modules that comprise the rule. Upon further delineation and characterization of an MRA into more than one MRS, Components shall reapply the rule to all MRSs within the MRA.
In such cases where data are not sufficient to populate one or two of the hazard evaluation modules (
e.g.,
there are no constituent sampling data for the Health Hazard Evaluation [HHE] module), Components will assign a priority based on the hazard evaluation modules evaluated and reapply the rule once sufficient data are available to apply the remaining hazard evaluation modules.
(b) Ensure that the total acreage of each MRA is evaluated using this rule (i.e., ensure the all MRSs within the MRA are evaluated).
(c) Ensure that EPA, other federal agencies (as appropriate or required), state regulatory agencies, tribal governments, local restoration advisory boards or technical review committees, local community stakeholders, and the current landowner (if the land is outside Department control) are offered opportunities as early as possible and throughout the process to participate in the application of the rule and making sequencing recommendations.
(1) To ensure EPA, other federal agency, state regulatory agencies, tribal governments, and local government officials are aware of the opportunity to participate in the application of the rule, the Component organization responsible for implementing a munitions response at the MRS shall notify the heads of these organizations (or their designated point of contact), as appropriate, seeking their involvement prior to beginning prioritization. Records of the notification will be placed in the Administrative Record and Information Repository for the MRS.
(2) Prior to beginning prioritization, the Component organization responsible for implementing a munitions response at the MRS shall publish an announcement in local community publications requesting information pertinent to prioritization or sequencing decisions to ensure the local community is aware of the opportunity to participate in the application of the rule.
(d) Establish a quality assurance panel of Component personnel to review, initially, all MRS prioritization decisions. Once the Department determines that its Components are applying the rule in a consistent manner and the rule's application leads to decisions that are representative of site conditions, the Department may establish a sampling-based approach for its Components to use for such reviews. This panel reviewing the priority assigned to an MRS shall not include any participant involved in applying the rule to that MRS. If the panel recommends a change that results in a different priority, the Component shall report, in the inventory data submitted to the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations
Environment) (ODUSD[I
E]), the rationale for this change. The Component shall also provide this rationale to the appropriate regulatory agencies and involved stakeholders for comment before finalizing the change.
(e) Following the panel review, submit the results of applying the rule along with the other inventory data that 10 U.S.C. 2710(c) requires be made publicly available, to the ODUSD(I
E). The ODUSD(I
E) shall publish this information in the report on environmental restoration activities for that fiscal year. If sequencing decisions result in action at an MRS with a lower MRS priority ahead of an MRS with a higher MRS priority, the Component shall provide specific justification to the ODUSD(I
E).
(f) Document in a Management Action Plan (MAP) or its equivalent all aspects of the munitions responses required at all MRSs for which that MAP is applicable. Department guidance requires that MAP be developed and maintained at an installation (or Formerly Used Defense Site [FUDS] property) level and address each site at that installation or FUDS. For the FUDS program, a statewide MAP may also be developed.
(g) Develop sequencing decisions at installations and FUDS with input from appropriate regulators and stakeholders (
e.g.,
community members of an installation's restoration advisory board or technical review committee), and document this development in the MAP. Final sequencing may be impacted by Component program management considerations. If the sequencing of any MRS is changed from the sequencing reflected in the current MAP,
the Component shall provide information to the appropriate regulators and stakeholders documenting the reasons for the sequencing change, and shall request their review and comment on that decision.
(h) Ensure that information provided by regulators and stakeholders that may influence the priority assigned to an MRS or sequencing decision concerning an MRS is included in the Administrative Record and the Information Repository.
(i) Review each MRS priority at least annually and update the priority as necessary to reflect new information. Reapplication of the rule is required under any of the following circumstances:
(1) Upon completion of a response action that changes site conditions in a manner that could affect the evaluation under this rule.
(2) To update or validate a previous evaluation at an MRS when new information is available.
(3) To update or validate the priority assigned where that priority has been previously assigned based on evaluation of only one or two of the three hazard evaluation modules.
(4) Upon further delineation and characterization of an MRA into MRSs.
(5) To categorize any MRS previously classified as “evaluation pending.”
§ 179.6
Procedures.
The rule in this part comprises the following three hazard evaluation modules.
(a) Explosive Hazard Evaluation (EHE) module.
(1) The EHE module provides a single, consistent, Department-wide approach for the evaluation of explosive hazards. This module is used when there is a known or suspected presence of an explosive hazard. The EHE module is composed of three factors, each of which has two to four data elements that are intended to assess the specific conditions at an MRS. These factors are:
(i)
Explosive hazard,
which has the data elements
Munitions Type
and
Source of Hazard
and constitutes 40 percent of the EHE module score. (See appendix A to this part, tables 1 and 2.)
(ii)
Accessibility,
which has the data elements
Location of Munitions, Ease of Access,
and
Status of Property
and constitutes 40 percent of the EHE module score. (See appendix A, tables 3, 4, and 5.)
(iii) Receptors, which has the data elements
Population Density, Population Near Hazard, Types of Activities/Structures,
and
Ecological and/or Cultural Resources
and constitutes 20 percent of the EHE module score. (See appendix A, tables 6, 7, 8, and 9.)
(2) Based on MRS-specific information, each data element is assigned a numeric score, and the sum of these score is the EHE module score. The EHE module score results in an MRS being placed into one of the following ratings. (See appendix A, table 10.)
(i)
EHE Rating A (Highest)
is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score from 92 to 100.
(ii)
EHE Rating B
is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score from 82 to 91.
(iii)
EHE Rating C
is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score from 71 to 81.
(iv)
EHE Rating D
is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score from 60 to 70.
(v)
EHE Rating E
is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score from 48 to 59.
(vi)
EHE Rating F
is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score from 38 to 47.
(vii)
EHE Rating G (Lowest)
is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score less than 38.
(3) There are also three other possible outcomes for the EHE module:
(i)
Evaluation pending.
This category is used when there are known or suspected UXO or DMM, but sufficient information is not available to populate the nine data elements of the EHE module.
(ii)
No longer required.
This category is reserved for MRSs that no longer require an assigned priority because the Department has conducted a response, all objectives set out in the decision document for the MRS have been achieved, and no further action, except for long-term management and recurring reviews, is required.
(iii)
No known or suspected explosive hazard.
This category is reserved for MRSs that do not require evaluation under the EHE module.
(4) The EHE module rating shall be considered with the CHE and HHE module ratings to determine the MRS priority.
(5) MRSs lacking information for determining an EHE module rating shall be programmed for additional study and evaluated as soon as sufficient data are available. Until an EHE module rating is assessed, MRSs shall be rated as “evaluation pending” for the EHE module.
(b) Chemical Warfare Materiel Hazard Evaluation (CHE) module. (1) The CHE module provides an evaluation of the chemical hazards associated with the physiological effects of CWM. The CHE module is used only when CWM are known or suspected of being present at an MRS. Like the EHE module, the CHE module has three factors, each of which has two to four data elements that are intended to assess the conditions at an MRS.
(i)
CWM hazard,
which has the data elements
CWM Configuration
and
Sources of CWM
and constitutes 40 percent of the CHE score. (See appendix A to this part, tables 11 and 12.)
(ii)
Accessibility,
which focuses on the potential for receptors to encounter the CWM known or suspected to be present on an MRS. This factor consists of three data elements,
Location of CWM, Ease of Access,
and
Status of Property,
and constitutes 40 percent of the CHE score. (See appendix A, tables 13, 14, and 15.)
(iii)
Receptor,
which focuses on the human and ecological populations that may be impacted by the presence of CWM. It has the data elements
Population Density, Population Near Hazard, Types of Activities/Structures,
and
Ecological and/or Cultural Resources
and constitutes 20 percent of the CHE score. (See appendix A, tables 16, 17, 18, and 19.)
(2) Similar to the EHE module, each data element is assigned a numeric score, and the sum of these scores (
i.e.
, the CHE module score) is used to determine the CHE rating. The CHE module score results in an MRS being placed into one of the following ratings. (See appendix A, table 20.)
(i)
CHE Rating A (Highest)
is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from 92 to 100.
(ii)
CHE Rating B
is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from 82 to 91.
(iii)
CHE Rating C
is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from 71 to 81.
(iv)
CHE Rating D
is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from 60 to 70.
(v)
CHE Rating E
is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from 48 to 59.
(vi)
CHE Rating F
is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from 38 to 47.
(vii)
CHE Rating G (Lowest)
is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score less than 38.
(3) There are also three other potential outcomes for the CHE module:
(i)
Evaluation pending.
This category is used when there are known or suspected CWM, but sufficient information is not available to populate the nine data elements of the CHE module.
(ii)
No longer required.
This category is reserved for MRSs that no longer require an assigned priority because the Department has conducted a response, all objectives set out in the decision document for the MRS have been achieved, and no further action, except for long-term management and recurring reviews, is required.
(iii)
No known or suspected CWM hazard.
This category is reserved for MRSs that do not require evaluation under the CHE module.
(4) The CHE rating shall be considered with the EHE module and HHE module ratings to determine the MRS priority.
(5) MRSs lacking information for assessing a CHE module rating shall be programmed for additional study and evaluated as soon as sufficient data are available. Until a CHE module rating is assigned, the MRS shall be rated as “evaluation pending” for the CHE module.
(c) Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) module.
(1) The HHE provides a consistent Department-wide approach for evaluating the relative risk to human health and the environment posed by MC. The HHE builds on the RRSE framework that is used in the Installation Restoration Program (IRP) and has been
modified to address the unique requirements of MRSs. The HHE module shall be used for evaluating the potential hazards posed by MC and other chemical contaminants. The HHE module is intended to evaluate MC at sites. Any incidental nonmunitions-related contaminants may be addressed incidental to a munitions response under the MMRP.
(2) The module has three factors:
(i) Contamination Hazard Factor (CHF), which indicates MC, and any nonmunitions-related incidental contaminants present; this factor contributes a level of High (H), Middle (M), or Low (L) based on Significant, Moderate, or Minimal contaminants present, respectively. (See appendix A to this part, table 21.)
(ii) Receptor Factor (RF), which indicates the receptors; this factor contributes a level of H, M, or L based on Identified, Potential, or Limited receptors, respectively. (See appendix A, table 21.)
(iii) Migration Pathway Factor (MPF), which indicates environmental migration pathways, and contributes a level of H, M, or L based on Evident, Potential or Confined pathways, respectively. (See appendix A, table 21.)
(3) The H, M, and L levels for the CHF, RF, and MPF are combined in a matrix to obtain composite three-letter combination levels that integrate considerations of all three factors. (See appendix A, table 22.)
(4) The three-letter combination levels are organized by frequency, and the resulting frequencies result in seven HHE ratings. (See appendix A, table 23.)
(i) HHE Rating A (Highest) is assigned to MRSs with an HHE combination level of high for all three factors.
(ii) HHE Rating B is assigned to MRSs with a combination level of high for CHF and RF and medium for MPF (HHM).
(iii) HHE Rating C is assigned to MRSs with a combination level of high for the CHF and RF and low for MPF (HHL), or high for CHF and medium for the RF and MPF (HMM).
(iv) HHE Rating D is assigned to MRSs with a combination level of high for the CHF, medium for the RF, and low for the MPF (HML), or medium for all three factors (MMM).
(v) HHE Rating E is assigned to MRSs with a combination level of high for the CHF and low for the RF and MPF (HLL), or medium for the CHF and RF and low for the MPF (MML).
(vi) HHE Rating F is assigned to MRSs with a combination level of medium for the CHF and low for the RF and MPF (MLL).
(vii) HHE Rating G (Lowest) is assigned to MRSs with a combination level of low for all three factors (LLL).
(5) The HHE three-letter combinations are replaced by the seven HHE ratings. (See appendix A, table 24.)
(6) There are also three other potential outcomes for the HHE module:
(i)
Evaluation pending.
This category is used when there are known or suspected MC, and any incidental nonmunitions-related contaminants present, but sufficient information is not available to determine the HHE module rating.
(ii)
No longer required.
This category is reserved for MRSs that no longer require an assigned MRS priority because the Department has conducted a response, all objectives set out in the decision document for the MRS have been achieved, and no further action, except for long-term management and recurring reviews, is required.
(iii)
No known or suspected munitions constituent hazard.
This rating is reserved for MRSs that do not require evaluation under the HHE module.
(7) The HHE module rating shall be considered with the EHE and CHE module ratings to determine the MRS priority.
(8) MRSs lacking information sufficient for assessing an HHE module rating shall be programmed for additional study and evaluated as soon as sufficient data are available. Until an HHR module rating is assigned, the MRS shall be classified as “evaluation pending” for the HHE module.
(d)
Determining the MRS priority.
(1) An MRS priority is determined based on integrating the ratings from the EHE, CHE, and HHE modules. Until all three hazard evaluation modules have been evaluated, the MRS priority shall be based on the results of the modules completed.
(2) Each MRS is assigned to one of eight MRS priorities based on the ratings of the three hazard evaluation modules, where Priority 1 indicates the highest potential hazard and Priority 8 the lowest potential hazard. Under the rule in this part, only MRSs with CWM can be assigned to Priority 1 and no MRS with CWM can be assigned to Priority 8. (See appendix A to this part, table 25.)
(3) An “evaluation pending” rating is used to indicate that an MRS requires further evaluation. This designation is only used when none of the three modules has a numerical rating (
i.e.
, 1 through 8) and at least one module is rated “evaluation pending.” The Department shall develop program metrics focused on reducing the number of MRSs with a status of “evaluating pending” for any of the three modules. (See appendix A, table 25.)
(4) A “no longer required” rating is used to indicate that an MRS no longer requires prioritization. The MRS will receive this rating when none of the three modules has a numerical (
i.e.
, 1 through 8) or an “evaluation pending” designation, and at least one of the modules is rated “no longer required.”
(5) A rating of “no known or suspected hazard” is used to indicate that an MRS has no known or expected hazard. This designation is used only when the hazard evaluation modules are rated as “no known or suspected explosive hazard,” “no known or suspected CWM hazard,” and “no known or suspected MC hazard.” (See appendix A, table 25.)
§ 179.7
Sequencing.
(a)
Sequencing considerations.
The sequencing of MRSs for action shall be based primarily on the MRS priority determined through applying the rule in this part. Generally, an MRS that presents a greater relative risk to human health, safety, or the environment will be addressed before an MRS that presents a lesser relative risk. Other factors, however, may warrant consideration when determining the sequencing for specific MRSs. In evaluating other factors in sequencing decisions, the Department will consider a broad range of issues. These other, or risk-plus factors, do not influence or change the MRS priority, but may influence the sequencing for action. Examples of factors that the Department may consider are:
(1) Concerns expressed by regulators or stakeholders.
(2) Cultural and social factors.
(3) Economic factors, including economic considerations pertaining to environmental justice issues, economies of scale, evaluation of total life cycle costs, and estimated valuations of long-term liabilities.
(4) Findings of health, safety, or ecological risk assessments or evaluations based on MRS-specific data.
(5) Reasonably anticipated future land use, especially when planning response actions, conducting evaluations of response alternatives, or establishing specific response action objectives.
(6) A community's reuse requirements at Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) installations.
(7) Specialized considerations of tribal trust lands (held in trust by the United States for the benefit of any tribe or individual). The United States holds the legal title to the land and the tribe holds the beneficial interest.
(8) Implementation and execution considerations (
e.g.
, funding availability; the availability of the necessary equipment and people to implement a particular action; examination of alternatives to responses that entail significant capital investments, a lengthy period of operation, or costly maintenance; alternatives to removal or treatment of contamination when existing technology cannot achieve established standards [
e.g.
, maximum contaminant levels]).
(9) Mission-driven requirements.
(10) The availability of appropriate technology (
e.g.
, technology to detect, discriminate, recover, and destroy UXO).
(11) Implementing standing commitments, including those in formal agreements with regulatory agencies, requirements for continuation of remedial action operations until response objectives are met, other long-term management activities, and program administration.
(12) Established program goals and initiatives.
(13) Short-term and long-term ecological effects and environmental impacts in general, including injuries to natural resources.
(b)
Procedures and documentation for sequencing decisions.
(1) Each installation or FUDS is required to develop and maintain a Management Action Plan (MAP) or its equivalent. Sequencing decisions, which will be documented in the MAP at military installations and FUDS, shall be developed with input from appropriate regulators and stakeholders (
e.g.
, community members of an installation's restoration advisory board or technical review committee). If the sequencing of an MRS is changed from the sequencing reflected in the current MAP, information documenting the reasons for the sequencing change will be provided for inclusion in the MAP. Notice of the change in the sequencing shall be provided to those regulators and stakeholders that provided input to the sequencing process.
(2) In addition to the information on prioritization, the Components shall ensure that information provided by regulators and stakeholders that may influence the sequencing of an MRS is included in the Administrative Record and the Information Repository.
(3) Components shall report the results of sequencing to ODUSD(I
E) (or successor organizations). ODUSD(I
E) shall compile the sequencing results reported by each Component and publish the sequencing in the report on environmental restoration activities for that fiscal year. If sequencing decisions result in action at an MRS with a lower MRS priority ahead of an MRS with a higher priority, specific justification shall be provided to the ODUSD(I
E).

§ 187.1
Purpose.
Executive Order 12114 provides the exclusive and complete requirement for taking account of considerations with respect to actions that do significant harm to the environment of places
outside
the United States. This part provides policy and procedures to enable Department of Defense (DoD) officials to be informed and take account of environmental considerations when authorizing or approving certain major Federal actions that do significant harm to the environment of places outside the United States. Its sole objective is to establish internal procedures to achieve this purpose, and nothing in it shall be construed to create a cause of action. Guidance for taking account of considerations with respect to the environment of places
within
the United States is set out in 32 CFR part 188 (under rev.) That guidance is grounded on legal and policy requirements different from those applicable to this part.
[44 FR 21786, Apr. 14, 1979. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 64481, Dec. 10, 1991]
§ 187.2
Applicability.
The provisions of this part apply to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Unified and Specified Commands, and the Defense Agencies (hereafter referred to as “DoD components”).
§ 187.3
Definitions.
(a)
Environment
means the natural and physical environment, and it excludes social, economic, and other environments. Social and economic effects do not give rise to any requirements under this part.
(b)
Federal Action
means an action that is implemented or funded directly by the United States Government. It does not include actions in which the United States participates in an advisory, information-gathering, representational, or diplomatic capacity but does not implement or fund the action; actions taken by a foreign government or in a foreign country in which the United States is a beneficiary of the action, but does not implement or fund the action; or actions in which foreign governments use funds derived indirectly from United States funding.
(c)
Foreign Nation
means any geographic area (land, water, and airspace) that is under the jurisdiction of one or more foreign governments; any area under military occupation by the United States alone or jointly with any other foreign government; and any area that is the responsibility of an international organization of governments. “Foreign nation” includes contiguous zones and fisheries zones of foreign nations. “Foreign government” in this context includes governments regardless of whether recognized by the United States, political factions, and organizations that exercise governmental power outside the United States.
(d)
Global Commons
are geographical areas that are outside the jurisdiction of any nation, and include the oceans outside territorial limits and Antarctica. Global commons do not include contiguous zones and fisheries zones of foreign nations.
(e)
Major Action
means an action of considerable importance involving substantial expenditures of time, money,
and resources, that affects the environment on a large geographic scale or has substantial environmental effects on a more limited geographical area, and that is substantially different or a significant departure from other actions, previously analyzed with respect to environmental considerations and approved, with which the action under consideration may be associated. Deployment of ships, aircraft, or other mobile military equipment is not a major action for purposes of this part.
(f)
United States
means all States, territories, and possessions of the United States; and all waters and airspace subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The territories and possessions of the United States include the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Wake Island, Midway Island, Guam, Palmyra Island, Johnston Atoll, Navassa Island, and Kingman Reef.
§ 187.4
Policy.
(a) Executive Order 12114 is based on the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States. The objective of the Order is to further foreign policy and national security interests while at the same time taking into consideration important environmental concerns.
(b) The Department of Defense acts with care in the global commons because the stewardship of these areas is shared by all the nations of the world. The Department of Defense will take account of environmental considerations when it acts in the global commons in accordance with procedures set out in Enclosure 1 and its attachment.
(c) The Department of Defense also acts with care within the jurisdiction of a foreign nation. Treaty obligations and the sovereignty of other nations must be respected, and restraint must be exercised in applying United States laws within foreign nations unless Congress has expressly provided otherwise. The Department of Defense will take account of environmental considerations in accordance with Enclosure 2 and its attachments when it acts in a foreign nation.
(d) Foreign policy considerations require coordination with the Department of State on communications with foreign governments concerning environmental agreements and other formal arrangements with foreign governments concerning environmental matters under this part.
Informal working-level communications and arrangements are not included in this coordination requirement. Consultation with the Department of State also is required in connection with the utilization of additional exemptions from this part as specified in paragraph C.3.b. of Enclosure 2. Coordination and consultation with the Department of State will be through the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs).
(e) Executive Order 12114, implemented by this part prescribes the exclusive and complete procedural measures and other actions to be taken by the Department of Defense to further the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act with respect to the environment outside the United States.

# Enclosure 1 to Part 187—Requirements for Environmental Considerations—Global Commons
A.
General.
This enclosure implements the requirements of Executive Order 12114 with respect to major Department of Defense actions that do significant harm to the environment of the global commons. The focus is not the place of the action, but the location of the environment with respect to which there is significant harm. The actions prescribed by this enclosure are the exclusive and complete requirement for taking account of environmental considerations with respect to Department of Defense activities that affect the global commons.
B.
Actions included.
The requirements of this enclosure apply only to major Federal actions that do significant harm to the environment of the global commons.
C.
Environmental Document Requirements
—1.
General.
When an action is determined to be a major Federal action that significantly harms the environment of the global commons, an environmental impact statement, as described below, will be prepared to enable the responsible decision-making official to be informed of pertinent environmental considerations. The statement may be a specific statement for the particular action, a generic statement covering the entire class of similar actions, or a program statement.
2.
Limitations on Actions.
Until the requirements of this enclosure have been met with respect to actions involving the global commons, no action concerning the proposal may be taken that does significant harm to the environment or limits the choice of reasonable alternatives.
3.
Emergencies.
Where emergency circumstances make it necessary to take an action that does significant harm to the environment without meeting the requirements of this enclosure, the DoD component concerned shall consult with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics). This includes actions that must be taken to promote the national defense or security and that cannot be delayed, and actions necessary for the protection of life or property.
4.
Combining Documents.
Environmental documents may be combined with other agency documents to reduce duplication. If an environmental impact statement for a particular action already exists, regardless of what Federal agency prepared it, no new statement is required by this part.
5.
Collective Statements.
Consideration should be given to the use of generic and program statements. Generic statements may include actions with relevant similarities such as common timing, environmental effects, alternatives, methods of implementation, or subject matter.
6.
Tiering.
Consideration should be given to tiering of environmental impact statements to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issue and to focus the issues. Tiering refers to the coverage of general matters in broader environmental impact statements, with succeeding narrower statements or environmental analyses that incorporate by reference the general discussion and concentrate only on the issues specific to the statement subsequently prepared.
7.
Lead Agency.
When one or more other Federal agencies are involved with the Department of Defense in an action or program, a lead agency may be designated to supervise the preparation of the environmental impact statement. In appropriate cases, more than one agency may act as joint lead agencies. The following factors should be considered in making the lead agency designation:
a. The magnitude of agency involvement;
b. Which agency or agencies have project approval and disapproval authority;
c. The expert capabilities concerning the environmental effects of the action;
d. The duration of agency involvement; and
e. The sequence of agency involvement.
8.
Categorical Exclusions.
The Department of Defense may provide categorical exclusions for actions that normally do not, individually or cumulatively, do significant harm to the environment. If an action is covered by a categorical exclusion no environmental assessment or environmental impact statement is required. Categorical exclusions will be established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics) and will be identified in Attachment 1 to this enclosure, to be entitled, “Categorical Exclusions—Global commons. “DoD components identifying recurring actions that have been determined, after analysis, not to do significant harm to the environment should submit recommendations for categorical exclusions and accompanying justification to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics).
9.
Environmental Assessments.
The purpose of an environmental assessment is to assist DoD components in determining whether an environmental impact statement is required for a particular action. The assessment should be brief and concise but should include sufficient information on which a determination can be made whether the proposed action is major and Federal, and whether it significantly harms the environment of the global commons. As a minimum, the assessment should include consideration of the need for the proposed action and the environmental effect of the proposed action. The environmental assessment will be made available to the public in the United States upon request, but there is no requirement that it be distributed for public comment.
D.
Environmental Impact Statements.
1.
General.
Environmental impact statements will be concise and no longer than necessary to permit an informed consideration of the environmental effects of the proposed action on the global commons and the reasonable alternatives. If an action requiring an environmental impact statement also has effects on the environment of a foreign nation or on a resource designated as one of global importance, the statement need not consider or be prepared with respect to these effects. The procedures for considering these effects are set out in Enclosure 2, of this part.
2.
Draft Statement.
Environmental impact statements will be prepared in two stages and may be supplemented. The first, or draft statement, should be sufficiently complete to permit meaningful analysis and comment. The draft statement will be made available to the public, in the United States, for comment. The Department of State, the council on environmental Quality, and other interested Federal agencies will be informed of the availability of the draft statement and will be afforded an opportunity to comment. Contacts with foreign governments are discussed in § 187.4(d) and subsection D.11. of this enclosure.
3.
Final statement.
Final statements will consider, either individually or collectively, substantive comments received on the draft statement. The final statement will be made available to the public in the United States.
4.
Supplemental statement.
Supplements to the draft or final statement should be used when substantial changes to the proposed action are made relative to the environment of the global commons or when significant new information or circumstances, relevant to environmental concerns, bears on the proposed action or its environmental effects on the global commons. Supplemental statements will be circulated for comment as in subsection 2. of this enclosure unless alternative procedures are approved by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics).
5.
Statement content.
The statement will include: A section on consideration of the purpose of and need for the proposed action; a section on the environmental consequences of the proposed action and reasonable alternatives; a section that provides a succinct description of the environment of the global commons affected by the proposed action and reasonable alternatives; and a section that analyzes, in comparative form, the environmental effects on the global commons of the proposed action and reasonable alternatives.
6.
Incomplete Information.
The statement should indicate when relevant information is missing due to unavailability or scientific uncertainty.
7.
Hearings.
Public hearings are not required. consideration should be given in appropriate cases to holding or sponsoring public hearings. Factors in this consideration include: Foreign relations sensitivities; whether the hearings would be an infringement or create the appearance of infringement on the sovereign responsibilities of another government; requirements of domestic and foreign governmental confidentiality; requirements of national security; whether meaningful information could be obtained through hearings; time considerations; and
requirements for commercial confidentiality. There is no requirement that all factors listed in this section be considered when one or more factors indicate that public hearings would not produce a substantial net benefit to those responsible for authorizing or approving the proposed action.
8.
Decision.
Relevant environmental documents developed in accordance with this enclosure will accompany the proposal for action through the review process to enable officials responsible for authorizing or approving the proposed action to be informed and to take account of environmental considerations. One means of making an appropriate record with respect to this requirement is for the decision-maker to sign and date a copy of the environmental impact statement indicating that it has been considered in the decision-making process. Other means of making an appropriate record are also acceptable.
9.
Timing.
No decision on the proposed action may be made until the later of 90 days after the draft statement has been made available and notice thereof published in the
Federal Register,
or 30 days after the final statement has been made available and notice thereof published in the
Federal Register.
The 90-day period and the 30-day period may run concurrently. Not less than 45 days may be allowed for public comment. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics) may, upon a showing of probable important adverse effect on national security or foreign policy, reduce the 30-day, 45-day, and 90-day periods.
10.
Classified Information.
Environmental assessments and impact statements that address classified proposals will be safeguarded and classified information will be restricted from public dissemination in accordance with Department of Defense procedures (32 CFR part 159) established for such information under Executive Order 12065. The requirements of that Executive Order take precedence over any requirement of disclosure in this part. Only unclassified portions of environmental documents may be disseminated to the public.
11.
Foreign Governments.
Consideration will be given to whether any foreign government should be informed of the availability of environmental documents. Communications with foreign governments concerning environmental agreements and other formal arrangements with foreign governments concerning environmental matters under this part will be coordinated with the Department of State. Informal, working-level communications and arrangements are not included in this coordination requirement. Coordination with the Department of State will be through the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs).

# Enclosure 2 to Part 187—Requirements for Environmental Considerations—Foreign Nations and Protected Global Resources
A.
General.
This enclosure implements the requirements of Executive Order 12114 to provide for procedural and other actions to be taken to enable officials to be informed of pertinent environmental considerations when authorizing or approving certain major Department of Defense actions that do significant harm to the environment of a foreign nation or to a protected global resource.
B.
Actions included.
1. The requirements of this enclosure apply only to the following actions:
a. Major Federal actions that significantly harm the environment of a foreign nation that is not involved in the action. The involvement of the foreign nation may be directly by participation with the United States in the action, or it may be in conjunction with another participating nation. The focus of this category is on the geographical location of the environmental harm and not on the location of the action.
b. Major Federal actions that are determined to do significant harm to the environment of a foreign nation because they provide to that nation: (1) A product, or involve a physical project that produces a principal product, emission, or effluent, that is prohibited or strictly regulated by Federal law in the United States because its toxic effects on the environment create a serious public health risk; or (2) a physical project that is prohibited or strictly regulated in the United States by Federal law to protect the environment against radioactive substances. Included in the category of “prohibited or strictly regulated” are the following: asbestos, vinyl chloride, acrylonitrile, isocyanates, polychlorinated biphenyls, mercury, beryllium, arsenic, cadmium, and benzene.
c. Major Federal actions outside the United States that significantly harm natural or ecological resources of global importance designated for protection by the President or, in the case of such a resource protected by international agreement binding on the United States, designated for protection by the Secretary of State. Such determinations by the President or the Secretary of State to be listed in Attachment 1 to this enclosure, entitled, “Protected Global Resources”.
2. The actions prescribed by this enclosure are the exclusive and complete requirement
for taking account of environmental considerations with respect to Federal actions that do significant harm to the environment of foreign nations and protected global resources as described in subsection B.1., of this enclosure. No action is required under this enclosure with respect to Federal actions that affect only the environment of a participating or otherwise involved foreign nation and that do not involve providing products or physical projects producing principal products, emissions, or effluents that are prohibited or strictly regulated by Federal law in the United States, or resources of global importance that have been designated for protection.
C.
Environmental Document Requirements.
1.
General.
a. There are two types of environmental documents officials shall use in taking account of environmental considerations for actions covered by this enclosure:
(1) Environmental studies—bilateral or multilateral environmental studies, relevant or related to the proposed action, by the United States and one or more foreign nations or by an international body or organization in which the United States is a member or participant; and
(2) Environmental reviews—concise reviews of the environmental issues involved that are prepared unilaterally by the United States.
b. This section identifies the procedures for the preparation of environmental studies or reviews when required by this enclosure and the exceptions from the requirement to prepare environmental studies or reviews. If an environmental document already exists for a particular action, regardless of what Federal agency prepared it, no new document is required by this enclosure.
2.
Lead Agency.
When one or more other Federal agencies are involved with the Department of Defense in an action or program, a lead agency may be designated to supervise the preparation of environmental documentation. In appropriate cases, more than one agency may act as joint lead agencies. The following factors should be considered in making the lead agency designation:
a. The magnitude of agency involvement;
b. Which agency or agencies have project approval and disapproval authority;
c. The expert capabilities concerning the environmental effects of the action;
d. The duration of agency involvement; and
e. The sequence of agency involvement.
3.
Exemptions.
There are general exemptions from the requirements of this enclosure provided by Executive Order 12114, and the Secretary of Defense has the authority to approve additional exemptions.
a.
General Exemptions.
The following actions are exempt from the procedural and other requirements of this enclosure under general exemptions established for all agencies by Executive Order 12114:
(1) Actions that the DoD component concerned determines do not do significant harm to the environment outside the United States or to a designated resource of global importance.
(2) Actions taken by the President. These include: Signing bills into law; signing treaties and other international agreements; the promulgation of Executive Orders; Presidential proclamations; and the issuance of Presidental decisions, instructions, and memoranda. This includes actions taken within the Department of Defense to prepare or assist in preparing recommendations, advice, or information for the President in connection with one of these actions by the President. It does not include actions taken within the Department of Defense to implement or carry out these instruments and issuances after they are promulgated by the President.
(3) Actions taken by or pursuant to the direction of the President or a cabinet officer in the course of armed conflict. The term “armed conflict” refers to: hostilities for which Congress has declared war or enacted a specific authorization for the use of armed forces; hostilities or situations for which a report is prescribed by section 4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, 50 U.S.C.A. 1543(a)(1) (Supp. 1978); and other actions by the armed forces that involve defensive use or introduction of weapons in situations where hostilities occur or are expected. This exemption applies as long as the armed conflict continues.
(4) Actions taken by or pursuant to the direction of the President or a cabinet officer when the national security or national interest is involved. The determination that the national security or national interest is involved in actions by the Department of Defense must be made in writing by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics).
(5) The activities of the intelligence components utilized by the Secretary of Defense under Executive Order 12036, 43 FR 3674 (1978). These components include the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the offices for the collection of specialized intelligence through reconnaissance programs, the Army Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, the Office of Naval Intelligence, and the Air Force Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence.
(6) The decisions and actions of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), the Defense Security Assistance Agency, and the other responsible offices within DoD components with respect to arms transfers to foreign nations. The term “arms transfers” includes the grant, loan, lease, exchange, or sale of
defense articles or defense services to foreign governments or international organizations, and the extension or guarantee of credit in connection with these transactions.
(7) Votes and other actions in international conferences and organizations. This includes all decisions and actions of the United States with respect to representation of its interests at international organizations, and at multilateral conferences, negotiations, and meetings.
(8) Disaster and emergency relief actions.
(9) Actions involving export licenses, export permits, or export approvals, other than those relating to nuclear activities. This includes: Advice provided by DoD components to the Department of State with respect to the issuance of munitions export licenses under section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 (1976); advice provided by DoD components to the Department of Commerce with respect to the granting of export licenses under the Export Administration Act of 1969, 50 U.S.C. App. 2401-2413 (1970
Supp. V 1975); and direct exports by the Department of Defense of defense articles and services to foreign governments and international organizations that are exempt from munitions export licenses under section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 (1976). The term “export approvals” does not mean or include direct loans to finance exports.
(10) Actions relating to nuclear activities and nuclear material, except actions providing to a foreign nation a nuclear production or utilization facility, as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or a nuclear waste management facility.
b.
Additional Exemptions.
The Department of Defense is authorized under Executive Order 12114 to establish additional exemptions that apply only to the Department's operations. There are two types of additional exemptions: Case-by-case and class.
(1)
Case-by-Case Exemptions.
Exemptions other than those specified above may be required because emergencies, national security considerations, exceptional foreign policy requirements, or other special circumstances preclude or are inconsistent with the preparation of environmental documentation and the taking of other actions prescribed by this enclosure. The following procedures apply for approving these exemptions:
(a)
Emergencies.
This category includes actions that must be taken to promote the national defense or security and that cannot be delayed, and actions necessary for the protection of life or property. The heads of the DoD components are authorized to approve emergency exemptions on a case-by-case basis. The Department of Defense is required to consult as soon as feasible with the Department of State and the Council on Environmental Quality with respect to emergency exemptions. The requirement to consult as soon as feasible is not a requirement of prior consultation. A report of the emergency action will be made by the DoD component head to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics), who, with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), shall undertake the necessary consultations.
(b)
Other Circumstances.
National security considerations, exceptional foreign policy requirements, and other special circumstances not identified in paragraph C.3.a. of this enclosure, may preclude or be inconsistent with the preparation of environmental documentation. In these circumstances, the head of the DoD component concerned is authorized to exempt a particular action from the environmental documentation requirements of this enclosure after obtaining the prior approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics), who, with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), shall consult, before approving the exemption, with the Department of State and the Council on Environmental Quality. The requirement for prior consultation is not a requirement for prior approval.
(2)
Class Exemptions.
Circumstances may exist where a class exemption for a group of related actions is more appropriate than a specific exemption. Class exemptions may be established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics), who, with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), shall consult, before approving the exemption, with the Department of State and the Council on Environmental Quality. The requirement for prior consultation is not a requirement for prior approval. Requests for class exemptions will be submitted by the head of the DoD component concerned to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics) after coordination with other interested DoD components. Notice of the establishment of a class exemption will be issued as Attachment 2 to this enclosure to be entitled, “Class Exemptions—Foreign Nations and Protected Global Resources.”
4.
Categorical Exclusions.
The Department of Defense is authorized by Executive Order 12114 to provide for categorical exclusions. A categorical exclusion is a category of actions that normally do not, individually or cumulatively, do significant harm to the environment. If an action is covered by a categorical exclusion, no environmental document is required. Categorical exclusions will be established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics), and will be identified in Attachment 3 to this enclosure to be entitled, “Categorical Exclusions—Foreign Nations and Protected Global
Resources.” DoD components identifying recurring actions that have been determined, after analysis, not to do significant harm to the environment should submit requests for categorical exclusions and accompanying justification to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics).
D.
Environmental studies.
1.
General.
Environmental studies are one of two alternative types of documents to be used for actions described by section B. of this enclosure.
a. An environmental study is an analysis of the likely environmental consequences of the action that is to be considered by DoD components in the decision-making process. It includes a review of the affected environment, significant actions taken to avoid environmental harm or otherwise to better the environment, and significant environmental considerations and actions by the other participating nations, bodies, or organizations.
b. An environmental study is a cooperative action and not a unilateral action undertaken by the United States. It may be bilateral or multilateral, and it is prepared by the United States in conjunction with one or more foreign nations, or by an international body or organization in which the United States is a member or participant. The environmental study, because it is prepared as a cooperative undertaking, may be best suited for use with respect to actions that provide strictly regulated or prohibited products or projects to a foreign nation (B.l.b.) and actions that affect a protected global resource (B.l.c.).
2.
Department of State Coordination.
Communications with foreign governments concerning environmental studies and other formal arrangements with foreign governments concerning environmental matters under this directive will be coordinated with the Department of State. Informal, working-level communications and arrangements are not included in this coordination requirement. Coordination with the Department of State will be through the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs).
3.
Whether to Prepare an Environmental Study.
The judgment whether the action is one that would do significant harm to one of the environments covered by this enclosure normally will be made in consultation with concerned foreign governments or organizations. If a negative decision is made, the file will be documented with a record of that decision and the decision-makers who participated. If a decision is made to prepare a study then, except as provided by this enclosure, no action concerning the proposal may be taken that would do significant harm to the environment until the study has been completed and the results considered.
4.
Content of the Study.
The document is a study of the environmental aspects of the proposed action to be considered in the decision-making process. The precise content of each study must be flexible because of such considerations as the sensitivity of obtaining information from foreign governments, the availability of useful and understandable information, and other factors identified under “Limitations,” (subsection D.6., of this enclosure). The study should, however, include consideration of the following:
a. A general review of the affected environment;
b. The predicted effect of the action on the environment;
c. Significant known actions taken by governmental entities with respect to the proposed action to protect or improve the environment; and
d. If no actions are being taken to protect or enhance the environment, whether the decision not to do so was made by the affected foreign government or international organization.
5.
Distribution of the Study.
Except as provided under “Limitations,” (subsection D.6., of this enclosure), and except where classified information is involved, environmental studies will be made available to the Department of State, the Council on Environmental Quality, other interested Federal agencies, and, on request, to the public in the United States. Interested foreign governments also may be informed of the studies, subject to the “Limitations” (subsection D.6., of this enclosure) and controls on classified information, and furnished copies of the documents. No distribution is required prior to the preparation of the final version of the study or prior to taking the action that caused the study to be prepared.
6.
Limitations.
The requirements with respect to the preparation, content, and distribution of environmental studies in the international context must remain flexible. The specific procedures must be determined on a case-by-case basis and may be modified where necessary to:
a. Enable the component to act promptly. Considerations such as national security and foreign government involvement may require prompt action that must take precedence in the environmental review process;
b. Avoid adverse impacts on relations between the United States and foreign governments and international organizations;
c. Avoid infringement or the appearance of infringement on the sovereign responsibilities of another government. The collection of information and the preparation and distribution of environmental documentation for actions in which another nation is involved, or with respect to the environment and resources of another nation, unless done with proper regard to the sovereign authority of that nation, may be viewed by that nation as an interference in its internal affairs
and its responsibility to evaluate requirements with respect to the environment;
d. Ensure consideration of:
(1) Requirements of governmental confidentiality. This refers to the need to protect sensitive foreign affairs information and information received from another government with the understanding that it will be protected from disclosure regardless of its classification;
(2) National security requirements. This refers to the protection of classified information and other national security interests;
(3) Availability of meaningful information. Information on the environment of foreign nations may be unavailable, incomplete, or not susceptible to meaningful evaluation, particularly where the affected foreign nation is not a participant in the analysis. This may reduce or change substantially the normal content of the environmental study;
(4) The extent of the participation of the DoD component concerned and its ability to affect the decision made. The utility of the environmental analysis and the need for an in-depth review diminishes as DoD's role and control over the decision lessens; and
(5) International commercial, commercial confidentiality, competitive, and export promotion factors. This refers to the requirement to protect domestic and foreign trade secrets and confidential business information from disclosure. Export promotion factors includes the concept of not unnecessarily hindering United States exports.
7.
Classified Information.
Classified information will be safeguarded from disclosure in accordance with the Department of Defense procedures (32 CFR 159) established for such information under Executive Order 12065. The requirements of that Executive Order take precedence over any requirement of disclosure in this directive.
E.
Environmental Reviews.
1.
General.
Environmental reviews are the second of the two alternative types of documents to be used for actions covered by section B. of this enclosure.
a. An environmental review is a survey of the important environmental issues involved. It includes identification of these issues, and a review of what if any consideration has been or can be given to the environmental aspects by the United States and by any foreign government involved in taking the action.
b. An environmental review is prepared by the DoD component concerned either unilaterally or in conjunction with another Federal agency. While an environmental review may be used for any of the actions identified by section B., it may be uniquely suitable, because it is prepared unilaterally by the United States, to actions that affect the environment of a nation not involved in the undertaking (B.l.a.).
2.
Department of State Coordination.
Communications with foreign governments concerning environmental agreements and other formal arrangements with foreign governments concerning environmental matters under this enclosure will be coordinated with the Department of State. Informal working-level communications and arrangements are not included in this coordination requirement. Coordination with the Department of State will be through the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs).
3.
Whether to Prepare an Environmental Review.
Sufficient information will be gathered, to the extent it is reasonably available, to permit an informed judgment as to whether the proposed action would do significant harm to the environments covered by this enclosure. If a negative decision is made, a record will be made of that decision and its basis. If a decision is made to prepare a review, then, except as provided by this enclosure, no action concerning the proposal may be taken that would do significant environmental harm until the review has been completed.
4.
Content of the Review.
An environmental review is a survey of the important environmental issues associated with the proposed action that is to be considered by the DoD component concerned in the decision-making process. It does not include all possible environmental issues and it does not include the detailed evaluation required in an environmental impact statement under Enclosure 1 of this part. There is no foreign government or international organization participation in its preparation, and the content therefore may be circumscribed because of the availability of information and because of foreign relations sensitivities. Other factors affecting the content are identified under “Limitations,” (subsection E.6., of this enclosure). To the extent reasonably practical the review should include consideration of the following:
a. A statement of the action to be taken including its timetable, physical features, general operating plan, and other similar broad-gauge descriptive factors;
b. Identification of the important environmental issues involved;
c. The aspects of the actions taken or to be taken by the DoD component that ameliorate or minimize the impact on the environment; and
d. The actions known to have been taken or to be planned by the government of any participating and affected foreign nations that will affect environmental considerations.
5.
Distribution.
Except as provided under “Limitations,” (subsection E.6., of this enclosure), and except where classified information is involved, environmental reviews will be made available to the Department of
State, the Council on Environmental Quality, other interested Federal agencies, and, on request, to the public in the United States. Interested foreign governments also may be informed of the reviews and, subject to the “Limitations” (subsection E.6., of this enclosure) and controls on classified information, will be furnished copies of the documents on request. This provision for document distribution is not a requirement that distribution be made prior to taking the action that is the subject of the review.
6.
Limitations.
The requirements with respect to the preparation, content, and distribution of environmental reviews in the international context must remain flexible. The specific procedures must be determined on a case-by-case basis and may be modified where necessary to:
a. Enable the component to act promptly. Considerations such as national security and foreign government involvement may require prompt action that must take precedence in the environmental review process;
b. Avoid adverse impacts on relations between the United States and foreign governments and international organizations;
c. Avoid infringement or the appearance of infringement on the sovereign responsibilities of another government. The collection of information and the preparation and distribution of environmental documentation for actions in which another nation is involved or with respect to the environment and resources of another nation, unless done with proper regard to the sovereign authority of that nation, may be viewed by that nation as an interference in its internal affairs and its prerogative to evaluate requirements with respect to the environment; and
d. Ensure consideration of:
(1) Requirements of governmental confidentiality. This refers to the need to protect sensitive foreign affairs information and information received from another government with the understanding that it will be protected from disclosure regardless of its classification;
(2) National security requirements. This refers to the protection of classified information;
(3) Availability of meaningful information. Information on the environment of foreign nations may be unavailable, incomplete, or not susceptible to meaningful evaluation, and this may reduce or change substantially the normal content of the environmental review;
(4) The extent of the participation of the DoD component concerned and its ability to affect the decision made. The utility of the environmental analysis and the need for an in-depth review diminishes as the role of the Department of Defense and control over the decision lessens; and
(5) International commercial, commercial confidentiality, competitive, and export promotion factors. This refers to the requirements to protect domestic and foreign trade secrets and confidential business information from disclosure. Export promotion factors includes the concept of not unnecessarily hindering United States exports.
7.
Classified Information.
Classified information will be safeguarded from disclosure in accordance with the DoD procedures (32 CFR 159) established for such information under Executive Order 12065. The requirements of that Executive Order take precedence over any requirement of disclosure in this part.

Conducting project-specific laboratory approvals
—(1)
General.
The DoD EDQW will use the procedures in this paragraph to conduct project-specific laboratory approvals for specific tests in the rare instances when DoD is unable to identify a DoD ELAP-accredited laboratory capable of providing the required services. This will ensure that competent laboratories are used to support DoD environmental projects. Examples of these rare instances include:
(i) The required method, matrix, or analyte is not included in the scope of accreditation for any existing DoD ELAP-accredited laboratories.
(ii) The required method, matrix, and analyte combination is included in the scope of accreditation for an existing accredited laboratory; however, the laboratory is unable to meet one or more of the project-specific measurement performance criteria.
(2)
Limitations.
(i) Project-specific laboratory approvals are not to be used as substitutes for the required DoD ELAP-accreditation.
(ii) The DoD EDQW will not perform project-specific laboratory approvals in cases where one or more DoD ELAP-accredited laboratories capable of meeting project-specific requirements are available.
(iii) The project-specific laboratory approval is a one-time approval, the specific terms of which will be outlined in the approval notice issued by the DoD EDQW.
(3)
Personnel qualifications.
DoD personnel and contractors assessing laboratories for the purpose of performing project-specific laboratory approvals must meet the government chemist or contractor project chemist requirements contained in USD(AT
L) Memorandum, “Acquisitions Involving Environmental Sampling or Testing Services.” Personnel must have a working knowledge of the DoD QSM requirements and be familiar with required environmental test methods and instrumentation.
(4)
Procedures.
(i) If a project-specific laboratory approval is requested, the DoD EDQW will request and review a copy of the project's quality assurance project plan (QAPP).
(ii) If, after review of the QAPP, the DoD EDQW determines that an existing DoD ELAP-accredited laboratory is available to provide the required services, the laboratory contact information will be provided to the project manager requesting assistance.
(iii) If, after review of the QAPP, the DoD EDQW determines that no existing DoD ELAP-accredited laboratory is available to provide the required services, the DoD EDQW will:
(A) Work with the project team to determine whether the use of alternative procedures by an existing DoD ELAP-accredited laboratory is feasible;
(B) Determine if the required services can be added to the scope of accreditation of an existing DoD ELAP-accredited laboratory; or
(C) Work with the project team to identify a candidate laboratory for project-specific laboratory approval.
(iv) If a project-specific approval is needed, the DoD EDQW will:
(A) Determine the type of assessment required (on-site, document review, etc.).
(B) Determine if additional funding is required to support the assessment. If additional funding is required, the DoD EDQW will provide a cost estimate and work with the project manager to establish funding.
(v) If the DoD EDQW determines that a project-specific laboratory approval is warranted and resources (including funding and technical expertise) are available to support the assessment, the DoD EDQW chair will coordinate with the EDQW component principals to appoint an assessment team with appropriate technical backgrounds.
(vi) The DoD EDQW chair will designate an assessment team leader. The assessment team leader will:
(A) Request the documentation needed to perform the assessment.
(B) Assign responsibilities for individual members of the assessment team, if appropriate.

Handling complaints
—(1)
General.
The DoD EDQW will use the procedures in this paragraph to handle complaints concerning the processes established in the DoD ELAP or the DoD QSM. The DoD EDQW will document and resolve complaints promptly through the appropriate channels, consistently and objectively, and identify and implement any necessary corrective action arising from complaints. Complaints generally fall into one of four categories:
(i) Complaints by any party against an accredited laboratory.
(ii) Complaints by any party against an AB.
(iii) Complaints by any party concerning any assessor acting on behalf of the AB.
(iv) Complaints by any party against the DoD ELAP itself.
(2)
Limitations.
The procedures in this paragraph:
(i) Do not address appeals by laboratories regarding accreditation decisions by ABs. Appeals to decisions made by ABs regarding the accreditation status of any laboratory must be filed directly with the AB in accordance with agreements in place between the laboratory and the AB.
(ii) Are not designed to handle allegations of unethical or illegal actions as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.
(iii) Do not address complaints involving contractual requirements between a laboratory and its client. All contracting issues must be resolved with the contracting officer.
(3)
Procedures.
(i) All complaints must be filed in writing to the EDQW chair. All complaints must provide the basis for the complaint (
i.e.,
the specific process or requirement in the DoD ELAP or the DoD QSM that has not been satisfied or is believed to need changing) and supporting documentation, including descriptions of attempts to resolve the complaint by the laboratory or the AB.
(ii) Upon receipt of the complaint, the DoD EDQW chair will assign a unique identifier to the complaint, send a notice of acknowledgement to the complainant, and forward a copy of
the complaint to the EDQW component principals.
(iii) In consultation with the EDQW component principals, the DoD EDQW chair will make a preliminary determination of the validity of the complaint. Following preliminary review, the actions available to the DoD EDQW chair include:
(A) If the DoD EDQW chair determines the complaint should be handled directly between the complainant and the subject of the complaint, the DoD EDQW will refer the complaint to the laboratory, or AB, as appropriate. The DoD EDQW will notify the complainant of the referral, but will take no further action with respect to investigation of the complaint. The subject of the complaint will be expected to respond to the complainant in accordance with their established procedures and timelines. A copy of the response will be provided to the DoD EDQW.
(B) If insufficient information has been provided to determine whether the complaint has merit, the DoD EDQW will return the complaint to the complainant with a request for additional supporting documentation.
(C) If the complaint appears to have merit and the parties to the complaint have been unable to resolve it, the DoD EDQW will investigate the complaint and recommend actions for its resolution.
(D) If available information does not support the complaint, the DoD EDQW may reject the complaint.
(E) If the complaint alleges inappropriate laboratory practices or other misconduct, the DoD EDQW chair will consult legal counsel to determine the recommended course of action.
(iv) In all cases, the DoD EDQW will notify the complainant and any other entity involved in the complaint and explain the response of the EDQW to the complaint.
(4)
Continual improvement.
The DoD EDQW will look into root causes and trends in complaints to help identify actions that should be taken by the DoD EDQW, or any parties involved with DoD ELAP, to prevent recurrence of problems that led to the complaints.
(5)
Data and records management.
Through NAVSEASYSCOM, the DoD EDQW will maintain copies of all complaint documentation in accordance with Secretary of the Navy Manual M-5210.1.
