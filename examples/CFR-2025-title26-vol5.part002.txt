If there is excess asset basis with respect to a foreign acquired corporation and the condition described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section is satisfied, then, except as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, an exchanging shareholder to which paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section applies must compute the all earnings and profits amount with respect to its stock in the foreign acquired corporation as if, immediately before the inbound nonrecognition transaction, the foreign acquired corporation had received a distribution of property from a foreign subsidiary under section 301 in an amount equal to the specified earnings. In addition, the deemed distribution described in the preceding sentence is treated as occurring for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(1), the amount of the distribution from a foreign subsidiary is equal to the amount of earnings and profits of that foreign subsidiary that is designated as specified earnings under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. In the case of a foreign subsidiary the stock of which is not held directly by the foreign acquired corporation, the distribution is treated as being made through any intermediate owners, or directly from any constructively owned foreign subsidiaries, where applicable. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(1), references to the foreign acquired corporation, S, and a foreign subsidiary include any predecessor corporation.
(i) S previously acquired in exchange for property stock or securities of the foreign acquired corporation in connection with a triangular reorganization described in § 1.358-6(b)(2), and the foreign acquired corporation and S did not make adjustments that have the effect of a distribution of property from S to the foreign acquired corporation under § 1.367(b)-10(b)(1).
(ii) The excess asset basis is attributable, directly or indirectly, to property previously provided by a foreign subsidiary of the foreign acquired corporation in connection with a transaction not described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section and undertaken
with a principal purpose to create such excess asset basis.
(2)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this paragraph (g).
(i)
Excess asset basis.
The term
excess asset basis
means, with respect to a foreign acquired corporation, the amount by which the inside asset basis of that corporation exceeds the sum of the following amounts:
(A) The earnings and profits of the foreign acquired corporation attributable to its outstanding stock. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A), such earnings and profits are determined under the principles of § 1.367(b)-2(d) but without regard to whether the exchanging shareholder is described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or whether the exchanging shareholder is a U.S. person or a foreign person. Such earnings and profits include amounts described in section 1248(d)(3) or (4).
(B) The aggregate basis in the outstanding stock of the foreign acquired corporation determined immediately before the nonrecognition transaction described in paragraph (a) of this section (the inbound nonrecognition transaction) and therefore without regard to any basis increase described in § 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii) resulting from such inbound nonrecognition transaction.
(C) The aggregate amount of liabilities of the foreign acquired corporation that are assumed (determined under the principles of section 357(d)) by the domestic acquiring corporation in the inbound nonrecognition transaction.
(ii)
Foreign subsidiary.
The term
foreign subsidiary
means, with respect to a foreign acquired corporation, a foreign corporation with respect to which the foreign acquired corporation satisfies the ownership requirements of section 1248(c)(2)(B) but for this purpose treating the foreign acquired corporation as the United States person referred to in section 1248(c)(2)(B).
(iii)
Inbound nonrecognition transaction.
The term
inbound nonrecognition transaction
has the meaning set forth in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(iv)
Inside asset basis.
The term
inside asset basis
means, with respect to a foreign acquired corporation, the aggregate of the adjusted basis of all the assets of that corporation in the hands of the domestic acquiring corporation determined immediately after the inbound nonrecognition transaction.
(v)
Lower-tier earnings.
The term
lower-tier earnings
means, with respect to a foreign acquired corporation, the sum of the earnings and profits (including deficits) of each foreign subsidiary.
(vi)
Property.
The term
property
has the same meaning as in § 1.367(b)-10(a)(3)(ii).
(vii)
S.
The term
S
has the same meaning as in § 1.367(b)-10(a)(3)(i).
(viii)
Specified earnings.
The term
specified earnings
means, with respect to a foreign acquired corporation, the lesser of the following amounts:
(A) Lower-tier earnings; and
(B) The excess asset basis of the foreign acquired corporation.
(3)
Designation of specified earnings.
If lower-tier earnings exceed specified earnings, then the portion of lower-tier earnings that is designated as specified earnings is determined by reference to the earnings and profits of each foreign subsidiary on a pro rata basis in proportion to each foreign subsidiary's share of lower-tier earnings.
(4)
Anti-abuse rule.
Appropriate adjustments are made pursuant to this section if a transaction is engaged in with a view to avoid the purposes of this paragraph (g). For example, if a transaction is engaged in with a view to reduce excess asset basis, including by increasing the basis in the stock of the foreign acquired corporation without a corresponding increase in the basis of the assets of the foreign acquired corporation, that increase in the basis in the stock of the foreign acquired corporation will be disregarded for purposes of computing excess asset basis.
(5)
Prohibition against affirmative use.
This paragraph (g) does not apply to an inbound nonrecognition transaction if a transaction described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section was entered into with a principal purpose of subjecting the inbound nonrecognition transaction to this paragraph (g). For example, this paragraph (g) will not apply to an inbound nonrecognition transaction if a taxpayer engaged in a transaction described in paragraph (g)(1) of this
section with a principal purpose of accessing tax attributes of lower-tier foreign subsidiaries by reason of a deemed distribution of lower-tier earnings of the foreign acquired corporation.
(6)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (g) is illustrated by the examples in this paragraph (g)(6). In each example, all corporations have a calendar year-end and use the United States dollar as their functional currency.

Example 1: Excess asset basis from triangular reorganization
—(A)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of USS, also a domestic corporation, and 80 percent of the stock of FP, a foreign corporation. USS owns the remaining 20 percent of the stock of FP. FP owns all of the stock of FS1, which in turn owns all of the stock of FS2. Both FS1 and FS2 are foreign corporations. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) (F reorganization), US Newco, a newly formed domestic corporation, acquires all of the assets of FP solely in exchange for stock of US Newco, which FP distributes to USP and USS in liquidation. Immediately before the F reorganization, the stock of FP owned by USP has a fair market value of $80x and an adjusted basis of $4x. The stock of FP owned by USS has a fair market value of $20x and an adjusted basis of $1x. The all earnings and profits amounts with respect to USP's stock of FP and USS's stock of FP, determined before any adjustments required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section, are $32x and $8x, respectively. FP holds assets with an adjusted basis of $95x, has no liabilities, and has $40x of earnings and profits attributable to its outstanding stock. FS1 and FS2 have $30x and $70x of earnings and profits, respectively, all of which are described in section 959(c)(3). Dividends paid by FS2 to FS1, and by FS1 to FP, would qualify for the exception to foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6). Before the applicability date described in paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section, and separate from the F reorganization, FS1 provided property to FP in exchange for stock of FP in connection with a triangular reorganization described in § 1.358-6(b)(2), and neither FP nor FS1 made adjustments that had the effect of a distribution of property from FS1 to FP under § 1.367(b)-10(b)(1).
(B)
Analysis
—(
1
)
All earnings and profits amount.
The F reorganization is an asset acquisition described in section 368(a)(1) and is thus subject to section 367(b) and this section. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, USP and USS each must include in income as a deemed dividend the all earnings and profits amount with respect to their stock of FP. Because there is excess asset basis with respect to FP (as determined in paragraph (g)(6)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section), USP and USS must compute the all earnings and profits amounts attributable to their stock of FP as if FP had received a distribution of specified earnings, immediately before the F reorganization.
See
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Because the stock of FS2 is indirectly owned by FP, to the extent the specified earnings are determined by reference to the earnings and profits of FS2, FS2 is treated as making a distribution to FS1 under section 301, and FS1 is then treated as making a distribution to FP under section 301 in an amount equal to the sum of the amount of specified earnings determined by reference to the earnings and profits of FS1 (determined without regard to the deemed distribution from FS2) and the amount of the deemed distribution received from FS2.
See id.
(

)
Excess asset basis.
The amount of excess asset basis is $50x, calculated as the amount by which FP's inside asset basis ($95x) exceeds the sum of FP's earnings and profits ($40x), the aggregate basis in the outstanding stock of FP ($5x), and the amount of liabilities of FP assumed by US Newco in the F reorganization ($0).
See
paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
(
3
)
Deemed distribution of specified earnings.
The amount of specified earnings equals $50x, the lesser of the following amounts: the sum of the earnings and profits of FS1 and FS2 ($100x); and the amount of excess asset basis with respect to FP ($50x).
See
paragraph (g)(2)(viii) of this section. FP is accordingly treated as receiving a distribution of $50x from FS1.
See
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, $15x ($50x ×
($30x/$100x)) of FS1's earnings and profits and $35x ($50x × ($70x/$100x)) of FS2's earnings and profits are designated as specified earnings. FS2 is treated as distributing $35x to FS1.
See
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Under sections 301(c)(1) and 954(c)(6), the $35x deemed distribution from FS2 to FS1 is treated as a dividend that does not give rise to foreign personal holding company income. FS1 must accordingly increase its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) by $35x to $65x, and FS2 must decrease its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) by the same amount. FS1 is then treated as making a distribution of $50x to FP.
See
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Under sections 301(c)(1) and 954(c)(6), the $50x deemed distribution is also treated as a dividend that does not give rise to foreign personal holding company income. FP must accordingly increase its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) by $50x to $90x, and FS1 must decrease its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) by the same amount.
(
4
)
Adjusted all earnings and profits amount attributable to USP's FP stock.
USP must compute the all earnings and profits amount attributable to its stock of FP after taking into account the $50x increase to FP's earnings and profits that resulted from the deemed distribution of specified earnings.
See
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Because USP owns 80% of the stock of FP, $40x (calculated as 80% of $50x) of the specified earnings are attributable to USP's stock of FP and are included in the all earnings and profits amount attributable to USP's stock of FP. The all earnings and profits amount that USP must include in income as a deemed dividend is therefore $72x ($32x + $40x).
(
5
)
Adjusted all earnings and profits amount attributable to USS's FP stock.
USS must compute the all earnings and profits amount attributable to its stock of FP after taking into account the $50x increase to FP's earnings and profits that resulted from the deemed distribution of specified earnings.
See
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Because USS owns 20% of the stock of FP, $10x (calculated as 20% of $50x) of the specified earnings are attributable to USS's stock of FP and are included in the all earnings and profits amount attributable to USS's stock of FP. The all earnings and profits amount that USS must include in income as a deemed divided is therefore $18x ($8x + $10x).
(ii)
Example 2: Principal purpose of creating excess asset basis
—(A)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of FP, which in turn owns all of the stock of FS. Both FP and FS are foreign corporations. The all earnings and profits amount with respect to USP's stock of FP, determined before any adjustments required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section, is $50x. FP has no other earnings and profits other than the $50x that reflect USP's all earnings and profits amount. FS has $200x of earnings and profits, all of which are earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) (PTEP) because those earnings and profits gave rise to an earlier income inclusion under section 951 with respect to USP. Increases in stock basis were made under section 961 by reason of USP's section 951 inclusion. FP has excess asset basis of $100x as a result of a previous transaction that was undertaken with a principal purpose of creating excess asset basis in which FS provided $100x of property to FP. At the time of that transaction, FP did not also have a principal purpose of subjecting an inbound nonrecognition transaction to this paragraph (g) and thus paragraph (g)(5) of this section is not applicable. Subsequently, in a liquidation described in section 332, FP distributes all of its assets to USP and the stock of FP is cancelled (the FP liquidation).
(B)
Analysis
—(
1
)
All earnings and profits amount.
The FP liquidation is subject to section 367(b) and this section. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, USP must include in income as a deemed dividend the all earnings and profits amount with respect to its stock of FP. Because there is excess asset basis with respect to FP, USP must compute the all earnings and profits amount attributable to its stock of FP as if FP had received a distribution of specified earnings immediately before the FP liquidation.
See
paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(
2
)
Deemed distribution of specified earnings.
The amount of specified earnings equals $100x, the lesser of the following amounts: the earnings and profits of FS ($200); and the amount of excess asset basis with respect to FP ($100x).
See
paragraph (g)(2)(viii) of this section. FS is accordingly treated as making a distribution of $100x to FP.
See
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Under sections 301(c)(1) and 959(b), the $100x deemed distribution from FS to FP is treated as a distribution of PTEP that is not included in the gross income of FP for purposes of section 951. The distribution reduces FS's earnings and profits and PTEP with respect to USP by $100x and increases FP's earnings and profits and PTEP with respect to USP by $100x. Furthermore, appropriate adjustments are made under section 961 for the distribution of PTEP.
(
3
)
Adjusted all earnings and profits amount attributable to USP's stock of FP.
USP must compute the all earnings and profits amount attributable to its stock of FP after taking into account the $100x increase to FP's earnings and profits that resulted from the deemed distribution of specified earnings.
See
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Because the deemed distribution consisted entirely of PTEP with respect to USP, the deemed distribution does not affect USP's all earnings and profits amount of $50x.
See
§ 1.367(b)-2(d)(2)(ii). USP must therefore include $50x in income as a deemed dividend under this section. USP must also recognize any foreign currency gain or loss under section 986(c) with respect to the $100x of PTEP of FP.
See
§ 1.367(b)-2(j)(2).

Applicability date
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (g) (other than paragraphs (g)(2)(viii), (g)(3) and (5) of this section) applies to transactions completed on or after December 2, 2016, and to any transactions treated as completed before December 2, 2016, as a result of an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after December 2, 2016. Paragraphs (g)(2)(viii), (g)(3) and (5) of this section apply to transactions completed on or after October 5, 2023.
(ii)
Transactions completed (or elections made) on or after December 2, 2016, and before October 5, 2023.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(7)(iii) of this section, the following definitions (in lieu of the corresponding definitions or in addition to the definitions in paragraph (g)(2) of this section) and rules apply with respect to transactions completed on or after December 2, 2016, and to any transactions treated as completed before December 2, 2016, as a result of an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after December 2, 2016, but before October 5, 2023:
(A) The term
specified earnings
means, with respect to the stock of a foreign acquired corporation that is exchanged by an exchanging shareholder, the lesser of the following amounts (but not below zero):
(
1
) The sum of the earnings and profits (including a deficit) with respect to each foreign subsidiary of the foreign acquired corporation that are attributable under section 1248(c)(2) to the stock of the foreign acquired corporation exchanged (lower-tier earnings). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the modifications described in § 1.367(b)-2(d)(2) and (d)(3)(i) apply. Thus, for example, the amount of the earnings and profits of a foreign subsidiary that are attributable to stock of the foreign acquired corporation is determined without regard to whether the foreign subsidiary was a controlled foreign corporation at any time during the five years preceding the inbound nonrecognition transaction.
(
2
) The product of the excess asset basis of the foreign acquired corporation, multiplied by the exchanging shareholder's specified percentage.
(
3
) The amount of gain that would be realized by the exchanging shareholder if, immediately before the inbound nonrecognition transaction, the exchanging shareholder had sold the stock of the foreign acquired corporation for fair market value, reduced by the exchanging shareholder's all earnings and profits amount (for this purpose, determined without regard to the modifications described in this paragraph (g)) (specified stock gain).
(B) The term
specified percentage
means, with respect to an exchanging shareholder, a fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is
the sum of the aggregate of the specified stock gain with respect to all exchanging shareholders to which paragraph (b)(3) of this section applies and the aggregate of the gain realized (regardless of whether such gain is recognized) with respect to the stock exchanged by all other exchanging shareholders.
(C) If there is excess asset basis with respect to a foreign acquired corporation, as determined under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, a taxpayer may reduce the excess asset basis to the extent that the excess asset basis is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to property provided by a foreign subsidiary of the foreign acquired corporation. For example, if there was a transfer of property to the foreign acquired corporation described in section 362(e)(2), and the election described in section 362(e)(2)(C) was made to limit the basis in the stock received in the foreign acquired corporation to its fair market value, then, for purposes of determining excess asset basis, the basis in the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation may be determined without regard to the application of section 362(e)(2).
(iii)
Early application.
A taxpayer and its related parties (within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1)) may choose to apply paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section to all open taxable years beginning before July 17, 2024, provided that the taxpayer and its related parties consistently apply paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section and § 1.367(b)-1(c)(4)(ix) for such years.

Election of taxable exchange treatment
—(i)
Rules
—(A)
In general.
In lieu of the treatment prescribed by § 1.367(b)-3(b)(3)(i), an exchanging shareholder described in § 1.367(b)-3(b)(1) may instead elect to recognize the gain (but not loss) that it realizes in the exchange (taxable exchange election). To make a taxable exchange election, the following requirements must be satisfied—
(
1
) The exchanging shareholder (and its direct or indirect owners that would be affected by the election, in the case of an exchanging shareholder that is a foreign corporation) reports the exchange in a manner consistent therewith (see, e.g., sections 954(c)(1)(B)(i), 1001 and 1248);
(
2
) The notification requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section are satisfied; and
(
3
) The adjustments described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section are made when the following circumstances are present—
(
i
) The transaction is described in section 332 or is an asset acquisition described in section 368(a)(1), with regard to which one U.S. person owns (directly or indirectly) 100 percent of the foreign acquired corporation; and
(
ii
) The all earnings and profits amount described in § 1.367(b)-3(b)(3)(i) with respect to the exchange exceeds the gain recognized by the exchanging shareholder.
(B)
Attribute reduction
—(
1
)
Reduction of NOL carryovers.
The amount by which the all earnings and profits amount exceeds the gain recognized by the exchanging shareholder (the excess earnings and profits amount) shall be applied to reduce the net operating loss carryovers (if any) of the foreign acquired corporation to which the domestic acquiring corporation would otherwise succeed under section 381(a) and (c)(1). See also Rev. Rul. 72-421 (1972-2 C.B. 166) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(
2
)
Reduction of capital loss carryovers.
After the application of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section, any remaining excess earnings and profits amount shall be applied to reduce the capital loss carryovers (if any) of the foreign acquired corporation to which the domestic acquiring corporation would otherwise succeed under section 381(a) and (c)(3).
(
3
)
Reduction of basis.
After the application of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section, any remaining excess
earnings and profits amount shall be applied to reduce (but not below zero) the basis of the assets (other than dollar-denominated money) of the foreign acquired corporation that are acquired by the domestic acquiring corporation. Such remaining excess earnings and profits amount shall be applied to reduce the basis of such assets in the following order: first, tangible depreciable or depletable assets, according to their class lives (beginning with those assets with the shortest class life); second, other non-inventory tangible assets; third, intangible assets that are amortizable; and finally, the remaining assets of the foreign acquired corporation that are acquired by the domestic acquiring corporation. Within each of these categories, if the total basis of all assets in the category is greater than the excess earnings and profits amount to be applied against such basis, the taxpayer may choose to which specific assets in the category the basis reduction first applies.
(C)
Notification.
The exchanging shareholder shall elect to apply the rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(i) by attaching a statement of its election to its section 367(b) notice. See § 1.367(b)-1(c) For the rules concerning filing a section 367(b) notice.
(D)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(i):

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
DC, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation. The stock of FC has a value of $100, and DC has a basis of $80 in such stock. The assets of FC are one parcel of land with a value of $60 and a basis of $30, and tangible depreciable assets with a value of $40 and a basis of $80. FC has no net operating loss carryovers or capital loss carryovers. The all earnings and profits amount with respect to the FC stock owned by DC is $30, of which $19 is described in section 1248(a) and the remaining $11 is not (for example, because it was earned prior to 1963). In a liquidation described in section 332, FC distributes all of its property to DC, and the FC stock held by DC is canceled. Rather than including in income as a deemed dividend the all earnings and profits amount of $30 as provided in § 1.367(b)-3(b)(3)(i), DC instead elects taxable exchange treatment under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
(ii)
Result.
DC recognizes the $20 of gain it realizes on its stock in FC. Of this $20 amount, $19 is included in income by DC as a dividend pursuant to section 1248(a). (For the source of the remaining $1 of gain recognized by DC, see section 865. For the treatment of the $1 for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, see generally section 904(d)(2)(A)(i).) Because the transaction is described in section 332 and because the all earnings and profits amount with respect to the FC stock held by DC ($30) exceeds by $10 the income recognized by DC ($20), the attribute reduction rules of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section apply. Accordingly, the $10 excess earnings and profits amount is applied to reduce the basis of the tangible depreciable assets of FC, beginning with those assets with the shortest class lives. Under section 337(a) FC does not recognize gain or loss in the assets that it distributes to DC, and under section 334(b) (which is applied taking into account the basis reduction prescribed by paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A)(
3
) of this section) DC takes a basis of $30 in the land and $70 in the tangible depreciable assets that it receives from FC.
(ii)
Effective date.
This paragraph (b)(4) applies for section 367(b) exchanges that occur between February 23, 2000, and February 23, 2001.
(c)-(d) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.367(b)-3(c) through (d).

§ 1.367(b)-4
Acquisition of foreign corporate stock or assets by a foreign corporation in certain nonrecognition transactions.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies to certain acquisitions by a foreign corporation of the stock or assets of a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1). Paragraph (b) of this section provides a rule regarding when an exchanging shareholder is required to include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock that it exchanges. Paragraph (c) of this section provides a rule excluding deemed dividends from foreign personal holding company income. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for subsequent sales or exchanges. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section provide rules regarding certain exchanges following inversion transactions. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules regarding exchanges that occur pursuant to a transaction described in § 1.367(b)-10(a)(1), without regard to the exceptions in § 1.367(b)-10(a)(2). Paragraph (h)
of this section provides definitions and special rules, including special rules regarding triangular reorganizations and recapitalizations. Paragraph (i) of this section provides the applicability dates for certain paragraphs of this section. See also § 1.367(a)-3(b)(2) for transactions subject to the concurrent application of sections 367(a) and (b) and § 1.367(b)-2 for additional definitions that apply.
(b)
Income inclusion.
If a foreign corporation (the transferee foreign corporation) acquires the stock of a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or the stock or assets of a foreign corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1) (in either case, the foreign acquired corporation), then an exchanging shareholder must, if its exchange is described in paragraph (b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(i), or (b)(3) of this section, include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock that it exchanges.

Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, an exchange is described in this paragraph (b)(1)(i) if—
(A) Immediately before the exchange, the exchanging shareholder is—
(
1
) A United States person that is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to the foreign acquired corporation; or
(
2
) A foreign corporation, and a United States person is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to such foreign corporation and with respect to the foreign acquired corporation;
(B) Either of the following conditions is satisfied—

If an exchanging shareholder is a domestic corporation that transfers stock of a foreign acquired corporation in an exchange under section 361(a) or (b) (section 361 exchange) to which the exception to section 367(a)(5) in § 1.367(a)-7(c) applies, and the exchanging shareholder receives stock in either the transferee foreign corporation or foreign controlling corporation (in the case of a triangular reorganization), such exchange will not be described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section only if immediately after the exchanging shareholder's receipt of the foreign stock in the section 361 exchange, but prior to, and without taking into account, the exchanging shareholder's distribution of the foreign stock under section 361(c)(1), the foreign acquired corporation, transferee foreign corporation, and foreign controlling corporation (in the case of a triangular reorganization) are controlled foreign corporations as to which the exchanging shareholder is a section 1248 shareholder. See paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section,

Receipt of domestic stock.
In the case of a triangular reorganization in which the stock received in the exchange is stock of a domestic controlling corporation, such exchange is not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section if immediately after the exchange the following foreign corporations are controlled foreign corporations as to which the domestic controlling corporation is a section 1248 shareholder—
(

Section 361 exchanges to which § 1.367(a)-7(c) applies.
If stock of the foreign acquired corporation is acquired by the foreign surviving corporation in a section 361 exchange by reason of triangular reorganization (other than a triangular B reorganization) to which the exception to section 367(a)(5) provided in § 1.367(a)-7(c) applies, and if paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to the section 361 exchange by reason of (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section (if the stock received is stock of a foreign controlling corporation) or by reason of (b)(1)(ii)(B)(

iv
) of this section (if the stock received is stock of a domestic controlling corporation), then the controlling corporation (foreign or domestic) must apply the principles of § 1.367(b)-13 to adjust the basis of the stock of the foreign surviving corporation so that the section 1248 amount in the stock of the foreign acquired corporation (determined when the foreign surviving corporation acquires such stock) is reflected in the stock of the foreign surviving corporation immediately after the exchange.

(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(1):

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
FC1 is a foreign corporation that is owned, directly and indirectly (applying the ownership rules of section 958), solely by foreign persons. DC is a domestic corporation that is unrelated to FC1. DC owns all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. Thus, under § 1.367(b)-2(a) and (b), DC is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to FC2, and FC2 is a controlled foreign corporation. Under § 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock of FC2 held by DC is $20. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), FC1 acquires all of the assets and assumes all of the liabilities of FC2 in exchange for FC1 voting stock. The FC1 voting stock received does not represent more than 50 percent of the voting power or value of FC1's stock. FC2 distributes the FC1 stock to DC, and the FC2 stock held by DC is canceled.
(ii)
Result.
FC1 is not a controlled foreign corporation immediately after the exchange. As a result, the exchange is described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b) of this section, DC must include in income, as a deemed dividend from FC2, the section 1248 amount ($20) attributable to the FC2 stock that DC exchanged.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the voting stock of FC1, which is received by FC2 in exchange for its assets and distributed by FC2 to DC, represents more than 50 percent of the voting power of FC1's stock under the rules of section 957(a).
(ii)
Result.
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to require inclusion in income of the section 1248 amount, because
FC1 is a controlled foreign corporation as to which DC is a section 1248 shareholder immediately after the exchange.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that FC2 receives and distributes voting stock of FP, a foreign corporation that is in control (within the meaning of section 368(c)) of FC1, instead of receiving and distributing voting stock of FC1.
(ii)
Result.
For purposes of section 367(a), the transfer is an indirect stock transfer subject to section 367(a). See § 1.367(a)-3(d)(1)(iv). Accordingly, DC's exchange of FC2 stock for FP stock under section 354 will be taxable under section 367(a) (and section 1248 will be applicable) if DC fails to enter into a gain recognition agreement in accordance with § 1.367(a)-8. Under § 1.367(a)-3(b)(2), if DC enters into a gain recognition agreement, the exchange will be subject to the provisions of section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder, as well as section 367(a). If FP and FC1 are controlled foreign corporations as to which DC is a (direct or indirect) section 1248 shareholder immediately after the reorganization, then the section 367(b) result is the same as in
Example 2
—that is, paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to require inclusion in income of the section 1248 amount. Under these circumstances, the amount of the gain recognition agreement would equal the amount of the gain realized on the indirect stock transfer. If FP or FC1 is not a controlled foreign corporation as to which DC is a (direct or indirect) section 1248 shareholder immediately after the exchange, then the section 367(b) result is the same as in
Example 1
—that is, DC must include in income, as a deemed dividend from FC2, the section 1248 amount ($20) attributable to the FC2 stock that DC exchanged. Under these circumstances, the amount of the gain recognition agreement would equal the amount of the gain realized on the indirect stock transfer, less the $20 section 1248 amount inclusion.

# Example 3A.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that FC1 merges into FC2 in a reorganization described in sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E). Pursuant to the reorganization, DC exchanges its FC2 stock for stock of FP.
(ii)
Result.
The result is similar to the result in
Example 3.
The transfer is an indirect stock transfer subject to section 367(a). See § 1.367(a)-3(d)(1)(ii). Accordingly, DC's exchange of FC2 stock for FP stock will be taxable under section 367(a) (and section 1248 will be applicable) if DC fails to enter into a gain recognition agreement. If DC enters into a gain recognition agreement, the exchange will be subject to the provisions of section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder, as well as section 367(a). If FP and FC2 are controlled foreign corporations as to which DC is a section 1248 shareholder immediately after the reorganization, then paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to require DC to include in income the section 1248 amount attributable to the FC2 stock that was exchanged and the amount of the gain recognition agreement is the amount of gain realized on the indirect stock transfer. If FP or FC2 is not a controlled foreign corporation as to which DC is a section 1248 shareholder immediately after the exchange, then DC must include in income as a deemed dividend from FC2 the section 1248 amount ($20) attributable to the FC2 stock that DC exchanged. Under these circumstances, the gain recognition agreement would be the amount of gain realized on the indirect transfer, less the $20 section 1248 amount inclusion.

# Example 3B.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 3,
except that USP, a domestic corporation, owns the controlling interest (within the meaning of section 368(c)) in FC1 stock. In addition, FC2 merges into FC1 in a reorganization described in sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D). Pursuant to the reorganization, DC exchanges its FC2 stock for USP stock.
(ii)
Result.
Because DC receives stock of a domestic corporation, USP, in the section 354 exchange, the transfer is not an indirect stock transfer subject to section 367(a). Accordingly, the exchange will be subject only to the provisions of section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, because the stock received is stock of a domestic corporation (USP) and, immediately after the exchange, USP is a section 1248 shareholder of FC1 (the surviving corporation) and FC1 is a controlled foreign corporation, the exchange is not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and DC is not required to include in income the section 1248 amount attributable to the FC2 stock that was exchanged. See § 1.367(b)-13(c) for the basis and holding period rules applicable to this transaction, which cause USP's adjusted basis and holding period in the stock of FC1 after the transaction to reflect the basis and holding period that DC had in its FC2 stock.

# Example 4.
(i)
Facts.
DC1, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of DC2, a domestic corporation. DC2 owns various assets, including all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. The stock of FC2 has a value of $100, and DC2 has a basis of $30 in the stock. The section 1248 earnings and profits attributable to the FC2 stock held by DC2 is $20. DC2 does not own any stock other than the FC2 stock. FC1 is a foreign corporation that is unrelated to DC1, DC2, and FC2. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), FC1 acquires all of the assets of DC2 in exchange for the assumption of DC2's liabilities and voting stock of FC1 that represents 20% of the outstanding voting stock of FC1. DC2 distributes the FC1 stock to DC1 under section
361(c)(1), and the DC2 stock held by DC1 is canceled. The exception to section 367(a)(5) provided in § 1.367(a)-7(c) applies to the section 361 exchange. DC1 properly files a gain recognition agreement that satisfies the conditions of §§ 1.367(a)-3(e)(6) and 1.367(a)-8 to qualify for nonrecognition treatment under section 367(a) with respect to DC2's transfer of the FC2 stock to FC1. See § 1.367(a)-3(e). FC1 is not a surrogate foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 7874) because DC1 does not hold at least 60% of the stock of FC1 by reason of holding stock of DC2.
(ii)
Result.
DC2, the exchanging shareholder, is a U.S. person and a section 1248 shareholder with respect to FC2, the foreign acquired corporation. Whether DC2 is required to include in income the section 1248 amount attributable to the FC2 stock under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section depends on whether, immediately after DC2's section 361 exchange of the FC2 stock for FC1 stock (and before the distribution of the FC1 stock to DC1 under section 361(c)(1)), FC1 and FC2 are controlled foreign corporations as to which DC2 is a section 1248 shareholder. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. If, immediately after the section 361 exchange (and before the distribution of the FC1 stock to DC1 under section 361(c)(1)), FC1 and FC2 are both controlled foreign corporations as to which DC2 is a section 1248 shareholder, then DC2 is not required to include in income the section 1248 amount attributable to the FC2 stock under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section because neither condition in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section is satisfied. Alternatively, if immediately after the section 361 exchange (and before the distribution of the FC1 stock to DC1 under section 361(c)(1)) either FC1 or FC2 is not a controlled foreign corporation as to which DC2 is a section 1248 shareholder, then, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, DC2 must include in income the section 1248 amount attributable to the FC2 stock. For the treatment of DC2's transfer of assets other than the FC2 stock to FC1, see section 367(a)(1) and (a)(3) and the regulations under that section. Furthermore, because DC2's transfer of any other assets to FC1 is pursuant to a section 361 exchange, see section 367(a)(5) and § 1.367(a)-7. If any of the assets transferred are intangible assets for purposes of section 367(d), see section 367(d). With respect to DC2's distribution of the FC1 stock to DC1 under section 361(c)(1), see section 1248(f)(1), and §§ 1.1248(f)-1 and 1.1248(f)-2.

# Example 5.
(i)
Facts.
DC1, a domestic corporation, wholly owns DC2, a domestic corporation. The DC2 stock has a $100x fair market value, and DC1 has a basis of $30x in the stock. DC2's only asset is all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. The FC2 stock has a $100x fair market value, and DC2 has a basis of $30x in the stock. There are $20x of earnings and profits attributable to the FC2 stock for purposes of section 1248. USP, a domestic corporation unrelated to DC1, DC2, and FC2, wholly owns FC1, a foreign corporation. In a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), DC2 transfers all the FC2 stock to FC1 in exchange solely for voting stock of USP, and distributes the USP stock to DC1 under section 361(c)(1). DC1 exchanges its DC2 stock for the USP stock under section 354. DC2's transfer of the FC2 stock to FC1 is described in section 361(a) and therefore, under section 367(a)(5) and § 1.367(a)-7, is generally subject to section 367(a)(1). However, the exception to section 367(a)(5) provided in § 1.367(a)-7(c) applies to the section 361 exchange. In addition, DC1 is not required to adjust the basis of its USP stock (determined under section 358) under section 367(a)(5) and § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3). DC1 properly files a gain recognition agreement that satisfies the conditions of §§ 1.367(a)-3(e)(6) and 1.367(a)-8 to qualify for nonrecognition treatment under section 367(a) with respect to DC2's transfer of the FC2 stock to FC1. See § 1.367(a)-3(e).
(ii)
Result.
Immediately after the exchange, FC1 and FC2 are controlled foreign corporations as to which USP is a section 1248 shareholder because USP directly and indirectly owns all the FC1 stock and FC2 stock, respectively. Because DC2 receives stock of a domestic corporation (USP) in exchange for the FC2 stock and, immediately after the exchange, FC1 and FC2 are controlled foreign corporations as to which USP is a section 1248 shareholder, DC2's exchange of the FC2 stock for the USP stock is not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
)(
iv
) of this section. Therefore, DC2 is not required to include in income the section 1248 amount in the FC2 stock. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(
2
)(
i
) of this section, USP must apply the principles of § 1.367(b)-13 to adjust the basis of its FC1 stock to preserve the section 1248 amount ($20x) in the FC2 stock. Under the principles of § 1.367(b)-13, each share of FC1 stock held by USP after the exchange must be divided into portions, one portion attributable to the FC1 stock owned before the exchange and one portion attributable to the FC2 stock received in the exchange. The $30x basis in the FC2 stock and the $20x earnings and profits attributable to the FC2 stock before the exchange are attributable to the divided portions of the FC1 stock to which the FC2 stock relates.
(2)
Receipt by exchanging shareholder of preferred or other stock in certain instances
—(i)
Rule.
An exchange is described in this paragraph (b)(2)(i) if—
(A) Immediately before the exchange, the foreign acquired corporation and the transferee foreign corporation are not members of the same affiliated
group (within the meaning of section 1504(a), but without regard to the exceptions set forth in section 1504(b), and substituting the words “more than 50” in place of the words “at least 80” in sections 1504(a)(2)(A) and (B));
(B) Immediately after the exchange, a domestic corporation directly or indirectly owns 10 percent or more of the voting power or value of the transferee foreign corporation; and
(C) The exchanging shareholder receives preferred stock (other than preferred stock that is fully participating with respect to dividends, redemptions and corporate growth) in consideration for common stock or preferred stock that is fully participating with respect to dividends, redemptions and corporate growth, or, in the discretion of the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate (and without regard to whether the stock exchanged is common stock or preferred stock), receives stock that entitles it to participate (through dividends, redemption payments or otherwise) disproportionately in the earnings generated by particular assets of the foreign acquired corporation or transferee foreign corporation.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(2):

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
FC1 is a foreign corporation. DC is a domestic corporation that is unrelated to FC1. DC owns all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation, and FC2 has no outstanding preferred stock. The value of FC2 is $100 and DC has a basis of $50 in the stock of FC2. Under § 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock of FC2 held by DC is $20. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), FC1 acquires all of the stock of FC2 and, in exchange, DC receives FC1 voting preferred stock that constitutes 10 percent of the voting stock of FC1 for purposes of section 902(a). Immediately after the exchange, FC1 and FC2 are controlled foreign corporations and DC is a section 1248 shareholder of FC1 and FC2, so paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not require inclusion in income of the section 1248 amount.
(ii)
Result.
Pursuant to § 1.367(a)-3(b)(2), the transfer is subject to both section 367(a) and section 367(b). Under § 1.367(a)-3(b)(1), DC will not be subject to tax under section 367(a)(1) if it enters into a gain recognition agreement in accordance with § 1.367(a)-8. Even though paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to require inclusion in income by DC of the section 1248 amount, DC must nevertheless include the $20 section 1248 amount in income as a deemed dividend from FC2 under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Thus, if DC enters into a gain recognition agreement, the amount is $30 (the $50 gain realized less the $20 recognized under section 367(b)). If DC fails to enter into a gain recognition agreement, it must include in income under section 367(a)(1) the $50 of gain realized ($20 of which is treated as a dividend under section 1248). Section 367(b) does not apply in such case.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that DC owns all of the outstanding stock of FC1 immediately before the transaction.
(ii)
Result.
Both section 367(a) and section 367(b) apply to the transfer. Paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section does not apply to require inclusion of the section 1248 amount. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the transaction is outside the scope of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because FC1 and FC2 are, immediately before the transaction, members of the same affiliated group (within the meaning of such paragraph). Thus, if DC enters into a gain recognition agreement in accordance with § 1.367(a)-8, the amount of such agreement is $50. As in
Example 1,
if DC fails to enter into a gain recognition agreement, it must include in income $50, $20 of which will be treated as a dividend under section 1248.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
FC1 is a foreign corporation. DC is a domestic corporation that is unrelated to FC1. DC owns all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. The section 1248 amount attributable to the stock of FC2 held by DC is $20. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), FC1 acquires all of the stock of FC2 in exchange for FC1 voting stock that constitutes 10 percent of the voting stock of FC1 for purposes of section 902(a). The FC1 voting stock received by DC in the exchange carries voting rights in FC1, but by agreement of the parties the shares entitle the holder to dividends, amounts to be paid on redemption, and amounts to be paid on liquidation, that are to be determined by reference to the earnings or value of FC2 as of the date of such event, and that are affected by the earnings or value of FC1 only if FC1 becomes insolvent or has insufficient capital surplus to pay dividends.
(ii)
Result.
Under § 1.367(a)-3(b)(1), DC will not be subject to tax under section 367(a)(1) if it enters into a gain recognition agreement with respect to the transfer of FC2 stock to FC1. Under § 1.367(a)-3(b)(2), the exchange will be subject to the provisions of section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder to the extent that it is not subject to tax under section 367(a)(1). Furthermore, even if DC would not otherwise be required to recognize income under this section, the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate may
nevertheless require that DC include the $20 section 1248 amount in income as a deemed dividend from FC2 under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Certain recapitalizations.
An exchange pursuant to a recapitalization under section 368(a)(1)(E) shall be deemed to be an exchange described in this paragraph (b)(3) if the following conditions are satisfied—
(i) During the 24-month period immediately preceding or following the date of the recapitalization, the corporation that undergoes the recapitalization (or a predecessor of, or successor to, such corporation) also engages in a transaction that would be described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section but for paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, either as the foreign acquired corporation or the transferee foreign corporation; and
(ii) The exchange in the recapitalization is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section.
(c)
Exclusion of deemed dividend from foreign personal holding company income
—(1)
Rule.
In the event the section 1248 amount is included in income as a deemed dividend by a foreign corporation under paragraph (b) of this section, such deemed dividend shall not be included as foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c).
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (c):

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
FC1 is a foreign corporation that is owned, directly and indirectly (applying the ownership rules of section 958), solely by foreign persons. DC is a domestic corporation that is unrelated to FC1. DC owns all of the outstanding stock of FC2, a foreign corporation. FC2 owns all of the outstanding stock of FC3, a foreign corporation. Under § 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock of FC3 held by FC2 is $20. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), FC1 acquires from FC2 all of the stock of FC3 in exchange for FC1 voting stock. The FC1 voting stock received by FC2 does not represent more than 50 percent of the voting power or value of FC1's stock.
(ii)
Result.
FC1 is not a controlled foreign corporation immediately after the exchange. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, FC2 must include in income, as a deemed dividend from FC3, the section 1248 amount ($20) attributable to the FC3 stock that FC2 exchanged. The deemed dividend is treated as a dividend for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code as provided in § 1.367(b)-2(e)(2); however, under this paragraph (c) the deemed dividend is not foreign personal holding company income to FC2.
(d)
Rules for subsequent sales or exchanges
—(1)
Rule.
If an exchanging shareholder (as defined in § 1.1248-8(b)(1)(iv)) is not required to include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount under paragraph (b) or paragraph (e)(1) of this section (non-inclusion exchange), then, for purposes of applying section 367(b) or 1248 to subsequent sales or exchanges, and subject to the limitation of § 1.367(b)-2(d)(3)(ii) (in the case of a transaction described in § 1.367(b)-3), the determination of the earnings and profits attributable to the stock an exchanging shareholder receives in the non-inclusion exchange is determined pursuant to the rules of section 1248 and the regulations under that section.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this section. For purposes of the example, assume that—
(i) There is no immediate gain recognition pursuant to section 367(a)(1) and the regulations under that section (either through operation of the rules or because the appropriate parties have entered into a gain recognition agreement under §§ 1.367(a)-3(b) and 1.367(a)-8);
(ii) References to earnings and profits are to earnings and profits that would be includible in income as a dividend under section 1248 and the regulations under that section if stock to which the earnings and profits are attributable were sold or exchanged by its shareholder;
(iii) Each corporation has only a single class of stock outstanding and uses the calendar year as its taxable year; and
(iv) Each transaction is unrelated to all other transactions.

# Example. Acquisition of the stock of a foreign corporation that controls a transferee foreign corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C).
(i)
Facts.
DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 has owned all the stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. FC, a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation, has owned all of the stock of FC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1,
year 2. On December 31, year 3, pursuant to a restructuring transaction that was a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), CFC1 transfers all of its assets, including the CFC2 stock, to FC2 in exchange for 80% of the voting stock of FC. CFC1 transfers the voting stock of FC to DC1 and the CFC1 stock is cancelled. Pursuant to section 1223(1), DC1 is considered to have held the stock of FC since January 1, year 1. Under section 1223(2), FC2 is considered to have held the stock of CFC2 since January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 3, CFC1 has $100 of earnings and profits. From January 1, year 4, until December 31, year 5, FC (a controlled foreign corporation after the restructuring transaction) accumulates an additional $50 of earnings and profits. FC2, a controlled foreign corporation after the restructuring transaction, accumulates $100 of earnings and profits from January 1, year 4, until December 31, year 5. On December 31, year 5, FC is liquidated into DC1 in a transaction described in section 332.
(ii)
Result.
Generally, this paragraph (d) requires that DC1 include in income the earnings and profits attributable to its stock in FC as determined under § 1.1248-8. However, since the liquidation of FC into DC1 is a transaction described in § 1.367(b)-3, the earnings and profits attributable to the stock of FC are limited by § 1.367(b)-2(d) (3)(ii) to that portion of the earnings and profits accumulated by FC itself before or after the restructuring transaction, and do not include the earnings and profits of FC's subsidiaries accumulated before or after the restructuring transaction. Thus, DC1 will include $40 of earnings and profits in income (80% of the $50 of earnings and profits accumulated by FC after the restructuring transaction).
(e)
Income inclusion and gain recognition in certain exchanges following an inversion transaction
—(1)
General rule.
If a foreign corporation (the transferee foreign corporation) acquires stock of a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or stock or assets of a foreign corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1) (in either case, the foreign acquired corporation), then an exchanging shareholder must, if its exchange is a specified exchange and the exception in paragraph (e)(3) of this section does not apply—
(i) Include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock that it exchanges; and
(ii) After taking into account the increase in basis provided in § 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii) resulting from the deemed dividend (if any), recognize all realized gain with respect to the stock that would not otherwise be recognized.
(2)
Specified exchanges.
An exchange is a specified exchange if—
(i) Immediately before the exchange, the foreign acquired corporation is an expatriated foreign subsidiary and the exchanging shareholder is either an expatriated entity described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section or an expatriated foreign subsidiary described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section;
(ii) The stock received in the exchange is stock of a foreign corporation; and
(iii) The exchange occurs during the applicable period.
(3)
De minimis exception.
The exception in this paragraph (e)(3) applies if—
(i) Immediately after the exchange, the foreign acquired corporation (in the case of an acquisition of stock of the foreign acquired corporation) or the transferee foreign corporation (in the case of an acquisition of assets of the foreign acquired corporation) is a controlled foreign corporation;
(ii) The post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to the foreign acquired corporation (in the case of an acquisition of stock of the foreign acquired corporation) or the transferee foreign corporation (in the case of an acquisition of assets of the foreign acquired corporation) is at least 90 percent of the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to the foreign acquired corporation; and
(iii) The post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to each lower-tier expatriated foreign subsidiary of the foreign acquired corporation is at least 90 percent of the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to the lower-tier expatriated foreign subsidiary.
(4)
Certain exceptions from foreign personal holding company not available.
An income inclusion of a foreign corporation under paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not qualify for the exceptions from foreign personal holding company income provided by sections 954(c)(3)(A)(i) and 954(c)(6) (to the extent in effect).
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e). For purposes of all of the examples, unless otherwise indicated: FP, a foreign corporation, owns all of the stock of USP, a domestic corporation, and all 40 shares of stock of FS, a controlled foreign corporation for its taxable year beginning January 1, 2017, but not for prior taxable years, except as a result of a transaction described in the facts of an example. USP owns all 50 shares of stock of FT1, a controlled foreign corporation, which, in turn, owns all 50 shares of FT2, a controlled foreign corporation. FP acquired all of the stock of USP in an inversion transaction that was completed on July 1, 2016. Therefore, with respect to that inversion transaction, USP is an expatriated entity; FT1 and FT2 are expatriated foreign subsidiaries; and FP and FS are each a non-EFS foreign related person. All entities have a calendar year tax year for U.S. tax purposes. All shares of stock have a fair market value of $1x, and each corporation has a single class of stock outstanding.

# Example 1.
Specified exchange to which general rule applies
—(i)
Facts.
During the applicable period, and pursuant to a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), FT1 transfers all 50 shares of FT2 stock to FS in exchange solely for 50 newly issued voting shares of FS. Immediately before the exchange, USP is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to FT1 and FT2. At the time of the exchange, the FT2 stock owned by FT1 has a fair market value of $50x and an adjusted basis of $5x, such that the FT2 stock has a built-in gain of $45x. In addition, the earnings and profits of FT2 attributable to FT1's stock in FT2 for purposes of section 1248 is $30x, taking into account the rules of § 1.367(b)-2(c)(1)(i) and (ii), and therefore the section 1248 amount with respect to the FT2 stock is $30x (the lesser of the $45x of built-in gain and the $30x of earnings and profits attributable to the stock).
(ii)
Analysis.
FT1's exchange is a specified exchange because the requirements set forth in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied. The requirement set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section is satisfied because, immediately before the exchange, FT2 (the foreign acquired corporation) is an expatriated foreign subsidiary and FT1 (the exchanging shareholder) is an expatriated foreign subsidiary that is described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section. The requirement set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section is also satisfied because the stock received in the exchange (FS stock) is stock of a foreign corporation. The requirement set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section is satisfied because the exchange occurs during the applicable period. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, FT1 must include in income as a deemed dividend $30x, the section 1248 amount with respect to its FT2 stock. In addition, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, FT1 must, after taking into account the increase in basis provided in § 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii) resulting from the deemed dividend (which increases FT1's basis in its FT2 stock from $5x to $35x), recognize $15x ($50x amount realized less $35x basis), the realized gain with respect to the FT2 stock that would not otherwise be recognized.

# Example 2.
De minimis shift to non-EFS foreign related persons
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in the introductory sentences of this paragraph (e)(5), except as follows. FT1 does not own any shares of FT2, and all 40 shares of FS are owned by DX, a domestic corporation wholly owned by individual A, and thus FS is not a non-EFS foreign related person. During the applicable period and pursuant to a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D), FT1 transfers all of its assets to FS in exchange for 50 newly issued FS shares, FT1 distributes the 50 FS shares to USP in liquidation under section 361(c)(1), and USP exchanges its 50 shares of FT1 stock for the 50 FS shares under section 354. Further, immediately after the exchange, FS is a controlled foreign corporation.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although USP's exchange is a specified exchange, paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply to the exchange because, as described in paragraphs (ii)(A) through (C) of this
Example 2,
the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section are satisfied.
(A) Because the assets, rather than the stock, of FT1 (the foreign acquired corporation) are acquired, the requirement set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied if FS (the transferee foreign corporation) is a controlled foreign corporation immediately after the exchange. As stated in the facts, FS is a controlled foreign corporation immediately after the exchange.
(B) The requirement set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is satisfied if the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS is at least 90% of the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FT1. Because USP, a domestic corporation that is an expatriated entity, directly owns 50 shares of FT1 stock immediately before the exchange, none of those shares are treated as indirectly owned by FP (a non-EFS foreign related person) for purposes of calculating the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FT1. See paragraph (h)(1)
of this section. Thus, for purposes of calculating the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FT1, FP is treated as directly or indirectly owning 0%, or 0 of 50 shares, of the stock of FT1. Accordingly, the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FT1 is 100 (calculated as 100% less 0%, the percentage of FT1 stock that non-EFS foreign related persons are treated as directly or indirectly owning immediately before the exchange). Consequently, for the requirement set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section to be satisfied, the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS must be at least 90. Because USP, a domestic corporation that is an expatriated entity, directly owns 50 shares of FS stock immediately after the exchange, none of those shares are treated as indirectly owned by FP (a non-EFS foreign related person) for purposes of calculating the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS. See paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Thus, for purposes of calculating the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS, FP is treated as directly or indirectly owning 0%, or 0 of 90 shares, of the stock of FS. As a result, the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS is 100 (calculated as 100% less 0%, the percentage of FS stock that non-EFS foreign related persons are treated as directly or indirectly owning immediately after the exchange). Therefore, because the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS (100) is at least 90, the requirement set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is satisfied.
(C) Because there is not a lower-tier expatriated foreign subsidiary of FT1, the requirement set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section does not apply.
(f)
Gain recognition upon certain transfers of property described in section 351 following an inversion transaction
—(1)
General rule.
If, during the applicable period, an expatriated foreign subsidiary transfers specified property to a foreign corporation (the transferee foreign corporation) in an exchange described in section 351, then the expatriated foreign subsidiary must recognize all realized gain with respect to the specified property transferred that would not otherwise be recognized, unless the exception in paragraph (f)(2) of this section applies.
(2)
De minimis exception.
The exception in this paragraph (f)(2) applies if—
(i) Immediately after the transfer, the transferee foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation; and
(ii) The post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to the transferee foreign corporation is at least 90 percent of the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to the expatriated foreign subsidiary.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f). For purposes of all of the examples, unless otherwise indicated: FP, a foreign corporation, owns all of the stock of USP, a domestic corporation, and all 10 shares of stock of FS, a controlled foreign corporation for its taxable year beginning January 1, 2017, but not for prior taxable years, except as a result of a transaction described in the facts of an example. USP owns all 50 shares of stock of FT, a controlled foreign corporation. FT owns Asset A, which is specified property with a fair market value of $50x and an adjusted basis of $10x. FP acquired all of the stock of USP in an inversion transaction that was completed on or after September 22, 2014. Accordingly, with respect to that inversion transaction, USP is an expatriated entity, FT is an expatriated foreign subsidiary, and FP and FS are each a non-EFS foreign related person. All entities have a calendar year tax year for U.S. tax purposes. All shares of stock have a fair market value of $1x, and each corporation has a single class of stock outstanding.

# Example 1.
Transfer to which general rule applies

# —(i)
Facts.

# In addition to the stock of USP and FS, FP owns Asset B, which has a fair market value of $40x. During the applicable period, and pursuant to an exchange described in section 351, FT transfers Asset A to FS in exchange for 50 newly issued shares of FS stock, and FP transfers Asset B to FS in exchange for 40 newly issued shares of FS stock.
(ii)
Analysis.
Paragraph (f)(1) of this section applies to the transfer by FT (an expatriated foreign subsidiary) of Asset A, which is specified property, to FS (the transferee foreign corporation). Thus, FT must recognize gain of $40x under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, which is the realized gain with respect to Asset A that would not otherwise be recognized ($50x amount realized less $10x basis). For rules regarding whether the FS stock held by FT is treated as United States property for purposes of section 956, see § 1.956-2(a)(4)(i).

# Example 2.
De minimis shift to non-EFS foreign related persons

# —(i)
Facts.

# Individual, a United States person, owns Asset B, which has a fair market value of $40x. During the applicable period, and pursuant to an exchange described in section 351, FT transfers Asset A to FS in exchange for 50 newly issued shares of FS

# stock, and Individual transfers Asset B to FS in exchange for 40 newly issued shares of FS stock.
(ii)
Analysis.
Paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not apply to the transfer by FT (an expatriated foreign subsidiary) of Asset A, which is specified property, to FS (the transferee foreign corporation)) because the requirements set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section are satisfied. The requirement set forth in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is satisfied because FS is a controlled foreign corporation immediately after the transfer. The requirement set forth in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section is satisfied if the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS is at least 90 percent of the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FT. Because USP, a domestic corporation that is an expatriated entity, directly owns 50 shares of FT stock immediately before the transfer, none of those shares are treated as indirectly owned by FP (a non-EFS foreign related person) for purposes of calculating the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FT. See paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Thus, for purposes of calculating the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FT, FP is treated as directly or indirectly owning 0 percent, or 0 of 50 shares, of the stock of FT. Accordingly, the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FT is 100 (calculated as 100 percent less 0 percent, the percentage of FT stock that non-EFS foreign related persons are treated as directly or indirectly owning immediately before the transfer). Consequently, for the requirement set forth in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section to be satisfied, the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS must be at least 90. Although FP directly owns 10 FS shares, none of the 50 FS shares that FP owns through USP (a domestic corporation that is an expatriated entity) are treated as indirectly owned by FP for purposes of calculating the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS because USP directly owns them. See paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Thus, for purposes of calculating the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS, FP is treated as directly or indirectly owning 10 percent, or 10 of 100 shares, of the stock of FS. As a result, the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS is 90 (calculated as 100 percent less 10 percent, the percentage of FS stock that non-EFS foreign related persons are treated as directly or indirectly owning immediately after the transfer). Therefore, because the post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to FS (90) is at least 90, the requirement set forth in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section is satisfied.
(g)
Income inclusion and gain recognition in exchanges occurring in connection with certain triangular reorganizations
—(1)
Rule.
If, in an exchange under section 354 or 356 that occurs in connection with a transaction described in § 1.367(b)-10, an exchanging shareholder exchanges stock or securities of a foreign acquired corporation, then, to the extent that the exchanging shareholder receives stock or securities of P acquired by S in exchange for property in the P acquisition, the shareholder must—
(i) Include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock that the shareholder exchanges; and
(ii) After taking into account the increase in basis in the stock provided in § 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii) resulting from the deemed dividend (if any), recognize all realized gain with respect to the stock or securities that would not otherwise be recognized.
(2)
Special rules and definitions.
For the purposes of this paragraph (g), an
exchanging shareholder
means a United States person or foreign person that exchanges stock of a foreign acquired corporation in a prescribed exchange, regardless of whether such United States person is a section 1248 shareholder or such foreign person is a foreign corporation in which a United States person is a section 1248 shareholder. As used in this paragraph (g), the terms P, S, property, and P acquisition have the meanings provided in § 1.367(b)-10(a), and the term
foreign person
means a person that is not a United States person.
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (g):
(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of FP and USS. FP is a foreign corporation that owns all of the stock of FS, a foreign corporation. USS is a domestic corporation that owns all of the stock of FT, a foreign corporation. USS owns 100 shares of stock of FT, which constitutes a single block of stock with a fair market value of $100x, an adjusted basis of $20x, and a section 1248 amount of $50x. FS has earnings and profits of $60x. A dividend from FS to FP would qualify for the exception to foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6). FP issues 100 shares of voting stock with a fair market value of $100x to FS, $40x of which
(the 40-percent FP block) is issued in exchange for $40x of newly issued common stock of FS and $60x of which (the 60-percent FP block) is issued in exchange for $60x of cash. FS acquires all of the stock of FT held by USS solely in exchange for the $100x of voting stock of FP (that is, FS exchanges both the 40-percent FP block and the 60-percent FP block) in a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B) (triangular B reorganization).
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Application of § 1.367(b)-10.
The triangular B reorganization is described in § 1.367(b)-10, and the $60x of cash constitutes property under § 1.367(b)-10(a)(3)(ii). Pursuant to § 1.367(b)-10(b)(1), adjustments must be made that have the effect of a distribution of property in the amount of $60x from FS to FP under section 301. The $60x deemed distribution is treated as separate from, and occurring immediately before, FS's acquisition of the 60-percent FP block used in the triangular B reorganization. The $60x deemed distribution from FS to FP results in $60x of dividend income to FP under section 301(c)(1) that is not foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6).
(B)
Application of paragraph (g) of this section.
Pursuant to § 1.367(a)-3(a)(2)(iv)(B), this paragraph (g) applies to $60x of the stock of FT (the 60-percent FT block) exchanged for the 60-percent FP block. Thus, under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, USS must include in income a $30x deemed dividend (representing 60 percent of USS's $50x section 1248 amount) with respect to the 60-percent FT block exchanged for the 60-percent FP block. In addition, under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, USS must recognize its realized gain that would not otherwise be recognized with respect to the 60-percent FT block. USS's fair market value and adjusted basis in the 60-percent FT block are $60x (60 percent of the $100x fair market value of the stock of FT) and $12x (60 percent of the $20x adjusted basis of the stock of FT), respectively. USS's initial built-in gain with respect to the 60-percent FT block is accordingly $48x ($60x fair market value less $12x adjusted basis). The $30x deemed dividend increases USS's basis in the 60-percent FT block to $42 ($12x + $30x), leaving $18x ($60x−$42x) of built-in gain. USS must therefore recognize the remaining $18x of gain with respect to the 60-percent FT block.
(C)
Application of paragraph (b) of this section and regulations under section 367(a).
USS has $32x of built-in gain in the remaining $40x of stock of FT (the 40-percent FT block) that USS exchanged for the 40-percent FP block, calculated as USS's initial $80 of built-in gain in all of its stock of FT less the $48x of initial built-in gain attributable to the 60-percent FT block. USS's section 1248 amount in the 40-percent FT block is $20x, calculated as 40 percent of USS's $50x section 1248 amount. USS does not recognize a deemed dividend of the $20x section 1248 amount under paragraph (b) of this section because FT remains a controlled foreign corporation with respect to which USS is a section 1248 shareholder immediately after the triangular B reorganization. Unless USS properly files a gain recognition agreement pursuant to §§ 1.367(a)-3(b) and 1.367(a)-8, USS recognizes the $32x of built-in gain under section 367(a)(1) with respect to the 40-percent FT block.
(h)
Definitions and special rules.
In addition to the definitions and special rules in §§ 1.367(b)-2 and 1.7874-12, the following definitions and special rules apply for purposes of this section.
(1)
Indirect ownership.
To determine indirect ownership of the stock of a corporation for purposes of calculating a pre-exchange ownership percentage or post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to that corporation, the principles of section 958(a) apply without regard to whether an intermediate entity is foreign or domestic. For this purpose, stock of the corporation that is directly or indirectly (applying the principles of section 958(a) without regard to whether an intermediate entity is foreign or domestic) owned by a domestic corporation that is an expatriated entity is not treated as indirectly owned by a non-EFS foreign related person.
(2) A
lower-tier expatriated foreign subsidiary
means an expatriated foreign subsidiary whose stock is directly or indirectly owned (under the principles
of section 958(a)) by an expatriated foreign subsidiary.
(3)
Pre-exchange ownership percentage
means, with respect to a corporation, 100 percent less the percentage of stock (by value) in the corporation that, immediately before an exchange, is owned, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly by non-EFS foreign related persons.
(4)
Post-exchange ownership percentage
means, with respect to a corporation, 100 percent less the percentage of stock (by value) in the corporation that, immediately after the exchange, is owned, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly by non-EFS foreign related persons.
(5)
Specified property
means any property other than stock of a lower-tier expatriated foreign subsidiary.
(6)
Recapitalizations.
A foreign corporation that undergoes a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(E) is treated as both the foreign acquired corporation and the transferee foreign corporation.
(7)
Triangular reorganizations
—(i)
Definition.
A triangular reorganization means a reorganization described in § 1.358-6(b)(2)(i) (forward triangular merger), (ii) (triangular C reorganization), (iii) (reverse triangular merger), (iv) (triangular B reorganization), and (v) (triangular G reorganization).
(ii)
Special rules
—(A)
Triangular reorganizations other than a reverse triangular merger.
In the case of a triangular reorganization other than a reverse triangular merger, the surviving corporation is the transferee foreign corporation that acquires the assets or stock of the foreign acquired corporation, and the reference to controlling corporation (foreign or domestic) is to the corporation that controls the surviving corporation.
(B)
Reverse triangular merger.
In the case of a reverse triangular merger, the surviving corporation is the entity that survives the merger, and the controlling corporation (foreign or domestic) is the corporation that before the merger controls the merged corporation. In the case of a reverse triangular merger, this section applies only if stock of the foreign surviving corporation is exchanged for stock of a foreign corporation in control of the merging corporation; in such a case, the foreign surviving corporation is treated as a foreign acquired corporation.
(i)
Applicability date of certain paragraphs in this section.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (i), paragraphs (a), (b) introductory text, (b)(1)(i)(C), (d)(1), (e), (f), and (h) of this section apply to exchanges completed on or after September 22, 2014, but only if the inversion transaction was completed on or after September 22, 2014. Paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section applies to exchanges completed on or after November 19, 2015, but only if the inversion transaction was completed on or after September 22, 2014. The portion of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section that requires the exchanging shareholder to be an expatriated entity or an expatriated foreign subsidiary apply to exchanges completed on or after April 4, 2016, but only if the inversion transaction was completed on or after September 22, 2014. For inversion transactions completed on or after September 22, 2014, however, taxpayers may elect to apply the portion of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section that requires the exchanging shareholder to be an expatriated entity or an expatriated foreign subsidiary to exchanges completed on or after September 22, 2014, and before April 4, 2016. Paragraphs (f) and (h)(5) of this section apply to transfers completed on or after April 4, 2016, but only if the inversion transaction was completed or after September 22, 2014. See § 1.367(b)-4, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016, for exchanges completed before September 22, 2014. Paragraph (g) of this section applies to transactions completed on or after December 2, 2016. Paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section applies to exchanges completed in taxable years of exchanging shareholders ending on or after November 2, 2020, and to taxable years of exchanging shareholders ending before November 2, 2020, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective on or before November 2, 2020, but was filed on or after November 2, 2020.

§ 1.367(b)-5
Distributions of stock described in section 355.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
This section provides rules relating to a distribution described in section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) and to which section 367(b) applies. For purposes of this section, the terms
distributing corporation, controlled corporation,
and
distributee
have the same meaning as used in section 355 and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Treatment of distributees as exchanging shareholders.
For purposes of the section 367(b) regulations, all distributees in a transaction described in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section shall be treated as exchanging shareholders that realize income in a section 367(b) exchange.
(b)
Distribution by a domestic corporation
—(1)
General rule.
In a distribution described in section 355, if the distributing corporation is a domestic corporation and the controlled corporation is a foreign corporation, the following general rules shall apply—
(i) If the distributee is a corporation, then the controlled corporation shall be considered to be a corporation; and
(ii) If the distributee is an individual, then, solely for purposes of determining the gain recognized by the distributing corporation, the controlled corporation shall not be considered to be a corporation, and the distributing corporation shall recognize any gain (but not loss) realized on the distribution.
(2)
Section 367(e) transactions.
The rules of paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to a foreign distributee to the extent gain is recognized under section 367(e)(1) and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Determining whether distributees are individuals.
All distributees in a distribution described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are presumed to be individuals. However, the shareholder identification principles of § 1.367(e)-1(d) (including the reporting procedures in § 1.367(e)-1(d)(2) and (3)) shall apply for purposes of rebutting this presumption.
(4)
Applicable cross-references.
For rules with respect to a distributee that is a partnership, trust or estate, see § 1.367(b)-2(k). For additional rules relating to a distribution of stock of a foreign corporation by a domestic corporation, see section 1248(f) and the regulations thereunder. For additional rules relating to a distribution described in section 355 by a domestic corporation to a foreign distributee, see section 367(e)(1) and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Pro rata distribution by a controlled foreign corporation
—(1)
Scope.
This paragraph (c) applies to a distribution described in section 355 in which the distributing corporation is a controlled foreign corporation and in which the stock of the controlled corporation is distributed pro rata to each of the distributing corporation's shareholders.
(2)
Adjustment to basis in stock and income inclusion.
If the distributee's postdistribution amount (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) with respect to the distributing or controlled corporation is less than the distributee's predistribution amount (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) with respect to such corporation, then the distributee's basis in such stock immediately after the distribution (determined under the normal principles of section 358) shall be reduced by the amount of the difference. However, the distributee's basis in such stock shall not be reduced below zero, and to the extent the foregoing reduction would have reduced basis below zero, the distributee shall instead include such amount in income as a deemed dividend from such corporation.
(3)
Interaction with § 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii).
The basis increase provided in § 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii) shall not apply to a deemed dividend that is included in income pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(4)
Basis redistribution.
If a distributee reduces the basis in the stock of the distributing or controlled corporation (or has an inclusion with respect to such stock) under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the distributee shall increase its basis in the stock of the other corporation by the amount of the basis decrease (or deemed dividend inclusion) required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section. However, the distributee's
basis in such stock shall not be increased above the fair market value of such stock and shall not be increased to the extent the increase diminishes the distributee's postdistribution amount with respect to such corporation.
(d)
Non-pro rata distribution by a controlled foreign corporation
—(1)
Scope.
This paragraph (d) applies to a distribution described in section 355 in which the distributing corporation is a controlled foreign corporation and in which the stock of the controlled corporation is not distributed pro rata to each of the distributing corporation's shareholders.
(2)
Treatment of certain shareholders as distributees.
For purposes of the section 367(b) regulations, all persons owning stock of the distributing corporation immediately after a transaction described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be treated as distributees of such stock. For other applicable rules, see paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(3)
Inclusion of excess section 1248 amount by exchanging shareholder.
If the distributee's postdistribution amount (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) with respect to the distributing or controlled corporation is less than the distributee's predistribution amount (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) with respect to such corporation, then the distributee shall include in income as a deemed dividend the amount of the difference. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), if a distributee owns no stock in the distributing or controlled corporation immediately after the distribution, the distributee's postdistribution amount with respect to such corporation shall be zero.
(4)
Interaction with § 1.367(b)—2(e)(3)(ii)
—(i)
Limited application.
The basis increase provided in § 1.367(b)—2(e)(3)(ii) shall apply to a deemed dividend that is included in income pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section only to the extent that such basis increase does not increase the distributee's basis above the fair market value of such stock and does not diminish the distributee's postdistribution amount with respect to such corporation.
(ii)
Interaction with predistribution amount.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), the distributee's predistribution amount (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) shall be determined without regard to any basis increase permitted under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.
(e)
Definitions
—(1)
Predistribution amount.
For purposes of this section, the predistribution amount with respect to a distributing or controlled corporation is the distributee's section 1248 amount (as defined in § 1.367(b)—2(c)(1)) computed immediately before the distribution (and after any section 368(a)(1)(D) transfer connected with the section 355 distribution), but only to the extent that such amount is attributable to the distributing corporation and any corporations controlled by it immediately before the distribution (the distributing group) or the controlled corporation and any corporations controlled by it immediately before the distribution (the controlled group), as the case may be, under the principles of §§ 1.1248-1(d)(3), 1.1248-2 and 1.1248-3. However, the predistribution amount with regard to the distributing group shall be computed without taking into account the distributee's predistribution amount with respect to the controlled group.
(2)
Postdistribution amount.
For purposes of this section, the postdistribution amount with respect to a distributing or controlled corporation is the distributee's section 1248 amount (as defined in § 1.367(b)-2(c)(1)) with respect to such stock, computed immediately after the distribution (but without regard to paragraph (c) or (d) of this section (whichever is applicable)). The postdistribution amount under this paragraph (e)(2) shall be computed before taking into account the effect (if any) of any inclusion under section 356(a) or (b).
(f)
Exclusion of deemed dividend from foreign personal holding company income.
In the event an amount is included in income as a deemed dividend by a foreign corporation under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section (including amounts received as an intermediate owner under the rule of § 1.367(b)-2(e)(2)), such deemed dividend shall not be included
as foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c).
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
USS, a domestic corporation, owns 40 percent of the outstanding stock of FD, a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). USS has owned the stock since FD was incorporated, and FD has always been a CFC. USS has a basis of $80 in its FD stock, which has a fair market value of $200. FD owns 100 percent of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation. FD has owned the stock since FC was incorporated. Neither FD nor FC own stock in any other corporation. FD has earnings and profits of $0 and a fair market value of $250 (not considering its ownership of FC). FC has earnings and profits of $300, none of which is described in section 1248(d), and a fair market value of $250. In a pro rata distribution described in section 355, FD distributes to USS stock in FC worth $100; thereafter, USS's FD stock is worth $100 as well.
(ii)
Result
—(A) FD's distribution is a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, USS must compare its predistribution amounts with respect to FD and FC to its respective postdistribution amounts. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USS's predistribution amount with respect to FD or FC is its section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution, but only to the extent such amount is attributable to FD or FC. Under § 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), USS's section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution is $120, all of which is attributable to FC. Thus, USS's predistribution amount with respect to FD is $0, and its predistribution amount with respect to FC is $120. These amounts are computed as follows: If USS had sold its FD stock immediately before the transaction, it would have recognized $120 of gain ($200 fair market value $80 basis). All of the gain would have been treated as a dividend under section 1248, and all of the section 1248 amount would have been attributable to FC (based on USS's pro rata share of FC's earnings and profits (40 percent × $300)).
(B) Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, USS's postdistribution amount with respect to FD or FC is its section 1248 amount with respect to such corporation, computed immediately after the distribution (but without regard to paragraph (c) of this section). Under § 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), USS's section 1248 amounts computed immediately after the distribution with respect to FD and FC are $0 and $60, respectively. These amounts, which are USS's postdistribution amounts, are computed as follows: Under the normal principles of section 358, USS allocates its $80 predistribution basis in FD between FD and FC according to the stock blocks' relative values, yielding a $40 basis in each block. If USS sold its FD stock immediately after the distribution, none of the resulting gain would be treated as a dividend under section 1248. If USS sold its FC stock immediately after the distribution, it would have a $60 gain ($100 fair market value—$40 basis), all of which would be treated as a dividend under section 1248.
(C) The basis adjustment and income inclusion rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply to the extent of any difference between USS's postdistribution and predistribution amounts. In the case of FD, there is no difference between the two amounts and, as a result, no adjustment or income inclusion is required. In the case of FC, USS's postdistribution amount is $60 less than its predistribution amount. Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, USS is required to reduce its basis in its FC stock from $40 to $0 and include $20 in income as a deemed dividend. Under § 1.367(b)-2(e)(2), the $20 deemed dividend is considered as having been paid by FC to FD, and by FD to USS, immediately prior to the distribution. Under paragraph (f) of this section, the deemed dividend is not included by FD as foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c). Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the basis increase provided in § 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii) does not apply with regard to the $20 deemed dividend. Under the rules of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, USS increases its basis in FD by the amount by which it decreased its basis in FC, as well as by the amount of its deemed dividend inclusion ($40 + $40 + $20 = $100).

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
USS1 and USS2, domestic corporations, each own 50 percent of the outstanding stock of FD, a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). USS1 and USS2 have owned their FD stock since it was incorporated, and FD has always been a CFC. USS1 and USS2 each have a basis of $500 in their FD stock, and the fair market value of each block of FD stock is $750. FD owns 100 percent of the outstanding stock of FC, a foreign corporation. FD owned the stock since FC was incorporated. Neither FD nor FC own stock in any other corporation. FD has earnings and profits of $0 and a fair market value of $750 (not considering its ownership of FC). FC has earnings and profits of $500, none of which is described in section 1248(d), and a fair market value of $750. In a non-pro rata distribution described in section 355, FD distributes all of the stock of FC to USS2 in exchange for USS2's FD stock.
(ii)
Result
—(A) FD's distribution is a transaction described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, USS1 is considered a distributee of FD stock. Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, USS1 and USS2 must compare their predistribution amounts with respect to FD and FC stock to their respective
postdistribution amounts. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USS1's predistribution amount with respect to FD or FC is USS1's section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution, but only to the extent such amount is attributable to FD or FC. USS2's predistribution amount is determined in the same manner. Under § 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), USS1 and USS2 each have a section 1248 amount computed immediately before the distribution of $250, all of which is attributable to FC. Thus, USS1 and USS2 each have a predistribution amount with respect to FD of $0, and each have a predistribution amount with respect to FC of $250. These amounts are computed as follows: If either USS1 or USS2 had sold its FD stock immediately before the transaction, it would have recognized $250 of gain ($750 fair market value—$500 basis). All of the gain would have been treated as a dividend under section 1248, and all of the section 1248 amount would have been attributable to FC (based on USS1's and USS2's pro rata shares of FC's earnings and profits (50 percent × $500)).
(B) Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a distributee that owns no stock in the distributing or controlled corporation immediately after the distribution has a postdistribution amount with regard to that stock of zero. Accordingly, USS2 has a postdistribution amount of $0 with respect to FD and USS1 has a postdistribution amount of $0 with respect to FC. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, USS1's postdistribution amount with respect to FD is its section 1248 amount with respect to such corporation, computed immediately after the distribution (but without regard to paragraph (d) of this section). USS2's postdistribution amount with respect to FC is determined in the same manner. Under § 1.367(b)-2(c)(1), USS1's section 1248 amount computed immediately after the distribution with respect to FD is $0 and USS2's section 1248 amount computed immediately after the distribution with respect to FC is $250. These amounts, which are USS1's and USS2's postdistribution amounts, are computed as follows: After the non-pro rata distribution, USS1 owns all the stock of FD and USS2 owns all the stock of FC. If USS1 sold its FD stock immediately after the distribution, none of the resulting $250 gain ($750 fair market value $500 basis) would be treated as a dividend under section 1248. If USS2 sold its FC stock immediately after the distribution, it would have a $250 gain ($750 fair market value—$500 basis), all of which would be treated as a dividend under section 1248.
(C) The income inclusion rule of paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies to the extent of any difference between USS1's and USS2's postdistribution and predistribution amounts. In the case of USS2, there is no difference between the two amounts with respect to either FD or FC and, as a result, no income inclusion is required. In the case of USS1, there is no difference between the two amounts with respect to its FD stock. However, USS1's postdistribution amount with respect to FC is $250 less than its predistribution amount. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, USS1 is required to include $250 in income as a deemed dividend. Under § 1.367(b)-2(e)(2), the $250 deemed dividend is considered as having been paid by FC to FD, and by FD to USS1, immediately prior to the distribution. This deemed dividend increases USS1's basis in FD ($500 + $250 = $750). Under paragraph (f) of this section, the deemed dividend is not included by FD as foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c).

§ 1.367(b)-7
Carryover of earnings and profits and foreign income taxes in certain foreign-to-foreign nonrecognition transactions.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies to an acquisition by a foreign corporation (foreign acquiring corporation) of the assets of another foreign corporation (foreign target corporation) in a transaction described in section 381 (foreign section 381 transaction). This section describes the manner and extent to which earnings and profits and foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation carry over to the surviving foreign corporation (foreign surviving corporation) and the ordering of distributions by the foreign surviving corporation. See § 1.367(b)-9 for special rules governing reorganizations described in section 368(a)(1)(F) and foreign section 381 transactions involving foreign corporations that hold no property and have no tax attributes immediately before the transaction, other than a nominal amount of assets (and related tax attributes).
(b)
General rules
—(1)
Non-previously taxed earnings and profits and related taxes.
Earnings and profits and related foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation (pre-transaction earnings and pre-transaction taxes, respectively) shall carry over to the foreign surviving corporation in the manner described in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section. Dividend distributions by the foreign surviving corporation (post-transaction distributions) shall be out of earnings and profits and shall reduce related foreign income taxes in the manner described in paragraph (c) of this section. See paragraph (g) of this section for rules applicable to taxable years of foreign corporations beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and taxable years of United States shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign corporations end (“post-2017 taxable years”).
(2)
Previously taxed earnings and profits.
[Reserved]
(c)
Ordering rule for post-transaction distributions.
Dividend distributions out of a foreign surviving corporation's earnings and profits shall be ordered in accordance with the rules of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, depending on whether the foreign surviving corporation is a pooling corporation or a nonpooling corporation.
(1)
If foreign surviving corporation is a pooling corporation.
In the case of a foreign surviving corporation that is a pooling corporation, post-transaction distributions shall be first out of the post-1986 pool (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) and second out of the pre-pooling annual layers (as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) under an annual last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
(2)
If foreign surviving corporation is a nonpooling corporation.
In the case of a foreign surviving corporation that is a nonpooling corporation, post-transaction distributions shall be out of the pre-pooling annual layers (as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) under the LIFO method.
(d)
Post-1986 pool.
If the foreign surviving corporation is a pooling corporation, then the post-1986 pool shall be determined under the rules of this paragraph (d).
(1)
In general
—(i)
Qualifying earnings and taxes.
The post-1986 pool shall consist of the post-1986 undistributed earnings and related post-1986 foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation.
(ii)
Carryover rule.
Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amounts described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section attributable to the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation shall carry over to the foreign surviving corporation and shall be combined on a separate category-by-separate category basis.
(2)
Hovering deficit
—(i)
In general.
If immediately prior to the foreign section 381 transaction either the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation has a deficit in one or more separate categories of post-1986 undistributed earnings or an aggregate deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits, such deficit will be a hovering deficit of the foreign surviving corporation. The rules of this paragraph (d)(2) apply to hovering deficits in separate categories of post-1986 undistributed earnings. See paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and
(e)(2)(iii) of this section for rules that apply to hovering deficits in pre-1987 accumulated profits. If the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation each have a post-1986 hovering deficit in the same separate category of post-1986 undistributed earnings, such deficits and their related post-1986 foreign income taxes shall be combined for purposes of applying this paragraph (d)(2). See also paragraphs (f)(1) and (4) of this section (describing other rules applicable to a deficit described in this paragraph (d)(2)).
(ii)
Offset rule.
A hovering deficit in a separate category of post-1986 undistributed earnings shall offset only earnings and profits accumulated by the foreign surviving corporation after the foreign section 381 transaction (post-transaction earnings) in the same separate category of post-1986 undistributed earnings. For purposes of this rule, however, post-transaction earnings do not include post-1986 undistributed earnings in the same category that are earned after the foreign section 381 transaction, but are distributed or deemed distributed in the same year they are earned (that is, that do not become accumulated). The offset shall occur as of the first day of the foreign surviving corporation's first taxable year following the year in which the post-transaction earnings accumulated.
(iii)
Related taxes.
Post-1986 foreign income taxes that are related to a hovering deficit in a separate category of post-1986 undistributed earnings shall only be added to the foreign surviving corporation's post-1986 foreign income taxes in that separate category on a pro rata basis as the hovering deficit is absorbed. Pro rata means in the same proportion as the portion of the hovering deficit that offsets post-transaction earnings in the separate category under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section bears to the total amount of the hovering deficit.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d). The examples assume the following facts: Foreign corporations A and B are controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) that were incorporated after December 31, 1986, have always been pooling corporations, and have always had calendar taxable years. None of the shareholders of foreign corporations A and B are required to include any amount in income under § 1.367(b)-4 as a result of the foreign section 381 transaction. Foreign corporations A and B (and all of their respective qualified business units as defined in section 989) maintain a “u” functional currency. Finally, unless otherwise stated, any post-1986 undistributed earnings in the passive category resulted from a look-through dividend that was paid by a lower-tier CFC out of earnings accumulated when the CFC was a noncontrolled section 902 corporation and that qualified for the subpart F same-country exception under section 954(c)(3)(A). The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.

(iii)
Post-transaction distribution.
(A) During 2007, foreign surviving corporation does not accumulate any earnings and profits or pay or accrue any foreign income taxes. On December 31, 2007, foreign surviving corporation distributes 300u to its shareholders. Under the rules described in § 1.902-1(d)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the distribution is out of, and reduces, post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes on a pro rata basis as follows:

(B) The foreign income taxes deemed paid by qualifying shareholders of foreign surviving corporation upon the distribution are subject to generally applicable rules and limitations, such as those of sections 78, 902, and 904(d).

Post-transaction earnings
—(A) In its taxable year ending on December 31, 2008, foreign surviving corporation accumulates earnings and profits and pays related foreign income taxes as follows:
Separate category

Foreign taxes
General
100u
$20
Passive
50u

(B) None of foreign surviving corporation's earnings and profits for its 2008 taxable year qualifies as subpart F income as defined in section 952(a). Under the rules described in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the hovering deficit in the passive category will offset the post-transaction earnings in that category and a proportionate amount of the foreign taxes related to the hovering deficit will be added to the post-1986 foreign income taxes pool. Because the post-transaction earnings in the passive category are half of the amount of the hovering deficit, half of the related taxes are added to the post-1986 foreign income taxes pool. Accordingly, foreign surviving corporation has the following post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes on January 1, 2009:

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 2
, except that the 50u of earnings in the passive category accrued by foreign surviving corporation during 2008 is subpart F income, all of which is included in income under section 951(a) by United States shareholders (as defined in section 951(b)). This example assumes that none of the United States shareholders are able to reduce their subpart F income inclusion with a qualified deficit under section 952(c)(1)(B).
(ii)
Result.
(A) Under the rule described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the (100u) hovering deficit in the passive category does not reduce foreign surviving corporation's current passive earnings and profits for purposes of determining subpart F income or associated deemed paid credits. Thus, foreign surviving corporation's United States shareholders include their pro rata shares of 50u in taxable income for the year and are eligible for a deemed paid foreign tax credit under section 960, computed by reference to their pro rata shares of $12.50 (50u subpart F inclusion / (50u + 50u post-1986 undistributed earnings in the passive category = 100u) = 50%, × $25 post-1986 foreign income taxes in the passive category = $12.50). The United States shareholders will also include their pro rata shares of the deemed-paid taxes of $12.50 in taxable income for the year as a deemed dividend pursuant to section 78.
(B) Immediately after the subpart F inclusion and section 960 deemed paid taxes (and taking into account the taxable year 2008 earnings and profits and related taxes in the general category), foreign surviving corporation has the following post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes:

(iii)
Post-transaction earnings and distribution.
(A) In its taxable year ending on December 31, 2007, foreign surviving corporation earns 100u in the general category and pays related foreign income taxes of $24. On December 31, 2007, foreign surviving corporation distributes 75u to its shareholders.
(B)
Result.
For purposes of determining the dividend amount under section 316 and the foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to that dividend under section 902, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section the hovering deficit does not offset the post-transaction current year earnings. Accordingly, the full 75u will be a dividend under section 316. The deemed paid taxes on that dividend are $17 (75u distribution / (100u current earnings + 50u accumulated earnings) = 50%, × ($10 accumulated foreign taxes + $24 current year foreign taxes) = $17). The 25u of undistributed earnings and profits in 2007 will be offset by (25u) of the hovering deficit for purposes of determining the opening balance of the post-1986 undistributed earnings pool in 2008. Because the amount of earnings offset by the hovering deficit is 25% of the amount of the hovering deficit, under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section $5 (25% of $20) of the related taxes are added to the post-1986 foreign income taxes pool at the beginning of the next taxable year. Accordingly, foreign surviving corporation has the following post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes on January 1, 2008:

Pre-pooling annual layers
—(1)
If foreign surviving corporation is a pooling corporation.
If the foreign surviving corporation is a pooling corporation, the pre-pooling annual layers shall be determined under the rules of this paragraph (e)(1).
(i)
Qualifying earnings and taxes.
The pre-pooling annual layers shall consist of the pre-1987 accumulated profits and the pre-1987 foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation.
(ii)
Carryover rule.
Subject to paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, the amounts described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section shall carry over to the foreign surviving corporation but shall not be combined. If the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation have pre-1987 accumulated profits in the same year and a distribution is made therefrom, the rules of § 1.902-1(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3) shall apply separately to reduce pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation on a pro rata basis. For further guidance, see Rev. Rul. 68-351 (1968-2 C.B. 307); Rev. Rul. 70-373 (1970-2 C.B. 152) (see also § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter); see also paragraph (f)(2) of this section (governing the reconciliation of taxable years).
(iii)
Deficit
—(A)
In general.
The rules of this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) apply when, immediately prior to the foreign section 381 transaction, the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation (or both) has a deficit in earnings and profits for one or more of the years that comprise its pre-1987 accumulated profits (see also paragraphs (f)(1) and (4) of this section, describing other rules applicable to a deficit described in this paragraph (e)(1)(iii)).
(B)
Aggregate positive pre-1987 accumulated profits.
If the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation (or both) has an aggregate positive (or zero) amount of pre-1987 accumulated profits, but a deficit in earnings and profits for one or more years, then the rules otherwise applicable to such deficits shall apply separately to the pre-1987 accumulated profits and related pre-1987 foreign income taxes of such corporation. A deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits for one or more years is applied to reduce pre-1987 accumulated profits on a LIFO basis. Any remaining deficit shall be applied to reduce pre-1987 accumulated profits in succeeding years. See Rev. Rul. 74-550 (1974-2 C.B. 209) (see also § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter);

As a result, no amount in excess of the aggregate positive amount of pre-1987 accumulated profits shall be distributed from the pre-transaction earnings of the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation.
(C)
Aggregate deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits.
If the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation (or both) has an aggregate deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits, a hovering deficit as defined under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, then the rules under § 1.902-2(b) shall apply to such hovering deficit (and related pre-1987 foreign income taxes) immediately prior to the transaction, except that the aggregate hovering deficit that is carried forward into the foreign surviving corporation's post-1986 pool shall offset only post-transaction earnings accumulated by the foreign surviving corporation in the same separate category of post-1986 undistributed earnings to which the relevant portion of the hovering deficit is attributable. Post-transaction earnings do not include earnings and profits that are
earned after the foreign section 381 transaction but distributed or deemed distributed in the same year they are earned.
(D)
Deficit and positive separate categories within annual layers.
For purposes of applying the rules of paragraphs (e)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, if within a single pre-pooling annual layer, the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation (or both) has a deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits in a separate category and positive pre-1987 accumulated profits in another separate category, the deficit shall first be used to offset the positive pre-1987 accumulated profits in the other separate category in the same pre-pooling annual layer. Any remaining deficit shall be carried forward or back to other years according to the rules of paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section as applicable.
(iv)
Pre-1987 section 960 earnings and profits and foreign income taxes.
The pre-1987 section 960 earnings and profits and pre-1987 section 960 foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation shall carry over to the foreign surviving corporation but shall not be combined. The rules otherwise applicable to such amounts shall apply separately to the pre-1987 section 960 earnings and profits and pre-1987 section 960 foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation on a pro rata basis. For further guidance, see Notice 88-70 (1988-2 C.B. 369) (see also § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e)(1). The examples assume the following facts: Foreign corporation A was incorporated in 2003 and was a nonpooling corporation through December 31, 2004. Foreign corporation A became a CFC on January 1, 2005 and, as a result, began to maintain a pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings on that date. Foreign corporation B was incorporated in 2003 and has always been owned by foreign shareholders (and thus never has met the requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B)). Both foreign corporation A and foreign corporation B have always had calendar taxable years. Foreign corporations A and B (and all of their respective qualified business units as defined in section 989) maintain a “u” functional currency. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all earnings and profits of foreign corporations A and B are in the general category. The examples are as follows:

Post-transaction distribution.
(A) During 2007, foreign surviving corporation does not accumulate any earnings and profits or pay or accrue any foreign income taxes. On December 31, 2007, foreign surviving corporation distributes 1,175u to its shareholders. Under the rules described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (e)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, the distribution is first out of the post-1986 pool, and then out of the pre-pooling annual layers, as follows:

(B) Under paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, the rules otherwise applicable when a foreign corporation has an aggregate positive (or zero) amount of pre-1987 accumulated profits, but a deficit in one or more years, apply separately to the pre-1987 accumulated profits and related foreign income taxes of foreign corporation A and foreign corporation B. As a result, distributions out of the pre-pooling annual layers of foreign corporation A and foreign corporation B cannot exceed the aggregate positive amount of pre-1987 accumulated profits of each corporation. Accordingly, only 50u can be distributed from foreign corporation A's pre-pooling annual layers and is out of its 2004 layer #1 (after rolling forward the (50u) deficit in 2003 layer #1 to reduce earnings in 2004 layer #1 to 50u (100u −50u)). Under the principles of § 1.902-1(b)(3), the full 20u of taxes related to 2004 layer #1 is reduced or deemed paid ($20 × (50/50)). 100u is distributed from foreign corporation B's 2006 annual layer. Foreign corporation B's (50u) deficit in 2005 is then rolled back to offset its 2003 annual layer to reduce earnings in that layer to 50u, 25u of which is distributed. Thus, after the distribution, 25u remains in 2003 layer # 2 along with 5u of foreign income taxes (10u × (25u/50u)).
(C) The foreign income taxes deemed paid by qualifying shareholders of foreign surviving corporation upon the distribution are subject to generally applicable rules and limitations, such as those of sections 78, 902, and 904(d).
(D) Immediately after the distribution, foreign surviving corporation has the following earnings and profits and foreign income taxes:

These foreign income taxes generally will not be reduced or deemed paid unless a foreign tax refund restores a positive balance to the associated earnings pursuant to section 905(c), and thus will be trapped. See § 1.902-2(b)(2).

Result.
(A) Because foreign corporation B has an aggregate hovering deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits, the rules of paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(C) of this section apply. Accordingly, § 1.902-2(b) applies immediately prior to the foreign section 381 transaction, except that the hovering deficit is carried forward into the foreign surviving corporation's post-1986 undistributed earnings pool and will offset only post-transaction earnings accumulated by foreign surviving corporation in the general category.

These foreign income taxes generally will not be reduced or deemed paid unless a foreign tax refund restores a positive balance to the associated earnings pursuant to section 905(c), and thus will be trapped. See § 1.902-2(b)(2).
(2)
If foreign surviving corporation is a nonpooling corporation.
If the foreign surviving corporation is a nonpooling corporation, then the pre-pooling annual layers shall be determined under the rules of this paragraph (e)(2).
(i)
Qualifying earnings and taxes.
The pre-pooling annual layers shall consist of the pre-1987 accumulated profits and the pre-1987 foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation. If the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation (or both) has post-1986 undistributed earnings or a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings, then those earnings or deficits and any related post-1986 foreign income taxes shall be recharacterized as pre-1987 accumulated profits or deficits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation accumulated immediately prior to the foreign section 381 transaction.
(ii)
Carryover rule.
Subject to paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the amounts described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section shall carry over to the foreign surviving corporation but shall not be combined. If the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation have pre-1987 accumulated profits in the same year and a distribution is made therefrom, the principles of § 1.902-1(b)(2)(ii) and (3) shall apply separately to reduce pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation on a pro rata basis. For further guidance, see Rev. Rul. 68-351 (1968-2 C.B. 307); Rev. Rul. 70-373 (1970-2 C.B. 152) (see also § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter); see also paragraph (f)(2) of this section (governing the reconciliation of taxable years).
(iii)
Deficits
—(A)
In general.
The rules of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii) apply when, immediately prior to the foreign section 381 transaction (and after application of the last sentence of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section), the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation (or both) has a deficit in one or more years that comprise its pre-1987 accumulated profits. See also paragraphs (f)(1) and (4) of this section (describing other rules applicable to a deficit described in this paragraph (e)(2)(iii)).
(B)
Aggregate positive pre-1987 accumulated profits.
If the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation (or both) has an aggregate positive (or zero) amount of pre-1987 accumulated profits, but a deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits in one or more years, then the rules otherwise applicable to such deficits shall apply separately to the pre-1987 accumulated profits and related foreign income taxes of such corporation. A deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits for one or
more years is applied to reduce pre-1987 accumulated profits on a LIFO basis. Any remaining deficit shall be applied to reduce pre-1987 accumulated profits in succeeding years. See Rev. Rul. 74-550 (1974-2 C.B. 209) (see also § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter);

v.
Commissioner,
81 T.C. 424 (1983), acq. in result, 1987-2 C.B. 1; Rev. Rul. 87-72 (1987-2 C.B. 170) (see also § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). As a result, no amount in excess of the aggregate positive amount of pre-1987 accumulated profits shall be distributed from the pre-transaction earnings of the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation.
(C)
Aggregate deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits.
If the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation (or both) has an aggregate deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits, a hovering deficit as defined under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, then the rules otherwise applicable to such hovering deficits shall apply separately to the pre-transaction earnings and profits and related taxes of the relevant corporation. See, e.g., sections 316(a) and 381(c)(2)(B). Thus, any hovering deficit shall offset only post-transaction earnings accumulated by the foreign surviving corporation in the same separate category of earnings and profits to which the relevant portion of the hovering deficit is attributable. Post-transaction earnings do not include earnings and profits that are earned after the foreign section 381 transaction but distributed or deemed distributed in the same year they are earned. Following the principles of § 1.902-2(b), if there is an aggregate deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits, any related pre-1987 foreign income taxes generally will not be reduced or deemed paid unless a foreign tax refund restores a positive balance to the associated earnings pursuant to section 905(c), and creates a pre-transaction aggregate positive balance for pre-1987 accumulated profits.
(D)
Deficit and positive separate categories within annual layers.
For purposes of applying the rules of paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, if within a single pre-pooling annual layer, the foreign acquiring corporation or the foreign target corporation (or both) has a deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits in a separate category and positive pre-1987 accumulated profits in another separate category, the deficit shall first be used to offset the positive pre-1987 accumulated profits in the other separate category in the same pre-pooling annual layer. Any remaining deficit shall be carried forward or back to other years according to the rules of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) or (C) as applicable.
(iv)
Pre-1987 section 960 earnings and profits and foreign income taxes.
The pre-1987 section 960 earnings and profits and pre-1987 section 960 foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation shall carry over to the foreign surviving corporation but shall not be combined. The rules otherwise applicable to such amounts shall apply separately to the pre-1987 section 960 earnings and profits and pre-1987 section 960 foreign income taxes of the foreign acquiring corporation and the foreign target corporation on a pro rata basis. For further guidance, see Notice 88-70 (1988-2 C.B. 369) (see also § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e)(2). The examples assume the following facts: Both foreign corporation A and foreign corporation B have always had calendar taxable years. Foreign corporations A and B (and all of their respective qualified business units as defined in section 989) maintain a “u” functional currency, and 1u = US$1 at all times. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all earnings and profits of foreign corporations A and B are in the general category. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
(A) Foreign corporations A and B both were incorporated in 2003. Nine percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation A is owned by domestic corporate shareholder C. Nine percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation B is owned by domestic corporate shareholder D. Shareholders C and D are unrelated. The remaining 91% of the voting stock of each foreign corporation is owned by unrelated foreign shareholders. Thus, neither corporation meets the requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B). On December 31, 2006, foreign corporations A and B have the following
earnings and profits and foreign income taxes:

Post-transaction distribution.
(A) During 2007, foreign surviving corporation does not accumulate any earnings and profits or pay or accrue any foreign income taxes. On December 31, 2007, foreign surviving corporation distributes 600u to its shareholders. Under the rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the distribution is out of pre-pooling annual layers under the LIFO method as follows:

(i)(A), except that foreign corporation A met the requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) on January 1, 2005, when U.S. corporate shareholder C acquired an additional 1% of voting stock for a total ownership interest of 10%; foreign corporation A thereby became a pooling corporation. On December 31, 2006, foreign corporations A and B have the following earnings and profits and foreign income taxes:

(iii)
Subsequent ownership change.
On July 1, 2010, USS (a domestic corporation) acquires 100% of the stock of foreign surviving corporation. Under the rules of paragraph (f)(3) of this section, foreign surviving corporation begins to pool its earnings and profits under section 902(c)(3) as of January 1, 2010. Foreign surviving corporation's earnings and profits and foreign income taxes accrued before January 1, 2010 retain their character as pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes.

# Example 3.

Immediately following the foreign section 381 transaction, foreign surviving corporation is a nonpooling corporation that does not meet the requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B).
(ii)
Result.
Because foreign corporations A and B have aggregate positive amounts of pre-1987 accumulated profits with a deficit in one or more years, the rules of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section apply. Accordingly, after the foreign section 381 transaction, foreign surviving corporation has the following earnings and profits and foreign income taxes:

(iii)
Post-transaction distribution.
(A) During 2007, foreign surviving corporation does not accumulate any earnings and profits or pay or accrue any foreign income taxes. On December 31, 2007, foreign surviving corporation distributes 1,300u to its shareholders. Under the rules described in paragraphs (c)(3) and (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the distribution is out of the pre-pooling annual layers, as follows:
E
P
Foreign taxes
Two Side-by-Side Layers of 2006 E

20u
2003 E
P:
2003 layer #1
50u
1.25u (25% of 5u taxes)
1,300u
(B) Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the rules otherwise applicable when a foreign corporation has an aggregate positive (or zero) amount of pre-1987 accumulated profits, but a deficit in one or more years, apply separately to the pre-1987 accumulated profits and related pre-1987 foreign income taxes of foreign corporation A and foreign corporation B. As a result, distributions out of the pre-pooling annual layers of foreign corporation A and foreign corporation B cannot exceed the aggregate positive amount of pre-1987 accumulated profits of each corporation. Accordingly, only 1,200u and 250u can be distributed out of foreign corporation A's and foreign corporation B's pre-pooling annual layers, respectively. Thus, 1,000u of the distribution is out of foreign corporation A's 2006 layer #1 and 250u is out of foreign corporation B's 2006 layer #2 (after rolling forward (50u) of the deficit in 2005 layer to reduce earnings in 2006 layer #1 to 250u (300u−50u)). Under the principles of § 1.902-1(b)(3), all of the taxes in each of those respective layers are reduced. The remaining 50u is distributed from foreign corporation A's 2003 layer #1 (after rolling back the (200u) deficit in 2004 layer #1 to reduce earnings in 2003 layer #1 to 200u (400u−200u)). Thus, after the distribution, 150u remains in the 2003 layer #1 along with 3.75u of foreign income taxes (5u × (150u/200u)).
(C) Foreign surviving corporation's foreign income tax accounts are reduced to reflect the distribution of earnings and profits notwithstanding that no shareholders are eligible to claim a credit for deemed paid foreign income taxes under section 902. See § 1.902-1(a)(10)(iii).
(D) Immediately after the distribution, foreign surviving corporation has the following earnings and profits and foreign income taxes:

(E) Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the 60u, 10u, 50u, and 5u of foreign income taxes related to foreign surviving corporation's 2005 layer, 2004 layer #1, 2004 layer #2, and 2003 layer #2, respectively, remain in those layers. These foreign income taxes generally will not be reduced or deemed paid unless a foreign tax refund restores a positive balance to the associated earnings pursuant to section 905(c), and thus will be trapped. See § 1.902-2(b)(2).

(B) On January 1, 2007, foreign corporation A acquires the assets of foreign corporation B in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C). Immediately following the foreign section 381 transaction, foreign surviving corporation is a nonpooling corporation.
(ii)
Result.
(A) Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, foreign corporation A's post-1986 pool is recharacterized as a 2006 layer of pre-1987 accumulated profits. Because after the foreign section 381 transaction foreign corporation A has an aggregate deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits, the rules of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(C) of this section apply and the rules otherwise applicable apply separately to the pre-1987 accumulated profits that carry over to foreign surviving corporation from foreign corporation A. The (800u) aggregate deficit in foreign corporation A's pre-1987 accumulated profits is a hovering deficit that will offset only post-transaction earnings accumulated by foreign surviving corporation in the general category. Accordingly, after the foreign section 381 transaction, foreign surviving corporation has the following earnings and profits and foreign income taxes:

These foreign income taxes generally will not be reduced or deemed paid unless a foreign tax refund restores a positive balance to the associated earnings pursuant to section 905(c), and thus will be trapped. See § 1.902-2(b)(2).
(iii)
Post-transaction distribution.
(A) During 2007, foreign surviving corporation does not accumulate any earnings and profits or pay or accrue any foreign income taxes. On December 31, 2007, foreign surviving corporation distributes 200u to its shareholders. Under the rules described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, no distribution can be made out of the pre-1987 accumulated profits of foreign corporation A (and the (800u) aggregate hovering deficit will offset only post-transaction earnings accumulated by foreign surviving corporation). Thus, the distribution is out of pre-pooling annual layers as follows:

Treatment of deficit
—(i)
General rule.
Any deficit described in paragraph (d)(2), (e)(1)(iii), or (e)(2)(iii) of this section shall not be
taken into account in determining current or accumulated earnings and profits of a foreign surviving corporation other than to offset post-transaction accumulated earnings, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, including for purposes of calculating—
(A) The earnings and profits limitation of section 952(c)(1)(A); and
(B) The amount of the foreign surviving corporation's subpart F income as defined in section 952(a).
(ii)
Exceptions.
The rule in paragraph (i) shall not apply for purposes of calculating an earnings and profits limitation under section 952(c)(1)(B) or (C).
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (f)(1). The examples assume the following facts: foreign corporation A, incorporated in 2002, is and always has been a wholly owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. Foreign corporation B, incorporated in 2004, is and always has been a wholly owned subsidiary of foreign corporation A. Both foreign corporation A and foreign corporation B are organized under the laws of foreign country X and have always had a calendar taxable year. Foreign corporations A and B (and all of their respective qualified business units as defined in section 989) maintain a “u” functional currency. Unless otherwise stated, any earnings and profits or deficit in earnings and profits of foreign corporation A and B in the general category are attributable to subpart F income derived from foreign base company sales income. Foreign corporation C is a wholly owned subsidiary of USP2 and was organized in 2004 under the laws of foreign country Y. Foreign corporation C (and all of its qualified business units as defined in section 989) maintains a “u” functional currency. Earnings and profits of foreign corporation C in the general category are not attributable to subpart F income. The examples are as follows:

(iii)
Post-transaction earnings and subpart F limitations.
(A) In its taxable year ending on December 31, 2008, foreign surviving corporation A earns 300u of subpart F general category income with respect to which it pays $50 in foreign income taxes. The hovering deficit of (100u) meets the requirements under section 952(c)(1)(B) and therefore is taken into account as a qualified deficit that may be used by USP to offset a portion of its income inclusion related to foreign surviving corporation A's subpart F income of 300u in the 2008 taxable year. Accordingly, USP includes 200u in taxable income for the year and is eligible for a deemed paid foreign tax credit under section 960 of $40 (200u subpart F inclusion/300 post-1986 undistributed earnings in the general category = 66.67%, × $60 foreign income taxes in the general category = $40). USP will also include the deemed paid foreign taxes of $40 in taxable income for the year as a deemed dividend pursuant to section 78. The 100u offset under section 952(c)(1)(B) does not result in a reduction of the hovering deficit for purposes of section 316 or section 902.
(B) Foreign surviving corporation A's 100u of subpart F income not included in income by USP will accumulate and be added to its post-1986 undistributed earnings as of the beginning of 2009. This 100u of post-transaction earnings will be offset by the (100u) hovering deficit. Because the amount of earnings offset by the hovering deficit is 100% of the total amount of the hovering deficit, all $25 of the related taxes are added to the post-1986 foreign income taxes pool as well. Accordingly, foreign surviving corporation A has the following post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes on January 1, 2009:

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
(A) On July 1, 2007, foreign corporation B elects under § 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter to be disregarded as an entity separate from foreign corporation A. Accordingly, foreign corporation B is deemed to have distributed all of its property to foreign corporation A in a liquidation described in section 332.
(B) Neither foreign corporation A nor B has any post-1986 undistributed earnings or post-1986 foreign income taxes as of the beginning of the 2007 taxable year. For its short taxable year ending on June 30, 2007, foreign corporation B has the following post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes:
Foreign Corporation B
Separate category

P

(C) For the 2007 taxable year, foreign surviving corporation A earns a total of 200u of subpart F foreign based company sales income in the general category with respect to which it pays $40 in foreign income taxes.
(ii)
Result.
(A) Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, foreign corporation B's (200u) deficit carries over to foreign surviving corporation A as a hovering deficit. Nevertheless, because it is a deficit of a qualified chain member for a taxable year ending within the 2007 taxable year of foreign surviving corporation A, the (200u) deficit meets the requirements under section 952(c)(1)(C) and therefore may still be taken into account for purposes of limiting foreign surviving corporation A's subpart F income. Accordingly, foreign surviving corporation A's 200u of subpart F income for the 2007 taxable year is fully offset by the (200u) deficit of foreign corporation B, and USP will have no subpart F income inclusion for the 2007 taxable year. The offset under section 952(c)(1)(C) does not result in a reduction of the hovering deficit for purposes of section 316 or section 902. The hovering deficit may not also be taken into account under section 952(c)(1)(B).
(B) Because USP has no subpart F income inclusion, foreign surviving corporation A's subpart F earnings of 200u will accumulate and be added to its post-1986 undistributed earnings as of the beginning of 2008. Under the rules of paragraph (f)(5) of this section, a pro rata amount, in this case 50% or 100u, will be deemed to have been accumulated prior to the foreign section 381 transaction and the other 50%, or 100u, will be deemed to have been accumulated after the foreign section 381 transaction. The 100u of post-transaction earnings will be offset by (100u) of the hovering deficit for purposes of determining the opening balance of the post-1986 undistributed earnings pool in 2008. Because the amount of earnings offset by the hovering deficit is 50% of the total amount of the hovering deficit, $15 (50% of $30) of the related taxes are added to the post-1986 foreign income taxes pool as well. The 100u of pre-transaction earnings remain in the post-1986 undistributed earnings pool. Accordingly, foreign surviving corporation A has the following post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes on January 1, 2008:

(B) On July 1, 2007, foreign corporation B acquires the assets of foreign corporation C in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C). Immediately following the foreign section 381 transaction, foreign surviving corporation B is a CFC.
(C) During the 2007 taxable year foreign surviving corporation B has a current deficit of (400u) and $60 of related foreign income taxes. During its short taxable year ending on June 30, 2007, foreign corporation C has no additional earnings and pays or accrues no foreign income taxes.
(ii)
Result.
(A) Under the rules of paragraph (f)(5) of this section, a pro rata amount, in this case 50% or (200u), of foreign surviving corporation B's (400u) current year deficit for the 2007 taxable year will be deemed to have been accumulated prior to the foreign section 381 transaction and be treated as a hovering deficit. The other 50%, or (200u) of the deficit will be deemed to have been accumulated after the foreign section 381 transaction. The related foreign income taxes of $60 will also be allocated on a similar 50/50 basis.
(B) Under the rules described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, foreign surviving corporation B has the following post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes as of January 1, 2008:

(iii)
Subpart F income limitations.
Even though (200u) of the current year deficit is treated as a hovering deficit, the full (400u) current year deficit in 2007 of foreign surviving corporation B meets the requirements under section 952(c)(1)(C) and therefore is available as a limitation on subpart F income, to the extent foreign corporation A, which wholly owns foreign surviving corporation B, earns any subpart F income in the 2007 taxable year. Any such offset under section 952(c)(1)(C) will have no effect on the earnings and profits and foreign income tax accounts above of foreign surviving corporation B for purposes of sections 316 and 902. Moreover, to the extent the hovering deficit reduces subpart F income under section 952(c)(1)(C), it may not also be taken into account under section 952(c)(1)(B).
(2)
Reconciling taxable years.
If a foreign acquiring corporation and a foreign target corporation had taxable years ending on different dates, then the pro rata distribution rules of paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section shall apply with respect to the taxable years that end within the same calendar year.
(3)
Post-transaction change of status.
If a foreign surviving corporation that is subject to the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section subsequently becomes a pooling corporation (by reason, for example, of a reorganization, liquidation, or change of ownership), then post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes that were recharacterized as pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes, respectively, under paragraph
(e)(2)(i) of this section retain their characterization as a pre-pooling annual layer.
(4)
Ordering rule for multiple hovering deficits
—(i)
Rule.
A foreign surviving corporation shall apply the deficit rules of paragraphs (d)(2), (e)(1)(iii), and (e)(2)(iii) of this section in that order if more than one of such rules applies to the foreign surviving corporation.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (f)(4). The example assumes the following facts: Foreign corporation A has been a pooling corporation since its incorporation on January 1, 1998. Foreign corporation B has been a nonpooling corporation since its incorporation on January 1, 2000. Foreign corporations A and B have always had calendar taxable years. Foreign corporations A and B (and all of their respective qualified business units as defined in section 989) maintain a “u” functional currency. All earnings and profits of foreign corporation B are in the general category. Finally, unless otherwise stated, any earnings and profits in the passive category resulted from a look-through dividend that was paid by a lower-tier CFC out of earnings accumulated when the CFC was a noncontrolled section 902 corporation and that qualified for the subpart F same-country exception under section 954(c)(3)(A). The example is as follows:

Under the rules described in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (e)(1)(i), (e)(1)(ii), and (e)(1)(iii) of this section, foreign surviving corporation has the following earnings and profits and foreign income taxes:

(B) None of the earnings and profits qualify as subpart F income as defined in section 952(a). Under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply before the rules of paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, post-transaction earnings in a separate category are first offset by a hovering deficit in the same separate category in the post-1986 pool. Thus, foreign surviving corporation's (300u) deficit in the general category offsets 300u of post-transaction earnings in the general category. After application of paragraph (d)(2)
of this section, the (200u) deficit in the general category carried forward from foreign corporation B's pre-pooling aggregate deficit offsets the remaining 100u of post-transaction earnings in the general category. Accordingly, foreign surviving corporation has the following earnings and profits and foreign income taxes at the end of 2007:

(C) Under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, all of the $25 of post-1986 foreign income taxes related to the (300u) hovering deficit in the general category is added to the foreign surviving corporation's post-1986 foreign income taxes of $60 in that category (because post-transaction earnings in the general category have exceeded the deficit in that category). Under paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(C) of this section, the 50u and 25u of foreign income taxes associated with foreign corporation B's pre-1987 accumulated profits for 2006 and 2005 remain in those layers. These foreign income taxes generally will not be reduced or deemed paid unless a foreign tax refund restores a positive balance to the associated earnings pursuant to section 905(c), and thus will be trapped. See § 1.902-2(b)(2).
(5)
Pro rata rule for earnings and deficits during transaction year.
(i) For purposes of offsetting post-transaction earnings of a foreign surviving corporation under the rules described in paragraphs (d)(2), (e)(1)(iii), and (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the earnings and profits, and any related foreign income taxes, in each separate category for the taxable year of the foreign surviving corporation in which the transaction occurs shall be deemed to have been accumulated after such transaction in an amount which bears the same ratio to the undistributed earnings and profits of the foreign surviving corporation for such taxable year (computed without regard to any earnings and profits carried over) as the number of days in the taxable year after the date of transaction bears to the total number of days in the taxable year. See, e.g., § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a)(7)
Example 2
(illustrating application of this rule with respect to domestic corporations).
(ii) For purposes of determining the amount of pre-transaction deficits described in paragraphs (d)(2), (e)(1)(iii), and (e)(2)(iii) of this section, of a foreign surviving corporation that has a deficit in earnings and profits in any separate category for its taxable year in which the transaction occurs, unless the actual accumulated earnings and profits, or deficit, as of such date can be shown, such pre-transaction deficit, and any related foreign income taxes, shall be deemed to have accumulated in a manner similar to that described in paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section. See, e.g., § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a)(7)
Example 4
(illustrating application of this rule with respect to domestic corporations).
(g)
Post-2017 taxable years.
As a result of the repeal of section 902 effective for taxable years of foreign corporations beginning on or after January 1, 2018, all foreign target corporations, foreign acquiring corporations, and foreign surviving corporations are treated as nonpooling corporations in post-2017 taxable years. Any amounts remaining in post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of any such corporation in any separate category as of the end of the foreign corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, are treated as earnings and taxes in a single pre-pooling annual layer in the foreign corporation's post-2017 taxable years for purposes of this section. Foreign income
taxes that are related to non-previously taxed earnings of a foreign acquiring corporation and a foreign target corporation that were accumulated in taxable years before the current taxable year of the foreign corporation, or in a foreign target's taxable year that ends on the date of the section 381 transaction, are not treated as current year taxes (as defined in § 1.960-1(b)(4)) of a foreign surviving corporation in any post-2017 taxable year. In addition, foreign income taxes that are related to a hovering deficit are not treated as current year taxes of the foreign surviving corporation in any post-2017 taxable year, regardless of whether the hovering deficit is absorbed.
(h)
Applicability dates.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (h), this section applies to foreign section 381 transactions that occur on or after November 6, 2006. Paragraph (g) of this section applies to taxable years of foreign corporations ending on or after November 2, 2020, and to taxable years of United States shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign corporations end.

Special rule for F reorganizations and similar transactions.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies to a foreign section 381 transaction (as defined in § 1.367(b)-7(a)) either—
(1) That is described in section 368(a)(1)(F); or
(2) That involves—
(i) At least one foreign corporation that holds no property and has no tax attributes immediately before the transaction, other than a nominal amount of assets (and related tax attributes) to facilitate its organization or preserve its existence as a corporation; and
(ii) No more than one foreign corporation that holds more than a nominal amount of property or has more than a nominal amount of tax attributes immediately before the transaction.
(b)
Hovering deficit rules inapplicable.
If a transaction is described in paragraph (a) of this section, a foreign surviving corporation shall succeed to earnings and profits, deficits in earnings and profits, and foreign income taxes without regard to the hovering deficit rules of § 1.367(b)-7(d)(2), (e)(1)(iii), and (e)(2)(iii).

(A) Foreign corporation A is and always has been a wholly owned subsidiary of USP, a domestic corporation. Foreign corporation A was incorporated in 1995, and has always had a calendar taxable year. Foreign corporation A (and all of its respective qualified business units as defined in section 989) maintains a “u” functional currency.

Result.
Under § 1.367(b)-7(d), as modified by paragraph (b) of this section, the pre-transaction deficit of foreign corporation A will not hover.

Foreign corporation B was incorporated in 2000 and foreign corporations C and D were incorporated in 2001. Foreign corporation B does not own any significant property and has no earnings and profits or foreign income taxes accounts. Both foreign corporations C and D have always had a calendar taxable year. Foreign corporations C and D (and all of their respective qualified
business units as defined in section 989) maintain a “u” functional currency. On December 31, 2006, foreign corporations C and D have the following post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes:

Result.
Although the merger is a foreign section 381 transaction involving a foreign corporation with no property or tax attributes, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply because more than one foreign corporation with significant tax attributes is involved in the foreign section 381 transaction.

§ 1.367(b)-10
Acquisition of parent stock or securities for property in triangular reorganizations.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, this section applies to a triangular reorganization if P or S (or both) is a foreign corporation and, in connection with the reorganization, S acquires in exchange for property all or a portion of the P stock or P securities (P acquisition) that are used to acquire the stock, securities or property of T in the triangular reorganization. This section applies to a triangular reorganization regardless of whether P controls (within the meaning of section 368(c)) S at the time of the P acquisition.
See
§ 1.367(b)-3(g) for the treatment of certain inbound nonrecognition transactions following transactions described in this section.
See
§ 1.367(b)-4(g) for rules applicable to certain exchanging shareholders that exchange stock of T in connection with a transaction described in this section.
(2)
Exceptions.
This section shall not apply if—
(i) P and S are foreign corporations and neither P nor S is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of § 1.367(b)-2(a)) immediately before or immediately after the triangular reorganization;
(ii) S is a domestic corporation, P is not a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of § 1.367(b)-2(a)), P's stock in S is not a United States real property interest (within the meaning of section 897(c)), and the deemed distribution that would result from the application of this section would not be treated as a dividend under section 301(c)(1) that would be subject to U.S. tax under either section 881 (for example, by reason of an applicable treaty or by reason of an absence of earnings and profits) or section 882; or
(iii) In an exchange under section 354 or 356, one or more U.S. persons exchange stock or securities of T and the
amount of gain in the T stock or securities that would otherwise be recognized under section 367(a)(1) is equal to or greater than the sum of the amount of the deemed distribution under this section that would be treated and subject to U.S. tax as a dividend under section 301(c)(1) (or would give rise to an inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) or 951A(a) that would be subject to U.S. tax) and the amount of such deemed distribution that would be treated and subject to U.S. tax as gain from the sale or exchange of property under section 301(c)(3) (or would give rise to an inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) or 951A(a) that would be subject to U.S. tax) if this section would otherwise apply to the triangular reorganization. The exception provided in this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) does not apply if T is a foreign corporation.
See
§ 1.367(a)-3(a)(2)(iv) (providing a similar rule that excludes certain transactions from the application of section 367(a)(1)).
(3)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(i) The terms
P, S,
and
T
have the meanings set forth in § 1.358-6(b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii), respectively.
(ii) The term
property
has the meaning set forth in section 317(a), except that the term property also includes—
(A) A liability assumed by S to acquire the P stock or securities;
(B) S stock (or any rights to acquire S stock) to the extent such S stock (or rights to acquire S stock) is used by S to acquire P stock or securities from a person other than P; and
(C) Stock of S that is nonqualified preferred stock (as defined in section 351(g)(2)).
(iii) The term
security
means an instrument that constitutes a security for purposes of section 354 or 356.
(iv) The term
triangular reorganization
has the meaning set forth in § 1.358-6(b)(2).
(b)
General rules
—(1)
Deemed distribution.
If this section applies, adjustments shall be made that have the effect of a distribution of property (with no built-in gain or loss) from S to P under section 301 (deemed distribution). The amount of the deemed distribution shall equal the sum of the amount of money transferred by S, the amount of any liabilities that are assumed by S and constitute property, and the fair market value of other property transferred by S in the P acquisition in exchange for the P stock or P securities described in paragraph (i) or (ii), respectively, of this paragraph (b)(1)—
(i) P stock received by T shareholders or securityholders in an exchange to which section 354 or 356 applies.
(ii) P securities received by T shareholders or securityholders to the extent such securities are “other property” (within the meaning of section 356(d)).
(2)
Timing of deemed distribution.
If P controls (within the meaning of section 368(c)) S at the time of the P acquisition, the adjustments described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are made as if the deemed distribution is a separate transaction occurring immediately before the P acquisition. If P does not control (within the meaning of section 368(c)) S at the time of the P acquisition, the adjustments described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are made as if the deemed distribution is a separate transaction occurring immediately after P acquires control of S, but before the reorganization.
(3)
Application of other provisions.
Nothing in this section shall prevent the application of other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code from applying to the P acquisition. For example, section 304 may apply to the P acquisition. Furthermore, section 1001 or 267 may apply to S's transfer of property to acquire P stock or securities from P or a person other than P. In addition, generally applicable provisions that apply to triangular reorganizations, such as § 1.358-6 and § 1.1032-2, shall apply to the triangular reorganization in a manner consistent with S acquiring the P stock or securities in exchange for property from P or a person other than P, as the case may be. Thus, P's adjustment to the basis in its S stock under § 1.358-6 is determined as if P provided the P stock or securities pursuant to the plan of reorganization, notwithstanding that S acquired the P stock or securities in exchange for property in the P acquisition.

(4)
Example.
The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following example:
(i)
Facts.
P, a publicly traded domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS, a foreign corporation, and all of the outstanding stock of US1, a domestic corporation that is a member of the P consolidated group. US1 owns all of the outstanding stock of FT, a foreign corporation, the fair market value of which is $100x. US1's basis in the FT stock is $100x, such that there is a no built-in gain or loss in the FT stock. FS has earnings and profits in excess of $100x. FS purchases $100x of P stock from the public on the open market in exchange for $100x of cash. Pursuant to foreign law, FT merges with and into FS in a triangular reorganization that qualifies under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(D). In an exchange to which section 354 applies, US1 exchanges all the outstanding stock of FT for the $100x of P stock purchased by FS on the open market.
(ii)
Analysis.
The triangular reorganization is described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. P is a domestic corporation and FS is a foreign corporation. In connection with FS purchasing the $100x of P stock in exchange for property (cash), FS uses the P stock to acquire the FT property in a triangular reorganization, and US1 receives the P stock in an exchange to which section 354 applies. Furthermore, none of the exceptions of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section apply. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, adjustments are made that have the effect of a deemed distribution of property (with no built-in gain or loss) in the amount of $100x from FS to P under section 301. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the adjustments described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are made as if the deemed distribution is a separate transaction occurring immediately before FS's purchase of the P stock on the open market. Generally applicable provisions apply to FS's purchase of the P stock on the open market (see, for example, section 304) and in determining certain tax consequences to P and FS as a result of the triangular reorganization (see, for example, § 1.358-6(d) and § 1.1032-2(c)). US1's transfer of its FT stock in exchange for P stock is subject to § 1.367(b)-4(g). If, contrary to the facts in this paragraph (b)(4), US1 had built-in gain with respect to its FT stock, then such gain would be recognized in accordance with § 1.367(b)-4(g).
(c)
Collateral adjustments.
This paragraph (c) provides additional rules that apply by reason of the deemed distribution described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A deemed distribution described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is treated as occurring for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, for example, the ordering rules of section 301(c) apply to characterize the deemed distribution to P as a dividend from the earnings and profits of S, return of stock basis, or gain from the sale or exchange of property, as the case may be. Furthermore, section 959 may apply to the deemed distribution if S is a foreign corporation, and section 881, 882, 897, 1442, or 1445 may apply to the deemed distribution if S is a domestic corporation. Appropriate corresponding adjustments must be made to S's earnings and profits consistent with the principles of section 312.
(d)
Anti-abuse rule
—(1)
Rule.
Appropriate adjustments must be made pursuant to this section if, in connection with a triangular reorganization, a transaction is engaged in with a view to avoid the purpose of this section. For example, if S is created, organized, or funded to avoid the application of this section with respect to the earnings and profits of another corporation, the earnings and profits of S (or any successor corporation) may be deemed to include the earnings and profits of such other corporation (or any successor corporation) for purposes of determining the consequences of the adjustments provided in this section, and appropriate corresponding adjustments may be made to account for the application of this section to the earnings and profits of such other corporation (or any successor corporation). Adjustments may be made under this paragraph (d) whether S is funded before or after a triangular reorganization, and such funding may include capital contributions, loans, and distributions. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d), the
application of which is not limited to the particular situations described in the examples.
(2)
Example 1: Deemed increase to S's earnings and profits
—(i)
Facts.
FP is a foreign corporation that owns all of the stock of USS, a domestic corporation. USS has no assets, liabilities, or earnings and profits. FP issues $10x of voting stock to USS in exchange for $10x of newly issued stock of USS, and FP also issues $90x of voting stock to USS in exchange for a note newly issued by USS with a fair market value of $90x (USS note). FP would be subject to U.S. tax under section 881 on a distribution from USS if, contrary to the facts, USS had earnings and profits for purposes of applying section 301(c) to the distribution. USS acquires all the stock of UST, a domestic corporation that is unrelated to FP and USS, from a foreign person in exchange for the $100x of voting stock of FP in a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B) (triangular B reorganization). UST has $100x of earnings and profits. USS's purchase of the $90x of stock of FP in exchange for the USS note in connection with the triangular B reorganization is engaged in with a view to avoid the purpose of this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because USS's purchase of the $90x of stock of FP in exchange for the USS note is engaged in with a view to avoid the purpose of this section, the anti-abuse rule applies and appropriate adjustments are made. In particular, for purposes of determining the consequences of the deemed distribution provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the earnings and profits of USS are deemed to include the earnings and profits of UST. USS is therefore treated as having made a deemed distribution equal to $90x, which reflects the portion of the stock of FP that USS acquired in exchange for property (the USS note). Because USS is deemed to have $100x of earnings and profits, the entire $90x deemed distribution is treated as a dividend under section 301(c)(1). The deemed distribution is treated as separate from, and occurring immediately before, USS's acquisition of the stock of FP used in the triangular B reorganization. No adjustments are made by FP to the basis in its stock of USS except as provided in § 1.358-6. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, FP's adjustment to the basis in its stock of USS under § 1.358-6 is determined as if FP provided all $100x of the stock of FP pursuant to the plan of reorganization.
(3)
Example 2: Downstream property transfer
—(i)
Facts.
USP is a domestic corporation that owns all of the stock of FS1, a foreign corporation, FS1 holds a note receivable issued by USP with a fair market value of $100x (USP note), and FS1 has more than $100x of earnings and profits. USP has no income inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(B) with respect to the USP note after the application of § 1.956-1(a)(2). FS1 forms USS Newco, a domestic corporation, to which it transfers the USP note in exchange for voting stock of USS Newco. USS Newco then forms FS2 Newco, a foreign corporation, and FS1 transfers all of its remaining assets (except for its stock in USS Newco) to FS2 Newco in exchange for additional voting stock of USS Newco in a transaction intended to qualify as a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C) (triangular C reorganization). FS1 liquidates into USP pursuant to the triangular C reorganization, and USP receives the stock of USS Newco held by FS1. FS1's transfer of the USP note to USS Newco in connection with the intended triangular C reorganization is engaged in with a view to avoid the purpose of this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because FS1's transfer of the USP note to USS Newco is in connection with a triangular reorganization and is engaged in with a view to avoid the purpose of this section, the anti-abuse rule applies and appropriate adjustments are made. FS1's formation of USS Newco and transfer of the USP note to USS Newco, together with the distribution of the shares of USS Newco pursuant to the liquidation of FS1, is treated under the anti-abuse rule as a distribution of $100x, consistent with its substance. Accordingly, adjustments are made consistent with there having been such a distribution. Because FS1 has more than $100x of earnings and profits, the adjustments made are consistent with USS Newco having received a $100x dividend
from FS1 separate from, and immediately before, the triangular C reorganization. USS Newco must therefore include $100x in gross income as if it had received that amount as a dividend and increase its earnings and profits by the same amount. FS1 must decrease its earnings and profits by $100x. For purposes of determining USS Newco's basis in its stock of FS2 Newco, § 1.367(b)-13 applies by treating USS Newco as P (within the meaning of § 1.367(b)-13(a)(2)(ii)). Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, USS Newco's adjustment to the basis in its FS2 Newco stock under § 1.367(b)-13 is determined as if USS Newco provided the stock of USS Newco stock pursuant to the plan of reorganization.

Example 3: Taxable debt exchange
—(i)
Facts.
USP is a domestic corporation that owns all of the stock of FP, a foreign corporation, and USS, a domestic corporation. Furthermore, FP owns all of the stock of FS, a foreign corporation, and USS owns all of the stock of UST, a domestic corporation. FP has no earnings and profits, and FS has more than $100x of earnings and profits. USP will not satisfy the requirements of sections 245A and 246(c) with respect to dividends received from FP. FS transfers a note issued by FS with a fair market value of $100x (FS note) to FP in exchange for $100x of voting stock of FP, and FS then uses the stock of FP to acquire all of the stock of UST held by USS in a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B) (triangular B reorganization). Because a dividend from FS to FP would not constitute foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6), the taxpayer asserts that the exception in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section applies and therefore does not make any adjustments pursuant to this section. FP then transfers the FS note to USP in exchange for a note issued by USP with a fair market value of $100x (USP note). The USP note constitutes United States property within the meaning of section 956(c), and USP would otherwise have an inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(B) and § 1.956-1(a)(2) if FP had earnings and profits. FS's transfer of the FS note to FP, and FP's subsequent transfer of the FS note to USP in connection with the triangular B reorganization, are engaged in with a view to avoid the purpose of this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because the transfers of the FS note are in connection with a triangular reorganization and are engaged in with a view to avoid the purpose of this section, the anti-abuse rule applies and appropriate adjustments are made. FS is therefore treated as having made a distribution to FP of $100x, reflecting the value of the stock of FP that FS acquired in exchange for property (the FS note). The deemed distribution is treated as separate from, and occurring immediately before, FS's acquisition of the stock of FP stock used in the triangular B reorganization. Because FS has more than $100x of earnings and profits, the entire deemed distribution is treated as a dividend under section 301(c)(1). The deemed dividend causes FP to increase its earnings and profits by $100x but does not constitute foreign personal holding company income to FP under section 954(c)(6). FP thus has $100x of earnings and profits available to support inclusions under section 951(a)(1)(B) in connection with FP's subsequent acquisition of the USP note. No adjustments are made by FP to the basis in its stock of FS except as provided in § 1.358-6. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, FP's adjustment to the basis in its stock of FS under § 1.358-6 is determined as if FP provided the stock of FP pursuant to the plan of reorganization.

§ 1.367(b)-13
Special rules for determining basis and holding period.
(a)
Scope and definitions
—(1)
Scope.
This section provides special basis and holding period rules to determine the basis and holding period of stock of certain foreign surviving corporations held by a controlling corporation whose stock is issued in an exchange under section 354 or 356 in a triangular reorganization. This section applies to transactions that are subject to section 367(b) as well as section 367(a), including transactions concurrently subject to sections 367(a) and (b).
(2)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(i) A block of stock has the meaning provided in § 1.1248-2(b).
(ii) The terms
P, S,
and
T
have the meanings set forth in § 1.358-6(b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii), respectively.

(c)
Determination of basis and holding period for triangular reorganizations
—(1)
Application.
In the case of a triangular reorganization described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, this paragraph (c) applies, if—
(i)(A) Immediately before the transaction, either P is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to S, or P is a foreign corporation and a United States person is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to both P and S; and
(B) In the case of a reverse triangular merger, P's exchange of S stock is not described in § 1.367(b)-3(a) and (b) or in § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i), (2)(i), or (3); or
(ii)(A) Immediately before the transaction, a shareholder of T is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to T, or a shareholder of T is a foreign corporation and a United States person is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to both such foreign corporation and T; and
(B) With respect to at least one of the exchanging shareholders described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the exchange of T stock is not described in § 1.367(b)-3(a) and (b) or in § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i), (2)(i), or (3).
(2)
Basis and holding period rules.
In the case of a triangular reorganization described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each share of stock of the surviving corporation (S or T) held by P must be divided into portions attributable to the S stock and the T stock immediately before the exchange. See paragraph (e) of this section
Examples 1
through
4
for illustrations of this rule.
(i)
Portions attributable to S stock
—(A) In the case of a forward triangular merger, a triangular C reorganization, or a triangular G reorganization, the basis and holding period of the portion of each share of surviving corporation stock attributable to the S stock is the basis and holding period of such share of stock immediately before the exchange.
(B) In the case of a reverse triangular merger, the basis and holding period of the portion of each share of surviving corporation stock attributable to the S stock is the basis and the holding period immediately before the exchange of a proportionate amount of the S stock to which the portion relates. If P is a shareholder described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section with respect to S, and P exchanges two or more blocks of S stock pursuant to the transaction, then each share of the surviving corporation (T) attributable to the S stock must be further divided into separate portions to account for the separate blocks of stock in S.
(C) If the value of S stock immediately before the triangular reorganization is less than one percent of the value of the surviving corporation stock immediately after the triangular reorganization, then P may determine its basis in the surviving corporation stock by applying the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section to determine the basis and holding period of the surviving corporation stock attributable to the T stock, and then increasing the basis of each share of surviving corporation stock by the proportionate amount of P's aggregate basis in the S stock immediately before the exchange (without dividing the stock of the surviving corporation into separate portions attributable to the S stock).
(ii)
Portions attributable to T stock
—(A) If any exchanging shareholder of T stock is described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the basis and holding period of the portion of each share of stock in the surviving corporation attributable to the T stock is the basis and holding period immediately before the exchange of a proportionate amount of the T stock to which such portion relates. If any exchanging shareholder of T stock is described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, and such shareholder exchanges two or more blocks of T stock pursuant to the
transaction, then each share of surviving corporation stock attributable to the T stock must be further divided into separate portions to account for the separate blocks of T stock.
(B) If no exchanging shareholder of T stock is described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the rules of § 1.358-6 apply to determine the basis of the portion of each share of the surviving corporation attributable to T immediately before the exchange.
(d)
Special rules applicable to divided shares of stock
—(1)
In general
—(i) Shares of stock in different blocks are aggregated into one divided portion for basis purposes, if such shares immediately before the exchange are owned by one or more shareholders that are—
(A) Not section 1248 shareholders with respect to the corporation; or
(B) Foreign corporate shareholders, provided that no United States persons are section 1248 shareholders with respect to both such foreign corporate shareholders and the corporation.
(ii) For purposes of determining the amount of gain realized on the sale or exchange of stock that has a divided portion pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, any amount realized on such sale or exchange will be allocated to each divided portion of the stock based on the relative fair market value of the stock to which the portion is attributable at the time the portions were created. See paragraph (e)
Example 5
of this section.
(iii) Shares of stock will no longer be required to be divided if section 1248 or section 964(e) would not apply to a disposition or exchange of such stock.
(2)
Pre-exchange earnings and profits.
All earnings and profits (or deficits) accumulated by a foreign corporation before the reorganization and attributable to a share (or block) of stock for purposes of section 1248 are attributable to the divided portion of stock with the basis and holding period of that share (or block). See § 1.367(b)-4(d).
(3)
Post-exchange earnings and profits.
Any earnings and profits (or deficits) accumulated by the surviving corporation subsequent to the reorganization are attributed to each divided share of stock pursuant to section 1248 and the regulations thereunder. The amount of earnings and profits (or deficits) attributable to a divided share of stock is further attributed to the divided portions of such share of stock based on the relative fair market value of each divided portion of stock. See paragraph (e)
Example 5
of this section.
(e)
Examples.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Blocks of stock exchanged in a triangular reorganization.
(i)
Facts.
(A) US1, a domestic corporation, owns all the stock of F1, a foreign corporation. F1 owns all the stock of FT, a foreign corporation, with 100 shares of stock outstanding. Each share of FT stock is valued at $10x. Because F1 acquired the stock of FT at two different dates, F1 owns two blocks of FT stock for purposes of section 1248. The first block consists of 60 shares. The shares in the first block have a basis of $300x ($5x per share), a holding period of 10 years, and $240x ($4x per share) of earnings and profits attributable to the shares for purposes of section 1248. The second block consists of 40 shares. The shares in the second block have a basis of $600x ($15x per share), a holding period of 2 years, and $80x ($2x per share) of earnings and profits attributable to the shares for purposes of section 1248.
(B) US2, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of FP, a foreign corporation, which owns all of the stock of FS, a foreign corporation. FP owns two blocks of FS stock. Each block consists of 10 shares with a value of $200x ($20x per share). The shares in the first block have a basis of $50x ($5x per share), a holding period of 10 years, and $50x ($5x per share) of earnings and profits attributable to such shares for purposes of section 1248. The shares in the second block had a basis of $100x ($10x per share), a holding period of 5 years, and $20x ($2x per share) of earnings and profits attributable to such shares for purposes of section 1248.
(C) FT merges into FS, with FS surviving, and F1 receives 50 shares of FP stock with a value of $1,000x in exchange for its FT stock. The merger of FT into FS qualifies as forward triangular merger, and immediately after the exchange US1 is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to F1, the exchanging shareholder, FP and FS, all of which are controlled foreign corporations.
(ii)
Basis and holding period determination.
(
1
) US1 is a section 1248 shareholder of F1, the exchanging shareholder, and FT (both of which are controlled foreign corporations) immediately before the transaction. Moreover, F1 is not required to include amounts in income under § 1.367(b)-3(b) or 1.367(b)-4(b) as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Accordingly, the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately after the triangular reorganization is
determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
(
2
) Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, each share of FS stock is divided into portions attributable to the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately before the exchange (the FS portion) and the FT stock held by F1 immediately before the exchange (the FT portion). The basis and holding period of the FS portion is the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately before the exchange. Thus, each share of FS stock in the first block has a portion with a basis of $5x, a value of $20x, a holding period of 10 years, and $5x of earnings and profits attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248. Each share of FS stock in the second block has a portion with a basis of $10x, a value of $20x, a holding period of 5 years, and $2x of earnings and profits attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248.
(
3
) Because the exchanging shareholder of FT stock (F1) has a section 1248 shareholder (US1), the holding period and basis of the FT portion is the holding period and the proportionate amount of the basis of the FT stock immediately before the exchange to which such portion relates. Further, because F1 exchanged two blocks of FT stock, the FT portion must be divided into two separate portions attributable to the two blocks of FT stock. Thus, each share of FS stock will have a second portion with a basis of $15x ($300x basis / 20 shares), a value of $30x ($600x value / 20 shares), a holding period of 10 years, and $12x of earnings and profits ($240x / 20 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248. Each share of FS stock will have a third portion with a basis of $30x ($600x basis / 20 shares), a value of $20x ($400x value / 20 shares), a holding period of 2 years, and $4x of earnings and profits ($80x / 20 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248.
(iii)
Subsequent disposition—first block.
Assume, immediately after the transaction, FP disposes of a share of FS stock from the first block. When FP disposes of any share of its FS stock, it is treated as disposing of each divided portion of such share. With respect to the first portion (attributable to the FS stock), FP recognizes a gain of $15x ($20x value − $5x basis), $5x of which is treated as a dividend under section 1248. With respect to the second portion (attributable to the first block of FT stock), FP recognizes a gain of $15x ($30x value − $15x basis), $12x of which is treated as a dividend under section 1248. With respect to the third portion (attributable to the second block of FT stock), FP recognizes a capital loss of $10x ($20x value − $30x basis).
(iv)
Subsequent disposition—second block.
Assume further, immediately after the transaction, FP also disposes of a share of stock from the second block of FS stock. With respect to the first portion (attributable to the FS stock), FP recognizes a gain of $10x ($20x value − $10x basis), $2x of which is treated as a dividend under section 1248. With respect to the second portion (attributable to the first block of FT stock), FP recognizes a gain of $15x ($30x value − $15x basis), $12x of which is treated as a dividend under section 1248. With respect to the third portion (attributable to the second block of FT stock), FP recognizes a capital loss of $10x ($20x value − $30x basis).

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that FS merges into FT with FT surviving in a reverse triangular merger. Pursuant to the merger, F1 receives FP stock with a value of $1,000x in exchange for its FT stock, and FP receives 10 shares of FT stock with a value of $1,000x in exchange for its FS stock. Immediately after the exchange, US1 is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to F1, the exchanging shareholder, FP, and FT, all of which are controlled foreign corporations.
(ii)
Basis and holding period determination
—(A) The basis and holding period of the stock of the surviving corporation held by FP are the same as in
Example 1,
except that each share of the surviving corporation (FT, instead of FS) will be divided into four portions instead of three portions. Because FP exchanges two blocks of FS stock, the FS portion must be divided into two separate portions attributable to the two blocks of FS stock. Because F1 exchanges two blocks of FT stock, the FT portion must be divided into two separate portions attributable to the two blocks of FT stock.
(B) Thus, each share of the surviving corporation (FT) will have a first portion (attributable to the first block of FS stock) with a basis of $5x ($50x / 10 shares), a value of $20x ($200x / 10 shares), a holding period of 10 years, and $5x of earnings and profits ($50x / 10 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248. Each share of FT stock will have a second portion (attributable to the second block of FS stock) with a basis of $10x ($100x / 10 shares), a value of $20x ($200x / 10 shares), a holding period of 5 years, and $2x of earnings and profits ($20x / 10 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248. Moreover, each share of FT stock will have a third portion (attributable to the first block of FT stock) with a basis of $30x ($300x basis / 10 shares), a value of $60x ($600x value / 10 shares), a holding period of 10 years, and $24x of earnings and profits ($240x / 10 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248. Lastly, each share of FT stock will have a fourth portion (attributable to the second block of FT stock) with a basis of $60x ($600x basis / 10 shares), a value of $40x ($400x value / 10 shares), a holding period of 2 years, and $8x of earnings and profits ($80x / 10 shares)
attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns all the stock of FS, a foreign corporation with 10 shares of stock outstanding. Each share of FS stock has a value of $10x, a basis of $5x, a holding period of 10 years, and $7x of earnings and profits attributable to such share for purposes of section 1248. FP, a foreign corporation, owns the stock of FT, another foreign corporation. FP and FT do not have any section 1248 shareholders. FT has assets with a value of $100x, a basis of $50x, and no liabilities. The FT stock held by FP has a value of $100x and a basis of $75x. FT merges into FS with FS surviving in a forward triangular merger. Pursuant to the reorganization, FP receives USP stock with a value of $100x in exchange for its FT stock.
(ii)
Basis and holding period determination
—(A) Because USP is a section 1248 shareholder of FS immediately before the transaction, the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by USP immediately after the triangular reorganization is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
(B) Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, each share of FS stock is divided into portions attributable to the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by USP immediately before the exchange (the FS portion) and the FT portion immediately before the exchange. Because FT does not have a section 1248 shareholder immediately before the transaction, the rules of § 1.358-6 apply to determine the basis of the FT portion of each share of FS stock. Those rules determine the basis of FS stock held by USP by reference to the basis of FT's net assets. The basis and holding period of the FS portion is the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by USP immediately before the exchange. Thus, each share of FS stock has a portion with a basis of $5x, a value of $10x, a holding period of 10 years, and $7x of earnings and profits attributable to such portion for section 1248 purposes. The basis of the FT portion is the basis of the FT assets to which such portion relates. Thus, each share of FS stock has a second portion with a basis of $5x ($50x basis in FT's assets / 10 shares) and a value of $10x ($100x value of FT's assets / 10 shares). All of FS's earnings and profits prior to the transaction ($70x) is attributed solely to the FS portion in each share of FS stock. As a result of each share of stock being divided into portions, the basis of the FS stock is not averaged with the basis of the FT assets to increase the section 1248 amount with respect to the stock of the surviving corporation (FS).

# Example 4.
(i)
Facts.
US, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of FT, a foreign corporation. The FT stock held by US constitutes a single block of stock with a value of $1,000x, a basis of $600x, and holding period of 5 years. USP, a domestic corporation, forms FS, a foreign corporation, pursuant to the plan of reorganization and capitalizes it with $10x of cash. FS merges into FT with FT surviving in a reverse triangular merger and a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B). Pursuant to the reorganization, US receives USP stock with a value of $1,000x in exchange for its FT stock, and USP receives 10 shares of FT stock with a value of $1,010x in exchange for its FS stock.
(ii)
Basis and holding period determination.
(A) US and USP are section 1248 shareholders of FT and FS, respectively, immediately before the transaction. Neither US nor USP is required to include amounts in income under § 1.367(b)-3(b) or 1.367(b)-4(b) as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) or (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. The basis and holding period of the FT stock held by USP is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
(B) Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, because the exchanging shareholder of FT stock (US) is a section 1248 shareholder of FT, each share of the surviving corporation (FT) has a proportionate amount of the basis and holding period of the FT stock immediately before the exchange to which such share relates. Thus, the portion of each share of FT stock attributable to the FT stock has a basis of $60x ($600x basis / 10 shares), a value of $100x ($1,000x value / 10 shares), and a holding period of 5 years. Because the value of FS stock immediately before the triangular reorganization ($10x) is less than one percent of the value of the surviving corporation (FT) immediately after the triangular reorganization ($1,010x), USP may determine its basis in the stock of the surviving corporation (FT) attributable to its FS stock basis held prior to the reorganization by increasing the basis of each share of FT stock by the proportionate amount of USP's aggregate basis in the FS stock immediately before the exchange (without dividing each share of FT stock into separate portions to account for FS and FT). If USP so elects, USP's basis in each share of FT stock is increased by $1x ($10x basis in FS stock / 10 shares). As a result, each share of FT stock has a basis of $61x, a value of $101x, and a holding period of 5 years.

# Example 5.
(i)
Facts.
US, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of F1, a foreign corporation, which owns all the stock of FT, a foreign corporation. The FT stock held by F1 constitutes one block of stock with a basis of $170x, a value of $200x, a holding period of 5 years, and $10x of earnings and profits attributable to such stock for purposes of section 1248. FP, a foreign corporation, owns all the stock of FS, a foreign corporation. FS has 10 shares of stock outstanding. No United States person is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to FP or FS. The FS stock held by FP has a value of $100x and a basis of $50x ($5x per share). FT merges into
FS with FS surviving in a forward triangular merger. Pursuant to the merger, F1 receives FP stock with a value of $200x for its FT stock in an exchange that qualifies for non-recognition under section 354. US is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to F1, the exchanging shareholder, FP, and FS (all of which are controlled foreign corporations) immediately after the exchange.
(ii)
Basis and holding period determination.
(A) Because US is a section 1248 shareholder of F1, the exchanging shareholder, and FT immediately before the transaction, and US is a section 1248 shareholder of F1, FP, and FS immediately after the transactions, F1 is not required to include amounts in income under §§ 1.367(b)-3(b) and 1.367(b)-4(b) as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Thus, the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately after the triangular reorganization is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
(B) Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, each share of FS stock is divided into portions attributable to the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately before the exchange (the FS portion) and the FT stock held by F1 immediately before the exchange (the FT portion). The basis and holding period of the FS portion is the basis and holding period of the FS stock held by FP immediately before the exchange. Thus, each share of FS stock has a portion with a basis of $5x and a value of $10x. Because the exchanging shareholder of FT stock (F1) has a section 1248 shareholder of both F1 and FT, the basis and holding period of the FT portion is the proportionate amount of the basis and the holding period of the FT stock immediately before the exchange to which such portion relates. Thus, each share of FS stock will have a second portion with a basis of $17x ($170x basis / 10 shares), a value of $20x ($200x value / 10 shares), a holding period of 5 years, and $1x of earnings and profits ($10x earnings and profits / 10 shares) attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248.
(iii)
Subsequent disposition.
(A) Several years after the merger, FP disposes of all of its FS stock in a transaction governed by section 964(e). At the time of the disposition, FS stock has decreased in value to $210x (a post-merger reduction in value of $90x), and FS has incurred a post-merger deficit in earnings and profits of $30x.
(B) Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, for purposes of determining the amount of gain realized on the sale or exchange of stock that has a divided portion, any amount realized on such sale or exchange is allocated to each divided portion of the stock based on the relative fair market value of the stock to which the portion is attributable at the time the portions were created. Immediately before the merger, the value of the FS stock in relation to the value of both the FS stock and the FT stock was one-third ($100x / ($100x plus $200x)). Likewise, immediately before the merger, the value of the FT stock in relation to the value of both the FT stock and the FS stock was two-thirds ($200x / $100x plus $200x). Accordingly, one-third of the $210x amount realized is allocated to the FS portion of each share and two-thirds to the FT portion of each share. Thus, the amount realized allocated to the FS portion of each share is $7x (one-third of $210x divided by 10 shares). The amount realized allocated to the FT portion of each share is $14x (two-thirds of $210x divided by 10 shares).
(C) Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, any earnings and profits (or deficits) accumulated by the surviving corporation subsequent to the reorganization are attributed to the divided portions of shares of stock based on the relative fair market value of each divided portion of stock. Accordingly, one-third of the post-merger earnings and profits deficit of $30x is allocated to the FS portion of each share and two-thirds to the FT portion of each share. Thus, the deficit in earnings and profits allocated to the FS portion of each share is $1x (one-third of $30x divided by 10 shares). The deficit in earnings and profits allocated to the FT portion of each share is $2x (two-thirds of $30x divided by 10 shares).
(D) When FP disposes of its FS stock, FP is treated as disposing of each divided portion of a share of stock. With respect to the FS portion of each share of stock, FP recognizes a gain of $2x ($7x value − $5x basis), which is not recharacterized as a dividend because a deficit in earnings and profits of $1x is attributable to such portion for purposes of section 1248. With respect to the FT portion of each share of stock, FP recognizes a loss of $3x ($14x value − $17x basis).

(3)
Useful life
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining the period of inclusions for deemed payments under § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(1), the useful life of intangible property is the entire period during which exploitation of the intangible property is reasonably anticipated to affect the determination of taxable income, as of the time of transfer. Exploitation of intangible property includes any direct or indirect use or transfer of the intangible property, including use without further development, use in the further development of the intangible property itself (and any exploitation of the further developed intangible property), and use in the development of other intangible property (and any exploitation of the other developed intangible property).
(ii)
Procedure to limit inclusions to 20 years.
In cases where the useful life of the transferred property is indefinite or is reasonably anticipated to exceed twenty years, taxpayers may, in lieu of including amounts during the entire useful life of the intangible property, choose in the year of transfer to increase annual inclusions during the 20-year period beginning with the first year in which the U.S. transferor takes into account income pursuant to section 367(d), to reflect amounts that, but for this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), would have been required to be included following the end of the 20-year period. See § 1.6038B-1(d)(1)(iv) for guidance on reporting this choice of method. If the taxpayer applies this method during the 20-year period, no adjustments will be made for taxable years beginning after the conclusion of the 20-year period. However, for purposes of determining whether amounts included during the 20-year period are commensurate with the income attributable to the transferred intangible property, the Commissioner may take into account information with respect to taxable years after that period, such as the income attributable to the transferred property during those later years. The application of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) must be reflected in a statement (titled “Application of 20-Year Inclusion Period to Section 367(d) Transfers”) attached to a timely filed original federal income tax return (including extensions) for the year of the transfer. An increase to the deemed payment rate made pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) will be irrevocable, and a failure to timely file the statement under this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) may not be remedied.
(iii)
Example.
Property subject to section 367(d) is transferred from USP, a domestic corporation, to FA, a foreign corporation wholly owned by USP. The useful life of the transferred property, inclusive of derivative works, at the time of transfer is indefinite but is reasonably anticipated to exceed 20 years. In the first five years following the transfer, sales related to the property are expected to be $100x, $130x, $160x, $180x and $187.2x, respectively. Thereafter, for the remainder of the property's useful life, sales are expected to grow by four percent annually. In the first five years following the transfer, operating profits attributable to the property are expected to be $5x, $8x, $11x, $12.5x, and $13x, respectively. Thereafter, for the remainder of the property's useful life, operating profits are expected to grow by four percent annually. It is determined that the appropriate discount rate for sales and operating profits is 10 percent. The present value of operating profits through the property's indefinite useful life is $185x. The present value of sales through the property's indefinite useful life is $2698x. Accordingly, the sales based royalty rate during the property's useful life is 6.8 percent ($185x/$2698x). The taxpayer may choose to take income inclusions into account over a 20-year period. The present
value of sales through the 20-year period is $1787x. Accordingly, the sales based royalty rate under the 20-year option is increased to 10.3 percent ($185x/$1787x).

(2)
Required adjustments.
If a U.S. transferor is required to recognize gain under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section or § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1), then, in addition to the adjustments described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(2) with respect to the deemed payment described in § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1)(ii)—
(i) For purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, the transferee foreign corporation reduces (but not below zero) the portion of its earnings and profits and gross income arising by reason of the subsequent disposition of the intangible property by the amount of gain recognized by the U.S. transferor under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section or § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1); and
(ii) The U.S. transferor may establish an account receivable from the transferee foreign corporation equal to the amount of gain recognized under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section or § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1) in accordance with § 1.367(d)-1T(g)(1).
(3)
Subsequent transfer of intangible property to related person.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section, a U.S. person's requirement to recognize income under § 1.367(d)-1T(c) or (e) is not affected by the transferee foreign corporation's subsequent disposition of the transferred intangible property to a related person. For purposes of any required adjustments, and of any accounts receivable created under § 1.367(d)-1T(g)(1), the related person that receives the intangible property is treated as the transferee foreign corporation.
(4)
Subsequent transfer of intangible property to qualified domestic person
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this section, if a U.S. person transfers intangible property subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361 and, within the useful life of the intangible property, that transferee foreign corporation subsequently disposes of the intangible property to a qualified domestic person, then—
(A) The U.S. transferor of the intangible property (or any person treated as such pursuant to § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1)) is required to recognize gain, as applicable, equal to the amount described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section; and
(B) If the U.S. transferor provides the information described in § 1.6038B-1(d)(2)(iv), then—
(
1
) The U.S. transferor is required to recognize a deemed payment as provided in § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1)(ii); and
(
2
) The intangible property is no longer subject to section 367(d), this section, or § 1.367(d)-1T after applying paragraphs (f)(4)(i)(A) and (f)(4)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section.
(ii)
Gain recognition for U.S. transferor.
The amount of gain a U.S. transferor must recognize under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section is determined as follows—
(A) If the intangible property is transferred basis property (as defined in section 7701(a)(43)) by reason of the subsequent disposition (determined
without regard to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T), the amount of gain, if any, the transferee foreign corporation would recognize if its adjusted basis in the intangible property were equal to the U.S. transferor's former adjusted basis in the property; or
(B) If the intangible property is not transferred basis property by reason of the subsequent disposition (determined without regard to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T), the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the intangible property on the date of the subsequent disposition over the U.S. transferor's former adjusted basis in that property.
(iii)
Qualified domestic person.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), a
qualified domestic person
means—
(A) The U.S. transferor that initially transferred intangible property subject to section 367(d);
(B) A U.S. person treated as a U.S. transferor under § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1), provided such person is an individual or a corporation other than a corporation exempt from tax under section 501(a), a regulated investment company (as defined in section 851(a)), a real estate investment trust (as defined in section 856(a)), a DISC (as defined in section 992(a)(1)), or an S corporation (as defined in section 1361(a));
(C) A U.S. person that is an individual related, within the meaning of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T(h), to the person described in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section; or
(D) A U.S. person that is a corporation related, within the meaning of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T(h), to the person described in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section, other than a corporation exempt from tax under section 501(a), a regulated investment company (as defined in section 851(a)), a real estate investment trust (as defined in section 856(a)), a DISC (as defined in section 992(a)(1)), or an S corporation (as defined in section 1361(a)).
(iv)
Qualified domestic person's basis in the intangible property.
The qualified domestic person's adjusted basis in the intangible property is—
(A) In the case of a subsequent disposition of intangible property described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, and subject to any applicable limitations that may apply under the Code, the lesser of the U.S. transferor's former adjusted basis in the intangible property or the transferee foreign corporation's adjusted basis in the intangible property (as determined immediately before the subsequent disposition), in each case increased by the greater of the amount of gain (if any) described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section and recognized by the U.S. transferor or the amount of gain (if any) recognized by the transferee foreign corporation as to the intangible property by reason of the subsequent disposition; or
(B) In the case of a subsequent disposition of intangible property described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the fair market value of the intangible property (as determined on the date of the subsequent disposition).
(v)
Special rule for related transactions.
If the transferee foreign corporation subsequently disposes of the transferred intangible property to a person that would, absent this paragraph (f)(4)(v), be a qualified domestic person (initial transferee) and, as part of a series of related transactions, the intangible property is subsequently disposed of to any other person, including by reason of multiple dispositions, then the initial transferee is treated as a qualified domestic person only if the ultimate recipient of the intangible property is a qualified domestic person.

paragraphs (f)(6)(ii)(D) and (E) of this section (
Examples 4
and
5
) for illustrations of the application of this paragraph (f)(4)(v).
(5)
Relief for certain failures to comply.
This paragraph (f)(5) provides relief if paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section would apply but for the U.S. transferor's failure to provide the information required by paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section (a “failure to comply”). When a failure to comply occurs, the subsequent disposition of the transferred intangible property is generally subject to paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Nevertheless, a failure to comply is deemed not to have occurred (regardless of whether
the U.S. transferor continued to include amounts in gross income under § 1.367(d)-1T(c) or (e) after the subsequent disposition), and the requirements of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section are treated as satisfied as of the date of the subsequent disposition if—
(i) Promptly after the U.S. transferor becomes aware of the failure, the U.S. transferor provides such information and provides a reasonable explanation for its failure to comply to the Director of Field Operations, Cross Border Activities Practice Area of Large Business
International (or any successor to the roles and responsibilities of such position, as appropriate), by eFax at (855) 582-4842 (or as otherwise directed on
irs.gov
), or, if any taxable year of the U.S. transferor is under examination when the discovery is made, to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the examination;
(ii) The U.S. transferor timely files an amended return for the taxable year in which the subsequent disposition occurred (and, if applicable, for each taxable year starting with the taxable year immediately after the taxable year in which the subsequent disposition occurred and ending with the taxable year in which the U.S. transferor seeks relief under this paragraph (f)(5)) that includes the information required by paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section; and
(iii) If any taxable year of the U.S. transferor is under examination when an amended return is filed, the U.S. transferor provides a copy of the amended return (or, if applicable, amended returns) to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the examination.

Facts.
In year 2, USP transfers all the stock of TFC to USS, a related person within the meaning of § 1.367(d)-1T(h) and paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, in a section 351 exchange to which § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1) applies (the year 2 transfer). In year 3, TFC distributes all its property (including the transferred IP) to USS pursuant to a complete liquidation to which sections 332 and 337 apply (the year 3 liquidation). The all earnings and profits amount determined under § 1.367(b)-2(d) with respect to the stock of TFC held by USS is $0. The information described in § 1.6038B-1(d)(2) is provided by USS for the taxable year in which the year 3 liquidation occurs.

The year 2 transfer.
Because the year 2 transfer involves a transfer of all the stock of TFC by USP (the initial U.S. transferor) to a related U.S. person (USS), under § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1)(i) USS (a successor U.S. transferor) is treated as receiving the right to receive a proportionate share of the contingent annual payments that USP would have otherwise taken into account under § 1.367(d)-1T(c). As determined under § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(4), USS's proportionate share of such payments is 100 percent. Accordingly, USS will annually include in its gross income the full amount of each of the annual payments that USP would otherwise have taken into account under § 1.367(d)-1T(c) over the useful life of the transferred IP, and USP will not
recognize any gain upon the year 2 transfer.
see
§ 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1)(ii) and (iii).

The year 3 liquidation.
The year 3 liquidation results in a subsequent disposition of the transferred IP to USS. USS, a U.S. person treated as the U.S. transferor pursuant to § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1), is a qualified domestic person within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, USS must recognize the amount of gain described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section. Because the year 3 liquidation is a complete liquidation to which sections 332 and 337 apply, the intangible property is transferred basis property (as defined in section 7701(a)(43) and determined without regard to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T), and therefore paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section applies to determine the amount of any gain USS must recognize. Because TFC does not recognize gain with respect to the transferred IP (regardless of the adjusted basis in the intangible property) by reason of the year 3 liquidation, the amount of gain described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is $0. Accordingly, USS does not recognize gain pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section by reason of the year 3 liquidation. Additionally, because USS provides the information described in § 1.6038B-1(d)(2), paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section applies to the year 3 liquidation. USS therefore recognizes a deemed payment representing the part of USS's taxable year during which TFC held the transferred IP pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section, and the required adjustments described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(2)(i) apply as to the deemed payment. Also, because USS does not recognize gain pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, the required adjustments described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section do not apply. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section, after taking the deemed payment into account, the transferred IP is no longer subject to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T. Finally, pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, USS's adjusted basis in the transferred IP is $0, which is equal to USP's former adjusted basis in the transferred IP ($0), increased by the greater of the amount of gain recognized by USS under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section ($0) or the amount of gain recognized by TFC upon the year 3 liquidation ($0).

Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that, instead of in year 3 TFC distributing all its property to USS pursuant to a complete liquidation, in year 3 TFC distributes the transferred IP to USS in a distribution described in section 311(b) when the fair market value of the transferred IP is $100x (the year 3 distribution). TFC's adjusted basis in the transferred IP immediately before the distribution is $0.
(

)
Analysis.
The consequence of the year 2 transfer is the same as described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A)(
2
)(
i
) of this section (
Example 1
). Like the consequences described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section (
Example 1
), the year 3 distribution is a subsequent disposition of the transferred IP to USS, a qualified domestic person. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, USS must recognize the amount of gain described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section. Because the year 3 distribution is described in section 311(b) the intangible property is not transferred basis property (as defined in section 7701(a)(43) and determined without regard to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T), and therefore USS must recognize $100x gain under paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. The $100x gain amount equals the excess of the fair market value of the transferred IP on the date of the year 3 distribution ($100x) over USP's former adjusted basis in the property ($0). TFC, because of USS's gain recognition under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, reduces (but not below zero) the portion of its earnings and profits and gross income arising by reason of the year 3 distribution by the amount of such gain under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Specifically, because the year 3 distribution requires USS to recognize $100x of gain,
TFC reduces the portion of its earnings and profits and gross income that arise by reason of the year 3 distribution, which is $100x (the excess of the fair market value of the transferred IP ($100x) over TFC's adjusted basis in the transferred IP ($0)), by $100x (the amount of gain USS recognizes pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section). As a result, after taking into account the reduction, TFC has no earnings and profits or gross income that arise by reason of the year 3 distribution. Furthermore, USS may establish an account receivable from TFC equal to $100x under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. Additionally, and as described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section (
Example 1
), pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section, USS recognizes a deemed payment for the portion of USS's taxable year during which TFC held the transferred IP, and the required adjustments described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(2) apply to this deemed payment. After taking these consequences into account, pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section, the transferred IP is no longer subject to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T. Finally, pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iv)(B) of this section, USS's adjusted basis in the transferred IP is $100x, which is the fair market value of the transferred IP on the date of the year 3 distribution.

Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that the transfer of stock of TFC to USS in year 2 does not occur and instead of the year 3 liquidation, in year 3 TFC transfers the intangible property to USS (a qualified domestic person as defined in paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section) in an exchange described in section 351(b) pursuant to which TFC recognizes $50x of gain and USP recognizes $50x of gain under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section (the year 3 exchange), which amount will reduce TFC's earnings and profits and gross income by $50x under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, USS's adjusted basis in the intangible property is $50x, which is the amount equal to the lesser of USP's former adjusted basis in the property ($0) or TFC's adjusted basis in the property ($0), increased by the greater of the amount of gain recognized by USP under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section ($50x) or the amount of gain recognized by TFC upon the year 3 exchange ($50x).

Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A)(

) of this section (
Example 1
), except that the year 3 liquidation occurs as part of a series of related transactions pursuant to which USS transfers the transferred IP that it receives from TFC to a related foreign corporation (FC1) in exchange for stock in FC1.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because the year 3 liquidation occurs as part of a series of related transactions pursuant to which the transferred IP is ultimately contributed to a FC1, a foreign corporation, and because a foreign corporation is not a qualified domestic person pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, then, under paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this section, the year 3 liquidation is not treated as a subsequent disposition described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, but is instead treated as a subsequent disposition described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.

(

)
Analysis.
Because the year 3 distribution occurs as part of a series of related transactions pursuant to which the transferred IP is distributed to USP, and because USP is a qualified domestic person pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this section does not prevent paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section from
applying to the year 3 distribution. Accordingly, the consequences under section 367(d) of the year 3 distribution are the same as those described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section (
Example 2
), and the consequences of the subsequent disposition of the transferred IP by USS to USP are determined after applying paragraph (f)(4) of this section to the transfer of the transferred IP by TFC to USS.

§ 1.367(d)-1T
Transfers of intangible property to foreign corporations (temporary).
(a)
Purpose and scope.
This section provides rules under section 367(d) concerning transfers of intangible property by U.S. persons to foreign corporations pursuant to section 351 or 361. Paragraph (b) of this section specifies the transfers that are subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section, while paragraph (c) provides rules concerning the consequences of such a transfer. In general, the U.S. transferor will be treated as receiving annual payments contingent on productivity or use of the transferred property, over the useful life of the property (regardless of whether such payments are in fact made by the transferee). Paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section provide rules for cases in which there is a later direct or indirect disposition of the intangible property transferred. In general, deemed annual license payments will continue if a transfer is made to a related person, while gain must be recognized immediately if the transfer is to an unrelated person. Paragraph (g) of this section provides several special rules, including a rule allowing appropriate adjustments where deemed payments under section 367(d) are not in fact received by the U.S. transferor of the intangible property, and a rule providing for a limited election to treat certain transfers of intangible property as sales at fair market value (in lieu of applying the general useful life-contingent payment rule). In addition, paragraph (g) of this section provides rules coordinating the application of section 367(d) with other relevant Code sections. Paragraph (h) of this section defines the term
related person
for purposes of this section. Finally, paragraph (i) of this section provides the effective date of this section. For rules concerning transfers of intangible property pursuant to section 332, see § 1.367(a)-5T(e). For purposes of determining whether a U.S. person has made a transfer of intangible property that is subject to the rules of section 367(d), the rules of § 1.367(a)-1T(c) shall apply.
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Deemed payments upon transfer of intangible property to foreign corporation
—(1)
In general.
If a U.S. person transfers intangible property that is subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361, then such person shall be treated as having transferred that property in exchange for annual payments contingent on the productivity or use of the property. Such person shall, over the useful life of the property, annually include in gross income an amount that represents an appropriate arms-length charge for the use of the property. The appropriate charge shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 482 and regulations thereunder. See § 1.482-2(d). The amount of the deemed payment thus calculated shall be reduced by any royalty or other periodic payment made or accrued by the transferee to an unrelated person during that taxable year for the right to use the intangible property. Amounts so included in the transferor's income shall be treated as ordinary income from sources within the United States. For purposes of computing estimated tax payments, deemed payments under this paragraph (c) shall be treated as received by the transferor on the last day of its taxable year.
(2)
Required adjustments.
The following adjustments shall be made with respect to a U.S. person's recognition of a deemed payment for the use of intangible property under this paragraph (c):
(i) For purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, the earnings and profits of the transferee foreign corporation shall be reduced by the amount of such deemed payment; and
(ii) For further guidance,
see
§ 1.367(d)-1(c)(2)(ii).
(3) [Reserved]
(4)
Blocked income.
No deemed payment included in a taxpayer's income under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be treated as deferrable income for purposes of applying rules relating to blocked foreign income. See Revenue Ruling 74-351, 1974-2 C.B. 144.
(d)
Subsequent transfer of stock of transferee foreign corporation to unrelated person
—(1)
Treatment as sale of intangible property.
If a U.S. person transfers intangible property that is subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361, and within the useful life of the intangible property that U.S. transferor subsequently disposes of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation to a person that is not a related person (within the meaning of paragraph (h) of this section), then the U.S. transferor shall be treated as having simultaneously sold the intangible property to the person acquiring the stock of the transferee foreign corporation. The U.S. transferor shall be required to recognize gain (but not loss) from sources within the United States in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the transferred intangible property on the date of the subsequent disposition and the U.S. transferor's former adjusted basis in that property (determined as of the original transfer). If the U.S. transferor's disposition of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation is subject to U.S. tax other than by reason of this paragraph (d), then the amount of gain otherwise required to be recognized with respect to the stock of the transferee foreign corporation shall be reduced by the amount of gain recognized with respect to the intangible property pursuant to this paragraph (d).
(2)
Required adjustments.
If a U.S. person disposes of the stock of a transferee foreign corporation, and under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is treated as having simultaneously sold intangible property, then, for purposes of computing basis and earnings and profits, the person acquiring the stock of the transferee foreign corporation shall be deemed to have purchased that property at fair market value and to have immediately thereafter contributed it to the transferee foreign corporation in a transaction not covered by section 367(d). Therefore, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code—
(i) The transferee foreign corporation's basis in the intangible property will be equal to its fair market value (as calculated for purposes of determining the gain required to be recognized by the U.S. transferor);
(ii) The acquiring person's basis in the stock of the transferee foreign corporation shall be determined as if no portion of the consideration given by the acquiring person for the stock is attributable to the intangible property; and
(iii) The earnings and profits of the transferee foreign corporation will not be affected by the transfer of its stock or the deemed transfer to it of the intangible property.
(e)
Subsequent transfer of stock of transferee foreign corporation to related person
—(1)
Transfer to related U.S. person treated as disposition of intangible property.
If a U.S. person transfers intangible property that is subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361 and, within the useful life of the transferred intangible property, that U.S. transferor subsequently transfers the stock of the transferee foreign corporation to U.S. persons that are related to the transferor within the meaning of paragraph (h) of this section, then the following rules shall apply:
(i) Each such related U.S. person shall be treated as having received (with the stock of the transferee foreign corporation) a right to receive a proportionate share of the contingent annual payments that would otherwise be deemed to be received by the U.S. transferor under paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) Each such related U.S. person shall, over the useful life of the property, annually include in gross income a proportionate share of the amount
that would have been included in the income of the U.S. transferor pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Such amounts shall be treated as ordinary income from sources within the United States.
(iii) The amount of income required to be recognized by the U.S. transferor pursuant to the rule of paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be reduced to the amount determined in accordance with the following formula:
(d)(1) amount × (100% − (e) percentage)
For purposes of the above formula, the (
d
)(
1
)
amount
is the income that would otherwise be required to be recognized by the transferor corporation pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and the (
e
)
percentage
is the percentage of the transferor corporation's total deemed rights to receive contingent annual payments under paragraph (c) of this section that is deemed to be transferred to related U.S. persons under the rules of this paragraph (e).
(iv) The rules of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall be reapplied in the case of any later transfer of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation by a related U.S. person that received such stock in a transfer that was subject to the rules of this paragraph (e). For purposes of reapplying the rules of paragraphs (d) and (e), each such related U.S. person shall be treated as a U.S. transferor of intangible property to the transferee foreign corporation (to the extent of the interest attributed to such person pursuant to subdivision (i) of this paragraph (e)(1)).
(2)
Required adjustments.
If a U.S. person transfers stock of a transferee foreign corporation to a U.S. related person in a transaction that is subject to the rules of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the following adjustments shall be made:
(i) For purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, the earnings and profits of the transferee foreign corporation shall be reduced by the amount of any payment deemed to be received by a related U.S. person under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section;
(ii) For further guidance,
see
§ 1.367(d)-1(e)(2)(ii);
(iii) For purposes of reapplying the rules of paragraph (d) and (e) of this section, if the related U.S. person is deemed to have received a right to contingent annual payments for the use of intangible property, then the U.S. related person shall be deemed to have held a proportionate share of the property with a basis equal to a proportionate share of the U.S. transferor's adjusted basis plus the gain, if any, recognized by the U.S. transferor on the earlier transfer of the stock to the U.S. related person, and then to have transferred that proportionate share of the property to the foreign corporation in a transfer subject to section 367(d); and
(iv) If the U.S. transferor is itself required to recognize gain upon the transfer by reason of the operation of paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1)(iii) of this section (because stock of the transferee foreign corporation is also transferred to unrelated persons), then those unrelated persons shall be deemed to have purchased a proportionate share of the transferred intangible property at fair market value and immediately contributed that property to the transferee foreign corporation, consistent with the general rule of paragraph (d)(2) of this section concerning transfers of stock to unrelated persons. Therefore, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code—
(A) Each unrelated person's basis in the stock of the transferee foreign corporation shall be increased to the extent of the gain recognized by the U.S. transferor upon the deemed purchase of intangible property by that person; and
(B) The transferee foreign corporation will receive an increase in its basis in the transferred intangible property equal to the fair market value of that portion of the intangible property deemed to be contributed to the transferee foreign corporation by unrelated persons (as calculated for purposes of determining the gain required to be recognized by the U.S. transferor).
(3)
Transfer to related foreign person not treated as disposition of intangible property.
If a U.S. person transfers intangible property that is subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361, and within the useful life of the transferred intangible property, that U.S. transferor subsequently transfers any
of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation to one or more foreign persons that are related to the transferor within the meaning of paragraph (h) of this section, then the U.S. transferor shall continue to include in its income the deemed payments described in paragraph (c) of this section in the same manner as if the subsequent transfer of stock had not occurred. The rule of this paragraph (e)(3) shall not apply with respect to the subsequent transfer by the U.S. person of any of the remaining stock to any related U.S. person or unrelated person.
(4)
Proportionate share.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), any “proportionate share” shall be determined by reference to the fair market value (at the time of the original transfer) of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation that was transferred by the U.S. transferor and the fair market value of all of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation originally received by the U.S. transferor.
(f)
Subsequent disposition of transferred intangible property by transferee foreign corporation
—(1)
In general.
If a U.S. person transfers intangible property that is subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361, and within the useful life of the intangible property that transferee foreign corporation subsequently disposes of the intangible property to an unrelated person, then—
(i) The U.S. transferor of the intangible property (or any person treated as such pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section) shall be required to recognize gain from U.S. sources (but not loss) in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the transferred intangible property on the date of the subsequent disposition and the U.S. transferor's former adjusted basis in that property (determined as of the original transfer); and
(ii) The U.S. transferor shall be required to recognize a deemed payment under paragraph (c) of this section for that part of its taxable year that the intangible property was held by the transferee foreign corporation and thereafter shall not be required to recognize any further deemed payments under paragraph (c) or (e)(1) of this section with respect to the transferred intangible property disposed of by the transferee foreign corporation.

Establishment of accounts receivable
—(i)
In general.
If a U.S. person is required to recognize income under the provisions of paragraph (c), (e), or (f) of this section, and the amount deemed to be received is not actually paid by the transferee foreign corporation, then the U.S. person may establish an account receivable from the transferee foreign corporation equal to the amount deemed paid that was not actually paid. A separate account receivable must be established for each taxable year in which payments deemed to be received are not actually made. Payments received from the transferee foreign corporation must be designated as payments upon a particular account and must be deducted from that account. Accounts receivable under this paragraph (g)(1) may be established and paid without further U.S. income tax consequences to the U.S. transferor or the transferee foreign corporation. No interest shall be paid or accrued on an account receivable created under this paragraph (g)(1), nor shall any bad debt deduction be allowed under section 166 with respect to any failure to receive payment on an account.
(ii)
Unpaid receivable treated as contribution to capital.
If any portion of an account receivable established under this paragraph (g)(1) remains unpaid as of the last day of the third taxable year following the taxable year to which the account relates, then—
(A) Such portion shall be deemed to have been paid on that date; and
(B) The U.S. person shall be deemed to have contributed an equivalent amount to the capital of the foreign corporation, and the U.S. person's basis in the stock of the foreign corporation shall, therefore, be increased by that amount.
(2)
Election to treat transfer as sale.
A U.S. person that transfers intangible property to a foreign corporation in a transaction subject to section 367(d)
may elect to recognize income in accordance with the rules of this paragraph (g)(2), if—
(i) [Reserved]
(ii) The transfer of the intangible property is either legally required by the government of the country in which the transferee corporation is organized as a condition of doing business in that country, or compelled by a genuine threat of immediate expropriation by the foreign government; or
(iii)(A) The U.S. person transferred the intangible property to the foreign corporation within three months of the organization of that corporation and as part of the original plan of capitalization of that corporation;
(B) Immediately after the transfer, the U.S. person owns at least 40 percent but not more than 60 percent of the total voting power and total value of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation;
(C) Immediately after the transfer, at least 40 percent of the total voting power and total value of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation is owned by foreign persons unrelated to the U.S. person;
(D) Intangible property constitutes at least 50 percent of the fair market value of the property transferred to the foreign corporation by the U.S. transferor; and
(E) [Reserved]
(F) A person that makes the election under this paragraph (g)(2) shall not be subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section. Such person shall instead recognize in the year of the transfer ordinary income from sources within the United States in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the intangible property transferred and its adjusted basis. A U.S. person shall make an election under this paragraph (g)(2) by notifying the Internal Revenue Service of the election in accordance with the requirements of section 6038B and regulations thereunder, and subsequently including the appropriate amounts in gross income in a timely filed tax return for the year of the transfer.
(3) [Reserved]
(4)
Coordination with section 482
—(i)
In general.
Section 367(d) and the rules of this section shall not apply in the case of an actual sale or license of intangible property by a U.S. person to a foreign corporation. If an adjustment under section 482 is required with respect to an actual sale or license of intangible property, then section 367(d) and the rules of this section shall not apply with respect to the required adjustment. If a U.S. person transfers intangible property to a related foreign corporation without consideration, or in exchange for stock or securities of the transferee in a transaction described in sections 351 or 361, no sale or license subject to adjustment under section 482 will be deemed to have occurred. Instead, the U.S. person shall be treated as having made a transfer of the intangible property that is subject to section 367(d).
(ii)
Sham licenses and sales.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, a purported sale or license of intangible property may be disregarded, and treated as a transfer subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section, if—
(A) The purported sale or license is made to a foreign corporation in which the transferor holds (or is acquiring) an interest; and
(B) The terms of the purported sale or license differ so greatly from the economic substance of the transaction or the terms that would obtain between unrelated persons that the purported sale or license is a sham.
The terms of a purported sale or license, for purposes of applying the rule of this paragraph (g)(4)(ii), shall be determined by reference not only to the nominal terms of the agreement but also to the actual practice of the parties under that agreement. A sale or license of intangible property shall not be disregarded under this paragraph (g)(4)(ii) solely because other property of an integrated business is simultaneously transferred to the foreign corporation by the U.S. transferor in a transaction described in section 367(a)(1) or any statutory or regulatory exception to section 367(a)(1).
(5)
Determination of fair market value.
For purposes of determining the gain required to be recognized immediately under paragraph (d), (f), or (g)(2) of this
section, the fair market value of transferred property shall be the single payment arm's-length price that would be paid for the property by an unrelated purchaser determined in accordance with the principles of section 482 and regulations thereunder. The allocation of a portion of the purchase price to intangible property agreed to by the parties to the transaction shall not necessarily be controlling for this purpose.
(6)
Anti-abuse rule.
If a U.S. person—
(i) Transfers intangible property to a domestic corporation with a principal purpose of avoiding the effect of section 367(d) and the rules of this section; and
(ii) Thereafter transfers the stock of that domestic corporation to a related foreign corporation,
then solely for purposes of section 367(d) that U.S. person shall be treated as having transferred the intangible property directly to the foreign corporation. A U.S. person shall be presumed to have transferred intangible property for a principal purpose of avoiding the effect of section 367(d) if the property is transferred to the domestic corporation less than two years prior to the transfer of the stock of that domestic corporation to a foreign corporation. The presumption created by the previous sentence may be rebutted by clear evidence that the subsequent transfer of the stock of the domestic transferee corporation was not contemplated at the time the intangible property was transferred to that corporation and that avoidance of section 367(d) and the rules of this section was not a principal purpose of the transaction. A transfer may have more than one principal purpose.
(h)
Related person.
For purposes of this section, persons are considered to be related if—
(1) They are partners or partnerships described in section 707(b)(1) of the Code; or
(2) They are related within the meaning of section 267 (b), (c), and (f) of the Code, except that—
(i) “10 percent or more” shall be substituted for “more than 50 percent” each place it appears; and
(ii) For further guidance,
see
§ 1.367(d)-1(h)(2)(ii).
(i)
Effective date.
Except as specifically provided to the contrary elsewhere in this section, this section applies to transfers occurring after December 31, 1984.

§ 1.367(e)-1
Distributions described in section 367(e)(1).
(a)
Purpose and scope.
This section provides rules for recognition (and nonrecognition) of gain by a domestic corporation (distributing corporation) on a distribution of stock or securities of a corporation (controlled corporation) to foreign persons that is described in section 355. Paragraph (b) of this section contains the general rule that gain is recognized on the distribution to the extent stock or securities of controlled are distributed to foreign persons. Paragraph (c) of this section provides an exception to the gain recognition rule for distributions of stock or securities of a domestic corporation. Paragraph (d) of this section contains rules for determining whether distributees of stock or securities in a section 355 distribution are qualified U.S. persons. Paragraph (e) of this section provides cross-references. Finally, paragraph (f) of this section specifies the effective date of this section.
(b)
Gain recognition
—(1)
General rule.
If a domestic corporation makes a distribution of stock or securities of a corporation that qualifies for nonrecognition under section 355 to a person who is not a qualified U.S. person, then, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the distributing corporation shall recognize gain (but not loss) on the distribution under section 367(e)(1). A distributing corporation shall not recognize gain under this section with respect to a section 355 distribution to a qualified U.S. person. For purposes of this section, a qualified U.S. person is—
(A) A citizen or resident of the United States; or
(B) A domestic corporation.
(2)
Stock owned through partnerships, disregarded entities, trusts, and estates.
For purposes of this section, distributing corporation stock or securities owned by or for a partnership (whether foreign or domestic) are owned proportionately by its partners. A partner's proportionate share of the stock or securities of the distributing corporation shall be equal to the partner's distributive share of the gain that would have been recognized had the partnership
sold the stock or securities (at a taxable gain) immediately before the distribution. The partner's distributive share of gain shall be determined under the rules and principles of sections 701 through 761 and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of this section, stock or securities owned by or for an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner (disregarded entity) under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter are owned directly by the owner of such disregarded entity. For purposes of this section, stock or securities owned by or for a trust or estate (whether foreign or domestic) are owned proportionately by the persons who would be treated as owning such stock or securities under section 318(a)(2)(A) and (B). In applying section 318(a)(2)(B)(i), if a trust includes interests that are not actuarially ascertainable, all such interests shall be considered to be owned by foreign persons. In a case where an interest holder in a partnership, a disregarded entity, trust, or estate that (directly or indirectly) owns stock of the distributing corporation is itself a partnership, disregarded entity, trust, or estate, the rules of this paragraph (b)(2) apply to such interest holder.
(3)
Gain computation.
Gain recognized under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock or securities distributed to persons who are not qualified U.S. persons (determined as of the time of the distribution) over the distributing corporation's adjusted basis in the stock or securities distributed to such distributees. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the distributing corporation's adjusted basis in each unit of each class of stock or securities distributed to a distributee shall be equal to the distributing corporation's total adjusted basis in all of the units of the respective class of stock or securities owned immediately before the distribution, divided by the total number of units of the class of stock or securities owned immediately before the distribution.
(4)
Treatment of distributee.
If the distribution otherwise qualifies for nonrecognition under section 355, each distributee shall be considered to have received stock or securities in a distribution qualifying for nonrecognition under section 355, even though the distributing corporation may recognize gain on the distribution under this section. Thus, the distributee shall not be considered to have received a distribution described in section 301 or a distribution in an exchange described in section 302(b) upon the receipt of the stock or securities of the controlled corporation, and the domestic distributing corporation shall have no withholding responsibilities under section 1441. Except where section 897(e)(1) and the regulations thereunder cause gain to be recognized by the distributee, the basis of the distributed domestic or foreign corporation stock in the hands of the foreign distributee shall be the basis of the distributed stock determined under section 358 without any increase for any gain recognized by the domestic corporation on the distribution.
(c)
Nonrecognition of gain.
A domestic distributing corporation shall not recognize gain under paragraph (b)(1) of this section on the distribution of stock or securities of a domestic corporation.
(d)
Determining whether distributees are qualified U.S. persons
—(1)
General rule—presumption of foreign status.
Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, all distributions of stock or securities in a distribution described in section 355 in which the distributing corporation is domestic and the controlled corporation is foreign are presumed to be to persons who are not qualified U.S. persons, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(2)
Non-publicly traded distributing corporations.
If the class of stock or securities of the distributing corporation (in respect to which stock or securities of the controlled corporation are distributed) is not regularly traded on a qualified exchange or other market (as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section), then the distributing corporation may only rebut the presumption contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section by identifying the qualified U.S. persons to which controlled corporation stock or securities were distributed and by certifying the amount of stock or securities that were distributed to the qualified U.S. persons.
(3)
Publicly traded distributing corporations.
If the class of stock or securities of the distributing corporation (in respect to which stock or securities of the controlled corporation are distributed) is regularly traded on a qualified exchange or other market (as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section), then the distributing corporation may only rebut the presumption contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section as described in this paragraph (d)(3).
(i)
Five percent shareholders.
A publicly traded distributing corporation may only rebut the presumption contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to distributees that are five percent shareholders of the class of stock or securities of the distributing corporation (in respect to which stock or securities of the controlled corporation are distributed) by identifying the qualified U.S. persons to which controlled corporation stock or securities were distributed and by certifying the amount of stock or securities that were distributed to the qualified U.S. persons. A five percent shareholder is a distributee who is required under U.S. securities laws to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a Schedule 13D or 13G under 17 CFR 240.13d-1 or 17 CFR 240.13d-2, and provide a copy of same to the distributing corporation under 17 CFR 240.13d-7.
(ii)
Other distributees.
A distributing corporation that has made a distribution described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may rebut the presumption contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to distributees that are not five percent shareholders (as defined in this paragraph (d)(3)) by relying on and providing a reasonable analysis of shareholder records and other relevant information that demonstrates a number of distributees that are qualified U.S. persons. Taxpayers may rely on such analysis, unless it is subsequently determined that there are actually fewer distributees who are qualified U.S. persons than were demonstrated in the analysis.
(4)
Qualified exchange or other market.
For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, the term qualified exchange or other market means, for any taxable year—
(i) A national securities exchange which is registered with the SEC or the national market system established pursuant to section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f); or
(ii) A foreign securities exchange that is regulated or supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the market is located and which has the following characteristics—
(A) The exchange has trading volume, listing, financial disclosure, and other requirements designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and to protect investors; and the laws of the country in which the exchange is located and the rules of the exchange ensure that such requirements are actually enforced; and
(B) The rules of the exchange ensure active trading of listed stocks.
(e)
Cross-references.
For additional rules relating to the distribution of the stock of a foreign corporation by a domestic corporation, see §§ 1.367(a)-3(e), 1.367(a)-7, 1.367(b)-5, and 1.1248(f)-1 through 1.1248(f)-3. See the regulations under section 6038B for reporting requirements for distributions under this section.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section shall be applicable to distributions occurring in taxable years ending after August 8, 1999.
[T.D. 8834, 64 FR 43076, Aug. 9, 1999; 65 FR 14467, Mar. 3, 2000, as amended by T.D. 9614, 78 FR 17041, Mar. 19, 2013; T.D. 9760, 81 FR 15169, Mar. 22, 2016]
§ 1.367(e)-2
Distributions described in section 367(e)(2).
(a)
Purpose and scope
—(1)
In general.
This section provides rules requiring gain and loss recognition by a corporation on its distribution of property to a foreign corporation in a complete liquidation described in section 332. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section contains the general rule that gain and loss are recognized when a domestic corporation makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332
to a foreign corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in the domestic corporation. Paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides the only exceptions to the gain and loss recognition rule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Paragraph (b)(3) of this section refers to other consequences of distributions described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section contains the general rule that gain and loss are not recognized when a foreign corporation makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in the foreign liquidating corporation. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides the only exceptions to the nonrecognition rule of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section refers to other consequences of distributions described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section contains an anti-abuse rule. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules regarding failures to file statements or other documents required under this section or failures to comply with the requirements of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section provides relief for certain failures to file or comply. Finally, paragraph (g) of this section specifies the effective/applicability dates for the rules of this section. The rules of this section are issued pursuant to the authority conferred by section 367(e)(2).
(2)
Nonapplicability of section 367(a).
Section 367(a) shall not apply to a complete liquidation described in section 332 by a domestic liquidating corporation into a foreign corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b).
(b)
Distribution by a domestic corporation
—(1)
General rule
—(i)
Recognition of gain and loss.
If a domestic corporation (domestic liquidating corporation) makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation (foreign distributee corporation) that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in the domestic liquidating corporation, then—
(A) Section 337(a) and (b)(1) will not apply; and
(B) The domestic liquidating corporation will recognize gain or loss on the distribution of property to the foreign distributee corporation, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(ii)
Operating rules
—(A)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section, the rules contained in section 336 will apply to the gain and loss recognized pursuant to this section.
(B)
Overall loss limitation
—(
1
)
Overall loss limitation rule.
Loss in excess of gain from the distribution shall not be recognized. If realized losses exceed recognized losses, the losses shall be recognized on a pro rata basis with respect to the realized loss attributable to each distributed loss asset in the category of assets (i.e., capital or ordinary) to which the realized but unrecognized loss relates. For additional limitations on the recognition of losses, see, e.g., section 1211.
(
2
)
Example.
The following example illustrates the overall loss limitation rule, the pro rata loss allocation method, and the general capital loss limitation rule in section 1211(a):

# Example.
F, a foreign corporation, owns all stock of US1, a domestic corporation. US1 owns the following capital assets: Asset A, which has a fair market value of $100 and an adjusted basis of $40; Asset B, which has a fair market value of $60 and an adjusted basis of $80; and, Asset C, which has a fair market value of $40 and an adjusted basis of $100. US1 also owns the following business assets that will generate ordinary income (or loss) upon disposition: Asset D, which has a fair market value of $100 and an adjusted basis of $40; Asset E, which has a fair market value of $60 and an adjusted basis of $100; and, Asset F, which has a fair market value of $40 and an adjusted basis of $80. US1 liquidates into F and distributes all assets to F in liquidation. None of the assets qualify for nonrecognition under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. US1's total realized capital loss is $80, but it may only recognize $60 of that loss. See section 1211(a). US1's total realized ordinary loss is $80, but it may only recognize $60 of that loss. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section. US1 will allocate $15 (60 × .25) of the recognized capital loss to Asset B and will allocate the remaining $45 (60 × .75) of recognized capital loss to
Asset C. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section. US1 will allocate $30 (60 × .50) of the recognized ordinary loss to Asset E and will allocate the remaining $30 (60 × .50) to Asset F. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section.
(C)
Special rules for built-in gains and losses attributable to property received in liquidations and reorganizations.
Built-in losses attributable to property received in a transaction described in sections 332 or 361 (during the two-year period ending on the date of the distribution in liquidation covered by this section) shall not offset gain from property not received in the same transaction. Built-in gains attributable to property received in a transaction described in sections 332 or 361 (during the two-year period ending on the date of the distribution in liquidation covered by this section) shall not be offset by a loss from property not received in the same transaction. Built-in gain or loss is that amount of gain or loss on property that existed at the time the domestic liquidating corporation acquired such property. See sections 336(d) and 382 for additional limitations on the recognition of losses.
(iii)
Distribution of partnership interest
—(A)
General rule.
If a domestic corporation distributes a partnership interest (whether foreign or domestic) in a distribution described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, then for purposes of applying this section the domestic liquidating corporation shall be treated as having distributed a proportionate share of partnership property. Accordingly, the applicability of the recognition rules of paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, and of any exception to recognition provided in this section shall be determined with reference to the partnership property, rather than to the partnership interest itself. Where the partnership property includes an interest in a lower-tier partnership, the applicability of any exception with respect to the interest in the lower-tier partnership shall be determined with reference to the lower-tier partnership property. In the case of multiple tiers of partnerships, the applicability of an exception shall be determined with reference to the property of each partnership, applying the rule contained in the preceding sentence. A domestic liquidating corporation's proportionate share of partnership property shall be determined under the rules and principles of sections 701 through 761 and the regulations thereunder.
(B)
Gain or loss calculation.
[Reserved]
(C)
Basis adjustments.
The foreign distributee corporation's basis in the distributed partnership interest shall be equal to the domestic liquidating corporation's basis in such partnership interest immediately prior to the distribution, increased by the amount of gain and reduced by the amount of loss recognized by the domestic liquidating corporation on the distribution of the partnership interest. Solely for purposes of sections 743 and 754, the foreign distributee corporation shall be treated as having purchased the partnership interest for an amount equal to the foreign corporation's adjusted basis therein.
(D)
Publicly traded partnerships.
The distribution by a domestic liquidating corporation of an interest in a publicly traded partnership that is treated as a corporation for U.S. income tax purposes under section 7704(a) shall not be subject to the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. Instead, the distribution of such an interest shall be treated in the same manner as a distribution of stock. Thus, a transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership that is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. income tax purposes shall be treated in the same manner as stock in a domestic corporation, and a transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership that is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. income tax purposes shall be treated in the same manner as stock in a foreign corporation.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Distribution of property used in a U.S. trade or business
—(A)
Conditions for nonrecognition.
A domestic liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain or loss under paragraph (b)(1) of this section on its distribution of property (including inventory) used by the domestic liquidating corporation in the conduct of a trade or business within United States, if—
(
1
) The foreign distributee corporation, immediately thereafter and for the ten-year period beginning on the
date of the distribution of such property, uses the property in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States;
(
2
) The domestic liquidating corporation attaches the statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section to its timely filed U.S. income tax returns for the taxable years that include the distributions in liquidation; and
(
3
) The foreign distributee corporation attaches a copy of the property description contained in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section to its timely filed U.S. income tax returns for the tax year that includes the date of distribution.
(B)
Qualifying property.
Property is used by the foreign distributee corporation in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(2)(i) only if all income from the use of the property and all income or gain from the sale or exchange of the property would be subject to taxation under section 882(a) as effectively connected income. Also, stock held by a dealer as inventory or for sale in the ordinary course of its trade or business shall be treated as inventory and not as stock in the hands of both the domestic liquidating corporation and the distributee foreign corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exception provided in this paragraph (b)(2)(i) shall not apply to intangibles described in section 367(d)(4).
(C)
Required statement.
The statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section shall be entitled “Required Statement under § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(i)” and shall be prepared by the domestic liquidating corporation and signed under penalties of perjury by an authorized officer of the domestic liquidating corporation and by an authorized officer of the foreign distributee corporation. The statement shall contain the following items:
(
1
) A declaration that the distribution to the foreign distributee corporation is one to which the rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(i) apply and a certification that the domestic liquidating corporation and the foreign distributee corporation agree to comply with all the conditions and requirements of this section, including, as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, to treat a failure to comply (as described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section) as extending the period of limitations on assessment of tax for the taxable year in which gain is required to be reported.
(
2
)
Property description.
A description of all property distributed by the domestic liquidating corporation (irrespective of whether the property qualifies for nonrecognition).

)
Taxable dispositions.
If, within the ten-year period from the date of a distribution of qualifying property, the foreign distributee corporation disposes of any qualifying property in a transaction subject to tax under section 882(a), then the foreign distributee corporation shall recognize such gain (or loss) and properly report it on a timely filed U.S. income tax return. If the foreign distributee corporation recognizes gain (or loss) under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(

)
Other triggering events.
If, within the ten-year period from the date of distribution, any qualifying property ceases to be used by the foreign distributee corporation in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (other than by reason of a taxable disposition described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(

5
) of this section), then the foreign distributee corporation shall recognize gain (but not loss) attributable to such property and properly report it on a timely filed U.S. income tax return. If the foreign distributee corporation properly reports gain under this paragraph (or if such qualified property is not gain property on the date that it ceases to be used in the foreign distributee corporation's U.S. trade or business), then the domestic liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain attributable to such property under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(

)
General rule.
If, within the ten-year period from the date of distribution, any qualifying property described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section ceases to be used by the foreign distributee corporation (or a qualifying transferee described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(
5
) of this section) in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States for any reason (including but not limited to the sale or exchange of such property or the removal of the property from conduct of the trade or business), then, except to the extent gain (or loss) is recognized under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(
1
) of this section, the domestic liquidating corporation shall recognize the gain (but not loss) realized but not recognized upon the initial distribution of such item of property. The domestic liquidating corporation

)(
i
) of this section, the foreign distributee corporation shall file an amended U.S. income tax return on behalf of the domestic liquidating corporation for the year of the distribution of such item of property. On the amended return, the domestic liquidating corporation may use any losses (or credits) existing in the year of the distribution to offset the gain recognized pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(
2
)(
i
) of this section (or the tax thereon), provided that the losses (or credits) were otherwise available in the year distribution and were not used in another year. The amended return shall be filed no later than the due date (including extensions) for the return of the foreign distributee corporation for the taxable year in which the property ceases to be used by the foreign distributee corporation in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
(

(
iv
)
Joint and several liability.
The foreign distributee corporation shall be jointly and severally liable for any tax owed by the domestic liquidating corporation as a result of the application of this section, and shall succeed to the domestic liquidating corporation's agreement to extend the statute of limitations on assessments and collections under section 6501.
(

)
Schedule for property no longer used in a U.S. trade or business.
If qualifying property (other than inventory) ceases to be used by the foreign distributee corporation in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business in the ten-year period beginning on the date of distribution of such property from the domestic liquidating corporation to the foreign distributee corporation, then the foreign distributee corporation shall list on a separate schedule (attached to its timely filed U.S. income tax return for the year of cessation) all such qualifying property. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(
3
), property ceases to be used in a U.S. trade or business whenever such property is sold, exchanged, or otherwise removed from the U.S. trade or business, irrespective of whether the domestic liquidating corporation filed an amended return under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(
2
) of this section, and irrespective of whether the property ceases to be used in the foreign distributee corporation's U.S. trade or business by virtue of a nontriggering event described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(

Also, the abandonment or disposal of worthless or obsolete property shall not trigger gain (or loss) under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E).
(
ii
)
Amendment to Master Property Description.
If the foreign distributee corporation acquires replacement property by virtue of a conversion or exchange of the qualifying property under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(

)
Nontriggering transfers to qualified transferees.
Gain (or loss) under this
paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) will not be triggered if qualifying property described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section is transferred to another person (qualified transferee) in a transaction qualifying for nonrecognition under the Internal Revenue Code (other than transactions described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(E)(4)(
i
) and (c)(1) of this section), if—
(
i
) The qualified transferee (and all other subsequent qualified transferees), immediately thereafter and for the ten-year period beginning on the date of the initial distribution of such qualifying property from the domestic liquidating corporation to the foreign distributee corporation, uses the property in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;
(
ii
) The foreign distributee corporation (or its successor in interest) prepares and attaches to its timely filed U.S. income tax return for the year of transfer a statement entitled “Required Statement under § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(i)(E)(
5
) for Property Transferred to a Qualified Transferee” that is signed under penalties of perjury by an authorized officer of the foreign distributee corporation and by a person similarly authorized by the qualified transferee;

) of this section shall contain a description of all qualifying property transferred by the foreign distributee corporation (or qualified transferee) to the qualified transferee (or subsequent qualified transferee);
(

) The statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(
5
)(
ii
) of this section shall also contain an identification of the qualified transferee (or subsequent qualified transferee), including its name and address, taxpayer identification number, residence, and place of incorporation (if applicable);
(
v
) The statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(
5
)(
ii
) of this section shall also contain a declaration by the qualifying transferee (or subsequent qualifying transferee) that it irrevocably waives any right under any treaty (whether or not currently in force at the time of the liquidation) to sell or exchange any item of such property without U.S. income taxation or at a reduced rate of taxation, or to derive income from the use of any item of such qualifying property without U.S. income taxation or at a reduced rate of taxation; and
(
vi
) A declaration that the transfer to the qualifying transferee (or subsequent qualifying transferee) is one to which the rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(
5
) apply and a certification that the foreign distributee corporation (or its successor in interest) and the qualifying transferee (or subsequent qualifying transferee) agree to all of the terms and conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(
1
) of this section, replacing “foreign distributee corporation” with “qualifying transferee” and replacing references to “section 882(a)” with “section 871(b)” (as the case may be).
(ii)
Distribution of certain U.S. real property interests.
A domestic liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain (or loss) under paragraph (b)(1) of this section on the distribution of a U.S. real property interest (other than stock in a former U.S. real property holding corporation that is treated as a U.S. real property interest for five years under section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii)). If property distributed by the domestic liquidating corporation is a U.S. real property interest that qualifies for nonrecognition under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) in addition to nonrecognition provided by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, then the domestic liquidating corporation shall secure nonrecognition pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) and not pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(iii)
Distribution of stock of domestic subsidiary corporations
—(A)
Conditions for nonrecognition.
A domestic liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain or loss under paragraph (b)(1) of this section on a distribution of stock of an 80 percent domestic subsidiary corporation, if the domestic liquidating corporation attaches a statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section to its timely filed U.S. income tax return for the year of the distribution of such stock. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii), a corporation is an 80 percent domestic subsidiary corporation, if—
(
1
) The subsidiary corporation is a domestic corporation (but not a foreign corporation that has made an election under section 897(i) to be treated as a U.S. corporation for purposes of section 897);
(
2
) The domestic liquidating corporation owns (directly and without regard to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) at least 80 percent of the total voting power of the stock of such corporation; and
(
3
) The domestic liquidating corporation owns (directly and without regard to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) at least 80 percent of the total value of all stock of such corporation.
(B)
Exceptions when the liquidating corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation.
If the domestic liquidating corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation (as defined in section 897(c)(2)) at the time of liquidation (or is a former U.S. real property holding corporation the stock of which is treated as a U.S. real property interest for five years under section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii)), then the exception in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section shall apply only to the distribution of stock of an 80 percent domestic subsidiary corporation that is a U.S. real property holding corporation (as defined in section 897(c)(2)) at the time of the liquidation and immediately thereafter.
(C)
Anti-abuse rule.
(
1
) The exception in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section shall not apply, if a principal purpose of the distribution of the 80 percent domestic subsidiary corporation's stock is the avoidance of U.S. tax that would have been imposed on the domestic liquidating corporation's disposition of such stock when taken together to an unrelated party. A distribution may have a principal purpose of tax avoidance even though the tax avoidance purpose is outweighed by other purposes when taken together.
(
2
) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section, a distribution of stock of the 80 percent domestic subsidiary corporation will be deemed to have been made pursuant to a plan, one of the principal purposes of which was the avoidance of U.S. tax, if the foreign distributee corporation disposes of (whether in a recognition or nonrecognition transaction) any such stock within two years of such distribution. The rule in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) will not apply if the foreign distributee corporation can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the avoidance of U.S. tax was not a principal purpose of the liquidation.
(D)
Required statement.
The statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section shall be entitled “Required Statement under § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(iii) for Stock of 80 Percent Domestic Subsidiary Corporations” and shall be prepared by the domestic liquidating corporation and shall be signed under penalties of perjury by an authorized officer of the domestic liquidating corporation and by an authorized officer of the foreign distributee corporation. The required statement shall contain a certification that states that if the foreign distributee corporation disposes of any stock subject to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section in a transaction described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, then the domestic liquidating corporation shall recognize all realized gain attributable to the distributed stock at the time of distribution, and the domestic liquidating corporation (or the foreign distributee corporation on behalf of the domestic liquidating corporation) shall file a U.S. income tax return (or amended U.S. income tax return, as the case may be) for the year of distribution reporting the gain attributable to such stock. The required statement shall also state that the domestic liquidating corporation agrees, as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, to treat a failure to comply (as described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section) as extending the period of limitations on assessment of tax for the taxable year in which gain is required to be reported.
(3)
Other consequences
—(i)
Distributee basis in property.
The foreign distributee corporation's basis in property subject to this paragraph (b) shall be the same as the domestic liquidating corporation's basis in such property immediately before the liquidation, increased by any gain, or reduced by any loss recognized by the domestic liquidating corporation on such property
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

If a foreign corporation (foreign liquidating) makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation (foreign distributee) that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in the foreign liquidating corporation, then, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, section 337 (a) and (b)(1) shall apply and the foreign liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain (or loss) on the distribution under section 367(e)(2). If a foreign liquidating corporation distributes a partnership interest (whether foreign or domestic), then such corporation shall be treated as having distributed a proportionate share of partnership property in accordance with the principles of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)

(
2
) The foreign distributee corporation is not entitled to benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty (this requirement shall apply only if the foreign liquidating corporation (or predecessor corporation) was not entitled to benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty); and
(
3
) The foreign liquidating corporation and foreign distributee corporation attach the statement described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section to their timely filed U.S. income tax returns for their taxable years that include the distribution.
(C)
Required statement.
The statement required by paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)(3) of this section shall be entitled “Required Statement under § 1.367(e)-2(c)(2)(i),” shall be prepared by foreign liquidating corporation, shall be signed under penalties of perjury by an authorized officer of the foreign liquidating corporation and by an authorized officer of the foreign distributee corporation, and shall be identical to the statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, except that “§ 1.367(e)-2(c)(2)(i)(B)” shall be substituted for references to “§ 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(i)” and “foreign liquidating corporation” shall be substituted for “domestic liquidating corporation” each time it appears. References in the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section to various rules in paragraph (b) of this section shall be applied as if such references were to this paragraph (c). However, the statement described in this paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) shall be modified as follows:
(
1
) The foreign distributee corporation shall not be required to waive its income tax treaty benefits as required by § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(i)(C)(

ii
) The foreign distributee corporation is entitled benefits under a treaty to which
the foreign liquidating corporation was not entitled.
(
2
) If the foreign distributee is required to waive treaty benefits because of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, then the foreign distributee shall only be required to waive benefits that were not available to the foreign liquidating corporation (or a predecessor corporation) prior to liquidation.
(
3
) The property description described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section shall include only the qualified U.S. trade or business property described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.

By the foreign liquidating corporation's claiming nonrecognition under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section and filing a statement described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the foreign liquidating corporation and the foreign distributee corporation agree to be subject to the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, as well as the rules of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(D) and (E) of this section. In applying the rules of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(D) and (E) of this section, “foreign liquidating corporation” shall be used instead of “domestic liquidating corporation” each time it appears. References in the rules of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(D) and (E) of this section to various rules in paragraph (b) of this section shall be applied as if such references were to this paragraph (c).
(ii)
Property formerly used in a United States trade or business.
A foreign liquidating corporation that makes a distribution described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall recognize gain (but not loss) on the distribution of property (other than U.S. real property interests) that had ceased to be used by the foreign liquidating corporation in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business within the ten-year period ending on the date of distribution and that would have been subject to section 864(c)(7) had it been disposed. Section 864(c)(7) shall govern the treatment of any gain recognized on the distribution of assets described in this paragraph as income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.

Other rules.
For other rules that may apply, see sections 367(b) and 381.

Anti-abuse rule.
The Commissioner may require a domestic liquidating corporation to recognize gain on a distribution in liquidation described in paragraph (b) of this section (or treat the liquidating corporation as if it had recognized loss on a distribution in liquidation), if a principal purpose of the liquidation is the avoidance of U.S. tax (including, but not limited to, the distribution of a liquidating corporation's earnings and profits with a principal purpose of avoiding U.S. tax). A liquidation may have a principal purpose of tax avoidance even though the tax avoidance purpose is outweighed by other purposes when taken together.

(3)
Failure to file
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of this section and except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(D) or (f) of this section, there is a failure to file an initial liquidation document if—
(A) An initial liquidation document is not filed with the timely filed U.S. income tax return specified under this section, or
(B) An initial liquidation document is not completed in all material respects.
(ii)
Consequences of a failure to file.
If there is a failure to file an initial liquidation document, then nonrecognition treatment under paragraph (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(iii), or (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section (as appropriate) will not apply.
(4)
Failure to comply
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of this section and except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(D) or (f) of this section, a failure to comply includes—
(A) A failure to report gain, or pay any additional tax or interest due, in accordance with the requirements under this section; and
(B) A failure to file a subsequent liquidation document, as determined by applying paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, but replacing the term “initial liquidation document” with the term “subsequent liquidation document.”
(ii)
Consequences of a failure to comply.
If there is a failure to comply in any material respect with the terms of paragraph (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(iii), or (c)(2)(i) of this section, as applicable, then—
(A) Any gain (but not loss) that was not previously recognized by the domestic liquidating corporation or foreign liquidating corporation, as applicable, under paragraph (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(iii), or (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section must be recognized; and
(B) The period of limitations on assessment of tax for the taxable year in which gain is required to be reported will be extended until the close of the third full taxable year ending after the date on which the domestic liquidating corporation, foreign distributee corporation, or foreign liquidating corporation, as applicable, furnishes to the Director of Field Operations, Cross Border Activities Practice Area of Large Business

A failure to file or a failure to comply will be deemed not to have occurred for purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (e)(4)(ii) of this section if
the taxpayer demonstrates that the failure was not willful using the procedure set forth in this paragraph (f). For this purpose, willful is to be interpreted consistent with the meaning of that term in the context of other civil penalties, which would include a failure due to gross negligence, reckless disregard, or willful neglect. Whether a failure to file or failure to comply was willful will be determined by the Director (as described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section) based on all the facts and circumstances. The taxpayer must submit a request for relief and an explanation as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Although a taxpayer whose failure to file or failure to comply is determined not to be willful will not be subject to gain or loss recognition under this section, the taxpayer will be subject to a penalty under section 6038B if the taxpayer fails to satisfy the reporting requirements, if any, under that section and does not demonstrate that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. See § 1.6038B-1(e)(4) and (f). The determination of whether the failure to file or failure to comply was willful under this section has no effect on any request for relief made under § 1.6038B-1(f).
(2)
Procedures for establishing that a failure to file or failure to comply was not willful
—(i)
Time and manner of submission.
A taxpayer's statement that a failure to file or failure to comply was not willful will be considered only if, promptly after the taxpayer becomes aware of the failure, an amended return is filed for the taxable year to which the failure relates that includes the information that should have been included with the original return for such taxable year or that otherwise complies with the rules of this section, and that includes a written statement explaining the reasons for the failure. In the case of a liquidating distribution described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the taxpayer must file, with the amended return, a Form 8838 extending the period of limitations on assessment of tax with respect to the gain realized but not recognized with respect to the liquidating distribution to the close of the third full taxable year ending after the date on which the required information is provided to the Director. In the case of a liquidating distribution described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the taxpayer must file, with the amended return, a Form 8838 extending the period of limitations on the assessment of tax with respect to the gain realized but not recognized with respect to the liquidating distribution to the later of: the date provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C)(
5
), taking into account paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) and (D), as applicable (date one); or, the close of the third full taxable year ending after the date on which the required information is provided to the Director (date two). However, the taxpayer is not required to file a Form 8838 with the amended return if both date one is later than date two and a Form 8838 was previously filed extending the period of limitations on assessment of tax with respect to the gain realized but not recognized with respect to the liquidating distribution to date one. If a Form 8838 is not required to be filed pursuant to the previous sentence, a copy of the previously filed Form 8838 must be filed with the amended return. The amended return and either a Form 8838 or a copy of the previously filed Form 8838, as the case may be, must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at the location where the taxpayer filed its original return. The taxpayer may submit a request for relief from the penalty under section 6038B as part of the same submission. See § 1.6038B-1(f).
(ii)
Notice requirement.
In addition to the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the taxpayer must comply with the notice requirements of this paragraph (f)(2)(ii). If any taxable year of the taxpayer is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return and any information required to be included with such return must be delivered to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the examination. If no taxable year of the taxpayer is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return and any information required to be included with such return must be delivered to the Director.
(3) For illustrations of the application of the willfulness standard of this
paragraph (f), see the examples in § 1.367(a)-8(p)(3).
(g)
Effective/applicability dates.
Except as otherwise provided, this section applies to distributions occurring on or after September 7, 1999 or, if the taxpayer so elects, to distributions in taxable years ending after August 8, 1999. The ninth, tenth, and eleventh sentences of paragraph (a) of this section, and paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(i)(A)(

# special rule; definitions
§ 1.368-1
Purpose and scope of exception of reorganization exchanges.
(a)
Reorganizations.
As used in the regulations under parts I, II, and III (section 301 and following), subchapter C, chapter 1 of the Code, the terms
reorganization
and
party to a reorganization
mean only a reorganization or a party to a reorganization as defined in subsections (a) and (b) of section 368. In determining whether a transaction qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a), the transaction must be evaluated under relevant provisions of law, including the step transaction doctrine. But see §§ 1.368-2 (f) and (k) and 1.338-3(d). The preceding two sentences apply to transactions occurring after January 28, 1998, except that they do not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding on January 28, 1998, and at all times thereafter. With respect to insolvency reorganizations, see part IV, subchapter C, chapter 1 of the Code.
(b)
Purpose.
Under the general rule, upon the exchange of property, gain or loss must be accounted for if the new property differs in a material particular, either in kind or in extent, from the old property. The purpose of the reorganization provisions of the Code is to except from the general rule certain specifically described exchanges incident to such readjustments of corporate structures made in one of the particular ways specified in the Code, as are required by business exigencies and which effect only a readjustment of continuing interest in property under modified corporate forms. Requisite to a reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code are a continuity of the business enterprise through the issuing corporation under the modified corporate form as described in paragraph (d) of this section, and (except as provided in section 368(a)(1)(D)) a continuity of interest as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (For rules regarding the continuity of interest requirement under section 355, see § 1.355-2(c).) For purposes of this section, the term
issuing corporation
means the acquiring corporation (as that term is used in section 368(a)), except that, in determining whether a reorganization qualifies as a triangular reorganization (as defined in § 1.358-6(b)(2)), the issuing corporation means the corporation in control of the acquiring corporation. The preceding three sentences apply to transactions occurring after January 28, 1998, except that they do not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding on January 28, 1998, and at all times thereafter. The continuity of business enterprise requirement is described in paragraph (d) of this section. Notwithstanding the requirements of this paragraph (b), for transactions occurring on or after February 25, 2005, a continuity of the business enterprise and a continuity of interest are not required for the transaction to qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(E) or (F). The Code recognizes as a reorganization the amalgamation (occurring in a specified way) of two corporate enterprises under a single corporate structure if there exists among the holders of the stock and securities of either of the old corporations the requisite continuity of interest in the new corporation, but there is not a reorganization if the holders of the stock and securities of the old corporation are merely the holders of
short-term notes in the new corporation. In order to exclude transactions not intended to be included, the specifications of the reorganization provisions of the law are precise. Both the terms of the specifications and their underlying assumptions and purposes must be satisfied in order to entitle the taxpayer to the benefit of the exception from the general rule. Accordingly, under the Code, a short-term purchase money note is not a security of a party to a reorganization, an ordinary dividend is to be treated as an ordinary dividend, and a sale is nevertheless to be treated as a sale even though the mechanics of a reorganization have been set up.
(c)
Scope.
The nonrecognition of gain or loss is prescribed for two specifically described types of exchanges, viz: The exchange that is provided for in section 354(a)(1) in which stock or securities in a corporation, a party to a reorganization, are, in pursuance of a plan of reorganization, exchanged for the stock or securities in a corporation, a party to the same reorganization; and the exchange that is provided for in section 361(a) in which a corporation, a party to a reorganization, exchanges property, in pursuance of a plan of reorganization, for stock or securities in another corporation, a party to the same reorganization. Section 368(a)(1) limits the definition of the term
reorganization
to six kinds of transactions and excludes all others. From its context, the term
a party to a reorganization
can only mean a party to a transaction specifically defined as a reorganization by section 368(a). Certain rules respecting boot received in either of the two types of exchanges provided for in section 354(a)(1) and section 361(a) are prescribed in sections 356, 357, and 361(b). A special rule respecting a transfer of property with a liability in excess of its basis is prescribed in section 357(c). Under section 367 a limitation is placed on all these provisions by providing that except under specified conditions foreign corporations shall not be deemed within their scope. The provisions of the Code referred to in this paragraph are inapplicable unless there is a plan of reorganization. A plan of reorganization must contemplate the bona fide execution of one of the transactions specifically described as a reorganization in section 368(a) and for the bona fide consummation of each of the requisite acts under which nonrecognition of gain is claimed. Such transaction and such acts must be an ordinary and necessary incident of the conduct of the enterprise and must provide for a continuation of the enterprise. A scheme, which involves an abrupt departure from normal reorganization procedure in connection with a transaction on which the imposition of tax is imminent, such as a mere device that puts on the form of a corporate reorganization as a disguise for concealing its real character, and the object and accomplishment of which is the consummation of a preconceived plan having no business or corporate purpose, is not a plan of reorganization.
(d)
Continuity of business enterprise
—(1)
General rule.
Continuity of business enterprise (COBE) requires that the issuing corporation (P), as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, either continue the target corporation's (T's) historic business or use a significant portion of T's historic business assets in a business. The preceding sentence applies to transactions occurring after January 28, 1998, except that it does not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding on January 28, 1998, and at all times thereafter. The application of this general rule to certain transactions, such as mergers of holding companies, will depend on all facts and circumstances. The policy underlying this general rule, which is to ensure that reorganizations are limited to readjustments of continuing interests in property under modified corporate form, provides the guidance necessary to make these facts and circumstances determinations.
(2)
Business continuity.
(i) The continuity of business enterprise requirement is satisfied if
P
continues
T
's historic business. The fact
P
is in the same line of business as
T
tends to establish the requisite continuity, but is not alone sufficient.
(ii) If
T
has more than one line of business, continuity of business enterprise requires only that
P
continue a significant line of business.
(iii) In general, a corporation's historic business is the business it has conducted most recently. However, a corporation's historic business is not one the corporation enters into as part of a plan of reorganization.
(iv) All facts and circumstances are considered in determining the time when the plan comes into existence and in determining whether a line of business is “significant”.
(3)
Asset continuity.
(i) The continuity of business enterprise requirement is satisfied if
P
uses a significant portion of
T
's historic business assets in a business.
(ii) A corporation's historic business assets are the assets used in its historic business. Business assets may include stock and securities and intangible operating assets such as good will, patents, and trademarks, whether or not they have a tax basis.
(iii) In general, the determination of the portion of a corporation's assets considered “significant” is based on the relative importance of the assets to operation of the business. However, all other facts and circumstances, such as the net fair market value of those assets, will be considered.
(4)
Acquired assets or stock held by members of the qualified group or partnerships.
The following rules apply in determining whether the COBE requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is satisfied:
(i)
Businesses and assets of members of a qualified group.
The issuing corporation is treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of all of the members of the qualified group, as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Qualified group.
A qualified group is one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with the issuing corporation, but only if the issuing corporation owns directly stock meeting the requirements of section 368(c) in at least one other corporation, and stock meeting the requirements of section 368(c) in each of the corporations (except the issuing corporation) is owned directly (or indirectly as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(D) of this section) by one or more of the other corporations.
(iii)
Partnerships
—(A)
Partnership assets.
Each partner of a partnership will be treated as owning the T business assets used in a business of the partnership in accordance with that partner's interest in the partnership.
(B)
Partnership businesses.
The issuing corporation will be treated as conducting a business of a partnership if—
(
1
) Members of the qualified group, in the aggregate, own an interest in the partnership representing a significant interest in that partnership business; or
(
2
) One or more members of the qualified group have active and substantial management functions as a partner with respect to that partnership business.
(C)
Conduct of the historic T business in a partnership.
If a significant historic T business is conducted in a partnership, the fact that P is treated as conducting such T business under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B) of this section tends to establish the requisite continuity, but is not alone sufficient.
(D)
Stock attributed from certain partnerships.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, if members of the qualified group own interests in a partnership meeting requirements equivalent to section 368(c) (a section 368(c) controlled partnership), any stock owned by the section 368(c) controlled partnership shall be treated as owned by members of the qualified group. Solely for purposes of determining whether a lower-tier partnership is a section 368(c) controlled partnership, any interest in a lower-tier partnership that is owned by a section 368(c) controlled partnership shall be treated as owned by members of the qualified group.
(iv)
Effective/applicability dates.
Paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (d)(4)(iii) (other than paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(D)) of this section apply to transactions occurring after January 28, 1998, except that they do not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding on January 28, 1998, and at all times thereafter. Paragraphs (d)(4)(ii) and (d)(4)(iii)(D) of this section apply to transactions occurring on or after October 25, 2007, except that they do not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding before October 25, 2007, and at all times after that.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d). All the corporations have only one class of stock outstanding. The preceding sentence and paragraph (d)(5)
Example 6
and
Example 8
through
Example 13
apply to transactions occurring after January 28, 1998, except that they do not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding on January 28, 1998, and at all times thereafter. Paragraph (d)(5)
Example 7
,
Example 14
, and
Example 15
apply to transactions occurring on or after October 25, 2007, except that they do not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding before October 25, 2007, and at all times after that. The examples read as follows:

# Example 1. T
conducts three lines of business: manufacture of synthetic resins, manufacture of chemicals for the textile industry, and distribution of chemicals. The three lines of business are approximately equal in value. On July 1, 1981,
T
sells the synthetic resin and chemicals distribution businesses to a third party for cash and marketable securities. On December 31, 1981,
T
transfers all of its assets to
P
solely for
P
voting stock.
P
continues the chemical manufacturing business without interruption. The continuity of business enterprise requirement is met. Continuity of business enterprise requires only that
P
continue one of
T
's three significant lines of business.

# Example 2. P
manufactures computers and
T
manufactures components for computers.
T
sells all of its output to
P.
On January 1, 1981,
P
decides to buy imported components only. On March 1, 1981,
T
merges into
P. P
continues buying imported components but retains
T
's equipment as a backup source of supply. The use of the equipment as a backup source of supply constitutes use of a significant portion of
T
's historic business assets, thus establishing continuity of business enterprise.
P
is not required to continue
T
's business.

# Example 3. T
is a manufacturer of boys' and men's trousers. On January 1, 1978, as part of a plan of reorganization,
T
sold all of its assets to a third party for cash and purchased a highly diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. As part of the plan
T
operates an investment business until July 1, 1981. On that date, the plan of reorganization culminates in a transfer by
T
of all its assets to
P,
a regulated investment company, solely in exchange for
P
voting stock. The continuity of business enterprise requirement is not met.
T
's investment activity is not its historic business, and the stocks and bonds are not
T
's historic business assets.

# Example 4. T
manufactures children's toys and
P
distributes steel and allied products. On January 1, 1981,
T
sells all of its assets to a third party for $100,000 cash and $900,000 in notes. On March 1, 1981,
T
merges into
P.
Continuity of business enterprise is lacking. The use of the sales proceeds in
P
's business is not sufficient.

# Example 5. T
manufactures farm machinery and
P
operates a lumber mill.
T
merges into
P. P
disposes of
T
's assets immediately after the merger as part of the plan of reorganization.
P
does not continue
T
's farm machinery manufacturing business. Continuity of business enterprise is lacking.

# Example 6. Use of a significant portion of T's historic business assets by the qualified group.
(i)
Facts. T
operates an auto parts distributorship.
P
owns 80 percent of the stock of a holding company (HC). HC owns 80 percent of the stock of ten subsidiaries, S-1 through S-10. S-1 through S-10 each separately operate a full service gas station. Pursuant to a plan of reorganization,
T
merges into
P
and the
T
shareholders receive solely
P
stock. As part of the plan of reorganization,
P
transfers
T
's assets to HC, which in turn transfers some of the
T
assets to each of the ten subsidiaries. No one subsidiary receives a significant portion of
T
's historic business assets. Each of the subsidiaries will use the
T
assets in the operation of its full service gas station. No
P
subsidiary will be an auto parts distributor.
(ii)
Continuity of business enterprise.
Under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section,
P
is treated as conducting the ten gas station businesses of S-1 through S-10 and as holding the historic
T
assets used in those businesses.
P
is treated as holding all the assets and conducting the businesses of all of the members of the qualified group, which includes S-1 through S-10 (paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section). No member of the qualified group continues
T
's historic distributorship business. However, subsidiaries S-1 through S-10 continue to use the historic
T
assets in a business. Even though no one corporation of the qualified group is using a significant portion of
T
's historic business assets in a business, the COBE requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is satisfied because, in the aggregate, the qualified group is using a significant portion of
T
's historic business assets in a business.

# Example 7. Transfers of acquired stock to members of the qualified group—continuity of business enterprise satisfied.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 6
, except that, instead of P acquiring the assets of T, HC acquires all of the outstanding stock of T in exchange solely for stock of P. In addition, as part of the plan of reorganization, HC transfers 10 percent of the stock of T to each of subsidiaries S-1 through S-10. T will continue to operate an auto parts distributorship. Without regard to whether the transaction satisfies the COBE requirement, the
transaction qualifies as a triangular B reorganization (as defined in § 1.358-6(b)(2)(iv)).
(ii)
Continuity of business enterprise.
Under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, P is treated as holding the assets and conducting the business of T because T is a member of the qualified group (as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section). The COBE requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is satisfied.

# Example 8. Continuation of the historic T business in a partnership satisfies continuity of business enterprise.
(i)
Facts. T
manufactures ski boots.
P
owns all of the stock of S-1. S-1 owns all of the stock of S-2, and S-2 owns all of the stock of S-3.
T
merges into
P
and the
T
shareholders receive consideration consisting of
P
stock and cash. The
T
ski boot business is to be continued and expanded. In anticipation of this expansion,
P
transfers all of the
T
assets to S-1, S-1 transfers all of the
T
assets to S-2, and S-2 transfers all of the
T
assets to S-3. S-3 and
X
(an unrelated party) form a new partnership (PRS). As part of the plan of reorganization, S-3 transfers all the
T
assets to PRS, and S-3, in its capacity as a partner, performs active and substantial management functions for the PRS ski boot business, including making significant business decisions and regularly participating in the overall supervision, direction, and control of the employees of the ski boot business. S-3 receives a 20 percent interest in PRS.
X
transfers cash in exchange for an 80 percent interest in PRS.
(ii)
Continuity of business enterprise.
Under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section,
P
is treated as conducting
T
's historic business because S-3 performs active and substantial management functions for the ski boot business in S-3's capacity as a partner.
P
is treated as holding all the assets and conducting the businesses of all of the members of the qualified group, which includes S-3 (paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section). The COBE requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is satisfied.

# Example 9. Continuation of the historic T business in a partnership does not satisfy continuity of business enterprise.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 8,
except that S-3 transfers the historic T business to PRS in exchange for a 1 percent interest in PRS.
(ii)
Continuity of business enterprise.
Under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section,
P
is treated as conducting
T
's historic business because S-3 performs active and substantial management functions for the ski boot business in S-3's capacity as a partner. The fact that a significant historic
T
business is conducted in PRS, and
P
is treated as conducting such
T
business under (d)(4)(iii)(B) tends to establish the requisite continuity, but is not alone sufficient (paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(C) of this section). The COBE requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is not satisfied.

# Example 10. Continuation of the T historic business in a partnership satisfies continuity of business enterprise.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 8,
except that S-3 transfers the historic T business to PRS in exchange for a 33
1/3
percent interest in PRS, and no member of P's qualified group performs active and substantial management functions for the ski boot business operated in PRS.
(ii)
Continuity of business enterprise.
Under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section,
P
is treated as conducting
T
's historic business because S-3 owns an interest in the partnership representing a significant interest in that partnership business.
P
is treated as holding all the assets and conducting the businesses of all of the members of the qualified group, which includes S-3 (paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section). The COBE requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is satisfied.

# Example 11. Use of T's historic business assets in a partnership business.
(i)
Facts. T
is a fabric distributor.
P
owns all of the stock of S-1.
T
merges into
P
and the
T
shareholders receive solely
P
stock. S-1 and
X
(an unrelated party) own interests in a partnership (PRS). As part of the plan of reorganization,
P
transfers all of the
T
assets to S-1, and S-1 transfers all the
T
assets to PRS, increasing S-1's percentage interest in PRS from 5 to 33
1/3
percent. After the transfer,
X
owns the remaining 66
2/3
percent interest in PRS. Almost all of the
T
assets consist of
T
's large inventory of fabric, which PRS uses to manufacture sportswear. All of the
T
assets are used in the sportswear business. No member of
P
's qualified group performs active and substantial management functions for the sportswear business operated in PRS.
(ii)
Continuity of business enterprise.
Under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, S-1 is treated as owning 33
1/3
percent of the
T
assets used in the PRS sportswear manufacturing business. Under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section,
P
is treated as conducting the sportswear manufacturing business because S-1 owns an interest in the partnership representing a significant interest in that partnership business.
P
is treated as holding all the assets and conducting the businesses of all of the members of the qualified group, which includes S-1 (paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section). The COBE requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is satisfied.

# Example 12. Aggregation of partnership interests among members of the qualified group: use of T's historic business assets in a partnership business.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 11
, except that S-1 transfers all the T assets to PRS, and P and X each transfer cash to PRS in exchange for partnership interests. After the transfers,
P
owns 11 percent, S-1 owns 22
1/3
percent, and
X
owns 66
2/3
percent of PRS.
(ii)
Continuity of business enterprise.
Under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section,
P
is
treated as conducting the sportswear manufacturing business because members of the qualified group, in the aggregate, own an interest in the partnership representing a significant interest in that business.
P
is treated as owning 11 percent of the assets directly, and S-1 is treated as owning 22
1/3
percent of the assets, used in the PRS sportswear business (paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section).
P
is treated as holding all the assets of all of the members of the qualified group, which includes S-1, and thus in the aggregate,
P
is treated as owning 33
1/3
of the
T
assets (paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section). The COBE requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is satisfied because
P
is treated as using a significant portion of
T
's historic business assets in its sportswear manufacturing business.

# Example 13. Tiered partnerships: use of T's historic business assets in a partnership business.
(i)
Facts. T
owns and manages a commercial office building in state
Z.
Pursuant to a plan of reorganization,
T
merges into
P,
solely in exchange for
P
stock, which is distributed to the
T
shareholders.
P
transfers all of the
T
assets to a partnership, PRS-1, which owns and operates television stations nationwide. After the transfer,
P
owns a 50 percent interest in PRS-1.
P
does not have active and substantial management functions as a partner with respect to the PRS-1 business.
X,
not a member of
P
's qualified group, owns the remaining 50 percent interest in PRS-1. PRS-1, in an effort to expand its state
Z
television operation, enters into a joint venture with
U,
an unrelated party. As part of the plan of reorganization, PRS-1 transfers all the
T
assets and its state
Z
television station to PRS-2, in exchange for a 75 percent partnership interest.
U
contributes cash to PRS-2 in exchange for a 25 percent partnership interest and oversees the management of the state
Z
television operation. PRS-1 does not actively and substantially manage PRS-2's business. PRS-2's state
Z
operations are moved into the acquired
T
office building. All of the assets that
P
acquired from
T
are used in PRS-2's business.
(ii)
Continuity of business enterprise.
Under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, PRS-1 is treated as owning 75 percent of the
T
assets used in PRS-2's business.
P,
in turn, is treated as owning 50 percent of PRS-1's interest the
T
assets. Thus,
P
is treated as owning 37
1/2
percent (50 percent × 75 percent) of the
T
assets used in the PRS-2 business. Under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section,
P
is treated as conducting PRS-2's business, the operation of the state
Z
television station, and under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section,
P
is treated as using 37
1/2
percent of the historic
T
business assets in that business. The COBE requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is satisfied because
P
is treated as using a significant portion of
T
's historic business assets in its television business.

# Example 14. Transfer of acquired stock to a partnership—continuity of business enterprise satisfied.
(i)
Facts.
Pursuant to a plan of reorganization, the T shareholders transfer all of their T stock to a subsidiary of P, S-1, solely in exchange for P stock. In addition, as part of the plan of reorganization, S-1 transfers the T stock to its subsidiary, S-2, and S-2 transfers the T stock to its subsidiary, S-3. S-2 and S-3 form a new partnership, PRS. Immediately thereafter, S-3 transfers all of the T stock to PRS in exchange for an 80 percent interest in PRS, and S-2 transfers cash to PRS in exchange for a 20 percent interest in PRS.
(ii)
Continuity of business enterprise.
Members of the qualified group, in the aggregate, own all of the interests in PRS. Because these interests in PRS meet requirements equivalent to section 368(c), under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(D) of this section, the T stock owned by PRS is treated as owned by members of the qualified group. P is treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of T because T is a member of the qualified group (as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section). The COBE requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is satisfied because P is treated as continuing T's business.

# Example 15. Transfer of acquired stock to a partnership—continuity of business enterprise not satisfied.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 14,
except that S-3 and U, an unrelated corporation, form a new partnership, PRS, and, immediately thereafter, S-3 transfers all of the T stock to PRS in exchange for a 50 percent interest in PRS, and U transfers cash to PRS in exchange for a 50 percent interest in PRS.
(ii)
Continuity of business enterprise.
Members of the qualified group, in the aggregate, own 50 percent of the interests in PRS. Because these interests in PRS do not meet requirements equivalent to section 368(c), the T stock owned by PRS is not treated as owned by members of the qualified group under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(D) of this section. P is not treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of T because T has ceased to be a member of the qualified group (as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section). The COBE requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section is not satisfied because P is not treated as continuing T's business or using T's historic business assets in a business.
(e)
Continuity of interest
—(1)
General rule.
(i) The purpose of the continuity of interest requirement is to prevent transactions that resemble sales from qualifying for nonrecognition of gain or loss available to corporate reorganizations. Continuity of interest requires that in substance a substantial
part of the value of the proprietary interests in the target corporation be preserved in the reorganization. A proprietary interest in the target corporation is preserved if, in a potential reorganization, it is exchanged for a proprietary interest in the issuing corporation (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section), it is exchanged by the acquiring corporation for a direct interest in the target corporation enterprise, or it otherwise continues as a proprietary interest in the target corporation. However, a proprietary interest in the target corporation is not preserved if, in connection with the potential reorganization, it is acquired by the issuing corporation for consideration other than stock of the issuing corporation, or stock of the issuing corporation furnished in exchange for a proprietary interest in the target corporation in the potential reorganization is redeemed. All facts and circumstances must be considered in determining whether, in substance, a proprietary interest in the target corporation is preserved. See paragraph (e)(6) of this section for rules related to when a creditor's claim against a target corporation is a proprietary interest in the corporation. For purposes of the continuity of interest requirement, a mere disposition of stock of the target corporation prior to a potential reorganization to persons not related (as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section determined without regard to paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section) to the target corporation or to persons not related (as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section) to the issuing corporation is disregarded and a mere disposition of stock of the issuing corporation received in a potential reorganization to persons not related (as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section) to the issuing corporation is disregarded.
(ii) For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, a proprietary interest in the target corporation (other than one held by the acquiring corporation) is not preserved to the extent that consideration received prior to a potential reorganization, either in a redemption of the target corporation stock or in a distribution with respect to the target corporation stock, is treated as other property or money received in the exchange for purposes of section 356, or would be so treated if the target shareholder also had received stock of the issuing corporation in exchange for stock owned by the shareholder in the target corporation. A proprietary interest in the target corporation is not preserved to the extent that creditors (or former creditors) of the target corporation that own a proprietary interest in the corporation under paragraph (e)(6) of this section (or would be so treated if they had received the consideration in the potential reorganization) receive payment for the claim prior to the potential reorganization and such payment would be treated as other property or money received in the exchange for purposes of section 356 had it been a distribution with respect to stock.
(2)
Measuring continuity of interest
—(i)
In general.
In determining whether a proprietary interest in the target corporation is preserved, the consideration to be exchanged for the proprietary interests in the target corporation pursuant to a contract to effect the potential reorganization shall be valued on the last business day before the first date such contract is a binding contract (the pre-signing date), if such contract provides for fixed consideration. If a portion of the consideration provided for in such a contract consists of other property identified by value, then this specified value of such other property is used for purposes of determining the extent to which a proprietary interest in the target corporation is preserved. If the contract does not provide for fixed consideration, this paragraph (e)(2)(i) is not applicable.
(ii)
Binding contract
—(A)
In general.
A binding contract is an instrument enforceable under applicable law against the parties to the instrument. The presence of a condition outside the control of the parties (including, for example, regulatory agency approval) shall not prevent an instrument from being a binding contract. Further, the fact that insubstantial terms remain to be negotiated by the parties to the contract, or that customary conditions remain to be satisfied, shall not prevent an instrument from being a binding contract.
(B)
Modifications
—(
1
)
In general.
If a term of a binding contract that relates to the amount or type of the consideration the target shareholders will receive in a potential reorganization is modified before the closing date of the potential reorganization, and the contract as modified is a binding contract, the date of the modification shall be treated as the first date there is a binding contract.
(
2
)
Modification of a transaction that preserves continuity of interest.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, a modification of a term that relates to the amount or type of consideration the target shareholders will receive in a transaction that would have resulted in the preservation of a substantial part of the value of the target corporation shareholders' proprietary interests in the target corporation if there had been no modification will not be treated as a modification if—
(
i
) The modification has the sole effect of providing for the issuance of additional shares of issuing corporation stock to the target corporation shareholders;
(
ii
) The modification has the sole effect of decreasing the amount of money or other property to be delivered to the target corporation shareholders; or
(
iii
) The modification has the effect of decreasing the amount of money or other property to be delivered to the target corporation shareholders and providing for the issuance of additional shares of issuing corporation stock to the target corporation shareholders.
(
3
)
Modification of a transaction that does not preserve continuity of interest.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, a modification of a term that relates to the amount or type of consideration the target shareholders will receive in a transaction that would not have resulted in the preservation of a substantial part of the value of the target corporation shareholders' proprietary interests in the target corporation if there had been no modification will not be treated as a modification if—
(
i
) The modification has the sole effect of providing for the issuance of fewer shares of issuing corporation stock to the target corporation shareholders;
(
ii
) The modification has the sole effect of increasing the amount of money or other property to be delivered to the target corporation shareholders; or
(
iii
) The modification has the effect of increasing the amount of money or other property to be delivered to the target corporation shareholders and providing for the issuance of fewer shares of issuing corporation stock to the target corporation shareholders.
(C)
Tender offers.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2), a tender offer that is subject to section 14(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78n(d)(1)] and Regulation 14D (17 CFR 240.14d-1 through 240.14d-101) and is not pursuant to a binding contract, is treated as a binding contract made on the date of its announcement, notwithstanding that it may be modified by the offeror or that it is not enforceable against the offerees. If a modification (not pursuant to a binding contract) of such a tender offer is subject to the provisions of Regulation 14d-6(c) (17 CFR 240.14d-6(c)) and relates to the amount or type of the consideration received in the tender offer, then the date of the modification shall be treated as the first date there is a binding contract.
(iii)
Fixed consideration
—(A)
In general.
A contract provides for fixed consideration if it provides the number of shares of each class of stock of the issuing corporation, the amount of money, and the other property (identified either by value or by specific description), if any, to be exchanged for all the proprietary interests in the target corporation, or to be exchanged for each proprietary interest in the target corporation. A shareholder's election to receive a number of shares of stock of the issuing corporation, money, or other property (or some combination of stock of the issuing corporation, money, or other property) in exchange for all of the shareholder's proprietary interests in the target corporation, or each of the shareholder's proprietary interests in the target corporation, will not prevent a contract from satisfying the definition of fixed consideration provided for in this paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A).
(B)
Shareholder elections.
A contract that provides a target corporation shareholder with an election to receive a number of shares of stock of the issuing corporation, money, or other property (or some combination of stock of the issuing corporation, money, or other property) in exchange for all of the shareholder's proprietary interests in the target corporation, or each of the shareholder's proprietary interests in the target corporation, provides for fixed consideration if the determination of the number of shares of issuing corporation stock to be provided to the target corporation shareholder is determined using the value of the issuing corporation stock on the last business day before the first date there is a binding contract. This is the case even though the shareholder election may preclude a determination, prior to the closing date, of the number of shares of each class of the issuing corporation, the amount of money, and the other property (or the combination of shares, money and other property) to be exchanged for each proprietary interest in the target corporation.
(C)
Contingent adjustments to the consideration
—(
1
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section, a contract that provides for contingent adjustments to the consideration will be treated as providing for fixed consideration if it would satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section without the contingent adjustment provision.
(
2
)
Exceptions.
A contract will not be treated as providing for fixed consideration if the contract provides for contingent adjustments to the consideration that prevent (to any extent) the target corporation shareholders from being subject to the economic benefits and burdens of ownership of the issuing corporation stock after the last business day before the first date the contract is a binding contract. For example, a contract will not be treated as providing for fixed consideration if the contract provides for contingent adjustments to the consideration in the event that the value of the stock of the issuing corporation, the value of the assets of the issuing corporation, or the value of any surrogate for either the value of the stock of the issuing corporation or the assets of the issuing corporation increases or decreases after the last business day before the first date there is a binding contract. Similarly, a contract will not be treated as providing for fixed consideration if the contract provides for contingent adjustments to the number of shares of the issuing corporation stock to be provided to the target corporation shareholders computed using any value of the issuing corporation shares after the last business day before the first date there is a binding contract.
(D)
Escrows.
Placing part of the consideration to be exchanged for proprietary interests in the target corporation in escrow to secure target's performance of customary pre-closing covenants or customary target representations and warranties will not prevent a contract from being treated as providing for fixed consideration.
(E)
Anti-dilution clauses.
The presence of a customary anti-dilution clause will not prevent a contract from being treated as providing for fixed consideration. However, the absence of such a clause will prevent a contract from being treated as providing for fixed consideration if the issuing corporation alters its capital structure between the first date there is an otherwise binding contract to effect the transaction and the effective date of the transaction in a manner that materially alters the economic arrangement of the parties to the binding contract. If the number of shares of the issuing corporation to be issued to the target corporation shareholders is altered pursuant to a customary anti-dilution clause, the value of the shares determined under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section must be adjusted accordingly.
(F)
Dissenters' rights.
The possibility that some shareholders may exercise dissenters' rights and receive consideration other than that provided for in the binding contract will not prevent the contract from being treated as providing for fixed consideration.
(G)
Fractional shares.
The fact that money may be paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares will not prevent a contract from being treated as providing for fixed consideration.
(iv)
New issuances.
For purposes of applying paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, any class of stock, securities, or indebtedness that the issuing corporation issues to the target corporation shareholders pursuant to the potential reorganization and that does not exist before the first date there is a binding contract to effect the potential reorganization is deemed to have been issued on the last business day before the first date there is a binding contract to effect the potential reorganization.
(v)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (e)(2)(v), P is the issuing corporation, T is the target corporation, S is a wholly owned subsidiary of P, all corporations have only one class of stock outstanding, A is an individual, no transactions other than those described occur, and the transactions are not otherwise subject to recharacterization. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(2):

# Example 1. Application of signing date rule.
On January 3 of year 1, P and T sign a binding contract pursuant to which T will be merged with and into P on June 1 of year 1. Pursuant to the contract, the T shareholders will receive 40 P shares and $60 of cash in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of T. Twenty of the P shares, however, will be placed in escrow to secure customary target representations and warranties. The P stock is listed on an established market. On January 2 of year 1, the value of the P stock is $1 per share. On June 1 of year 1, T merges with and into P pursuant to the terms of the contract. On that date, the value of the P stock is $.25 per share. None of the stock placed in escrow is returned to P. Because the contract provides for the number of shares of P and the amount of money to be exchanged for all of the proprietary interests in T, under this paragraph (e)(2), there is a binding contract providing for fixed consideration as of January 3 of year 1. Therefore, whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is determined by reference to the value of the P stock on the pre-signing date. Because, for continuity of interest purposes, the T stock is exchanged for $40 of P stock and $60 of cash, the transaction preserves a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T. Therefore, the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement.

# Example 2. Treatment of forfeited escrowed stock.
(i) Escrowed stock. The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that T's breach of a representation results in the escrowed consideration being returned to P. Because the contract provides for the number of shares of P and the amount of money to be exchanged for all of the proprietary interests in T, under this paragraph (e)(2), there is a binding contract providing for fixed consideration as of January 3 of year 1. Therefore, whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is determined by reference to the value of the P stock on the pre-signing date. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, for continuity of interest purposes, the T stock is exchanged for $20 of P stock and $60 of cash, and the transaction does not preserve a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T. Therefore, the transaction does not satisfy the continuity of interest requirement.
(ii)
Escrowed stock and cash.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2
except that the consideration placed in escrow consists solely of eight of the P shares and $12 of the cash. Because the contract provides for the number of shares of P and the amount of money to be exchanged for all of the proprietary interests in T, under this paragraph (e)(2), there is a binding contract providing for fixed consideration as of January 3 of year 1. Therefore, whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is determined by reference to the value of the P stock on the pre-signing date. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, for continuity of interest purposes, the T stock is exchanged for $32 of P stock and $48 of cash, and the transaction preserves a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T. Therefore, the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement.

# Example 3. Redemption of stock received pursuant to binding contract.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that A owns 50 percent of the outstanding stock of T immediately prior to the merger and receives 10 P shares and $30 in the merger and an additional 10 P shares upon the release of the stock placed in escrow. In connection with the merger, A and S agree that, immediately after the merger, S will purchase any P shares that A acquires in the merger for $1 per share. Shortly after the merger, S purchases A's P shares for $20. Because the contract provides for the number of shares of P and the amount of money to be exchanged for all of the proprietary interests in T, under this paragraph (e)(2), there is a binding contract providing for fixed consideration as of January 3 of year 1. Therefore, whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is determined by reference to the value of the P stock on the pre-signing date. In addition, S is a person related to P under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Accordingly, A is treated as exchanging his T shares for $50 of cash. Because, for continuity of interest purposes,
the T stock is exchanged for $20 of P stock and $80 of cash, the transaction does not preserve a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T. Therefore, the transaction does not satisfy the continuity of interest requirement.

# Example 4. Modification of binding contract—continuity not preserved.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that on April 1 of year 1, the parties modify their contract. Pursuant to the modified contract, which is a binding contract, the T shareholders will receive 50 P shares (an additional 10 shares) and $75 of cash (an additional $15 of cash) in exchange for all of the outstanding T stock. On March 31 of year 1, the value of the P stock is $.50 per share. Under this paragraph (e)(2), although there was a binding contract providing for fixed consideration as of January 3 of year 1, terms of that contract relating to the consideration to be provided to the target shareholders were modified on April 1 of year 1. The execution of the transaction without modification would have resulted in the preservation of a substantial part of the value of the target corporation shareholders' proprietary interests in the target corporation if there had been no modification. However, because the modified contract provides for additional P stock and cash to be exchanged for all the proprietary interests in T, the exception in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section does not apply to preserve the original signing date. Therefore, whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is determined by reference to the value of the P stock on March 31 of year 1. Because, for continuity of interest purposes, the T stock is exchanged for $25 of P stock and $75 of cash, the transaction does not preserve a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T. Therefore, the transaction does not satisfy the continuity of interest requirement.

# Example 5. Modification of binding contract disregarded—continuity preserved.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4
except that, pursuant to the modified contract, which is a binding contract, the T shareholders will receive 60 P shares (an additional 20 shares as compared to the original contract) and $60 of cash in exchange for all of the outstanding T stock. In addition, on March 31 of year 1, the value of the P stock is $.40 per share. Under this paragraph (e)(2), although there was a binding contract providing for fixed consideration as of January 3 of year 1, terms of that contract relating to the consideration to be provided to the target shareholders were modified on April 1 of year 1. Nonetheless, the modification has the sole effect of providing for the issuance of additional P shares to the T shareholders. In addition, the execution of the terms of the contract without regard to the modification would have resulted in the preservation of a substantial part of the value of the T shareholders' proprietary interest in T because, for continuity of interest purposes, the T stock would have been exchanged for $40 of P stock and $60 of cash. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, the modification is not treated as a modification for purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section. Accordingly, whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is determined by reference to the value of the P stock on the pre-signing date. Because, for continuity of interest purposes, the T stock is exchanged for $60 of P stock and $60 of cash, the transaction preserves a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T. Therefore the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement.

# Example 6. New issuance.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that, instead of cash, the T shareholders will receive a new class of P securities that will be publicly traded. In the aggregate, the securities will have a stated principal amount of $60 and bear interest at the average LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rates) during the 10 days prior to the potential reorganization. If the T shareholders had been issued the P securities on January 2 of year 1, the P securities would have had a value of $60 (determined by reference to the value of comparable publicly traded securities). Whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is determined by reference to the value of the P stock and the P securities to be issued to the T shareholders on January 2 of year 1. Under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, for purposes of valuing the new P securities, they will be treated as having been issued on the pre-signing date. Because, for continuity of interest purposes, the T stock is exchanged for $40 of P stock and $60 of other property, the transaction preserves a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T. Therefore, the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement.

# Example 7. Fixed consideration—continuity not preserved.
On January 3 of year 1, P and T sign a binding contract pursuant to which T will be merged with and into P on June 1 of year 1. Pursuant to the contract, 60 shares of the T stock will be exchanged for $80 of cash and 40 shares of the T stock will be exchanged for 20 shares of P stock. On January 2 of year 1, the value of the P stock is $1 per share. On June 1 of year 1, T merges with and into P pursuant to the terms of the contract. This contract provides for fixed consideration and therefore whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is determined by reference to the value of the P stock on the pre-signing date. However, applying the signing date rule, the P stock represents only 20 percent of the value of the total consideration to be received by
the T shareholders. Accordingly, based on the economic realities of the exchange, the transaction does not preserve a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T. Therefore, the transaction does not satisfy the continuity of interest requirement.

# Example 8. Anti-dilution clause.
(i)
Absence of anti-dilution clause.
On January 3 of year 1, P and T sign a binding contract pursuant to which T will be merged with and into P on June 1 of year 1. Pursuant to the contract, the T shareholders will receive 40 P shares and $60 of cash in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of T. The contract does not contain a customary anti-dilution provision. The P stock is listed on an established market. On January 2 of year 1, the value of the P stock is $1 per share. On April 10 of year 1, P issues its stock to effect a stock split; each shareholder of P receives an additional share of P for each P share that it holds. On April 11 of year 1, the value of the P stock is $.50 per share. Because P altered its capital structure between January 3 and June 1 of year 1 in a manner that materially alters the economic arrangement of the parties, under paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section, the contract is not treated as a binding contract that provides for fixed consideration. Accordingly, whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement cannot be determined by reference to the value of the P stock on January 2 of year 1.
(ii)
Adjustment for anti-dilution clause.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 8
except that the contract contains a customary anti-dilution provision, and the T shareholders receive 80 P shares and $60 of cash in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of T. Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section, the contract is treated as a binding contract that provides for fixed consideration as of January 3 of year 1. Therefore, whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is generally determined by reference to the value of the P stock on January 2 of year 1. However, under paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section, the value of the P stock on the pre-signing date must be adjusted to take the stock split into account. For continuity of interest purposes, the T stock is exchanged for $40 of P stock (($1/2) × 80) and $60 of cash. Therefore, the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement.

# Example 9. Shareholder election.
On January 3 of year 1, P and T sign a binding contract pursuant to which T will be merged with and into P on June 1 of year 1. On January 2 of year 1, the value of the P stock and the T stock is $1 per share. Pursuant to the contract, at the shareholders' election, each share of T's 100 shares will be exchanged for cash of $1, or alternatively, P stock. The contract provides that the determination of the number of shares of P stock to be exchanged for a share of T stock is made using the value of the P stock on the last business day before the first date there is a binding contract (that is, $1 per share). The contract further provides that, in the aggregate, 40 shares of P stock and $60 will be delivered, and contains a proration mechanism in the event that either item of consideration is oversubscribed. On the closing date, the value of the P stock is $.20 per share, and all target shareholders elect to receive cash. Pursuant to the proration provision, each target share is exchanged for $.60 of cash and $.08 of P stock. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the contract provides for fixed consideration because it provides for the number of shares of P stock and the amount of money to be exchanged for all the proprietary interests in the target corporation. Furthermore, pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the contract provides for fixed consideration because the number of shares of issuing corporation stock to be provided to the target corporation shareholders is determined using the pre-signing date value of P stock. Accordingly, whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is determined by reference to the value of the P stock on January 2 of year 1. Because, for continuity purposes, the T stock is exchanged for $40 of P stock and $60 of cash, the transaction preserves a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T. Therefore, the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement.

# Example 10. Contingent adjustment based on the value of the issuing corporation stock—continuity not preserved.
On January 3 of year 1, P and T sign a binding contract pursuant to which T will be merged with and into P on June 1 of year 1. On January 2 of year 1, the value of the P stock is $1 per share. Pursuant to the contract, if the value of the P stock does not decrease after January 2 of year 1, the T shareholders will receive 40 P shares and $60 of cash in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of T. Furthermore, the contract provides that the T shareholders will receive $.16 of additional P shares and $.24 for every $.01 decrease in the value of one share of P stock after January 2 of year 1. On June 1 of year 1, T merges with and into P pursuant to the terms of the contract. On that date, the value of the P stock is $.40 per share. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, the consideration is adjusted so that the T shareholders receive 24 more P shares ((60 × $.16)/$.40) and $14.40 more cash (60 × $.24) than they would absent an adjustment. Accordingly, at closing the T shareholders receive 64 P shares and $74.40 of cash. Because the contract provides that additional P shares and cash will be delivered to the T shareholders if the value of the stock of P decreases after January 2 of year 1, under paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section, the contract is not treated as providing for fixed
consideration, and therefore whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement cannot be determined by reference to the value of the P stock on January 2 of year 1. For continuity of interest purposes, the T stock is exchanged for $25.60 of P stock (64 × $.40) and $74.40 of cash and the transaction does not preserve a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T. Therefore, the transaction does not satisfy the continuity of interest requirement.

# Example 11. Contingent adjustment to boot based on the value of the target corporation stock—continuity not preserved.
On January 3 of year 1, P and T sign a binding contract pursuant to which T will be merged with and into P on June 1 of year 1. On January 2 of year 1, T has 100 shares outstanding, and each T share is worth $1. On January 2 of year 1, each P share is worth $1. Pursuant to the contract, if the value of the T stock does not increase after January 3 of year 1, the T shareholders will receive 40 P shares and $60 of cash in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of T. Furthermore, the contract provides that the T shareholders will receive $1 of additional cash for every $.01 increase in the value of one share of T stock after January 3 of year 1. On June 1 of year 1, the value of the T stock is $1.40 per share and the value of the P stock is $.75 per share. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, the consideration is adjusted so that the T shareholders receive $40 more cash (40 × $1) than they would absent an adjustment. Accordingly, at closing the T shareholders receive 40 P shares and $100 of cash. Because the contract provides the number of shares of P stock and the amount of money to be exchanged for all the proprietary interests in T, and the contingent adjustment to the cash consideration is not based on changes in the value of the P stock, P assets, or any surrogate thereof, after January 2 of year 1, there is a binding contract providing for fixed consideration as of January 3 of year 1. Therefore, whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is determined by reference to the value of the P stock on January 2 of year 1. For continuity of interest purposes, the T stock is exchanged for $40 of P stock (40 × $1) and $100 of cash. Therefore, the transaction does not satisfy the continuity of interest requirement.

# Example 12. Contingent adjustment to stock based on the value of the target corporation stock—continuity preserved.
On January 3 of year 1, P and T sign a binding contract pursuant to which T will be merged with and into P on June 1 of year 1. On that date T has 100 shares outstanding, and each T share is worth $1. On January 2 of year 1, each P share is worth $1. Pursuant to the contract, if the value of the T stock does not decrease after January 3 of year 1, the T shareholders will receive 40 P shares and $60 of cash in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of T. Furthermore, the contract provides that the T shareholders will receive $.40 less P stock and $.60 less cash for every $.01 decrease in the value of one share of T stock after January 3 of year 1. The contract also provides that the number of P shares by which the consideration will be reduced as a result of this adjustment will be determined based on the value of the P stock on January 2 of year 1. On June 1 of year 1, T merges with and into P pursuant to the terms of the contract. On that date, the value of the T stock is $.70 per share and the value of the P stock is $.75 per share. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, the consideration is adjusted so that the T shareholders receive 12 fewer P shares ((30 × $.40)/$1) and $18 less cash (30 × $.60) than they would absent an adjustment. Accordingly, at closing the T shareholders receive 28 P shares and $42 of cash. Because the contract provides for the number of shares of P stock and the amount of money to be exchanged for all of the proprietary interests in T, the contract does not provide for contingent adjustments to the consideration based on a change in value of the P stock, P assets, or any surrogate thereof, after January 2 of year 1, and the adjustment to the number of P shares the T shareholders receive is determined based on the value of the P shares on January 2 of year 1, there is a binding contract providing for fixed consideration as of January 3 of year 1. Therefore, whether the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement is determined by reference to the value of the P stock on January 2 of year 1. For continuity of interest purposes, the T stock is exchanged for $28 of P stock (28 × $1) and $42 of cash. Accordingly, the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement.
(3)
Related persons acquisitions.
A proprietary interest in the target corporation is not preserved if, in connection with a potential reorganization, a person related (as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section) to the issuing corporation acquires, for consideration other than stock of the issuing corporation, either a proprietary interest in the target corporation or stock of the issuing corporation that was furnished in exchange for a proprietary interest in the target corporation. The preceding sentence does not apply to the extent those persons who were the direct or indirect owners of the target corporation prior to the potential reorganization maintain a direct or indirect proprietary interest in the issuing corporation.
(4)
Definition of related person
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), two corporations are related persons if either—
(A) The corporations are members of the same affiliated group as defined in section 1504 (determined without regard to section 1504(b)); or
(B) A purchase of the stock of one corporation by another corporation would be treated as a distribution in redemption of the stock of the first corporation under section 304(a)(2) (determined without regard to § 1.1502-80(b)).
(ii)
Special rules.
The following rules apply solely for purposes of this paragraph (e)(4):
(A) A corporation will be treated as related to another corporation if such relationship exists immediately before or immediately after the acquisition of the stock involved.
(B) A corporation, other than the target corporation or a person related (as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section determined without regard to paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section) to the target corporation, will be treated as related to the issuing corporation if the relationship is created in connection with the potential reorganization.
(5)
Acquisitions by partnerships.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), each partner of a partnership will be treated as owning or acquiring any stock owned or acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership in accordance with that partner's interest in the partnership. If a partner is treated as acquiring any stock by reason of the application of this paragraph (e)(5), the partner is also treated as having furnished its share of any consideration furnished by the partnership to acquire the stock in accordance with that partner's interest in the partnership.
(6)
Creditors' claims as proprietary interests
—(i)
In general.
A creditor's claim against a target corporation may be a proprietary interest in the target corporation if the target corporation is in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)) or the amount of the target corporation's liabilities exceeds the fair market value of its assets immediately prior to the potential reorganization. In such cases, if any creditor receives a proprietary interest in the issuing corporation in exchange for its claim, every claim of that class of creditors and every claim of all equal and junior classes of creditors (in addition to the claims of shareholders) is a proprietary interest in the target corporation immediately prior to the potential reorganization to the extent provided in paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Value of proprietary interest
—(A)
Claims of most senior class of creditors receiving stock.
A claim of the most senior class of creditors receiving a proprietary interest in the issuing corporation and a claim of any equal class of creditors will be treated as a proprietary interest in accordance with the rules of this paragraph (e)(6)(ii). For a claim of the most senior class of creditors receiving a proprietary interest in the issuing corporation, and a claim of any equal class of creditors, the value of the proprietary interest in the target corporation represented by the claim is determined by multiplying the fair market value of the claim by a fraction, the numerator of which is the fair market value of the proprietary interests in the issuing corporation that are received in the aggregate in exchange for the claims of those classes of creditors, and the denominator of which is the sum of the amount of money and the fair market value of all other consideration (including the proprietary interests in the issuing corporation) received in the aggregate in exchange for such claims. If only one class (or one set of equal classes) of creditors receives stock, such class (or set of equal classes) is treated as the most senior class of creditors receiving stock. When only one class (or one set of equal classes) of creditors receives issuing corporation stock in exchange for a creditor's proprietary interest in the target corporation, such stock will be counted for measuring continuity of interest provided that the stock issued by the issuing corporation is not de minimis in relation to the total consideration received by the insolvent target corporation, its shareholders, and its creditors.
(B)
Claims of junior classes of creditor receiving stock.
The value of a proprietary interest in the target corporation held by a creditor whose claim is junior
to the claims of other classes of target claims which are receiving proprietary interests in the issuing corporation is the fair market value of the junior creditor's claim.
(iii)
Bifurcated claims.
If a creditor's claim is bifurcated into a secured claim and an unsecured claim pursuant to an order in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)) or pursuant to an agreement between the creditor and the debtor, the bifurcation of the claim and the allocation of consideration to each of the resulting claims will be respected in applying the rules of this paragraph (e)(6).
(iv)
Effect of treating creditors as proprietors.
The treatment of a creditor's claim as a proprietary interest in the target corporation shall not preclude treating shares of the target corporation as proprietary interests in the target corporation.
(7)
Successors and predecessors.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), any reference to the issuing corporation or the target corporation includes a reference to any successor or predecessor of such corporation, except that the target corporation is not treated as a predecessor of the issuing corporation and the issuing corporation is not treated as a successor of the target corporation.
(8)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (e)(7), P is the issuing corporation, T is the target corporation, S is a wholly owned subsidiary of P, all corporations have only one class of stock outstanding, A and B are individuals, PRS is a partnership, all reorganization requirements other than the continuity of interest requirement are satisfied, and the transaction is not otherwise subject to recharacterization. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1. Sale of stock to third party.
(i)
Sale of issuing corporation stock after merger.
A owns all of the stock of T. T merges into P. In the merger, A receives P stock having a fair market value of $50x and cash of $50x. Immediately after the merger, and pursuant to a preexisting binding contract, A sells all of the P stock received by A in the merger to B. Assume that there are no facts and circumstances indicating that the cash used by B to purchase A's P stock was in substance exchanged by P for T stock. Under paragraphs (e)(1) and (3) of this section, the sale to B is disregarded because B is not a person related to P within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Thus, the transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement because 50 percent of A's T stock was exchanged for P stock, preserving a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T.
(ii)
Sale of target corporation stock before merger.
The facts are the same as paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that B buys A's T stock prior to the merger of T into P and then exchanges the T stock for P stock having a fair market value of $50x and cash of $50x. The sale by A is disregarded. The continuity of interest requirement is satisfied because B's T stock was exchanged for P stock, preserving a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T.

# Example 2. Relationship created in connection with potential reorganization.
Corporation X owns 60 percent of the stock of P and 30 percent of the stock of T. A owns the remaining 70 percent of the stock of T. X buys A's T stock for cash in a transaction which is not a qualified stock purchase within the meaning of section 338. T then merges into P. In the merger, X exchanges all of its T stock for additional stock of P. As a result of the issuance of the additional stock to X in the merger, X's ownership interest in P increases from 60 to 80 percent of the stock of P. X is not a person related to P under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section, because a purchase of stock of P by X would not be treated as a distribution in redemption of the stock of P under section 304(a)(2). However, X is a person related to P under paragraphs (e)(4)(i)(A) and (ii)(B) of this section, because X becomes affiliated with P in the merger. The continuity of interest requirement is not satisfied, because X acquired a proprietary interest in T for consideration other than P stock, and a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T is not preserved. See paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

# Example 3. Participation by issuing corporation in post-merger sale.
A owns 80 percent of the T stock and none of the P stock, which is widely held. T merges into P. In the merger, A receives P stock. In addition, A obtains rights pursuant to an arrangement with P to have P register the P stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. P registers A's stock, and A sells the stock shortly after the merger. No person who purchased the P stock from A is a person related to P within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Under paragraphs (e)(1) and (3) of this section, the sale of the P stock by A is disregarded because no person who purchased the P stock from A is a person related to P within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4) of this section. The transaction satisfies the continuity of interest requirement because
A's T stock was exchanged for P stock, preserving a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T.

# Example 4. Redemptions and purchases by issuing corporation or related persons.
(i)
Redemption by issuing corporation.
A owns 100 percent of the stock of T and none of the stock of P. T merges into S. In the merger, A receives P stock. In connection with the merger, P redeems all of the P stock received by A in the merger for cash. The continuity of interest requirement is not satisfied, because, in connection with the merger, P redeemed the stock exchanged for a proprietary interest in T, and a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T is not preserved. See paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Purchase of target corporation stock by issuing corporation.
The facts are the same as paragraph (i) of this
Example 4,
except that, instead of P redeeming its stock, prior to and in connection with the merger of T into S, P purchases 90 percent of the T stock from A for cash. The continuity of interest requirement is not satisfied, because in connection with the merger, P acquired a proprietary interest in T for consideration other than P stock, and a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T is not preserved. See paragraph (e)(1) of this section. However, see § 1.338-3(d) (which may change the result in this case by providing that, by virtue of section 338, continuity of interest is satisfied for certain parties after a qualified stock purchase).
(iii)
Purchase of issuing corporation stock by person related to issuing corporation.
The facts are the same as paragraph (i) of this
Example 4,
except that, instead of P redeeming its stock, S buys all of the P stock received by A in the merger for cash. S is a person related to P under paragraphs (e)(4)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. The continuity of interest requirement is not satisfied, because S acquired P stock issued in the merger, and a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T is not preserved. See paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

# Example 5. Redemption in substance by issuing corporation.
A owns 100 percent of the stock of T and none of the stock of P. T merges into P. In the merger, A receives P stock. In connection with the merger, B buys all of the P stock received by A in the merger for cash. Shortly thereafter, in connection with the merger, P redeems the stock held by B for cash. Based on all the facts and circumstances, P in substance has exchanged solely cash for T stock in the merger. The continuity of interest requirement is not satisfied, because in substance P redeemed the stock exchanged for a proprietary interest in T, and a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T is not preserved. See paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

# Example 6. Purchase of issuing corporation stock through partnership.
A owns 100 percent of the stock of T and none of the stock of P. S is an 85 percent partner in PRS. The other 15 percent of PRS is owned by unrelated persons. T merges into P. In the merger, A receives P stock. In connection with the merger, PRS purchases all of the P stock received by A in the merger for cash. Under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, S, as an 85 percent partner of PRS, is treated as having acquired 85 percent of the P stock exchanged for A's T stock in the merger, and as having furnished 85 percent of the cash paid by PRS to acquire the P stock. S is a person related to P under paragraphs (e)(4)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. The continuity of interest requirement is not satisfied, because S is treated as acquiring 85 percent of the P stock issued in the merger, and a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T is not preserved. See paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

# Example 7. Exchange by acquiring corporation for direct interest.
A owns 30 percent of the stock of T. P owns 70 percent of the stock of T, which was not acquired by P in connection with the acquisition of T's assets. T merges into P. A receives cash in the merger. The continuity of interest requirement is satisfied, because P's 70 percent proprietary interest in T is exchanged by P for a direct interest in the assets of the target corporation enterprise.

# Example 8. Maintenance of direct or indirect interest in issuing corporation.
X, a corporation, owns all of the stock of each of corporations P and Z. Z owns all of the stock of T. T merges into P. Z receives P stock in the merger. Immediately thereafter and in connection with the merger, Z distributes the P stock received in the merger to X. X is a person related to P under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. The continuity of interest requirement is satisfied, because X was an indirect owner of T prior to the merger who maintains a direct or indirect proprietary interest in P, preserving a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interest in T. See paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

# Example 9. Preacquisition redemption by target corporation.
T has two shareholders, A and B. P expresses an interest in acquiring the stock of T. A does not wish to own P stock. T redeems A's shares in T in exchange for cash. No funds have been or will be provided by P for this purpose. P subsequently acquires all the outstanding stock of T from B solely in exchange for voting stock of P. The cash received by A in the prereorganization redemption is not treated as other property or money under section 356, and would not be so treated even if A had received some stock of P in exchange for his T stock. The prereorganization redemption by T does not affect continuity of interest,
because B's proprietary interest in T is unaffected, and the value of the proprietary interest in T is preserved.

# Example 10. Creditors treated as owning a proprietary interest.
(i)
More than one class of creditor receives issuing corporation stock.
T has assets with a fair market value of $150x and liabilities of $200x. T has two classes of creditors: two senior creditors with claims of $25x each; and one junior creditor with a claim of $150x. T transfers all of its assets to P in exchange for $95x in cash and shares of P stock with a fair market value of $55x. Each T senior creditor receives $20x in cash and P stock with a fair market value of $5x in exchange for his claim. The T junior creditor receives $55x in cash and P stock with a fair market value of $45x in exchange for his claim. The T shareholders receive no consideration in exchange for their T stock. Under paragraph (e)(6) of this section, because the amount of T's liabilities exceeds the fair market value of its assets immediately prior to the potential reorganization, the claims of the creditors of T may be proprietary interests in T. Because the senior creditors receive proprietary interests in P in the transaction in exchange for their claims, their claims and the claim of the junior creditor and the T stock are treated as proprietary interests in T immediately prior to the transaction. Under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, the value of the proprietary interest of each of the senior creditors' claims is $5x (the fair market value of the senior creditor's claim, $25x, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is $10x, the fair market value of the proprietary interests in the issuing corporation, P, received in the aggregate in exchange for the claims of all the creditors in the senior class, and the denominator of which is $50x, the sum of the amount of money and the fair market value of all other consideration (including the proprietary interests in P) received in the aggregate in exchange for such claims). Accordingly, $5x of the stock that each of the senior creditors receives is counted in measuring continuity of interest. Under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(B) of this section, the value of the junior creditor's proprietary interest in T immediately prior to the transaction is $100x, the value of his claim. Thus, the value of the creditors' proprietary interests in total is $110x and the creditors received $55x worth of P stock in total in exchange for their proprietary interests. Therefore, P acquired 50 percent of the value of the proprietary interests in T in exchange for P stock. Because a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interests in T is preserved, the continuity of interest requirement is satisfied.
(ii)
One class of creditor receives issuing corporation stock and cash in disproportionate amounts.
T has assets with a fair market value of $80x and liabilities of $200x. T has one class of creditor with two creditors, A and B, each having a claim of $100x. T transfers all of its assets to P for $60x in cash and shares of P stock with a fair market value of $20x. A receives $40x in cash in exchange for its claim. B receives $20x in cash and P stock with a fair market value of $20x in exchange for its claim. The T shareholders receive no consideration in exchange for their T stock. The P stock is not de minimis in relation to the total consideration received. Under paragraph (e)(6) of this section, because the amount of T's liabilities exceeds the fair market value of its assets immediately prior to the potential reorganization, the claims of the creditors of T may be proprietary interests in T. Because the creditors of T received proprietary interests in P in the transaction in exchange for their claims, their claims and the T stock are treated as proprietary interests in T immediately prior to the transaction. Under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, the value of the proprietary interest of each of the senior creditors is $10x (the fair market value of a senior creditor's claim, $40x, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is $20x, the fair market value of the proprietary interests in the issuing corporation, P, received in the aggregate in exchange for the claims of all the creditors in the class, and the denominator of which is $80x, the sum of the amount of money and the fair market value of all other consideration (including the proprietary interests in P) received in the aggregate in exchange for such claims). Accordingly, $10x of the cash that was received by A and $10x of the P stock that was received by B are counted in measuring continuity of interest. Thus, the value of the creditors' proprietary interests in total is $20x and the creditors received $10x worth of P stock in total in exchange for their proprietary interests. Therefore, P acquired 50 percent of the value of the proprietary interests in T in exchange for P stock. Because a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interests in T is preserved, the continuity of interest requirement is satisfied.
(9)
Effective/applicability dates
—(i)
In general.
Paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(3) through (e)(7) of this section apply to transactions occurring after January 28, 1998, except that they do not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding on January 28, 1998, and at all times thereafter. Paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, however, applies to transactions occurring after August 30, 2000, unless the transaction occurs pursuant to a written agreement that is (subject to customary conditions) binding on that date and at all times thereafter.
Taxpayers who entered into a binding agreement on or after January 28, 1998, and before August 30, 2000, may request a private letter ruling permitting them to apply the final regulations to their transaction. A private letter ruling will not be issued unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the IRS that there is not a significant risk of different parties to the transaction taking inconsistent positions, for Federal tax purposes, with respect to the applicability of the final regulations to the transaction. The sixth sentence of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the last sentence of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, paragraph (e)(3) of this section, paragraph (e)(6) of this section, and
Example 10
of paragraph (e)(8) of this section apply to transactions occurring after December 12, 2008.
(ii)
COI measurement date.
Paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies to transactions occurring pursuant to binding contracts entered into after December 19, 2011. For transactions entered into after March 19, 2010, and occurring pursuant to binding contracts entered into on or before December 19, 2011, the parties to the transaction may elect to apply the provisions of § 1.368-1T as contained in 26 CFR, Part 1, §§ 1.301-1.400, revised as of April 1, 2009. However, the target corporation, the issuing corporation, the controlling corporation of the acquiring corporation if stock thereof is provided as consideration in the transaction, and any direct or indirect transferee of transferred basis property from any of the foregoing, may not elect to apply the provisions of § 1.368-1T as contained in 26 CFR, Part 1, §§ 1.301-1.400, revised as of April 1, 2009, unless all such taxpayers elect to apply such provisions. This election requirement will be satisfied if none of the specified parties adopts inconsistent treatment. For transactions entered into on or before March 19, 2010, see § 1.368-1T as contained in 26 CFR, Part 1, §§ 1.301-1.400, revised as of April 1, 2009.

§ 1.368-2
Definition of terms.
(a) The application of the term
reorganization
is to be strictly limited to the specific transactions set forth in section 368(a). The term does not embrace the mere purchase by one corporation of the properties of another corporation. The preceding sentence applies to transactions occurring after January 28, 1998, except that it does not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding on January 28, 1998, and at all times thereafter. If the properties are transferred for cash and deferred payment obligations of the transferee evidenced by short-term notes, the transaction is a sale and not an exchange in which gain or loss is not recognized.
(b)(1)(i)
Definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), the following terms shall have the following meanings:
(A)
Disregarded entity.
A disregarded entity is a business entity (as defined in § 301.7701-2(a) of this chapter) that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes. Examples of disregarded entities include a domestic single member limited liability company that does not elect to be classified as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes, a corporation (as defined in § 301.7701-2(b) of this chapter) that is a qualified REIT subsidiary (within the meaning of section 856(i)(2)), and a corporation that is a qualified subchapter S subsidiary (within the meaning of section 1361(b)(3)(B)).
(B)
Combining entity.
A combining entity is a business entity that is a corporation (as defined in § 301.7701-2(b) of this chapter) that is not a disregarded entity.
(C)
Combining unit.
A combining unit is composed solely of a combining entity and all disregarded entities, if any, the assets of which are treated as owned by such combining entity for Federal income tax purposes.
(ii)
Statutory merger or consolidation generally.
For purposes of section
368(a)(1)(A), a statutory merger or consolidation is a transaction effected pursuant to the statute or statutes necessary to effect the merger or consolidation, in which transaction, as a result of the operation of such statute or statutes, the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction—
(A) All of the assets (other than those distributed in the transaction) and liabilities (except to the extent such liabilities are satisfied or discharged in the transaction or are nonrecourse liabilities to which assets distributed in the transaction are subject) of each member of one or more combining units (each a transferor unit) become the assets and liabilities of one or more members of one other combining unit (the transferee unit); and
(B) The combining entity of each transferor unit ceases its separate legal existence for all purposes; provided, however, that this requirement will be satisfied even if, under applicable law, after the effective time of the transaction, the combining entity of the transferor unit (or its officers, directors, or agents) may act or be acted against, or a member of the transferee unit (or its officers, directors, or agents) may act or be acted against in the name of the combining entity of the transferor unit, provided that such actions relate to assets or obligations of the combining entity of the transferor unit that arose, or relate to activities engaged in by such entity, prior to the effective time of the transaction, and such actions are not inconsistent with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In each of the examples, except as otherwise provided, each of R, V, Y, and Z is a C corporation. X is a domestic limited liability company. Except as otherwise provided, X is wholly owned by Y and is disregarded as an entity separate from Y for Federal income tax purposes. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Divisive transaction pursuant to a merger statute.
(i)
Facts.
Under State W law, Z transfers some of its assets and liabilities to Y, retains the remainder of its assets and liabilities, and remains in existence for Federal income tax purposes following the transaction. The transaction qualifies as a merger under State W corporate law.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transaction does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section because all of the assets and liabilities of Z, the combining entity of the transferor unit, do not become the assets and liabilities of Y, the combining entity and sole member of the transferee unit. In addition, the transaction does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section because the separate legal existence of Z does not cease for all purposes. Accordingly, the transaction does not qualify as a statutory merger or consolidation under section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 2. Merger of a target corporation into a disregarded entity in exchange for stock of the owner.
(i)
Facts.
Under State W law, Z merges into X. Pursuant to such law, the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z become the assets and liabilities of X and Z's separate legal existence ceases for all purposes. In the merger, the Z shareholders exchange their stock of Z for stock of Y.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transaction satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section because the transaction is effected pursuant to State W law and the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z, the combining entity and sole member of the transferor unit, become the assets and liabilities of one or more members of the transferee unit that is comprised of Y, the combining entity of the transferee unit, and X, a disregarded entity the assets of which Y is treated as owning for Federal income tax purposes, and Z ceases its separate legal existence for all purposes. Accordingly, the transaction qualifies as a statutory merger or consolidation for purposes of section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 3. Merger of a target S corporation that owns a QSub into a disregarded entity.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that Z is an S corporation and owns all of the stock of U, a QSub.
(ii)
Analysis.
The deemed formation by Z of U pursuant to § 1.1361-5(b)(1) (as a consequence of the termination of U's QSub election) is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. The transaction is treated as a transfer of the assets of U to X, followed by X's transfer of these assets to U in exchange for stock of U. See § 1.1361-5(b)(3)
Example 9.
The transaction will, therefore, satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section because the transaction is effected pursuant to State W law and the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z and U, the sole members of
the transferor unit, become the assets and liabilities of one or more members of the transferee unit that is comprised of Y, the combining entity of the transferee unit, and X, a disregarded entity the assets of which Y is treated as owning for Federal income tax purposes, and Z ceases its separate legal existence for all purposes. Moreover, the deemed transfer of the assets of U in exchange for U stock does not cause the transaction to fail to qualify as a statutory merger or consolidation. See § 368(a)(2)(C). Accordingly, the transaction qualifies as a statutory merger or consolidation for purposes of section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 4. Triangular merger of a target corporation into a disregarded entity.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that V owns 100 percent of the outstanding stock of Y and, in the merger of Z into X, the Z shareholders exchange their stock of Z for stock of V. In the transaction, Z transfers substantially all of its properties to X.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transaction is not prevented from qualifying as a statutory merger or consolidation under section 368(a)(1)(A), provided the requirements of section 368(a)(2)(D) are satisfied. Because the assets of X are treated for Federal income tax purposes as the assets of Y, Y will be treated as acquiring substantially all of the properties of Z in the merger for purposes of determining whether the merger satisfies the requirements of section 368(a)(2)(D). As a result, the Z shareholders that receive stock of V will be treated as receiving stock of a corporation that is in control of Y, the combining entity of the transferee unit that is the acquiring corporation for purposes of section 368(a)(2)(D). Accordingly, the merger will satisfy the requirements of section 368(a)(2)(D).

# Example 5. Merger of a target corporation into a disregarded entity owned by a partnership.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that Y is organized as a partnership under the laws of State W and is classified as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transaction does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. All of the assets and liabilities of Z, the combining entity and sole member of the transferor unit, do not become the assets and liabilities of one or more members of a transferee unit because neither X nor Y qualifies as a combining entity. Accordingly, the transaction cannot qualify as a statutory merger or consolidation for purposes of section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 6. Merger of a disregarded entity into a corporation.
(i)
Facts.
Under State W law, X merges into Z. Pursuant to such law, the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of X (but not the assets and liabilities of Y other than those of X) become the assets and liabilities of Z and X's separate legal existence ceases for all purposes.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transaction does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section because all of the assets and liabilities of a transferor unit do not become the assets and liabilities of one or more members of the transferee unit. The transaction also does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section because X does not qualify as a combining entity. Accordingly, the transaction cannot qualify as a statutory merger or consolidation for purposes of section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 7. Merger of a corporation into a disregarded entity in exchange for interests in the disregarded entity.
(i)
Facts.
Under State W law, Z merges into X. Pursuant to such law, the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z become the assets and liabilities of X and Z's separate legal existence ceases for all purposes. In the merger of Z into X, the Z shareholders exchange their stock of Z for interests in X so that, immediately after the merger, X is not disregarded as an entity separate from Y for Federal income tax purposes. Following the merger, pursuant to § 301.7701-3(b)(1)(i) of this chapter, X is classified as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transaction does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section because immediately after the merger X is not disregarded as an entity separate from Y and, consequently, all of the assets and liabilities of Z, the combining entity of the transferor unit, do not become the assets and liabilities of one or more members of a transferee unit. Accordingly, the transaction cannot qualify as a statutory merger or consolidation for purposes of section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 8. Merger transaction preceded by distribution.
(i)
Facts.
Z operates two unrelated businesses, Business P and Business Q, each of which represents 50 percent of the value of the assets of Z. Y desires to acquire and continue operating Business P, but does not want to acquire Business Q. Pursuant to a single plan, Z sells Business Q for cash to parties unrelated to Z and Y in a taxable transaction, and then distributes the proceeds of the sale pro rata to its shareholders. Then, pursuant to State W law, Z merges into Y. Pursuant to such law, the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z related to Business P become the assets and liabilities of Y and Z's separate legal existence ceases for all purposes. In the merger, the Z shareholders exchange their Z stock for Y stock.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transaction satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section because the transaction is effected pursuant to State W law and the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z, the combining entity and sole member of the transferor unit, become the assets and liabilities of Y, the combining entity and sole member of the transferee unit, and Z ceases its separate legal existence for all purposes. Accordingly, the transaction qualifies as a statutory merger or consolidation for purposes of section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 9. State law conversion of target corporation into a limited liability company.
(i)
Facts.
Y acquires the stock of V from the V shareholders in exchange for consideration that consists of 50 percent voting stock of Y and 50 percent cash. Immediately after the stock acquisition, V files the necessary documents to convert from a corporation to a limited liability company under State W law. Y's acquisition of the stock of V and the conversion of V to a limited liability company are steps in a single integrated acquisition by Y of the assets of V.
(ii)
Analysis.
The acquisition by Y of the assets of V does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section because V, the combining entity of the transferor unit, does not cease its separate legal existence. Although V is an entity disregarded from its owner for Federal income tax purposes, it continues to exist as a juridical entity after the conversion. Accordingly, Y's acquisition of the assets of V does not qualify as a statutory merger or consolidation for purposes of section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 10. Dissolution of target corporation.
(i)
Facts.
Y acquires the stock of Z from the Z shareholders in exchange for consideration that consists of 50 percent voting stock of Y and 50 percent cash. Immediately after the stock acquisition, Z files a certificate of dissolution pursuant to State W law and commences winding up its activities. Under State W dissolution law, ownership and title to Z's assets does not automatically vest in Y upon dissolution. Instead, Z transfers assets to its creditors in satisfaction of its liabilities and transfers its remaining assets to Y in the liquidation stage of the dissolution. Y's acquisition of the stock of Z and the dissolution of Z are steps in a single integrated acquisition by Y of the assets of Z.
(ii)
Analysis.
The acquisition by Y of the assets of Z does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section because Y does not acquire all of the assets of Z as a result of Z filing the certificate of dissolution or simultaneously with Z ceasing its separate legal existence. Instead, Y acquires the assets of Z by reason of Z's transfer of its assets to Y. Accordingly, Y's acquisition of the assets of Z does not qualify as a statutory merger or consolidation for purposes of section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 11. Merger of corporate partner into a partnership.
(i)
Facts.
Y owns an interest in X, an entity classified as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes, that represents a 60 percent capital and profits interest in X. Z owns an interest in X that represents a 40 percent capital and profits interest. Under State W law, Z merges into X. Pursuant to such law, the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z become the assets and liabilities of X and Z ceases its separate legal existence for all purposes. In the merger, the Z shareholders exchange their stock of Z for stock of Y. As a result of the merger, X becomes an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from Y for Federal income tax purposes.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transaction satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section because the transaction is effected pursuant to State W law and the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z, the combining entity and sole member of the transferor unit, become the assets and liabilities of one or more members of the transferee unit that is comprised of Y, the combining entity of the transferee unit, and X, a disregarded entity the assets of which Y is treated as owning for Federal income tax purposes immediately after the transaction, and Z ceases its separate legal existence for all purposes. Accordingly, the transaction qualifies as a statutory merger or consolidation for purposes of section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 12. State law consolidation.
(i)
Facts.
Under State W law, Z and V consolidate. Pursuant to such law, the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z and V become the assets and liabilities of Y, an entity that is created in the transaction, and the existence of Z and V continues in Y. In the consolidation, the Z shareholders and the V shareholders exchange their stock of Z and V, respectively, for stock of Y.
(ii)
Analysis.
With respect to each of Z and V, the transaction satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section because the transaction is effected pursuant to State W law and the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z and V, respectively, each of which is the combining entity of a transferor unit, become the assets and liabilities of Y, the combining entity and sole member of the transferee unit, and Z and V each ceases its separate legal existence for all purposes. Accordingly, the transaction qualifies as the statutory merger or consolidation of each of Z and V into Y for purposes of section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 13. Transaction effected pursuant to foreign statutes.
(i)
Facts.
Z and Y are entities organized under the laws of Country Q and classified as corporations for Federal income tax purposes. Z and Y combine. Pursuant to statutes of Country Q the following events occur simultaneously: all of the assets and liabilities of Z become the assets and liabilities of Y and Z's separate legal existence ceases for all purposes.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transaction satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section because the transaction is effected pursuant to statutes of Country Q and the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z, the combining entity of the transferor unit, become the assets and liabilities of Y, the combining entity and sole member of the transferee unit, and Z ceases its separate legal existence for all purposes. Accordingly, the transaction qualifies as a statutory merger or consolidation for purposes of section 368(a)(1)(A).

# Example 14. Foreign law amalgamation using parent stock.
(i)
Facts.
Z and V are entities organized under the laws of Country Q and classified as corporations for Federal income tax purposes. Z and V amalgamate. Pursuant to statutes of Country Q, the following events occur simultaneously: all the assets and liabilities of Z and V become the assets and liabilities of R, an entity that is created in the transaction and that is wholly owned by Y immediately after the transaction, and Z's and V's separate legal existences cease for all purposes. In the transaction, the Z and V shareholders exchange their Z and V stock, respectively, for stock of Y.
(ii)
Analysis.
With respect to each of Z and V, the transaction satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section because the transaction is effected pursuant to Country Q law and the following events occur simultaneously at the effective time of the transaction: all of the assets and liabilities of Z and V, respectively, each of which is the combining entity of a transferor unit, become the assets and liabilities of R, the combining entity and sole member of the transferee unit, with regard to each of the above transfers, and Z and V each ceases its separate legal existence for all purposes. Because Y is in control of R immediately after the transaction, the Z shareholders and the V shareholders will be treated as receiving stock of a corporation that is in control of R, the combining entity of the transferee unit that is the acquiring corporation for purposes of section 368(a)(2)(D). Accordingly, the transaction qualifies as the statutory merger or consolidation of each of Z and V into R, a corporation controlled by Y, and is a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(D).
(v)
Effective date
—(A)
In general.
This paragraph (b)(1) applies to transactions occurring on or after January 23, 2006. For rules regarding statutory mergers or consolidation occurring before January 23, 2006, see § 1.368-2T as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2005, and § 1.368-2(b)(1) as in effect before January 24, 2003 (see 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2002).
(B)
Transitional rule.
A taxpayer may elect to apply the provisions of § 1.368-2T(b) as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2005 (the temporary regulations), instead of the provisions of this paragraph (b), to a transaction that occurs on or after January 23, 2006, pursuant to a written agreement which is (subject to customary conditions) binding on January 22, 2006, and at all times thereafter, or pursuant to a tender offer announced prior to January 23, 2006. However, the combining entity of the transferor unit, the combining entity of the transferee unit, any controlling corporation of the combining entity of the transferee unit if stock thereof is provided as consideration in the transaction, and any direct or indirect transferee of transferred basis property from any of the foregoing, may not elect to apply the provisions of the temporary regulations unless all such taxpayers elect to apply the provisions of the temporary regulations.
(2) In order for the transaction to qualify under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of the application of section 368(a)(2)(D), one corporation (the acquiring corporation) must acquire substantially all of the properties of another corporation (the acquired corporation) partly or entirely in exchange for stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation (the controlling corporation), provided that (i) the transaction would have qualified under section 368(a)(1)(A) if the merger had been into the controlling corporation, and (ii) no stock of the acquiring corporation is used in the transaction. The foregoing test of whether the transaction would have qualified under section 368(a)(1)(A) if the merger had been into the controlling corporation means that the general requirements of a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) (such as a business purpose, continuity of business enterprise, and continuity
of interest) must be met in addition to the special requirements of section 368(a)(2)(D). Under this test, it is not relevant whether the merger into the controlling corporation could have been effected pursuant to State or Federal corporation law. The term
substantially all
has the same meaning as it has in section 368(a)(1)(C). Although no stock of the acquiring corporation can be used in the transaction, there is no prohibition (other than the continuity of interest requirement) against using other property, such as cash or securities, of either the acquiring corporation or the parent or both. In addition, the controlling corporation may assume liabilities of the acquired corporation without disqualifying the transaction under section 368(a)(2(D), and for purposes of section 357(a) the controlling corporation is considered a party to the exchange. For example, if the controlling corporation agrees to substitute its stock for stock of the acquired corporation under an outstanding employee stock option agreement, this assumption of liability will not prevent the transaction from qualifying as a reorganization under section 368(a)(2)(D) and the assumption of liability is not treated as money or other property for purposes of section 361(b). Section 368(a)(2)(D) applies whether or not the controlling corporation (or the acquiring corporation) is formed immediately before the merger, in anticipation of the merger, or after preliminary steps have been taken to merge directly into the controlling corporation. Section 368(a)(2)(D) applies only to statutory mergers occurring after October 22, 1968.
(3) For regulations under section 368(a)(2)(E), see paragraph (j) of this section.
(c) In order to qualify as a “reorganization” under section 368(a)(1)(B), the acquisition by the acquiring corporation of stock of another corporation must be in exchange solely for all or a part of the voting stock of the acquiring corporation (or, in the case of transactions occurring after December 31, 1963, solely for all or a part of the voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation), and the acquiring corporation must be in control of the other corporation immediately after the transaction. If, for example, Corporation X in one transaction exchanges nonvoting preferred stock or bonds in addition to all or a part of its voting stock in the acquisition of stock of Corporation Y, the transaction is not a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B). Nor is a transaction a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B) if stock is acquired in exchange for voting stock both of the acquiring corporation and of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation. The acquisition of stock of another corporation by the acquiring corporation solely for its voting stock (or solely for voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation) is permitted tax-free even though the acquiring corporation already owns some of the stock of the other corporation. Such an acquisition is permitted tax-free in a single transaction or in a series of transactions taking place over a relatively short period of time such as 12 months. For example, Corporation A purchased 30 percent of the common stock of Corporation W (the only class of stock outstanding) for cash in 1939. On March 1, 1955, Corporation A offers to exchange its own voting stock for all the stock of Corporation W tendered within 6 months from the date of the offer. Within the 6-months' period Corporation A acquires an additional 60 percent of stock of Corporation W solely for its own voting stock, so that it owns 90 percent of the stock of Corporation W. No gain or loss is recognized with respect to the exchanges of stock of Corporation A for stock of Corporation W. For this purpose, it is immaterial whether such exchanges occurred before Corporation A acquired control (80 percent) of Corporation W or after such control was acquired. If Corporation A had acquired 80 percent of the stock of Corporation W for cash in 1939, it could likewise acquire some or all of the remainder of such stock solely in exchange for its own voting stock without recognition of gain or loss.
(d) In order to qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C), the transaction must be one described in subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph:
(1) One corporation must acquire substantially all the properties of another corporation solely in exchange for all or a part of its own voting stock, or solely in exchange for all or a part of the voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation. For example, Corporation P owns all the stock of Corporation A. All the properties of Corporation W are transferred to Corporation A either solely in exchange for voting stock of Corporation P or solely in exchange for less than 80 percent of the voting stock of Corporation A. Either of such transactions constitutes a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C). However, if the properties of Corporation W are acquired in exchange for voting stock of both Corporation P and Corporation A, the transaction will not constitute a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C). In determining whether the exchange meets the requirement of “solely for voting stock”, the assumption by the acquiring corporation of liabilities of the transferor corporation, or the fact that property acquired from the transferor corporation is subject to a liability, shall be disregarded. Though such an assumption does not prevent an exchange from being solely for voting stock for the purposes of the definition of a reorganization contained in section 368(a)(1)(C), it may in some cases, however, so alter the character of the transaction as to place the transaction outside the purposes and assumptions of the reorganization provisions. Section 368(a)(1)(C) does not prevent consideration of the effect of an assumption of liabilities on the general character of the transaction but merely provides that the requirement that the exchange be solely for voting stock is satisfied if the only additional consideration is an assumption of liabilities.
(2) One corporation:
(i) Must acquire substantially all of the properties of another corporation in such manner that the acquisition would qualify under (1) above, but for the fact that the acquiring corporation exchanges money, or other property in addition to such voting stock, and
(ii) Must acquire solely for voting stock (either of the acquiring corporation or of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation) properties of the other corporation having a fair market value which is at least 80 percent of the fair market value of all the properties of the other corporation.
(3) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(ii) only, a liability assumed or to which the properties are subject is considered money paid for the properties. For example, Corporation A has properties with a fair market value of $100,000 and liabilities of $10,000. In exchange for these properties, Corporation Y transfers its own voting stock, assumes the $10,000 liabilities, and pays $8,000 in cash. The transaction is a reorganization even though a part of the properties of Corporation A is acquired for cash. On the other hand, if the properties of Corporation A worth $100,000, were subject to $50,000 in liabilities, an acquisition of all the properties, subject to the liabilities, for any consideration other than solely voting stock would not qualify as a reorganization under this section since the liabilities alone are in excess of 20 percent of the fair market value of the properties. If the transaction would qualify under either subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph and also under section 368(a)(1)(D), such transaction shall not be treated as a reorganization under section 368 (a)(1)(C).
(4)(i) For purposes of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2)(ii) of this section, prior ownership of stock of the target corporation by an acquiring corporation will not by itself prevent the solely for voting stock requirement of such paragraphs from being satisfied. In a transaction in which the acquiring corporation has prior ownership of stock of the target corporation, the requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is satisfied only if the sum of the money or other property that is distributed in pursuance of the plan of reorganization to the shareholders of the target corporation other than the acquiring corporation and to the creditors of the target corporation pursuant to section 361(b)(3), and all of the liabilities of the target corporation assumed by the acquiring corporation (including liabilities to which the properties of the target corporation are subject), does not exceed 20 percent of the value of all of
the properties of the target corporation. If, in connection with a potential acquisition by an acquiring corporation of substantially all of a target corporation's properties, the acquiring corporation acquires the target corporation's stock for consideration other than the acquiring corporation's own voting stock (or voting stock of a corporation in control of the acquiring corporation if such stock is used in the acquisition of the target corporation's properties), whether from a shareholder of the target corporation or the target corporation itself, such consideration is treated, for purposes of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, as money or other property exchanged by the acquiring corporation for the target corporation's properties. Accordingly, the transaction will not qualify under section 368(a)(1)(C) unless, treating such consideration as money or other property, the requirements of section 368(a)(2)(B) and paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section are met. The determination of whether there has been an acquisition in connection with a potential reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C) of a target corporation's stock for consideration other than an acquiring corporation's own voting stock (or voting stock of a corporation in control of the acquiring corporation if such stock is used in the acquisition of the target corporation's properties) will be made on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances.
(ii) The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (d)(4):

# Example 1.
Corporation P (P) holds 60 percent of the Corporation T (T) stock that P purchased several years ago in an unrelated transaction. T has 100 shares of stock outstanding. The other 40 percent of the T stock is owned by Corporation X (X), an unrelated corporation. T has properties with a fair market value of $110 and liabilities of $10. T transfers all of its properties to P. In exchange, P assumes the $10 of liabilities, and transfers to T $30 of P voting stock and $10 of cash. T distributes the P voting stock and $10 of cash to X and liquidates. The transaction satisfies the solely for voting stock requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section because the sum of $10 of cash paid to X and the assumption by P of $10 of liabilities does not exceed 20% of the value of the properties of T.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that P purchased the 60 shares of T for $60 in cash in connection with the acquisition of T's assets. The transaction does not satisfy the solely for voting stock requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section because P is treated as having acquired all of the T assets for consideration consisting of $70 of cash, $10 of liability assumption and $30 of P voting stock, and the sum of $70 of cash and the assumption by P of $10 of liabilities exceeds 20% of the value of the properties of T.
(iii) This paragraph (d)(4) applies to transactions occurring after December 31, 1999, unless the transaction occurs pursuant to a written agreement that is (subject to customary conditions) binding on that date and at all times thereafter.
(e) A “recapitalization”, and therefore a reorganization, takes place if, for example:
(1) A corporation with $200,000 par value of bonds outstanding, instead of paying them off in cash, discharges them by issuing preferred shares to the bondholders;
(2) There is surrendered to a corporation for cancellation 25 percent of its preferred stock in exchange for no par value common stock;
(3) A corporation issues preferred stock, previously authorized but unissued, for outstanding common stock;
(4) An exchange is made of a corporation's outstanding preferred stock, having certain priorities with reference to the amount and time of payment of dividends and the distribution of the corporate assets upon liquidation, for a new issue of such corporation's common stock having no such rights;
(5) An exchange is made of an amount of a corporation's outstanding preferred stock with dividends in arrears for other stock of the corporation. However, if pursuant to such an exchange there is an increase in the proportionate interest of the preferred shareholders in the assets or earnings and profits of the corporation, then under § 1.305-7(c)(2), an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount by which the fair market value or liquidation preference, whichever is greater, of the stock received in the exchange (determined immediately following the recapitalization) exceeds the issue price of the preferred stock surrendered, or
(ii) the amount of the dividends in arrears, shall be treated under section 305(c) as a deemed distribution to which sections 305(b)(4) and 301 apply.
(f) The term
a party to a reorganization
includes a corporation resulting from a reorganization, and both corporations, in a transaction qualifying as a reorganization where one corporation acquires stock or properties of another corporation. If a transaction otherwise qualifies as a reorganization, a corporation remains a party to the reorganization even though stock or assets acquired in the reorganization are transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (k) of this section. If a transaction otherwise qualifies as a reorganization, a corporation shall not cease to be a party to the reorganization solely by reason of the fact that part or all of the assets acquired in the reorganization are transferred to a partnership in which the transferor is a partner if the continuity of business enterprise requirement is satisfied. See § 1.368-1(d). The preceding three sentences apply to transactions occurring after January 28, 1998, except that they do not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding on January 28, 1998, and at all times thereafter. A corporation controlling an acquiring corporation is a party to the reorganization when the stock of such controlling corporation is used in the acquisition of properties. Both corporations are parties to the reorganization if, under statutory authority, Corporation A is merged into Corporation B. All three of the corporations are parties to the reorganization if, pursuant to statutory authority, Corporation C and Corporation D are consolidated into Corporation E. Both corporations are parties to the reorganization if Corporation F transfers substantially all its assets to Corporation G in exchange for all or a part of the voting stock of Corporation G. All three corporations are parties to the reorganization if Corporation H transfers substantially all its assets to Corporation K in exchange for all or a part of the voting stock of Corporation L, which is in control of Corporation K. Both corporations are parties to the reorganization if Corporation M transfers all or part of its assets to Corporation N in exchange for all or a part of the stock and securities of Corporation N, but only if (1) immediately after such transfer, Corporation M, or one or more of its shareholders (including persons who were shareholders immediately before such transfer), or any combination thereof, is in control of Corporation N, and (2) in pursuance of the plan, the stock and securities of Corporation N are transferred or distributed by Corporation M in a transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized under section 354 or 355, or is recognized only to the extent provided in section 356. Both Corporation O and Corporation P, but not Corporation S, are parties to the reorganization if Corporation O acquires stock of Corporation P from Corporation S in exchange solely for a part of the voting stock of Corporation O, if (1) the stock of Corporation P does not constitute substantially all of the assets of Corporation S, (2) Corporation S is not in control of Corporation O immediately after the acquisition, and (3) Corporation O is in control of Corporation P immediately after the acquisition. If a transaction otherwise qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B) or as a reverse triangular merger (as defined in § 1.358-6(b)(2)(iii)), the target corporation (in the case of a transaction that otherwise qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B)) or the surviving corporation (in the case of a transaction that otherwise qualifies as a reverse triangular merger) remains a party to the reorganization even though its stock or assets are transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (k) of this section. If a transaction otherwise qualifies as a forward triangular merger (as defined in § 1.358-6(b)(2)(i)), a triangular B reorganization (as defined in § 1.358-6(b)(2)(iv)), a triangular C reorganization (as defined in § 1.358-6(b)(2)(ii)), or a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(G) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(D), the acquiring corporation remains a party to the reorganization even though its stock is transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (k) of this section. The two preceding sentences apply to transactions occurring on or after October 25, 2007, except
that they do not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding before October 25, 2007, and at all times after that.
(g) The term
plan of reorganization
has reference to a consummated transaction specifically defined as a reorganization under section 368(a). The term is not to be construed as broadening the definition of
reorganization
as set forth in section 368(a), but is to be taken as limiting the nonrecognition of gain or loss to such exchanges or distributions as are directly a part of the transaction specifically described as a reorganization in section 368(a). Moreover, the transaction, or series of transactions, embraced in a plan of reorganization must not only come within the specific language of section 368(a), but the readjustments involved in the exchanges or distributions effected in the consummation thereof must be undertaken for reasons germane to the continuance of the business of a corporation a party to the reorganization. Section 368(a) contemplates genuine corporate reorganizations which are designed to effect a readjustment of continuing interests under modified corporate forms.
(h) As used in section 368, as well as in other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, if the context so requires, the conjunction “or” denotes both the conjunctive and the disjunctive, and the singular includes the plural. For example, the provisions of the statute are complied with if “stock and securities” are received in exchange as well as if “stock or securities” are received.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)(1) This paragraph (j) prescribes rules relating to the application of section 368 (a)(2)(E).
(2) Section 368(a)(2)(E) does not apply to a consolidation.
(3) A transaction otherwise qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(A) is not disqualified by reason of the fact that stock of a corporation (the controlling corporation) which before the merger was in control of the merged corporation is used in the transaction, if the conditions of section 368(a)(2)(E) are satisfied. Those conditions are as follows:
(i) In the transaction, shareholders of the surviving corporation must surrender stock in exchange for voting stock of the controlling corporation. Further, the stock so surrendered must constitute control of the surviving corporation. Control is defined in section 368(c). The amount of stock constituting control is measured immediately before the transaction. For purposes of this subdivision (i), stock in the surviving corporation which is surrendered in the transaction (by any shareholder except the controlling corporation) in exchange for consideration furnished by the surviving corporation (and not by the controlling corporation of the merged corporation) is considered not to be outstanding immediately before the transaction. For effect on “substantially all” test of consideration furnished by the surviving corporation, see paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, the controlling corporation must control the surviving corporation immediately after the transaction.
(iii) After the transaction, the surviving corporation must hold substantially all of its own properties and substantially all of the properties of the merged corporation (other than stock of the controlling corporation distributed in the transaction). The surviving corporation may transfer such properties as provided in paragraph (k) of this section. After the transaction, except as provided in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the surviving corporation must hold substantially all of its own properties and substantially all of the properties of the merged corporation (other than stock of the controlling corporation distributed in the transaction). The term
substantially all
has the same meaning as in section 368(a)(1)(C). The “substantially all” test applies separately to the merged corporation and to the surviving corporation. In applying the “substantially all” test to the surviving corporation, consideration furnished in the transaction by the surviving corporation in exchange for its stock is property of the surviving corporation which it does not hold after the transaction. In applying the “substantially
all” test to the merged corporation, assets transferred from the controlling corporation to the merged corporation in pursuance of the plan of reorganization are not taken into account. Thus, for example, money transferred from the controlling corporation to the merged corporation to be used for the following purposes is not taken into account for purposes of the “substantially all” test:
(A) To pay additional consideration to shareholders of the surviving corporation;
(B) To pay dissenting shareholders of the surviving corporation;
(C) To pay creditors of the surviving corporation;
(D) To pay reorganization expenses; or
(E) To enable the merged corporation to satisfy state minimum capitalization requirements (where the money is returned to the controlling corporation as part of the transaction).
(iv) Paragraph (j)(3)(ii) and the first two sentences of paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section apply to transactions occurring on or after October 25, 2007, except that they do not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding before October 25, 2007, and at all times thereafter. The remainder of paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section applies to transactions occurring after January 28, 1998, except that it does not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding on January 28, 1998, and at all times after that.
(4) The controlling corporation may assume liabilities of the surviving corporation without disqualifying the transaction under section 368(a)(2)(E). An assumption of liabilities of the surviving corporation by the controlling corporation is a contribution to capital by the controlling corporation to the surviving corporation. If, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, securities of the surviving corporation are exchanged for securities of the controlling corporation, or for other securities of the surviving corporation, see sections 354 and 356.
(5) In applying section 368(a)(2)(E), it makes no difference if the merged corporation is an existing corporation, or is formed immediately before the merger, in anticipation of the merger, or after preliminary steps have been taken to otherwise acquire control of the surviving corporation.
(6) The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (j). In each of the examples, Corporation P owns all of the stock of Corporation S and, except as otherwise stated, Corporation T has outstanding 1,000 shares of common stock and no shares of any other class. In each of the examples, it is also assumed that the transaction qualifies under section 368(a)(1)(A) if the conditions of section 368(a)(2)(E) are satisfied.

# Example 1.
P owns no T stock. On January 1, 1981, S merges into T. In the merger, T's shareholders surrender 950 shares of common stock in exchange for P voting stock. The holders of the other 50 shares (who dissent from the merger) are paid in cash with funds supplied by P. After the transaction, T holds all of its own assets and all of S's assets. Based on these facts, the transaction qualifies under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of the application of section 368(a)(2)(E). In the transaction, former shareholders of T surrender, in exchange for P voting stock, an amount of T stock (950/1,000 shares or 95 percent) which constitutes control of T.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example (1)
except that holders of 100 shares in corporation T, who dissented from the merger, are paid in cash with funds supplied by T (and not by P or S) and in the merger, T's remaining shareholders surrender 720 shares of common stock in exchange for P voting stock and 180 shares of common stock for cash supplied by P. The requirements of section 368(a)(2)(E)(ii) are satisfied since, in the transaction, former shareholders of T surrender, in exchange for P voting stock, an amount of T stock (720/900 shares or 80 percent) which constitutes control of T. The T stock surrendered in exchange for consideration furnished by T is not considered outstanding for purposes of determining whether the amount of T stock surrendered by T shareholders for P stock constitutes control of T.

# Example 3.
T has outstanding 1,000 shares of common stock, 100 shares of nonvoting preferred stock, and no shares of any other class. On January 1, 1981, S merges into T. Prior to the merger, as part of the transaction, T distributes its own cash in redemption of the 100 shares of preferred stock. In the transaction, T's remaining shareholders surrender their 1,000 shares of common stock in exchange for P voting stock. The requirements of section 368(a)(2)(E)(ii) are satisfied
since, in the transaction, former shareholders of T surrender, in exchange for P voting stock, an amount of T stock (1,000/1,000 shares or 100 percent) which constitutes control of T. The preferred stock surrendered in exchange for consideration furnished by T is not considered outstanding for purposes of determining whether the amount of T stock surrendered by T shareholders for P stock constitutes control of T. However, the consideration furnished by T for its stock is property of T which T does not hold after the transaction for purposes of the substantially all test in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section.

# Example 4.
On January 1, 1971, P purchased 201 shares of T's stock. On January 1, 1981, S merges into T. In the merger, T's shareholders (other than P) surrender 799 shares of T stock in exchange for P voting stock. Based on these facts, in the transaction, former shareholders of T do not surrender, in exchange for P voting stock, an amount of T stock which constitutes control of T (799/1,000 shares being less than 80 percent). Therefore, the transaction does not qualify under section 368(a)(1)(A). However, if S is a transitory corporation, formed solely for purposes of effectuating the transaction, the transaction may qualify as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B) provided all of the applicable requirements are satisfied.

# Example 5.
On January 1, 1971, P purchased 200 shares of T's stock. On January 1, 1981, S merges into T. Prior to the merger, as part of the transaction, T distributes its own cash in redemption of 1 share of T stock from a T shareholder other than P. In the merger, T's remaining shareholders (other than P) surrender 799 shares of T stock in exchange for P voting stock. Based on these facts, in the transaction, former shareholders of T do not surrender, in exchange for P voting stock, an amount of T stock which constitutes control of T (799/999 shares being less than 80 percent). Therefore, the transaction does not qualify under section 368(a)(1)(A). However, if S is a transitory corporation, formed for purposes of effectuating the transaction, the transaction may qualify as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B) provided all of the applicable requirements are satisfied.

# Example 6.
The stock of S has a value of $25,000. The stock of T has a value of $75,000. On January 1, 1984, S merges into T. In the merger, T's shareholders surrender all of their T stock in exchange for P voting stock. After the transaction, T holds all of its own assets and all of S's assets. Based on these facts, the transaction qualifies under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of the application of section 368(a)(2)(E). In the transaction, former shareholders of T surrender, in exchange for P voting stock, an amount of T stock (1,000/1,000 shares or 100 percent) which constitutes control of T. The stock of T received by P in exchange for P's prior interest in S is not taken into account for purposes of section 368(a)(2)(E)(ii) since the amount of T stock constituting control of T is measured before the transaction.

# Example 7.
The stock of T has a value of $75,000. On January 1, 1984, S merges into T. In the merger, T's shareholders surrender all of their T stock in exchange for P voting stock. As part of the transaction, P contributes $25,000 to T in exchange for new shares of T stock. None of the cash received by T is distributed or otherwise paid out to former T shareholders. After the transaction, T holds all of its own assets and all of S's assets. Based on these facts, the transaction qualifies under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of the application of section 368(a)(2)(E). In the transaction, former shareholders of T surrender, in exchange for P voting stock, an amount of T stock (1,000/1,000 shares or 100 percent) which constitutes control of T. The T stock received by P in exchange for its contribution to T is not taken into account for purposes of section 368(a)(2)(E)(ii) since the amount of T stock constituting control of T is measured before the transaction.

# Example 8.
The facts are the same as in
Example (7)
except that, as part of the transaction, corporation R, instead of P, contributes $25,000 to T in exchange for T stock. Based on these facts, the transaction does not qualify under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(E) since P does not control T immediately after the transaction.

# Example 9.
T stock has a value of $75,000. P owns 500 shares (
1/2
) of that stock with a value of $37,500. The stock of S has a value of $125,000. On January 1, 1984, S merges into T. In the merger, T's shareholders (other than P) surrender their T stock in exchange for P voting stock. Based on these facts, in the transaction, former shareholders of T do not surrender, in exchange for P voting stock, an amount of T stock which constitutes control of T (500/1,000 shares being less than 80 percent). Therefore, the transaction does not qualify under section 368(a)(1)(A). The stock of T received by P in exchange for P's prior interest in S does not contribute to satisfaction of the requirement of section 368(a)(2)(E)(ii).
(k)
Certain transfers of assets or stock in reorganizations
—(1)
General rule.
A transaction otherwise qualifying as a reorganization under section 368(a) shall not be disqualified or recharacterized as a result of one or more subsequent transfers (or successive transfers) of assets or stock, provided that the requirements of § 1.368-1(d) are satisfied and the transfer(s) are described in either paragraph (k)(1)(i) or (k)(1)(ii) of this section. However, this paragraph (k) shall not apply to a transfer to the former shareholders of
the acquired corporation (other than a former shareholder that is also the acquiring corporation) or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, to the extent it constitutes the receipt of consideration for a proprietary interest in the acquired corporation or the surviving corporation, as the case may be. Similarly, this paragraph (k) shall not apply to a transfer by the former shareholders of the acquired corporation (other than a former shareholder that is also the acquiring corporation) or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, of consideration initially received in the potential reorganization to the issuing corporation or a person related to the issuing corporation (see definition of “related person” in § 1.368-1(e)).
(i)
Distributions.
One or more distributions to shareholders (including distribution(s) that involve the assumption of liabilities) are described in this paragraph (k)(1)(i) if—
(A) The property distributed consists of—
(
1
) Assets of the acquired corporation, the acquiring corporation, or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, or an interest in an entity received in exchange for such assets in a transfer described in paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section;
(
2
) Stock of the acquired corporation provided that such distribution(s) of stock do not cause the acquired corporation to cease to be a member of the qualified group (as defined in § 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)); or
(
3
) A combination thereof; and
(B) The aggregate of such distributions does not consist of—
(
1
) An amount of assets of the acquired corporation, the acquiring corporation (disregarding assets held prior to the potential reorganization), or the surviving corporation (disregarding assets of the merged corporation), as the case may be, that would result in a liquidation of such corporation for Federal income tax purposes; or
(
2
) All of the stock of the acquired corporation that was acquired in the transaction.
(ii)
Transfers Other Than Distributions.
One or more other transfers are described in this paragraph (k)(1)(ii) if—
(A) The transfer(s) do not consist of one or more distributions to shareholders;
(B) The property transferred consists of—
(
1
) Part or all of the assets of the acquired corporation, the acquiring corporation, or the surviving corporation, as the case may be;
(
2
) Part or all of the stock of the acquired corporation, the acquiring corporation, or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, provided that such transfer(s) of stock do not cause such corporation to cease to be a member of the qualified group (as defined in § 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)); or
(3) A combination thereof; and
(C) The acquired corporation, the acquiring corporation, or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, does not terminate its corporate existence for Federal income tax purposes in connection with the transfer(s).
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (k). Except as otherwise noted, P is the issuing corporation, and T is an unrelated target corporation. All corporations have only one class of stock outstanding. T operates a bakery that supplies delectable pastries and cookies to local retail stores. The acquiring corporate group produces a variety of baked goods for nationwide distribution. Except as otherwise noted, P owns all of the stock of S-1 and 80 percent of the stock of S-4, S-1 owns 80 percent of the stock of S-2 and 50 percent of the stock of S-5, S-2 owns 80 percent of the stock of S-3, and S-4 owns the remaining 50 percent of the stock of S-5. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Transfers of acquired assets to members of the qualified group after a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C).
(i)
Facts.
Pursuant to a plan of reorganization, T transfers all of its assets to S-1 solely in exchange for P stock, which T distributes to its shareholders, and S-1's assumption of T's liabilities. In addition, pursuant to the plan, S-1 transfers all of the T assets to S-2, and S-2 transfers all of the T assets to S-3.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under this paragraph (k), the transaction, which otherwise qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C), is not disqualified by the successive transfers of all of the T assets to S-2 and from S-2 to S-3 because the transfers are not one or more distributions to shareholders, the
transfers consist of part or all of the assets of the acquiring corporation, the acquiring corporation does not terminate its corporate existence for Federal income tax purposes in connection with the transfers, and the transaction satisfies the requirements of § 1.368-1(d).

# Example 2. Distribution of acquired assets to a member of the qualified group after a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C).
(i)
Facts.
Pursuant to a plan of reorganization, T transfers all of its assets to S-1 solely in exchange for P stock, which T distributes to its shareholders, and S-1's assumption of T's liabilities. In addition, pursuant to the plan, S-1 distributes half of the T assets to P, and P assumes half of the T liabilities.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under this paragraph (k), the transaction, which otherwise qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C), is not disqualified by the distribution of half of the T assets from S-1 to P, or P's assumption of half of the T liabilities from S-1, because the distribution consists of assets of the acquiring corporation, the distribution does not consist of an amount of S-1's assets that would result in a liquidation of S-1 for Federal income tax purposes (disregarding S-1's assets held prior to the acquisition of T), and the transaction satisfies the requirements of § 1.368-1(d).

# Example 3. Indirect distribution of acquired assets to a member of the qualified group after a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C).
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 2
, except that, instead of S-1 distributing half of the T assets to P and having P assume half of the T liabilities, S-1 contributes half of the T assets to newly formed S-6, S-6 assumes half of the T liabilities, and S-1 distributes all of the S-6 stock to P.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under this paragraph (k), the transaction, which otherwise qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C), is not disqualified by the transfer of half of the T assets to S-6 and the distribution of the S-6 stock to P because the transfer of half of the T assets to S-6 is described in paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section, the distribution of the S-6 stock to P is an indirect distribution of assets of the acquiring corporation, the distribution does not consist of an amount of S-1's assets that would result in a liquidation of S-1 for Federal income tax purposes (disregarding S-1's assets held prior to the acquisition of T), and the transaction satisfies the requirements of § 1.368-1(d).

# Example 4. Distribution of acquired stock to a controlled partnership after a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B).
(i)
Facts.
P owns 80 percent of the stock of S-1, and an 80-percent interest in PRS, a partnership. S-4 owns the remaining 20-percent interest in PRS. PRS owns the remaining 20 percent of the stock of S-1. Pursuant to a plan of reorganization, the T shareholders transfer all of their T stock to S-1 solely in exchange for P stock. In addition, pursuant to the plan, S-1 distributes 90 percent of the T stock to PRS in redemption of 5 percent of the stock of S-1 owned by PRS.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under this paragraph (k), the transaction, which otherwise qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B), is not disqualified by the distribution of 90 percent of the T stock from S-1 to PRS because the distribution consists of less than all of the stock of the acquired corporation that was acquired in the transaction, the distribution does not cause T to cease to be a member of the qualified group (as defined in § 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)), and the transaction satisfies the requirements of § 1.368-1(d).

# Example 5. Transfer of acquired stock to a non-controlled partnership.
(i)
Facts.
Pursuant to a plan, the T shareholders transfer all of their T stock to S-1 solely in exchange for P stock. In addition, as part of the plan, T distributes half of its assets to S-1, S-1 assumes half of the T liabilities, and S-1 transfers the T stock to S-2. S-2 and U, an unrelated corporation, form a new partnership, PRS. Immediately thereafter, S-2 transfers all of the T stock to PRS in exchange for a 50 percent interest in PRS, and U transfers cash to PRS in exchange for a 50 percent interest in PRS.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under this paragraph (k), the transaction, which otherwise qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B), is not disqualified by the distribution of half of the T assets from T to S-1, or S-1's assumption of half of the T liabilities from T, because the distribution consists of assets of the acquired corporation, the distribution does not consist of an amount of T's assets that would result in a liquidation of T for Federal income tax purposes, and the transaction satisfies the requirements of § 1.368-1(d). Further, this paragraph (k) describes the transfer of the acquired stock from S-1 to S-2, but does not describe the transfer of the acquired stock from S-2 to PRS because such transfer causes T to cease to be a member of the qualified group (as defined in § 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)). Therefore, the characterization of this transaction must be determined under the relevant provisions of law, including the step transaction doctrine. See § 1.368-1(a). The transaction fails to meet the control requirement of a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B) because immediately after the acquisition of the T stock, the acquiring corporation does not have control of T.

# Example 6. Transfers of acquired assets to members of the qualified group after a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D).
(i)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of T. Pursuant to a plan of reorganization, T transfers all of its assets to S-1 solely in exchange for S-1 stock, which T distributes to P, and S-1's assumption of T's liabilities. In addition, pursuant to the plan, S-1 transfers all of the T assets
to S-2, and S-2 transfers all of the T assets to S-3.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under this paragraph (k), the transaction, which otherwise qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D), is not disqualified by the successive transfers of all the T assets from S-1 to S-2 and from S-2 to S-3 because the transfers are not one or more distributions to shareholders, the transfers consist of part or all of the assets of the acquiring corporation, the acquiring corporation does not terminate its corporate existence for Federal income tax purposes in connection with the transfers, and the transaction satisfies the requirements of § 1.368-1(d).

# Example 7. Transfer of stock of the acquiring corporation to a member of the qualified group after a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(D).
(i)
Facts.
Pursuant to a plan of reorganization, S-1 acquires all of the T assets in the merger of T into S-1. In the merger, the T shareholders receive solely P stock. Also, pursuant to the plan, P transfers all of the S-1 stock to S-4.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under this paragraph (k), the transaction, which otherwise qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(D), is not disqualified by the transfer of all of the S-1 stock to S-4 because the transfer is not a distribution to shareholders, the transfer consists of part or all of the stock of the acquiring corporation, the transfer does not cause S-1 to cease to be a member of the qualified group (as defined in § 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)), the acquiring corporation does not terminate its corporate existence for Federal income tax purposes in connection with the transfer, and the transaction satisfies the requirements of § 1.368-1(d).

# Example 8. Transfer of acquired assets to a partnership after a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(D).
(i)
Facts.
Pursuant to a plan of reorganization, S-1 acquires all of the T assets in the merger of T into S-1. In the merger, the T shareholders receive solely P stock. In addition, pursuant to the plan, S-1 transfers all of the T assets to PRS, a partnership in which S-1 owns a 33
1/3
-percent interest. PRS continues T's historic business. S-1 does not perform active and substantial management functions as a partner with respect to PRS' business.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under this paragraph (k), the transaction, which otherwise qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(D), is not disqualified by the transfer of T assets from S-1 to PRS because the transfer is not a distribution to shareholders, the transfer consists of part or all of the assets of the acquiring corporation, the acquiring corporation does not terminate its corporate existence for Federal income tax purposes in connection with the transfers, and the transaction satisfies the requirements of § 1.368-1(d).

# Example 9. Sale of acquired assets to a member of the qualified group after a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C).
(i)
Facts.
Pursuant to a plan of reorganization, T transfers all of its assets to S-1 in exchange for P stock, which T distributes to its shareholders, and S-1's assumption of T's liabilities. In addition, pursuant to the plan, S-1 sells all of the T assets to S-5 for cash equal to the fair market value of those assets.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under this paragraph (k), the transaction, which otherwise qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C), is not disqualified by the sale of all of the T assets from S-1 to S-5 because the transfer is not a distribution to shareholders, the transfer consists of part or all of the assets of the acquiring corporation, the acquiring corporation does not terminate its corporate existence for Federal income tax purposes in connection with the transfer, and the transaction satisfies the requirements of § 1.368-1(d).
(3)
Effective/applicability dates.
This paragraph (k) applies to transactions occurring on or after
May 9, 2008
, except that it does not apply to any transaction occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is binding before
May 9, 2008
, and at all times after that.
(l)
Certain transactions treated as reorganizations described in section 368(a)(1)(D)
—(1)
General rule.
In order to qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D), a corporation (transferor corporation) must transfer all or part of its assets to another corporation (transferee corporation) and immediately after the transfer the transferor corporation, or one or more of its shareholders (including persons who were shareholders immediately before the transfer), or any combination thereof, must be in control of the transferee corporation; but only if, in pursuance of the plan, stock or securities of the transferee are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 354, 355, or 356.
(2)
Distribution requirement
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (l)(1) of this section, a transaction otherwise described in section 368(a)(1)(D) will be treated as satisfying the requirements of sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 354(b)(1)(B) notwithstanding that there is no actual issuance of stock and/or securities of the transferee corporation if the same person or persons own, directly or
indirectly, all of the stock of the transferor and transferee corporations in identical proportions. In cases where no consideration is received or the value of the consideration received in the transaction is less than the fair market value of the transferor corporation's assets, the transferee corporation will be treated as issuing stock with a value equal to the excess of the fair market value of the transferor corporation's assets over the value of the consideration actually received in the transaction. In cases where the value of the consideration received in the transaction is equal to the fair market value of the transferor corporation's assets, the transferee corporation will be deemed to issue a nominal share of stock to the transferor corporation in addition to the actual consideration exchanged for the transferor corporation's assets. The nominal share of stock in the transferee corporation will then be deemed distributed by the transferor corporation to the shareholders of the transferor corporation, as part of the exchange for the stock of such shareholders. Where appropriate, the nominal share will be further transferred through chains of ownership to the extent necessary to reflect the actual ownership of the transferor and transferee corporations. Similar treatment to that of the preceding two sentences shall apply where the transferee corporation is treated as issuing stock with a value equal to the excess of the fair market value of the transferor corporation's assets over the value of the consideration actually received in the transaction.
(ii)
Attribution.
For purposes of paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, ownership of stock will be determined by applying the principles of section 318(a)(2) without regard to the 50 percent limitation in section 318(a)(2)(C). In addition, an individual and all members of his family described in section 318(a)(1) shall be treated as one individual.
(iii)
De minimis variations in ownership and certain stock not taken into account.
For purposes of paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, the same person or persons will be treated as owning, directly or indirectly, all of the stock of the transferor and transferee corporations in identical proportions notwithstanding the fact that there is a de minimis variation in shareholder identity or proportionality of ownership. Additionally, for purposes of paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, stock described in section 1504(a)(4) is not taken into account.
(iv)
Exception.
Paragraph (l)(2) of this section does not apply to a transaction otherwise described in § 1.358-6(b)(2).
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraph (l) of this section. For purposes of these examples, each of A, B, C, and D is an individual, T is the acquired corporation, S is the acquiring corporation, P is the parent corporation, and each of S1, S2, S3, and S4 is a direct or indirect subsidiary of P. Further, all of the requirements of section 368(a)(1)(D) other than the requirement that stock or securities be distributed in a transaction to which section 354 or 356 applies are satisfied. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
A owns all the stock of T and S. The T stock has a fair market value of $100x. T sells all of its assets to S in exchange for $100x of cash and immediately liquidates. Because there is complete shareholder identity and proportionality of ownership in T and S, under paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, the requirements of sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 354(b)(1)(B) are treated as satisfied notwithstanding the fact that no S stock is issued. Pursuant to paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, S will be deemed to issue a nominal share of S stock to T in addition to the $100x of cash actually exchanged for the T assets, and T will be deemed to distribute all such consideration to A. The transaction qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that C, A's son, owns all of the stock of S. Under paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this section, A and C are treated as one individual. Accordingly, there is complete shareholder identity and proportionality of ownership in T and S. Therefore, under paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, the requirements of sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 354(b)(1)(B) are treated as satisfied notwithstanding the fact that no S stock is issued. Pursuant to paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, S will be deemed to issue a nominal share of S stock to T in addition to the $100x of cash actually exchanged for the T assets, and T will be deemed to distribute all such consideration to A. A will be deemed to transfer the nominal share of S stock to C. The transaction qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D).

# Example 3.
P owns all of the stock of S1 and S2. S1 owns all of the stock of S3, which owns all of the stock of T. S2 owns all of the stock of S4, which owns all of the stock of S. The T stock has a fair market value of $70x. T sells all of its assets to S in exchange for $70x of cash and immediately liquidates. Under paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this section, there is indirect, complete shareholder identity and proportionality of ownership in T and S. Accordingly, the requirements of sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 354(b)(1)(B) are treated as satisfied notwithstanding the fact that no S stock is issued. Pursuant to paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, S will be deemed to issue a nominal share of S stock to T in addition to the $70x of cash actually exchanged for the T assets, and T will be deemed to distribute all such consideration to S3. S3 will be deemed to distribute the nominal share of S stock to S1, which, in turn, will be deemed to distribute the nominal share of S stock to P. P will be deemed to transfer the nominal share of S stock to S2, which, in turn, will be deemed to transfer such share of S stock to S4. The transaction qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D).

# Example 4.
A, B, and C own 34%, 33%, and 33%, respectively, of the stock of T. The T stock has a fair market value of $100x. A, B, and C each own 33% of the stock of S. D owns the remaining 1% of the stock of S. T sells all of its assets to S in exchange for $100x of cash and immediately liquidates. For purposes of determining whether the distribution requirement of sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 354(b)(1)(B) is met, under paragraph (l)(2)(iii) of this section, D's ownership of a de minimis amount of stock of S is disregarded and the transaction is treated as if there is complete shareholder identity and proportionality of ownership in T and S. Because there is complete shareholder identity and proportionality of ownership in T and S, under paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, the requirements of sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 354(b)(1)(B) are treated as satisfied notwithstanding the fact that no S stock is issued. Pursuant to paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, S will be deemed to issue a nominal share of S stock to T in addition to the $100x of cash actually exchanged for the T assets, T will be deemed to distribute all such consideration to A, B, and C, and the nominal S stock will be deemed transferred among the S shareholders to the extent necessary to reflect their actual ownership of S. The transaction qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D).

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4
except that A, B, and C own 34%, 33%, and 33%, respectively, of the common stock of T and S. D owns preferred stock in S described in section 1504(a)(4). For purposes of determining whether the distribution requirement of sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 354(b)(1)(B) is met, under paragraph (l)(2)(iii) of this section, D's ownership of S stock described in section 1504(a)(4) is ignored and the transaction is treated as if there is complete shareholder identity and proportionality of ownership in T and S. Because there is complete shareholder identity and proportionality of ownership in T and S, under paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, the requirements of sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 354(b)(1)(B) are treated as satisfied notwithstanding the fact that no S stock is issued. Pursuant to paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, S will be deemed to issue a nominal share of S stock to T in addition to the $100x of cash actually exchanged for the T assets, and T will be deemed to distribute all such consideration to A, B, and C. The transaction qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D).

# Example 6.
A and B each own 50% of the stock of T. The T stock has a fair market value of $100x. B and C own 90% and 10%, respectively, of the stock of S. T sells all of its assets to S in exchange for $100x of cash and immediately liquidates. Because complete shareholder identity and proportionality of ownership in T and S does not exist, paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section does not apply. The requirements of sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 354(b)(1)(B) are not satisfied, and the transaction does not qualify as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D).
(4)
Effective/applicability date
—(i)
In general.
This section applies to transactions occurring on or after
December 18, 2009.
For rules regarding transactions occurring before
December 18, 2009,
see section 1.368-2T(l) as contained in 26 CFR part 1.
(ii)
Transitional rule.
A taxpayer may apply the provisions of these regulations to transactions occurring before
December 18, 2009.
However, the transferor corporation, the transferee corporation, any direct or indirect transferee of transferred basis property from either of the foregoing, and any shareholder of the transferor or transferee corporation may not apply the provisions of these regulations unless all such taxpayers apply the provisions of the regulations.
(m)
Qualification as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F)
—(1)
Mere change.
To qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F), a transaction must result in a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization of one corporation, however effected (a mere change). A mere change can consist of a transaction that involves an actual or deemed transfer of property
from one corporation (a transferor corporation) to one other corporation (a resulting corporation). Such a transaction is a mere change and qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F) only if all the requirements set forth in paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section are satisfied. For purposes of this paragraph (m), a transaction or a series of related transactions that can be tested against the requirements set forth in paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section (a potential F reorganization) begins when the transferor corporation begins transferring (or is deemed to begin transferring) its assets, directly or indirectly, to the resulting corporation, and it ends when the transferor corporation has distributed (or is deemed to have distributed) to its shareholders the consideration it receives (or is deemed to receive) from the resulting corporation and has completely liquidated for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this paragraph (m), deemed transfers include, for example, those provided in § 301.7701-3(g)(1)(iv) of this chapter (when an entity disregarded as separate from its owner elects under paragraph § 301.7701-3(c)(1)(i) of this chapter to be classified as an association, the owner of the entity is deemed to transfer all of the assets and liabilities of the entity to the association in exchange for stock of the association). Deemed transfers also include those resulting from the application of step transaction principles. For example, step transaction principles may disregard a transitory holding of property by an individual after a liquidation of the transferor corporation and before a subsequent transfer of the transferor corporation's property to the resulting corporation. Step transaction principles may also treat a contribution of all the stock of the transferor corporation to the resulting corporation, followed by a liquidation (or deemed liquidation) of the transferor corporation, as a deemed transfer of the transferor corporation's property to the resulting corporation, followed by a distribution of stock of the resulting corporation in complete liquidation of the transferor corporation.
(i)
Resulting corporation stock distributed in exchange for transferor corporation stock.
Immediately after the potential F reorganization, all the stock of the resulting corporation, including any stock of the resulting corporation issued before the potential F reorganization, must have been distributed (or deemed distributed) in exchange for stock of the transferor corporation in the potential F reorganization. However, for purposes of this paragraph (m)(1)(i) and paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section, a de minimis amount of stock issued by the resulting corporation other than in respect of stock of the transferor corporation to facilitate the organization of the resulting corporation or maintain its legal existence is disregarded.
(ii)
Identity of stock ownership.
The same person or persons must own all of the stock of the transferor corporation, determined immediately before the potential F reorganization, and of the resulting corporation, determined immediately after the potential F reorganization, in identical proportions. However, this requirement is not violated if one or more holders of stock in the transferor corporation exchange stock in the transferor corporation for stock of equivalent value in the resulting corporation, but having different terms from those of the stock in the transferor corporation, or receive a distribution of money or other property from either the transferor corporation or the resulting corporation, whether or not in exchange for stock in the transferor corporation or the resulting corporation.
(iii)
Prior assets or attributes of resulting corporation.
The resulting corporation may not hold any property or have any tax attributes (including those specified in section 381(c)) immediately before the potential F reorganization. However, this requirement is not violated if the resulting corporation holds or has held a de minimis amount of assets to facilitate its organization or maintain its legal existence, and has tax attributes related to holding those assets, or holds the proceeds of borrowings undertaken in connection with the potential F reorganization.
(iv)
Liquidation of transferor corporation.
The transferor corporation must
completely liquidate, for federal income tax purposes, in the potential F reorganization. However, the transferor corporation is not required to dissolve under applicable law and may retain a de minimis amount of assets for the sole purpose of preserving its legal existence.
(v)
Resulting corporation is the only acquiring corporation.
Immediately after the potential F reorganization, no corporation other than the resulting corporation may hold property that was held by the transferor corporation immediately before the potential F reorganization, if such other corporation would, as a result, succeed to and take into account the items of the transferor corporation described in section 381(c).
(vi)
Transferor corporation is the only acquired corporation.
Immediately after the potential F reorganization, the resulting corporation may not hold property acquired from a corporation other than the transferor corporation if the resulting corporation would, as a result, succeed to and take into account the items of such other corporation described in section 381(c).
(2)
Non-application of continuity of interest and continuity of business enterprise requirements.
A continuity of the business enterprise and a continuity of interest are not required for a potential F reorganization to qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F).
See
§ 1.368-1(b).
(3)
Related transactions
—(i)
Series of transactions.
A potential F reorganization consisting of a series of related transactions that together result in a mere change of one corporation may qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F), whether or not certain steps in the series, viewed in isolation, could be subject to other Code provisions, such as sections 304(a), 331, 332, or 351. However,
see
paragraph (k) of this section for transactions that qualify as reorganizations under section 368(a) and will not be recharacterized as a mere change as a result of one or more subsequent transfers of assets or stock.
(ii)
Mere change within a larger transaction.
A potential F reorganization that qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F) may occur before, within, or after other transactions that effect more than a mere change, even if the resulting corporation has only transitory existence. Related events that precede or follow the potential F reorganization generally will not cause that potential F reorganization to fail to qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). Qualification of a potential F reorganization as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F) will not alter the character of other transactions for federal income tax purposes, and step transaction principles may be applied to other transactions without regard to whether certain steps qualify as a reorganization or part of a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F).
(iii)
Distributions treated as separate transactions.
As provided in paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section, a potential F reorganization may qualify as a mere change even though a holder of stock in the transferor corporation receives a distribution of money or other property from either the transferor corporation or the resulting corporation. If a shareholder receives money or other property (including in exchange for its shares) from the transferor corporation or the resulting corporation in a potential F reorganization that qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F), then the receipt of money or other property (including any exchanged for shares) is treated as an unrelated, separate transaction from the reorganization, whether or not connected in a formal sense. See § 1.301-1(j).
(iv)
Transactions also qualifying under other provisions of section 368(a)(1).
In certain cases, a potential F reorganization would (but for this paragraph (m)(3)(iv)) qualify both as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F) and as a reorganization or part of a reorganization under another provision of section 368(a)(1). The following rules determine which of these overlapping qualifications applies.
(A) If the potential F reorganization or a step thereof qualifies as a reorganization or part of a reorganization under another provision of section 368(a)(1), and if a corporation in control (within the meaning of section 368(c)) of the resulting corporation is a party
to such other reorganization (within the meaning of section 368(b)), the potential F reorganization will not qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F).
(B) Except as provided in paragraph (m)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, if, but for this paragraph (m)(3)(iv)(B), the potential F reorganization would qualify as a reorganization under both section 368(a)(1)(F) and one or more of sections 368(a)(1)(A), 368(a)(1)(C), or 368(a)(1)(D), then for all federal income tax purposes the potential F reorganization will qualify as a reorganization only under section 368(a)(1)(F).
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (m). Unless the facts otherwise indicate, A, B, and C are domestic individuals; P, S, T, X, Y, and Z (and similar designations) are domestic corporations; each transaction is entered into for a valid business purpose; all persons and transactions are unrelated; and all other relevant facts are set forth in the examples.

# Example 1. Cash contribution and redemption—no mere change.
C owns all of the stock of X, a State A corporation. The net value of X's assets and liabilities is $1,000,000. Y, a State B corporation, seeks to acquire the assets of X for cash. To effect the acquisition, Y and X enter into an agreement under which Y will contribute $1,000,000 to Z, a newly formed corporation of which Y is the sole shareholder, in exchange for Z stock and X will merge into Z. In the merger, C surrenders all of the X stock and receives the $1,000,000 Y contributed to Z. C receives no Z stock in the transaction. After the merger, Y holds all of the Z stock, and Z holds all of the assets and liabilities previously held by X. Z stock is not distributed to the shareholders of X in exchange for their stock in X as required by paragraph (m)(1)(i) of this section, and the transaction results in a change in the ownership of X that does not result from an exchange or distribution described in paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section. Therefore, the merger of X into Z is not a mere change of X and does not qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F).

# Example 2. Cash redemption—mere change.
A owns 75%, and B owns 25%, of the stock of X, a State A corporation. The management of X determines that it would be in the best interest of X to reorganize under the laws of State B. Accordingly, X forms Y, a State B corporation, and X and Y enter into an agreement under which X will merge into Y. A does not wish to own stock in Y. In the merger, A surrenders A's X stock and receives cash, and B surrenders all of B's X stock and receives all the stock of Y. The change in ownership caused by A's surrender of X stock results from a distribution and exchange described in paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section. Therefore, the merger of X into Y is a mere change of X and qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). Under paragraph (m)(3)(iii) of this section, A's surrender of X stock for cash is treated as a transaction, separate from the reorganization, to which section 302(a) applies.

# Example 3. Pre-transaction de minimis stock issuance—mere change—other provisions of section 368(a)(1).
P owns all of the stock of S, a Country A corporation. The management of P determines that it would be in the best interest of S to change its place of incorporation to Country B. Under Country B law, a corporation must have at least two shareholders to enjoy limited liability. P is advised by its Country B advisors that the new corporation should issue 1% of its stock to a shareholder that is not P's nominee to assure satisfaction of the two-shareholder requirement. As part of an integrated plan, C, an officer of S, organizes Y, a Country B corporation with 1,000 shares of common stock authorized, and contributes cash to Y in exchange for ten of the common shares. S then merges into Y under the laws of Country A and Country B. Pursuant to the plan of merger, P surrenders its shares of S stock and receives 990 shares of Y common stock. The ten shares of Y stock issued to C not in respect of the S stock are de minimis and are used to facilitate the organization of Y within the meaning of paragraph (m)(1)(i) of this section. Therefore, the issuance of this stock to a new shareholder does not prevent the merger of S into Y from qualifying as a mere change of S. Accordingly, the merger is a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). Without regard to the merger's qualification under section 368(a)(1)(F), the merger would also qualify as a reorganization under both section 368(a)(1)(A) and section 368(a)(1)(D). Under paragraph (m)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, if a potential F reorganization qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F), and would also qualify under one or more of sections 368(a)(1)(A) or 368(a)(1)(D), the potential F reorganization qualifies only as a reorganization under 368(a)(1)(F), and neither section 368(a)(1)(A) nor section 368(a)(1)(D) will apply.

# Example 4. Pre-transaction assets, attributes—no mere change.
A owns all of the stock of P, and P owns all of the stock of S, which is engaged in a manufacturing business. P has owned the stock of S for many years. P owns no assets other than the stock of S. A decides to eliminate the holding company structure by merging P into S. Because it
operates a manufacturing business, the potential resulting corporation, S, holds property and has tax attributes immediately before the potential F reorganization. Therefore, under paragraph (m)(1)(iii) of this section, the merger of P into S is not a mere change of P and does not qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). The same result would occur under paragraph (m)(1)(iii) of this section if, instead of P merging into S, S merged into P, because P, the potential resulting corporation, holds property (the stock of S) and has tax attributes immediately before the potential F reorganization.

# Example 5. Series of related transactions—mere change.
P owns all of the stock of S1, a State A corporation. The management of P determines that it would be in the best interest of S1 to change its place of incorporation to State B. Accordingly, under an integrated plan, P forms S2, a new State B corporation; P contributes the S1 stock to S2; and S1 merges into S2 under the laws of State A and State B. Under paragraph (m)(3)(i) of this section, a series of transactions that together result in a mere change of one corporation may qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). The contribution of S1 stock to S2 and the merger of S1 into S2 together constitute a mere change of S1. Therefore, the potential F reorganization qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). Without regard to its qualification under section 368(a)(1)(F), the potential F reorganization would also qualify as a reorganization under both section 368(a)(1)(A) and section 368(a)(1)(D). Under paragraph (m)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, if a potential F reorganization qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F) and would also qualify under one or more of sections 368(a)(1)(A) or 368(a)(1)(D), it qualifies only as a reorganization under 368(a)(1)(F), and neither section 368(a)(1)(A) nor section 368(a)(1)(D) will apply. The result would be the same with respect to qualification under section 368(a)(1)(F) if, instead of merging into S2, S1 completely liquidates or is deemed to liquidate by reason of a conversion in an entity disregarded as separate from its owner under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter.

# Example 6. Post-transaction stock sale—mere change.
P owns all of the stock of S1, a State A corporation. The management of P determines that it would be in the best interest of S1 to change its place of incorporation to State B. Accordingly, P forms S2, a new State B corporation. S1 then merges into S2 under the laws of State A and State B. Immediately thereafter, and as part of the same plan, P sells all of its stock in S2 to an unrelated party. Without regard to P's sale of S2 stock, the merger of S1 into S2 is a potential F reorganization that qualifies as a mere change of S1 within the meaning of paragraph (m)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (m)(3)(ii) of this section, related events that occur before or after a potential F reorganization that qualifies as a mere change generally do not cause that potential F reorganization to fail to qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). Therefore, P's sale of the S2 stock is disregarded in determining whether the merger of S1 into S2 is a mere change of S1. Accordingly, the merger of S1 into S2 qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). The result would be the same if, instead of the S2 stock being sold by P, S2 merges into a previously unrelated corporation and terminates its separate existence.

# Example 7. Post-transaction redemption—mere change.
A owns all of the stock of T. P owns all of the stock of S. Each of T and S is a State A corporation engaged in a manufacturing business. The following transactions occur pursuant to a single plan. Each of T, P, and S is a State A corporation engaged in a manufacturing business. Second, P changes its state of incorporation to State B by merging into newly incorporated New P under the laws of State A and State B. Third, New P redeems all the New P stock issued to A in respect of A's P stock (initially issued to A in respect of A's T stock) for cash. Without regard to the other steps, the merger of P into New P is a potential F reorganization that qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). Under paragraph (m)(3)(ii) of this section, related events that occur before or after a potential F reorganization that qualifies as a mere change generally do not prevent that potential F reorganization from qualifying as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). Therefore, the merger of P into New P qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). Under paragraph (m)(3)(ii) of this section, the qualification of the merger of P into New P as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F) does not alter the tax treatment of the merger of T into S. Because the P shares received by A in respect of the T shares (exchanged for New P shares in the mere change of P into New P) are redeemed for cash pursuant to the plan, the merger of T into S does not satisfy the continuity of interest requirement of § 1.368-1(e) and therefore does not qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a).

# Example 8. Series of related transactions—mere change.
P owns all of the stock of S, a State A corporation. The management of P determines that it would be in the best interest of S to change its form from a State A corporation to a State A limited partnership but to continue to be treated as a corporation for federal tax purposes. Accordingly, P contributes 1% of the S stock to newly formed LLC, a limited liability company, in exchange for all of the membership interests in LLC. P is the sole member of LLC. Under
§ 301.7701-3 of this chapter, LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, P. Then, under a State A statute, S converts to a State A limited partnership. In the conversion, P's interest as a 99% shareholder of S is converted into a 99% limited partner interest, and LLC's interest as a 1% shareholder of S is converted into a 1% general partner interest. S also elects, under § 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter, to be classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, effective on the same day as the conversion. Under paragraph (m)(3)(i) of this section, the conversion of S from a State A corporation to a State A limited partnership, together with the election to treat S as a corporation for federal tax purposes, results in a mere change of S and qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F).

# Example 9. Other acquiring corporation—no mere change.
P owns 80%, and A owns 20%, of the stock of S. A and the management of P determine that it would be in the best interest of S to completely liquidate while A continues to operate part of the business of S in corporate form. Accordingly, S distributes 80% of its assets to P and 20% of its assets to A; S dissolves; and A contributes the assets it receives from S to newly incorporated New S in exchange for all of the stock of New S. S's distribution of 80% of its property to P as part of the complete liquidation of S meets the requirements of section 332. Thus, section 381(a)(1) applies to P's acquisition of 80% of the property held by S immediately before the transaction. Under paragraph (m)(1)(v) of this section, the potential F reorganization in which 20% of the property held by S immediately before the transaction is transferred to New S cannot be a mere change of S, because section 381(a) applies to P's acquisition of property held by S immediately before the potential F reorganization. Accordingly, sections 331 and 336 apply to A's acquisition of property from S and S's distribution of property to A, and section 351 applies to A's contribution of that property to New S.

# Example 10. Other acquiring corporation—no mere change.
P owns all of the stock of S1. The management of P determines that it would be in the best interest of S1 to merge S1 into P. Accordingly, pursuant to a state merger statute, S1 merges into P. Immediately afterward and as part of the same plan, P contributes 50% of the former assets of S1 to newly incorporated S2 in exchange for all of the stock of S2. The transaction does not qualify as a complete liquidation of S1 under section 332 (because of the reincorporation of some of S1's assets) but does qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(C) and paragraph (k) of this section. Under paragraph (m)(1)(v) of this section, the potential F reorganization in which some of the former assets of S1 are transferred (in form) first to P, and then to S2, is not a mere change of S1, because section 381(a) applies to P's acquisition of property held by S1 immediately before the potential F reorganization. Furthermore, under paragraph (m)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, P, the corporation in control of S2 within the meaning of section 368(c), is a party to the reorganization within the meaning of section 368(b). Thus, the indirect transfer of property from S1 to S2 does not qualify under section 368(a)(1)(F).

# Example 11. Other acquiring corporation—mere change.
P owns all of the stock of S1. S1's only asset is all of the equity interest in LLC2, a domestic limited liability company. Under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter, LLC2 is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, S1. Pursuant to an integrated plan to undergo a reorganization under 368(a)(1)(F), S1 and LLC2 undergo the following two state law conversions. First, under state law LLC2 converts into S2, a corporation. Second, under state law S1 converts into LLC1, a domestic limited liability company. Under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter, LLC1 is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, P. As a result of the two conversions, S1 is deemed to transfer its assets to S2 in exchange for all of the stock in S2 and then distribute the S2 stock to P in complete liquidation of S1. The two conversions, viewed as a potential F reorganization, constitute a mere change of S1, and that potential F reorganization qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). The result would be the same if, instead of converting into S2 pursuant to state law, LLC2 elected under § 301.7701-3(c) to change its classification for federal tax purposes and be treated as an association taxable as a corporation, provided the effective date of the election (and its resulting deemed transactions) occurs before the conversion of S1.

# Example 12. Other acquiring corporation—no mere change.
The facts are the same facts as in
Example 11,
except that S1 converts into LLC1 prior to the conversion of LLC2 into S2. As a result of these conversions, S1 is deemed to distribute all of its assets to P in exchange for all of P's S1 stock, and P is deemed to transfer all of those assets to S2 in exchange for all of the stock in S2. The transaction does not qualify as a complete liquidation of S1 under section 332 (because of the reincorporation of S1's assets), but does qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(C) and paragraph (k) of this section. Under paragraph (m)(1)(v) of this section, the potential F reorganization in which the former assets of S1 are deemed transferred, first by S1 to P, and then by P to S2, is not a mere change of S1 because section 381(a) applies to P's acquisition of property held by S1 immediately before the potential F reorganization. Furthermore, the corporation in
control of S2, within the meaning of section 368(c), is a party to the reorganization within the meaning of section 368(b). Thus, the indirect transfer of property from S1 to S2 does not qualify under section 368(a)(1)(F).

# Example 13. Series of related transactions—no mere change.
X owns all of the stock of T. P acquires all of the stock of T in exchange for consideration consisting of $50 cash and P voting stock with $50 value. No election is made under section 338. Immediately thereafter and as part of the same plan, P forms S as a wholly-owned subsidiary, and T is merged into S. Viewed in isolation as a potential F reorganization, the merger of T into S appears to constitute a mere change of T. However, the acquisition of the T stock by P and the merger of T into S, viewed together, qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(D). The step transaction doctrine is applied treat the transaction as a statutory merger of T into S in exchange for $50 cash and $50 of P's voting stock (and S's assumption of T's liabilities), P's momentary ownership of T stock is disregarded. Under paragraph (m)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, P, the corporation in control of S, is a party to the reorganization within the meaning of section 368(b). Thus, the transfer of property from T to S does not qualify under section 368(a)(1)(F).

# Example 14. Multiple transferor corporations—no mere change.
P owns all the stock of S1 and S2. The management of P determines it would be in the best interest of S1 and S2 to operate as a single corporation. P forms S3 and, under applicable corporate law, S1 and S2 simultaneously merge into S3. Immediately after the merger, P owns all the stock of S3. Each of the mergers can be tested as a potential F reorganization. However, immediately after the simultaneous mergers, the resulting corporation, S3, holds property acquired from a corporation other than the transferor corporation, and section 381(a) would apply to the acquisition of such property. Therefore, under paragraph (m)(1)(vi) of this section, neither potential F reorganization is a mere change, and neither merger into S3 qualifies as a reorganization under section 386(a)(1)(F). The result would be different if the mergers were not simultaneous. If S1 completed its merger into S3 before S2 began its merger into S3, the merger of S1 into S3 would qualify as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F), but the merger of S2 into S3 would not so qualify (although it would qualify as a reorganization under sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(1)(D)).

Effective/Applicability Date.
This paragraph (m) applies to transactions occurring on or after September 21, 2015.

# Insolvency Reorganizations

# Carryovers
§ 1.381(a)-1
General rule relating to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions.
(a)
Allowance of carryovers.
Section 381 provides that a corporation which acquires the assets of another corporation in certain liquidations and reorganizations shall succeed to, and take into account, as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer, the items described in section 381(c) of the distributor or transferor corporation. These items shall be taken into account by the acquiring corporation subject to the conditions and limitations specified in sections 381, 382(b), and 383 and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Determination of transactions and items to which section 381 applies
—(1)
Qualified transactions.
Except to the extent provided in section 381(c)(20), relating to the carryover of unused pension trust deductions in certain liquidations, the items described in section 381(c) are required by section 381 to be carried over to the acquiring corporation (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) only in the following liquidations and reorganizations:
(i) The complete liquidation of a subsidiary corporation upon which no gain or loss is recognized in accordance with the provisions of section 332;
(ii) A statutory merger or consolidation qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(A) to which section 361 applies;
(iii) A reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(C);
(iv) A reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(D) if the requirements of section 354(b)(1)(A) and (B) are satisfied; and
(v) A mere change in identity, form, or place of organization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(F).
(2)
Acquiring corporation defined.
(i) Only a single corporation may be an acquiring corporation for purposes of section 381 and the regulations thereunder. The corporation which acquires the assets of its subsidiary corporation in a complete liquidation to which section 381(a)(1) applies is the acquiring corporation for purposes of section 381. In a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies, the acquiring corporation is the corporation that, pursuant to the plan of reorganization, directly acquires the assets transferred by the transferor corporation, even if that corporation ultimately retains none of the assets so transferred.
(ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Y Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of X Corporation, directly acquired all the assets of Z Corporation solely in exchange for voting stock of X Corporation in a transaction qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(C). Y Corporation is the acquiring corporation for purposes of section 381.

# Example 2.
X Corporation acquired all the assets of Z Corporation solely in exchange for voting stock of X Corporation in a transaction qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(C). Thereafter, pursuant to the plan of reorganization X Corporation transferred all the assets so acquired to Y Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiary (see section 368(a)(2)(C)). X Corporation is the acquiring corporation for purposes of section 381.

# Example 3.
X Corporation acquired all the assets of Z Corporation solely in exchange for the voting stock of X Corporation in a transaction qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(C). Thereafter, pursuant to the plan of reorganization X Corporation transferred one-half of the assets so acquired to Y Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiary, and retained the other half of such assets. X Corporation is the acquiring corporation for purposes of section 381.

# Example 4.
X Corporation acquired all the assets of Z Corporation solely in exchange for voting stock of X Corporation in a transaction qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(C). Thereafter, pursuant to the plan of reorganization X Corporation transferred one-half of the assets so acquired to Y Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiary, and the other half of such assets to M Corporation, another wholly-owned subsidiary of X Corporation. X Corporation is the acquiring corporation for purposes of section 381.
(3)
Transactions and items not covered by section 381.
Section 381 does not apply to partial liquidations, divisive reorganizations, or other transactions not described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. Moreover, section 381 does not apply to the carryover of an item or tax attribute not specified in subsection (c) thereof. In a case where section 381 does not apply to a transaction, item, or tax attribute by reason of either of the preceding sentences, no
inference is to be drawn from the provisions of section 381 as to whether any item or tax attribute shall be taken into account by the successor corporation.
(c)
Foreign corporations.
For additional rules involving foreign corporations, see §§ 1.367(b)-7 through 1.367(b)-9.
(d)
Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
Any reference in the regulations under section 381 to any provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall, where appropriate, be deemed also to refer to the corresponding provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
The rules of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section apply to corporate reorganizations and tax-free liquidations described in section 381(a) that occur on or after August 31, 2011. The last sentence of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and
Example 2
of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section apply to transactions occurring on or after November 10, 2014.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11607, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7343, 40 FR 1698, Jan. 9, 1975; T.D. 9273, 71 FR 44914, Aug. 8, 2006; T.D. 9534, 76 FR 45675, Aug. 1, 2011; T.D. 9700; 79 FR 66617, Nov. 10, 2014]
§ 1.381(b)-1
Operating rules applicable to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions.
(a)
Closing of taxable year
—(1)
In general.
Except in the case of certain reorganizations qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(F), the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation shall end with the close of the date of distribution or transfer. With regard to the closing of the taxable year of the transferor corporation in certain reorganizations under section 368(a)(1)(F) involving a foreign corporation after December 31, 1986, see §§ 1.367(a)-1(e) and 1.367(b)-2(f).
(2)
Reorganizations under section 368(a)(1)(F).
In the case of a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(F) (whether or not such reorganization also qualifies under any other provision of section 368(a)(1)), the acquiring corporation shall be treated (for purposes of section 381) just as the transferor corporation would have been treated if there had been no reorganization. Thus, the taxable year of the transferor corporation shall not end on the date of transfer merely because of the transfer; a net operating loss of the acquiring corporation for any taxable year ending after the date of transfer shall be carried back in accordance with section 172(b) in computing the taxable income of the transferor corporation for a taxable year ending before the date of transfer; and the tax attributes of the transferor corporation enumerated in section 381(c) shall be taken into account by the acquiring corporation as if there had been no reorganization.
(b)
Date of distribution or transfer.
(1) The date of distribution or transfer shall be that day on which are distributed or transferred all those properties of the distributor or transferor corporation which are to be distributed or transferred pursuant to a liquidation or reorganization described in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.381(a)-1. If the distribution or transfer of all such properties is not made on one day, then, except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the date of distribution or transfer shall be that day on which the distribution or transfer of all such properties is completed.
(2) If the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations file the statements described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, the date of distribution or transfer shall be that day as of which (i) substantially all of the properties to be distributed or transferred have been distributed or transferred, and (ii) the distributor or transferor corporation has ceased all operations (other than liquidating activities). Such day also shall be the date of distribution or transfer if the completion of the distribution or transfer is unreasonably postponed beyond the date as of which substantially all the properties to be distributed or transferred have been distributed or transferred and the distributor or transferor corporation has ceased all operations other than liquidating activities. A corporation shall be considered to have distributed or transferred substantially all of its properties to be distributed or transferred even though it retains money or other property in a reasonable amount to pay outstanding debts
or preserve the corporation's legal existence. A corporation shall be considered to have ceased all operations, other than liquidating activities, when it ceases to be a going concern and its activities are merely for the purpose of winding up its affairs, paying its debts, and distributing any remaining balance of its money or other properties to its shareholders.
(3)
Election
—(i)
Content of statements.
The statements referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be entitled, “ELECTION OF DATE OF DISTRIBUTION OR TRANSFER PURSUANT TO § 1.381(b)-1(b)(2),” and must include: [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF DISTRIBUTOR OR TRANSFEROR CORPORATION] AND [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF ACQUIRING CORPORATION] ELECT TO DETERMINE THE DATE OF DISTRIBUTION OR TRANSFER UNDER § 1.381(b)-1(b)(2). SUCH DATE IS [INSERT DATE (mm/dd/yyyy)].
(ii)
Filing of statements.
One statement must be included on or with the timely filed Federal income tax return of the distributor or transferor corporation for its taxable year ending with the date of distribution or transfer. An identical statement must be included on or with the timely filed Federal income tax return of the acquiring corporation for its first taxable year ending after that date. If the distributor or transferor corporation, or the acquiring corporation, is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957), each United States shareholder (within the meaning of section 951(b)) with respect thereto must include this statement on or with its return.
(4) If—
(i) The last day of the acquiring corporation's taxable year is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, and
(ii) The day specified in subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph as the date of distribution or transfer is the last business day before such Saturday, Sunday, or holiday,
then the last day of the acquiring corporation's taxable year shall be the date of distribution or transfer for purposes of section 381(b) and this section. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term
business day
means a day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, and also means a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday if the date of distribution or transfer determined under subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph is such Saturday, Sunday, or holiday.
(c)
Return of distributor or transferor corporation.
The distributor or transferor corporation shall file an income tax return for the taxable year ending with the date of distribution or transfer described in paragraph (b) of this section. If the distributor or transferor corporation remains in existence after such date of distribution or transfer, it shall file an income tax return for the taxable year beginning on the day following the date of distribution or transfer and ending with the date on which the distributor or transferor corporation's taxable year would have ended if there had been no distribution or transfer.
(d)
Carryback of net operating losses.
For provisions relating to the carryback of net operating losses of the acquiring corporation, see paragraph (b) of § 1.381(c)(1)-1.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (b)(3) of this section applies to any taxable year beginning on or after May 30, 2006. However, taxpayers may apply paragraph (b)(3) of this section to any original Federal income tax return (including any amended return filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of such original return) timely filed on or after May 30, 2006. For taxable years beginning before May 30, 2006, see § 1.381(b)-1 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2006.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11607, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended at T.D. 8280, 55 FR 1417, Jan. 16, 1990; T.D. 8862, 65 FR 3609, Jan. 24, 2000; T.D. 9264, 71 FR 30598, May 30, 2006; T.D. 9329, 72 FR 32801, June 14, 2007; T.D. 9739, 80 FR 56915, Sept. 21, 2015]
§ 1.381(c)(1)-1
Net operating loss carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
(1) Section 381(c)(1) requires the acquiring corporation to succeed to, and take into account, the net operating loss
carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation. To determine the amount of these carryovers as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer, and to integrate them with any carryovers and carrybacks of the acquiring corporation for purposes of determining the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for taxable years ending after the date of distribution or transfer, it is necessary to apply the provisions of section 172 in accordance with the conditions and limitations of section 381(c)(1) and this section. See also section 382(b) and the regulations thereunder.
(2) The net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks of the acquiring corporation determined as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be computed without reference to any net operating loss of a distributor or transferor corporation. The net operating loss carryovers of a distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be determined without reference to any net operating loss of the acquiring corporation.
(3) For purposes of the tax imposed under section 56, the acquiring corporation succeeding to and taking into account any net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation shall also succeed to and take into account along with such net operating loss carryforward any deferred tax liability under section 56(b) and the regulations thereunder attributable to such net operating loss carryover.
(b)
Carryback of net operating losses.
A net operating loss of the acquiring corporation for any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer shall not be carried back in computing the taxable income of a distributor or transferor corporation. However, a net operating loss of the acquiring corporation for any such taxable year shall be carried back in accordance with section 172(b) in computing the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for a taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer. If a distributor or transferor corporation remains in existence after the date of distribution or transfer, a net operating loss sustained by it for any taxable year beginning after such date shall be carried back in accordance with section 172(b) in computing the taxable income of such corporation for a taxable year ending on or before that date, but may not be carried back or over in computing the taxable income of the acquiring corporation. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On December 31, 1954, X Corporation merged into Y Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies, and the charter of Y Corporation continued after the merger. Y Corporation sustained a net operating loss for the calendar year 1955. Y Corporation's net operating loss for 1955 may not be carried back in computing the taxable income of X Corporation but shall be carried back in computing the taxable income of Y Corporation.

# Example 2.
On December 31, 1954, X Corporation and Y Corporation transferred all their assets to Z Corporation in a statutory consolidation to which section 361 applies. Z Corporation sustained a net operating loss for the calendar year 1955. Z Corporation's net operating loss for 1955 may not be carried back in computing the taxable income of X Corporation or Y Corporation.

# Example 3.
On December 31, 1954, X Corporation ceased all operations (other than liquidating activities) and transferred substantially all its properties to Y Corporation in a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(C). Such properties comprised all of X Corporation's properties which were to be transferred pursuant to the reorganization. In the process of liquidating its assets and winding up its affairs, X Corporation sustained a net operating loss for its taxable year beginning on January 1, 1955. This net operating loss of X Corporation shall be carried back in computing the taxable income of that corporation but may not be carried back or over in computing the taxable income of Y Corporation.
(c)
First taxable year to which carryovers apply.
(1) The net operating loss carryovers available to the distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall first be carried to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after that date. This rule applies irrespective of whether the date of distribution or transfer is on the last day, or any other day, of the acquiring corporation's taxable year. Thus, such net operating loss carryovers shall first be used by the acquiring corporation with respect to the
computation of its net operating loss deduction under section 172(a), and its taxable income determined under the provisions of section 172(b)(2), for such first taxable year. However, see paragraph (f) of this section.
(2) The net operating loss carryovers available to the distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be carried to the acquiring corporation without diminution by reason of the fact that the acquiring corporation does not acquire 100 percent of the assets of the distributor or transferor corporation. Thus, if a parent corporation owning 80 percent of all classes of stock of its subsidiary corporation were to acquire its share of the assets of the subsidiary corporation upon a complete liquidation described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of § 1.381(a)-1, then, subject to the conditions and limitations of this section, 100 percent of the net operating loss carryovers available to the subsidiary corporation as of the close of the date of distribution would be carried over to the parent corporation.
(d)
Limitation on net operating loss deduction for first taxable year ending after date of distribution or transfer.
(1) That part of the acquiring corporation's net operating loss deduction, determined in accordance with sections 172(a) and 381(c)(1), for its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer which is attributable to the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation, is limited by section 381(c)(1)(B) and this paragraph to an amount equal to the acquiring corporation's postacquisition part year taxable income. Such postacquisition part year taxable income is the amount which bears the same ratio to the acquiring corporation's taxable income for the first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer (determined under section 63 without regard to any net operating loss deduction but taking into account other items to which the acquiring corporation succeeds under section 381) as the number of days in such first taxable year which follow the date of distribution or transfer bears to the total number of days in such taxable year. Thus, if the date of distribution or transfer is the last day of the acquiring corporation's taxable year, the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor are allowed in full in computing under section 172(a) the net operating loss deduction of the acquiring corporation for its first taxable year ending after that date. In such instance, the number of days in the first taxable year which follow the date of distribution or transfer is the total number of days in such taxable year.
(2) The limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) applies solely for the purpose of computing the net operating loss deduction of the acquiring corporation under section 172(a) for the acquiring corporation's first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer. The limitation does not apply for purposes of determining the portion of any net operating loss (whether of the distributor, transferor, or acquiring corporation) which may be carried to any taxable year of the acquiring corporation following its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer since such determination is made pursuant to section 172(b) and section 381(c)(1)(C). See paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
(3) The limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) shall be applied to the aggregate of the allowable net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation without reference to the taxable years in which the net operating losses were sustained by such corporation. If the acquiring corporation has acquired the assets of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on the same date of distribution or transfer, then the limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) shall be applied to the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers from all of such distributor or transferor corporations.
(4) If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the net operating loss carryovers of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on two or more different dates of distribution or transfer within one taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the limitation to be applied under section 381(c)(1)(B) to the aggregate of such carryovers
shall be governed by the rules prescribed in paragraph (b) of § 1.381(c)(1)-2.
(5)
Illustrations.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) X Corporation and Y Corporation were organized on January 1, 1956, and make their returns on the calendar year basis. On December 16, 1957, X Corporation transferred all its assets to Y Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. The net operating losses and taxable income (computed without the net operating loss deduction) of the two corporations are as follows, the assumption being made that none of the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2)(A) apply to any taxable year:
Taxable year
X Corporation (transferor)
Y Corporation (acquirer)

($35,000)
($5,000)
Ending 12-16-57
(30,000)
xxx
1957
xxx
36,500
(ii) The aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers of X Corporation carried under section 381(c)(1)(A) to Y Corporation's taxable year ending December 31, 1957, is $65,000; but pursuant to section 381(c)(1)(B), only $1,500 of such aggregate amount ($36,500 × 15/365) may be used in computing the net operating loss deduction of Y Corporation for such taxable year under section 172(a). This limitation applies even though Y Corporation's own net operating loss carryover to such year is only $5,000, with the result that Y Corporation has taxable income under section 63 of $30,000 for its taxable year ending December 31, 1957, that is, $36,500 less the sum of $5,000 and $1,500.
(iii) For rules determining the portion of any given loss of X Corporation or Y Corporation which may be carried to a taxable year of Y Corporation following its taxable year ending December 31, 1957, see sections 172(b)(2) and 381(c)(1)(C) and paragraph (f) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) X Corporation was organized on January 1, 1954, and Y Corporation was organized on January 1, 1956. Each corporation makes its return on the basis of the calendar year. On December 31, 1956, X Corporation transferred all its assets to Y Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. The net operating losses and the taxable income (computed without any net operating loss deduction) of the two corporations are as follows, the assumption being made that none of the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2)(A) apply to any taxable year:

For this purpose, Z Corporation may not use the total of the aggregate carryovers ($10,000) from X Corporation plus the aggregate carryovers ($14,000) from Y Corporation, even though each such aggregate of carryovers is separately less than the limitation ($18,400) applicable under section 381(c)(1)(B) and this section.
(iii) For rules determining the portion of any given loss of X Corporation, Y Corporation, or Z Corporation which may be carried to a taxable year of Z Corporation following its taxable year ending December 31, 1956, see sections 172(b)(2) and 381(c)(1)(C) and paragraph (f) of this section.
(e)
Computation of carryovers and carrybacks; general rule
—(1)
Sequence for
applying losses and computation of taxable income.
The portion of any net operating loss which is carried back or carried over to any taxable year is the excess, if any, of the amount of the loss over the sum of the taxable income for each of the prior taxable years to which the loss may be carried under sections 172(b)(1) and 381. In determining the taxable income for each such prior taxable year for this purpose, the various net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to such prior taxable year are considered to be applied in reduction of the taxable income in the order of the taxable years in which the net operating losses are sustained, beginning with the loss for the earliest taxable year. The application of this rule to the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer involves the use of carryovers of the distributor or transfer corporation, and of carryovers and carrybacks of the acquiring corporation. In such instance, the sequence for the use of loss years remains the same, and the requirement is to begin with the net operating loss of the earliest taxable year, whether or not it is a loss of the distributor, transferor, or acquiring corporation. The taxable income of the acquiring corporation for any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer shall be determined in the manner prescribed by section 172(b)(2), except that, if the date of distribution or transfer is on a day other than the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the taxable income of such corporation for the taxable year which includes such date shall be computed in the special manner prescribed by section 381(c)(1)(C) and paragraph (f) of this section.
(2)
Loss year of transferor or distributor considered prior taxable year.
Section 381(c)(1)(C) provides that, for the purpose of determining the net operating loss carryovers under section 172(b)(2), a net operating loss for a loss year of a distributor or transferor corporation which ends on or before the last day of a loss year of the acquiring corporation shall be considered to be a net operating loss for a year prior to such loss year of the acquiring corporation. In a case where the acquiring corporation has acquired the assets of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on the same date of distribution or transfer, the loss years of the distributor or transferor corporations shall be taken into account in the order in which such loss years terminate; if any one of the loss years of a distributor or transferor corporation ends on the same day as the loss year of another distributor or transferor corporation, either loss year may be taken into account before the other.
(3)
Years to which losses may be carried.
The taxable years to which a net operating loss shall be carried back or carried over are prescribed by section 172(b)(1). Since the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ends with the close of the date of distribution or transfer, such taxable year and the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation which ends after that date shall be considered two separate taxable years to which a net operating loss of the distributor or transferor corporation for any taxable year ending before that date may be carried over. This rule applies even though the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation which ends on the date of distribution or transfer is a period of less than twelve months. However, for the purpose of determining under section 172(b)(1) the taxable years to which a net operating loss of the acquiring corporation is carried over or carried back, the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation which ends after the date of distribution or transfer shall be treated as only one taxable year even though such taxable year is considered under section 381(c)(1)(C) and paragraph (f)(2) of this section as two taxable years. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X Corporation was organized on January 1, 1954, and thereafter it sustained net operating losses in its calendar years 1954, 1955, and 1956. On June 30, 1957, X Corporation transferred all its assets to Y Corporation, which was organized on January 1, 1955, in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. In its taxable year ending June 30, 1957, X Corporation sustained a net operating loss. Y Corporation sustained net operating losses in its calendar years 1955, 1956, and 1958, but had taxable income for the year
1957. The years to which these losses of X Corporation and Y Corporation shall be carried, and the sequence in which carried, are as follows:
Loss year
X 1954
X 1955, X 1956, X 6/30/57, Y 1957, Y 1958.

Computation of carryovers in a case where the date of distribution or transfer occurs on last day of acquiring corporation's taxable year.
The computation of the net operating loss carryovers from the distributor or transferor corporation and from the acquiring corporation in a case where the date of distribution or transfer occurs on the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X Corporation and Y Corporation were organized on January 1, 1955, and each corporation makes its return on the basis of the calendar year. On December 31, 1956, X Corporation transferred all its assets to Y Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. The net operating losses and the taxable income (computed without any net operating loss deduction) of the two corporations are as follows, the assumption being made that none of the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2)(A) apply to any taxable year:

Computation of carryovers and carrybacks when date of distribution or transfer is not on last day of acquiring corporation's taxable year
—(1)
General rule.
Pursuant to the provisions of section 381(c)(1)(C), the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for its taxable year which is a prior taxable year for purposes of section 172(b)(2) and paragraph (e) of this section shall be determined in the manner prescribed in this paragraph, if the date of distribution or transfer occurs within, but not on the last day of, such taxable year.
(2)
Taxable year considered as two taxable years.
Such taxable year of the acquiring corporation shall be considered as though it were two taxable years,
but only for the limited purpose of applying section 172(b)(2). The first of such two taxable years shall be referred to in this section as the preacquisition part year; the second, as the postacquisition part year. For purposes of section 172(b)(2), a net operating loss of the acquiring corporation shall be carried to the preacquisition part year and then to the postacquisition part year, whereas a net operating loss of a distributor or transferor corporation shall be carried to the postacquisition part year and then to the acquiring corporation's subsequent taxable years. In determining under section 172(b)(2) and this paragraph the portion of any net operating loss of a distributor or transferor corporation which is carried to any taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the postacquisition part year, the taxable income (as determined under this paragraph) of the postacquisition part year shall be taken into account but the taxable income of the preacquisition part year (as so determined) shall not be taken into account. Though considered as two separate taxable years for purposes of section 172(b)(2), the preacquisition part year and the postacquisition part year are treated as one taxable year in determining the years to which a net operating loss is carried under section 172(b)(1). See paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(3)
Preacquisition part year.
The preacquisition part year shall begin with the beginning of such taxable year of the acquiring corporation and shall end with the close of the date of distribution or transfer.
(4)
Postacquisition part year.
The postacquisition part year shall begin with the day following the date of distribution or transfer and shall end with the close of such taxable year of the acquiring corporation.
(5)
Division of taxable income.
The taxable income for such taxable year (computed with the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2)(A) but without any net operating loss deduction) of the acquiring corporation shall be divided between the preacquisition part year and the postacquisition part year in proportion to the number of days in each. Thus, if in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies Y Corporation acquires the assets of X Corporation on June 30, 1960, and Y Corporation has taxable income (computed in the manner so prescribed) of $36,600 for its calendar year 1960, then the preacquisition part year taxable income would be $18,200 ($36,600 × 182/366) and the postacquisition part year taxable income would be $18,400 ($36,600 × 184/366).
(6)
Net operating loss deduction.
After obtaining the taxable income of the preacquisition part year and of the postacquisition part year in the manner described in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, it is necessary to compute the net operating loss deduction for each such part year. This deduction shall be determined in the manner prescribed by section 172(b)(2)(B) but subject to the provisions of this subparagraph. The net operating loss deduction for the preacquisition part year shall, for purposes of section 172(b)(2) only, be determined in the same manner as that prescribed by section 172(b)(2)(B) but shall be computed without taking into account any net operating loss of the distributor or transferor corporation. Therefore, only net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks of the acquiring corporation to the preacquisition part year shall be taken into account in computing the net operating loss deduction for such part year. The net operating loss deduction for the post- acquisition part year shall, for purposes of section 172(b)(2) only, be determined in the same manner as that prescribed by section 172(b)(2)(B) and shall be computed by taking into account all the net operating loss carryovers available to the distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer, as well as the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks of the acquiring corporation to the postacquisition part year. The sequence in which the net operating losses of the two corporations shall be applied for purposes of this subparagraph shall be determined in the manner prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section.
(7)
Limitation on taxable income.
In no case shall the taxable income of the preacquisition part year or the
postacquisition part year, as computed under this paragraph, be considered to be less than zero.
(8)
Cross reference.
If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the net operating loss carryovers of two or more distributors or transferor corporations on two or more dates of distribution or transfer during the same taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the determination of the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for such year pursuant to section 381(c)(1)(C) shall be governed by the rules prescribed in paragraph (c) of § 1.381(c)(1)-2.

§ 1.381(c)(1)-2
Net operating loss carryovers; two or more dates of distribution or transfer in the taxable year.
(a)
In general.
If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the net operating loss carryovers of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on two or more dates of distribution or transfer within one taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the limitation to be applied under section 381(c)(1)(B) to the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers to that taxable year from all of the distributor or transferor corporations shall be determined by applying the rules prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, and the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for that taxable year under sections 381(c)(1)(C) and 172(b)(2) shall be determined by applying the rules prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of this section, the term
postacquisition income
means postacquisition part year taxable income determined under paragraph (d)(1) of § 1.381(c)(1)-1 by treating the first date of distribution or transfer as though it were the only date of distribution or transfer during the taxable year of the acquiring corporation.
(b)
Determination of limitation under section 381(c)(1)(B)
—(1)
In general.
If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the net operating loss carryovers of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on two or more dates of distribution or transfer during the same taxable year of the acquiring corporation, and if the amount of the net operating loss carryovers acquired on the first date of distribution or transfer equals or exceeds the postacquisition income, then the limitation under section 381(c)(1)(B) shall be an amount equal to such postacquisition income. If the amount of the net operating loss carryovers acquired on the first date of distribution or transfer is less than such postacquisition income, then the limitation under section 381(c)(1)(B) shall be determined as provided in subparagraphs (2) through (5) of this paragraph.
(2)
Allocation of postacquisition income among partial postacquisition years.
That part of the taxable year of the acquiring corporation beginning on the day following the first date of distribution or transfer and ending with the close of the taxable year of the acquiring corporation shall be divided into the same number of partial postacquisition years as the number of dates of distribution or transfer on which the acquiring corporation succeeds to net operating loss carryovers during its taxable year. The first partial postacquisition year shall begin with the day following the first date of distribution or transfer and shall end with the close of the second date of distribution or transfer. The second and succeeding partial postacquisition years shall begin with the day following the close of the preceding such partial year and shall end with the close of the succeeding date of distribution or transfer, or, if there is no such succeeding date, then with the close of the taxable year of the acquiring corporation. The postacquisition income of the acquiring corporation shall be allocated among the partial postacquisition years in proportion to the number of days in each such partial year.
(3)
Two dates of distribution or transfer.
If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the net operating loss carryovers of two distributor or transferor corporations on two dates of distribution or transfer during the same taxable year of the acquiring corporation, and if the amount of the net operating loss carryovers acquired on the first date equals or exceeds the income for the first partial postacquisition year, the limitation provided by section
381(c)(1)(B) shall be the amount of the postacquisition income. If the income for the first partial postacquisition year exceeds the net operating loss carryovers acquired on the first date of distribution or transfer, the limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) shall be the amount of the postacquisition income reduced by the amount of such excess. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) X Corporation has taxable income (computed without any net operating loss deduction) of $36,500 for its calendar year 1955. During 1955, X Corporation acquires the assets of Y and Z Corporations in statutory mergers to each of which section 361 applies, the dates of transfer being January 1 and December 1, respectively. The net operating loss carryovers of each transferor corporation and the income for each partial postacquisition year are:
Corp.
Carryovers
Income for partial years
Reduction
Y
$1,000
$33,400 ($36,500 × 334/365)
$32,400
Z
50,000
3,000 ($36,500 × 30/365)
0
51,000
36,400
32,400
(ii) The limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) equals the postacquisition income of $36,400 reduced by $32,400, the excess of the income for the first partial year ($33,400) over the net operating loss carryovers acquired on the first date of transfer ($1,000). Accordingly, the limitation is $4,000 ($36,400 minus $32,400). Therefore, although X Corporation acquired carryovers aggregating $51,000 during 1955, it can utilize only $4,000 of such carryovers in computing its net operating loss deduction for 1955.
(4)
Three dates of distribution or transfer.
If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the net operating loss carryovers of three distributor or transferor corporations on three dates of distribution or transfer during the same taxable year of the acquiring corporation, and if the amount of the net operating loss carryovers acquired on the first date equals or exceeds the income for the first and second partial postacquisition years, the limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) shall be the amount of the postacquisition income. If the amount of the carryovers acquired on the first date equals or exceeds the income for the first partial postacquisition year but does not equal or exceed the income for the first and second partial postacquisition years, the limitation shall be the amount of the postacquisition income reduced by the excess of the income for the first and second partial postacquisition years over the amount of carryovers acquired on the first and second dates of distribution or transfer. If the income for the first partial postacquisition year exceeds the carryovers acquired on the first date, the limitation shall be the postacquisition income reduced by the sum of the amount of such excess plus the amount, if any, by which the income for the second partial postacquisition year exceeds the carryovers acquired on the second date. This subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) X Corporation has taxable income (computed without any net operating loss deduction) of $36,500 for its calendar year 1955. During 1955, X Corporation acquires the assets of M, N, and Z Corporations in statutory mergers to each of which section 361 applies, the dates of transfer being January 1, January 31, and December 1, respectively. The net operating loss carryovers of each transferor corporation and the income for each partial postacquisition year are:
Corp.
Carryovers
Income for partial years
Reduction
M
$4,000
$3,000 ($36,500 × 30/365)
$23,400
N
6,000
30,400 ($36,500 × 304/365)
Z
50,000
3,000 ($36,500 × 30/365)
0
60,000
36,400
23,400
(ii) Since the carryovers of $4,000 acquired on the first date of transfer exceed the income for the first partial year ($3,000), the limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) is the amount of the postacquisition income ($36,400) reduced by the excess of the income for the first and second partial years ($33,400) over the carryovers acquired on the first and second dates of transfer ($10,000). Therefore, the limitation is $13,000 ($36,400 less $23,400).

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example (1)
except that the amount of the net operating loss carryovers acquired from M Corporation is $1,000. The net operating
loss carryovers of each transferor corporation and the income for each partial postacquisition year are:
Corp.
Carryovers
Income for partial years
Reduction
M

Z
50,000
3,000 ($36,500 × 30/365)
0
57,000
36,400
26,400
(ii) Since the income for the first partial year ($3,000) exceeds the $1,000 of carryovers acquired on the first date by $2,000, the limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) is the postacquisition income of $36,400 reduced by such excess and also reduced by the excess of the income for the second partial year ($30,400) over the carryovers acquired on the second date of transfer ($6,000). Therefore, the limitation is $10,000 ($36,400 less the sum of $2,000 and $24,400).

# Example 3.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example (2)
except that the carryovers acquired from N Corporation are $75,000. The net operating loss carryovers of each transferor corporation and the income for each partial postacquisition year are:
Corp.
Carryovers
Income for partial years

M
$1,000

3,000 ($36,500 × 30/365)
0
126,000
36,400
2,000
(ii) Since the income for the first partial year ($3,000) exceeds the $1,000 of carryovers acquired on the first date by $2,000, the limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) is the postacquisition income of $36,400 reduced by $2,000, or $34,400. No further reduction is made since the income for the second partial year ($30,400) does not exceed the carryovers of $75,000 acquired on the second date of transfer.
(5)
Four or more dates of distribution or transfer.
If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the net operating loss carryovers of four or more distributor or transferor corporations on four or more dates of distribution or transfer during the same taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) shall be determined consistently with the methods prescribed in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) X Corporation has taxable income (computed without any net operating loss deduction) of $36,500 for its calendar year 1955. During 1955, X Corporation acquired the assets of M, N, O, Y, and Z Corporations in statutory mergers to each of which section 361 applied, the dates of transfer being, respectively, January 1, January 31, March 3, April 2, and December 1. The net operating loss carryovers of each transferor corporation and the income for each partial postacquisition year are:
Corp.

0
36,000
36,400
17,400
(ii) The limitation provided by section 381(c)(1)(B) equals the postacquisition income of $36,400 reduced by the sum of (a) the $2,000 excess of the income for the first partial year ($3,000) over the carryovers acquired from M Corporation ($1,000), (b) the $1,100 excess of the income for the second and third partial years ($6,100) over the carryovers acquired from N and O Corporations ($5,000), and (c) the $14,300 excess of the income for the fourth partial year ($24,300) over the carryovers acquired from Y Corporation ($10,000). Accordingly, the limitation is $19,000 ($36,400 minus $17,400). Therefore, although X Corporation acquired carryovers aggregating $36,000 during 1955, it can utilize only $19,000 of such carryovers in computing its net operating loss deduction for 1955.
(c)
Determination of taxable income of acquiring corporation under section 381(c)(1)(C)
—(1)
In general.
If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the net operating loss carryovers of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on two or more dates of distribution or
transfer within one taxable year of the acquiring corporation, then pursuant to section 381(c)(1)(C) the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for its taxable year which is a prior taxable year for purposes of section 172(b)(2) and paragraph (e) of § 1.381(c)(1)-1 shall be determined as provided in this paragraph.
(2)
Division of taxable income.
The taxable income of the acquiring corporation (computed with the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2)(A) but without any net operating loss deduction) shall be allocated proportionately on a daily basis among a preacquisition part year (determined under paragraph (f)(3) of § 1.381(c)(1)-1 by treating the first date of distribution or transfer as though it were the only date of distribution or transfer during the taxable year of the acquiring corporation) and two or more partial postacquisition years (determined as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). The preacquisition part year and each partial postacquisition year shall be considered a separate taxable year, but only for the limited purpose of applying sections 172(b)(2) and 381(c)(1)(C).
(3)
Net operating loss deduction.
The net operating loss deduction of the preacquisition part year and the partial postacquisition years shall be determined consistently with the manner described in paragraph (f)(6) of § 1.381(c)(1)-1 but by taking into account, in the case of any partial postacquisition year, only the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks of the acquiring corporation and those net operating loss carryovers from a distributor or transferor corporation which become available to the acquiring corporation as of the close of those dates of distribution or transfer which occur before the beginning of that specific partial postacquisition year. The sequence in which the net operating losses of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations shall be applied for this purpose shall be determined in the manner described in paragraph (e) of § 1.381(c)(1)-1. Subject to the preceding sentence, the net operating loss carryovers to any specific partial postacquisition year, whether from a distributor, transferor, or acquiring corporation, shall be taken into account in the order of the taxable years in which the net operating losses arose, beginning with the loss for the earliest taxable year.
(4)
Illustration.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation, which was organized on January 1, 1957, sustained a net operating loss of $20,000 for its calendar year 1957 and had taxable income (computed without any net operating loss deduction) of $36,500 for its calendar year 1958. During 1958, X Corporation acquired the assets of Y and Z Corporations in statutory mergers to each of which section 361 applied, the dates of transfer being June 30 and September 30, respectively. None of the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2)(A) apply to any of the corporations for any taxable year. The taxable income (computed without any net operating loss deduction) and net operating losses of Y and Z Corporations (which were organized on January 1, 1957, and January 1, 1954, respectively) are set forth below:

§ 1.381(c)(2)-1
Earnings and profits.
(a)
In general.
(1) Section 381(c)(2) requires the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies to succeed to, and take into account, the earnings and profits, or deficit in earnings and profits, of the distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer. In determining the amount of such earnings and profits, or deficit, to be carried over, and the manner in which they are to be used by the acquiring corporation after such date, the provisions of section 381(c)(2) and this section shall apply. For purposes of section 381(c)(2) and this section, if the distributor or transferor corporation accumulates earnings and profits, or incurs a deficit in earnings and profits, after the date of distribution or transfer and before the completion of the reorganization or liquidation, such earnings and profits, or deficit, shall be deemed to have been accumulated or incurred as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer.
(2) If the distributor or transferor corporation has accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer, such earnings and profits shall (except as hereinafter provided in this section) be deemed to be received by, and to become a part of the accumulated earnings and profits of, the acquiring corporation as of such time. Similarly, if the distributor or transferor corporation has a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer, such deficit shall (except as hereinafter provided in this section) be deemed to be incurred by the acquiring corporation as of such time. In no event, however, shall the accumulated earnings and profits, or deficit, of the distribution or transferor corporation be taken into account in determining earnings and profits of the acquiring corporation for the taxable year during which occurs the date of distribution or transfer.
(3) Any part of the accumulated earnings and profits, or deficit in accumulated earnings and profits, of the distributor or transferor corporation which consists of earnings and profits, or deficits, accumulated before March
1, 1913, shall be deemed to become earnings and profits, or deficits, of the acquiring corporation accumulated before March 1, 1913, and any part of the accumulated earnings and profits of the distributor or transferor corporation which consists of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913, shall be deemed to become earnings and profits of the acquiring corporation consisting of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913.
(4) If the acquiring corporation and each distributor or transferor corporation has accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer, or if each of such corporations has a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits as of such time, then the accumulated earnings and profits (or deficit) of each such corporation shall be consolidated as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer in the accumulated earnings and profits account of the acquiring corporation. See subparagraph (6) of this paragraph for determination of the accumulated earnings and profits (or deficit) of the acquiring corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer.
(5) If (i) one or more corporations a party to a distribution or transfer has accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer, and (ii) one or more of such corporations has a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits as of such time, the total of any such deficits shall be used only to offset earnings and profits accumulated, or deemed to have been accumulated under subparagraph (6) of this paragraph, by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer. In such instance, the acquiring corporation will be considered as maintaining two separate earnings and profits accounts after the date of distribution or transfer. The first such account shall contain the total of the accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer of each corporation which has accumulated earnings and profits as of such time, and the second such account shall contain the total of the deficits in accumulated earnings and profits of each corporation which has a deficit as of such time. The total deficit in the second account may not be used to reduce the accumulated earnings and profits in the first account (although such earnings and profits may be offset by deficits incurred, or deemed to have been incurred, after the date of distribution or transfer) but shall be used only to offset earnings and profits accumulated, or deemed to have been accumulated under subparagraph (6) of this paragraph, by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer.
(6) In any case in which it is necessary to compute the accumulated earnings and profits, or the deficit in accumulated earnings and profits, of the acquiring corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer and such date is a day other than the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation—
(i) If the acquiring corporation has earnings and profits for its taxable year during which occurs the date of distribution or transfer, such earnings and profits (
a
) shall be deemed to have accumulated as of the close of such date in an amount which bears the same ratio to the undistributed earnings and profits of such corporation for such year as the number of days in the taxable year preceding the date following the date of distribution or transfer bears to the total number of days in the taxable year, and (
b
) shall be deemed to have accumulated after the date of distribution or transfer in an amount which bears the same ratio to the undistributed earnings and profits of such corporation for such year as the number of days in the taxable year following such date bears to the total number of days in such taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the undistributed earnings and profits of the acquiring corporation for such taxable year shall be the earnings and profits for such taxable year reduced by any distributions made therefrom during such taxable year.
(ii) If the acquiring corporation has an operating deficit for its taxable year during which occurs the date of distribution or transfer, then, unless the actual accumulated earnings and profits, or deficit, as of such date can be
shown, such operating deficit shall be deemed to have accumulated in a manner similar to that described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(7) This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that none of the accumulated earnings and profits, or deficits, consist of earnings and profits or deficits accumulated, or increase in value of property accrued, before March 1, 1913.

(ii) As of the close of June 30, 1959, N acquires from M accumulated earnings and profits of $115,000. Since M and N each has accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of the date of transfer, M's accumulated earnings and profits are added to N's accumulated earnings and profits as of such time. However, no part of M's accumulated earnings and profits is taken into account in determining N's earnings and profits for the calendar year 1959. Therefore, N's earnings and profits for the calendar year 1959 are $36,500.

(ii) As of the close of June 30, 1959, Y acquires from X a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits in the amount of $60,000. This deficit may be used only to reduce those earnings and profits of Y which are accumulated, or deemed to have accumulated, after June 30, 1959. Accordingly, as of December 31, 1959, the accumulated earnings and profits of Y amount to $118,100; at such time Y also has a separate deficit in accumulated earnings and profits in the amount of $41,600. These amounts are determined as follows:

(1) If, as of the date of distribution or transfer, either the acquiring corporation, or the distributor or transferor corporation, or both, is considered under paragraph (a) of this section to be maintaining separate earnings and profits accounts as the result of a prior transaction or transactions to which section 381(a) applied, the accumulated earnings and profits, or deficit in accumulated earnings and profits, of each such corporation shall be combined with the appropriate earnings and profits account of the other such corporation. For example, if, as of the date of transfer, the acquiring corporation and the transferor corporation are each maintaining separate accounts, one containing accumulated earnings and profits and the other containing a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits, the amounts in the two accumulated earnings and profits accounts shall be combined into one account, and the amounts in the two deficit accounts shall be combined into a second account, and the amount in one combined account may not be used to offset the amount in the other combined account.
(2) This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that none of the accumulated earnings and profits, or deficits, consist of earnings and profits or deficits accumulated, or increase in value of property accrued, before March 1, 1913.

As of the close of August 31, 1958, Z acquires from Y earnings and profits of $12,000, no portion of which may be reduced by the deficit acquired by Z from X. Accordingly, as of December 31, 1958, Z has accumulated earnings and profits of $90,100, and also has a separate deficit in accumulated earnings and profits of $26,600. These amounts are determined as follows:

The total deficit of $33,500 may be used only to reduce earnings and profits of M which are accumulated, or deemed to have accumulated, after June 30, 1959. Accordingly, as of December 31, 1959, M has accumulated earnings and profits of $140,100, and also has a separate deficit in accumulated earnings and profits in the amount of $15,100.

(2) If, in a distribution to which section 381(a)(1) (relating to certain liquidations of subsidiaries) applies, the acquiring corporation receives less than 100 percent of the assets distributed by the distributor corporation, then the accumulated earnings and profits of the distributor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution shall be computed by taking into account the amount of earnings and profits properly applicable to the distributions to minority stockholders, regardless of whether such distributions occur before or after the close of the date of distribution.

§ 1.381(c)(3)-1
Capital loss carryovers.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
(1) Section 381(c)(3) requires the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies to succeed to, and take into account, the capital loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation. To determine the amount of these carryovers as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer, and to integrate them with the capital loss carryovers of the acquiring corporation for purposes of determining the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for taxable years ending after the date of distribution or transfer, it is necessary to apply the provisions of section 1212 in accordance with the conditions and limitations of section 381(c)(3) and this section.
(2) The capital loss carryovers of the acquiring corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be determined without reference to any capital gains or capital losses of the distributor or transferor corporation. The capital loss carryovers of a distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be determined without reference to any capital gains or capital losses of the acquiring corporation.
(3) This section contains rules applicable to capital loss carryovers determined without reference to the amendment of section 1212(a) made by section 7 of the Act of September 2, 1964 (Public Law 88-571, 78 Stat. 860) in respect of foreign expropriation capital losses. If the distributor, transferor, or acquiring corporation sustains a net capital loss in a taxable year ending after December 31, 1958, any portion of which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss, such portion shall be carried over to each of the ten succeeding taxable years consistently with the rules prescribed in this section and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1212-1.
(b)
First taxable year to which carryovers apply.
(1) The capital loss carryovers available to the distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall first be carried to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after that date. This rule applies irrespective of whether the date of distribution or transfer is on the last day, or any other day, of the acquiring corporation's taxable year.
(2) The capital loss carryovers available to the distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be carried to the acquiring corporation without diminution by reason of the fact that the acquiring corporation does not acquire 100 percent of the assets of the distributor or transferor corporation.
(c)
Limitation on capital loss carryovers for first taxable year ending after date of distribution or transfer.
(1) Any capital
loss carryover of a distributor or transferor corporation which is available to the acquiring corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be a short-term capital loss of the acquiring corporation in each of the taxable years to which the net capital loss giving rise to such carryover may be carried to the extent provided in section 1212 and this section. However, in the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the total capital loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation which may be treated in that year as short-term capital losses of the acquiring corporation is limited by section 381(c)(3)(B) to an amount which bears the same ratio to the acquiring corporation's capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for such first taxable year (determined without regard to any capital loss carryovers) as the number of days in such first taxable year which follow the date of distribution or transfer bears to the total number of days in such taxable year. Thus, if the date of distribution or transfer is the last day of the acquiring corporation's taxable year, there is no limitation under section 381(c)(3)(B) on the amount of such carryovers which may be treated as short-term capital losses of the acquiring corporation for its first taxable year ending after that date.
(2) The limitation provided by section 381(c)(3)(B) shall be applied to the aggregate of the capital loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation without reference to the taxable years in which the net capital losses giving rise to the carryovers were sustained. If the acquiring corporation has acquired the assets of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on the same date of distribution or transfer, then the limitation provided by section 381(c)(3)(B) shall be applied to the aggregate of the capital loss carryovers from all of such distributor or transferor corporations.
(3) If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the capital loss carryovers of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on two or more dates of distribution or transfer during the same taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the limitation to be applied under section 381(c)(3)(B) to the aggregate of such carryovers shall be determined consistently with the rules prescribed in paragraph (b) of § 1.381(c)(1)-2.
(4) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) X and Y Corporations are organized on January 1, 1954, and make their returns on the basis of the calendar year. On July 4, 1957, X Corporation transfers all its assets to Y Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. The net capital losses and the net capital gains (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 1976), (computed without regard to any capital loss carryovers) of the two corporations are as follows:
Taxable year
X Corporation (transferor)

(ii) The capital loss carryovers of X Corporation which are available to Y Corporation as of the close of July 4, 1957, amount to $48,000 in the aggregate; but only $18,000 ($36,500 × 180/365) of such amount may be treated as short-term capital losses of Y Corporation for 1957.
(d)
Computation of carryovers; general rule
—(1)
Sequence for applying losses and determination of capital gain net income.
Section 1212 provides that a net capital loss sustained in any taxable year (hereinafter referred to as the “loss year”) shall be carried over to each of the five succeeding taxable years and treated in each of such succeeding years as a short-term capital loss to the extent not allowed as a deduction against any capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of any taxable years intervening between the loss year and the taxable year to which such loss is carried. For this purpose, the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of any intervening taxable year is determined without regard to the net capital loss for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter, and the various capital
loss carryovers from taxable years preceding the loss year to any such intervening taxable year are considered to be applied in reduction of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for such year in the order of the taxable years in which the losses were sustained, beginning with the loss for the earliest preceding taxable year. The application of these rules to the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of the acquiring corporation for any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer involves the use of carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation and of the acquiring corporation. In determining the order in which the capital loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations from taxable years ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer are considered to be applied in reduction of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of the acquiring corporation for any intervening taxable year ending after such date, the following rules shall apply:
(i) Each taxable year of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations which, with respect to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date of distribution or transfer, constitutes a first preceding taxable year, shall be treated as if each such year ended on the same day, whether or not such taxable years actually end on the same day. In like manner, each taxable year of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations which, with respect to such first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date of distribution or transfer, constitutes a second preceding taxable year, shall be treated as if each such year ended on the same day (whether or not such taxable years actually end on the same day), and a similar rule shall be applied with respect to those taxable years of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations which constitute third, fourth, and fifth preceding taxable years;
(ii) If in the same preceding taxable year both the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations incurred a net capital loss which is a carryover to an intervening taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date of distribution or transfer, then in applying such losses in reduction of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for such an intervening year, either such loss may be taken into account before the other; and
(iii) The rules of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph shall apply regardless of the number of distributor or transferor corporations the assets of which are acquired by the acquiring corporation on the same date of distribution or transfer.
(2)
Cross reference.
If the date of distribution or transfer is a day other than the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation, then in determining the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of the acquiring corporation for its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, section 1212 and this paragraph shall be applied in the special manner set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
(3)
Years to which losses may be carried.
The taxable years to which a net capital loss shall be carried are prescribed by section 1212. Since the taxable year of a distributor or transferor corporation ends with the close of the date of distribution or transfer, such taxable year and the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation which ends after that date are considered two separate taxable years to which a net capital loss of the distributor or transferor corporation for any taxable year ending before that date shall be carried. This rule applies even though the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation which ends on the date of distribution or transfer is a period of less than twelve months. However, the distribution or transfer has no effect in determining under section 1212 the taxable years to which a net capital loss of the acquiring corporation is carried. For this purpose, the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation which ends after the date of distribution or transfer constitutes only one taxable year even though such
taxable year is considered under paragraph (e) of this section as two taxable years for certain purposes. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
R and S Corporations are organized on January 1, 1954, and both corporations make their returns on the basis of the calendar year. R Corporation has net capital losses for its years 1954, 1955, and 1957, and S Corporation has net capital losses for its years 1954 and 1956. On June 30, 1958, R Corporation transfers all its assets to S Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. The taxable years to which these losses of R and S Corporations may be carried are as follows:
Loss year
Carried to
R1954
R1955, R1956, R1957, R6/30/58, S1958.
S1954
S1955, S1956, S1957, S1958, S1959.
R1955
R1956, R1957, R6/30/58, S1958, S1959.
S1956
S1957, S1958, S1959, S1960, S1961.
R1957
R6/30/58, S1958, S1959, S1960, S1961.
(4)
Computation of carryovers in case where date of distribution or transfer occurs on last day of acquiring corporation's taxable year.
The computation of the capital loss carryovers from the distributor or transferor corporation and from the acquiring corporation in a case where the date of distribution or transfer occurs on the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X and Y Corporations are organized on January 1, 1955, and make their returns on the basis of the calendar year. On December 31, 1956, X Corporation transfers all its assets to Y Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. The net capital losses and the net capital gains (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976), (computed without regard to any capital loss carryovers) of the two corporations are as follows:
Taxable year
X Corporation (transferor)
Y Corporation (acquirer)
1955
($20,000)
($2,000)
1956
(10,000)
(8,000)
1957
25,000
1958
10,000
The sequence in which the net capital losses of X and Y Corporations are applied, and the computation of the capital loss carryovers to Y Corporation's taxable year 1959, may be illustrated as follows. (For purposes of this example, the carryover from a preceding taxable year of the transferor corporation will be applied before the carryover from the same preceding taxable year of the acquiring corporation):
(i)
X Corporation's 1955 loss.
The carryover to 1959 is $0, computed as follows:
Net capital loss
$20,000
Less: Y's 1957 net capital gain (computed without regard to any capital loss carryovers)
25,000
Carryover to Y 1958 and Y 1959
0
(ii)
Y Corporation's 1955 loss.
The carryover to 1959 is $0, computed as follows:
Net capital loss
$2,000
Less:
Y's 1957 net capital gain (computed without regard to any capital loss carryovers)
$25,000
Minus capital loss carryovers to Y 1957 (i.e., carryover of $20,000 from X 1955)
20,000
5,000
Carryover to Y 1958 and Y 1959
0
(iii)
X Corporation's 1956 loss.
The carryover to 1959 is $0, computed as follows:
Net capital loss
$10,000
Less:
Y's 1957 net capital gain (computed without regard to any capital loss carryovers)
$25,000
Minus capital loss carryovers to Y 1957 (i.e., carryovers of $20,000 from X 1955 and $2,000 from Y 1955)
22,000

10,000
Carryover to Y 1959
0
(iv)
Y Corporation's 1956 loss.
The carryover to 1959 is $5,000, computed as follows:
Net capital loss
$8,000
Less:
Y's 1957 net capital gain (computed without regard to any capital loss carryovers)
$25,000
Minus capital loss carryovers to Y 1957 (i.e., carryovers of $20,000 from X 1955, $2,000 from Y 1955, and $10,000 from X 1956)

(e)
Computation of carryovers when date of distribution or transfer is not on last day of acquiring corporation's taxable year
—(1)
General rule.
If, in determining under paragraph (d) of this section the portion of a net capital loss for any taxable year which is carried over to a succeeding taxable year, an intervening taxable year is a taxable year of the acquiring corporation which includes, but does not end on, the date of distribution or transfer, the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of such intervening year shall be determined by applying section 1212 in the special manner provided by this paragraph.
(2)
Taxable year considered as two taxable years.
Such intervening taxable year of the acquiring corporation shall be considered as though it were two taxable years, but only for the limited purpose of computing capital loss carryovers to subsequent taxable years. The first of such two taxable years shall be referred to in this paragraph as the preacquisition part year; the second, as the postacquisition part year. Though considered as two separate taxable years for purposes of this paragraph, the preacquisition part year and the postacquisition part year are treated as one taxable year in determining the years to which a net capital loss is carried under section 1212. See paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(3)
Preacquisition part year.
The preacquisition part year shall begin with the beginning of such taxable year of the acquiring corporation and shall end with the close of the date of distribution or transfer.
(4)
Postacquisition part year.
The postacquisition part year shall begin with the day following the date of distribution or transfer and shall end with the close of such taxable year of the acquiring corporation.
(5)
Division of capital gain net income.
The capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for such intervening taxable year (computed without regard to any capital loss carryovers) of the acquiring corporation shall be divided between the preacquisition part year and the postacquisition part year in proportion to the number of days in each. Thus, if in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies Y Corporation acquires the assets of X Corporation on June 30, 1956, and Y Corporation has net capital gain (computed in the manner so prescribed) of $36,600 for its calendar year 1956, then the preacquisition part year capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) would be $18,200 ($36,600 × 182/366) and the postacquisition part year capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) would be $18,400 ($36,600 × 184/366).
(6)
Application of capital loss carryovers.
After obtaining the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of the preacquisition part year and postacquisition part year in the manner described in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, it is necessary to determine the capital loss carryovers which are taken into account with respect to each such part year. The carryovers to be taken into account and the sequence in which such carryovers are applied, shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section but subject to the provisions of this subparagraph. With respect to the preacquisition part year, no capital loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation shall be taken into account; that is, only capital loss carryovers of the acquiring corporation shall be taken into account. With respect to the postacquisition part year, capital loss carryovers of both the distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation shall be taken into account.
(7)
Cross reference.
If an intervening taxable year is a taxable year of the acquiring corporation during which the acquiring corporation succeeds to the capital loss carryovers of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on two or more dates of distribution or transfer, the capital gain net income
(net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of the acquiring corporation for such intervening taxable year shall be determined consistently with the rules prescribed in paragraph (c) of § 1.381(c)(1)-2, except that the sequence in which the capital loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations shall be applied shall be determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(8)
Illustration.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated as follows:

# Example.
X Corporation is organized on April 1, 1959, and makes its return on the basis of the fiscal year ending March 31. Y Corporation is organized on January 1, 1959, and makes its return on the basis of the calendar year. On June 30, 1961, X Corporation transfers all its assets to Y Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. The net capital losses and the net capital gains (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) (computed without regard to any capital loss carryovers) of the two corporations are as follows:
Taxable year
X Corporation (transferor)
Y Corporation (acquirer)
1959
($24,000)
Ending 3-31-60
($19,000)
1960

Successive acquiring corporations.
An acquiring corporation which, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, acquires the assets of a distributor or transferor corporation which previously acquired the assets of another corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall succeed to and take into account, subject to the conditions and limitations of sections 1212 and 381, the capital loss carryovers available to the first acquiring corporation under sections 1212 and 381.
[T.D. 6552, 26 FR 1985, Mar. 8, 1961, as amended by T.D. 6867, 30 FR 15094, Dec. 12, 1965; T.D. 7728, 45 FR 72650, Nov. 3, 1980]
§ 1.381(c)(4)-1
Method of accounting.
(a)
Introduction
—(1)
Purpose.
This section provides guidance regarding the method of accounting or combination of methods (other than inventory and depreciation methods) an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(4) apply and how to implement any associated change in method of accounting. See § 1.381(c)(5)-1 for guidance regarding the inventory method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(5) apply. See § 1.381(c)(6)-1 for guidance regarding the depreciation method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(6) apply.
(2)
Carryover method requirement for separate and distinct trades or businesses.
In a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, if an acquiring corporation continues to operate a trade or business of the parties to the section 381(a) transaction as a separate and distinct trade or business after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation must use a carryover method as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or the acquiring corporation changes the carryover method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The carryover method requirement applies to the overall method of accounting (for example, an accrual method of accounting) and any special method of accounting (for example, the percentage of completion method of accounting described in section 460) as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section used by each trade or business after the date of distribution or transfer. The acquiring corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to continue a carryover method.
(3)
Principal method requirement for trades or businesses not operated as separate and distinct trades or businesses.
In a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, if an acquiring corporation does not operate the trades or businesses of the parties to the section 381(a) transaction as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation must use a principal method determined under paragraph (c) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph
(a)(4) of this section or the acquiring corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The principal method requirement applies to the overall method of accounting (for example, the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting) and any special method of accounting (for example, the installment method under section 453) as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section used by each integrated trade or business after the date of distribution or transfer. The acquiring corporation must change to a principal method in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each integrated trade or business and need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use a principal method.
(4)
Carryover method or principal method not a permissible method.
If a carryover method or principal method is not a permissible method of accounting, the acquiring corporation must secure the Commissioner's consent to change to a permissible method of accounting as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the acquiring corporation must use a single method of accounting for a particular item after the date of distribution or transfer regardless of the number of separate and distinct trades or businesses operated on that date, the acquiring corporation must use the principal method for that item as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under this paragraph (a)(4) or the acquiring corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
(5)
Voluntary change.
Any party to a section 381(a) transaction may request permission under section 446(e) to change a method of accounting for the taxable year in which the transaction occurs or is expected to occur. For trades or businesses that will not operate as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer, a change in method of accounting for the taxable year that includes that date will be granted only if the requested method is the method that the acquiring corporation must use after the date of distribution or transfer. The time and manner of obtaining the Commissioner's consent to change to a different method of accounting is described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a). Unless otherwise noted, the carryover method is a permissible method of accounting.

# Example (1). Carryover method for separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation operates an employment agency that uses the overall cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. T Corporation operates an educational institution that uses an overall accrual method of accounting. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates the employment agency as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the educational institution.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates the employment agency as a separate and distinct trade or business, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must use the carryover method for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the carryover method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. As defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the carryover method for the employment agency is the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and the carryover method for the educational institution is the accrual method of accounting used by T Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use either carryover method.

# Example (2). Carryover method for a special method of accounting.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation provides personal grooming consulting and T Corporation provides weight management consulting. Both X Corporation and T Corporation use the same overall accrual method of accounting. X Corporation has elected to use the recurring item exception under § 1.461-5. T Corporation does not use the recurring item exception. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates the personal grooming consulting business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the weight management consulting business.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates the personal grooming consulting business as a separate and distinct trade or business, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must use a carryover method for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the carryover method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. As defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the carryover method for the overall method of accounting for each trade or business is the accrual method used immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The carryover method for the special method of accounting for the personal grooming consulting business is the recurring item exception under § 1.461-5 while the carryover method for the weight management consulting business is not to use the recurring item exception under § 1.461-5. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the carryover methods of accounting.

# Example (3). Carryover method for a special method of accounting not permissible.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation is an engineering firm that uses the overall cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and has elected under section 171 to amortize bond premium with respect to its taxable bonds acquired at a premium. T Corporation is a manufacturer that uses an overall accrual method of accounting and has not made a section 171 election to amortize bond premium with respect to its taxable bonds acquired at a premium. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates the engineering firm as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the manufacturing business.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates the engineering firm as a separate and distinct trade or business, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must use a carryover method for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the carryover method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. As defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the carryover method for the overall method of accounting for the engineering firm is the cash receipts and disbursements method used by X Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, and the carryover method for the overall method of accounting for the manufacturing business is the accrual method used by T Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use either carryover method. Notwithstanding that after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation has two separate and distinct trades or businesses, X Corporation is permitted only one method of accounting for amortizable bond premium under section 171. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation must use a single method of accounting for bond premium for all trades or businesses, X Corporation must use the principal method for that item as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes that method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. X Corporation must change to the principal method in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If amortizing bond premium is not the principal method, X Corporation may make an election to amortize bond premium to the extent permitted by section 171. See paragraph (e)(2) of this section for rules on making elections.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Method of accounting.
A method of accounting has the same meaning as provided in section 446 and any applicable Income Tax Regulations.
(2)
Special method of accounting.
A special method of accounting is a method expressly permitted or required by the Internal Revenue Code, Income Tax Regulations, or administrative guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin that deviates from the normal application of the cash receipts and disbursements method or an accrual method of accounting. The installment method under section 453, the mark-to-market method under section 475, the amortization of bond premium under section 171, the percentage of completion method under section 460, the recurring item exception of § 1.461-5, and the income deferral method under section 455 are examples of special methods of accounting. See § 1.446-1(c)(1)(iii).

(c)
Principal method
—(1)
In general.
For each integrated trade or business, the principal method is generally the method of accounting used by the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. If, however, the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation is larger than the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation on the date of distribution or transfer, the principal method is the method used by the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation immediately prior to that date. If the larger component trade or business does not have a special method of accounting for a particular item immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, the principal method for that item is the method of accounting used by the component trade or business that does have a special method of accounting for that item. See paragraph (e)(9) of this section for special rules concerning methods of accounting that are elected on a project-by-project, job-by-job, or other similar basis. For each integrated trade or business, the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation is larger than the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation on the date of distribution or transfer if—
(i) The aggregate of the adjusted bases of the assets held by each component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation (determined under section 1011 and any applicable Income Tax Regulations) exceeds the aggregate of the adjusted bases of the assets of each component trade or business of the acquiring corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, and
(ii) The aggregate of the gross receipts for a representative period of each component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation exceeds the aggregate of the gross receipts for the same period of each component trade or business of the acquiring corporation. See paragraph (e)(5) of this section for rules on determining the representative period.
(2)
Multiple component trades or businesses with different principal methods.
If a party to the section 381(a) transaction has multiple component trades or businesses and more than one principal overall method of accounting or more than one principal special method of accounting for an item, then the acquiring corporation may choose which of the principal methods of accounting used by such component trades or businesses will be the principal methods of the integrated trade or business. The acquiring corporation must choose a principal method that is a permissible method of accounting. In general, a change to a principal method in a transaction to which section 381(a) and paragraph (a)(3) of this section applies is made under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c). Unless otherwise noted, the principal method is a permissible method of accounting.

# Example (1). Principal method is the method used by the acquiring corporation.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation and T Corporation each operate an employment agency. X Corporation uses the overall cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, and T Corporation uses an overall accrual method of accounting. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. The adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's employment agency immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's employment agency, and the gross receipts in X Corporation's employment agency for the representative period exceed the gross receipts of T Corporation's employment agency for the period. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation's employment agency will not be operated as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's employment agency.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its employment agency as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use a principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's employment agency is not larger than X Corporation's employment agency, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the cash receipts and disbursements method used by X Corporation's employment agency. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use this method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the method of accounting for the employment agency acquired from T Corporation to the cash receipts and disbursements method.

# Example (2). Principal method is the method used by the acquiring corporation.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(1), except that the gross receipts of T Corporation's employment agency for the representative period exceed the gross receipts of X Corporation's employment agency for the period.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The result is the same as in
Example
(1). Although the gross receipts of T Corporation's employment agency exceed the gross receipts of X Corporation's employment agency, T Corporation's employment agency is not larger than X Corporation's employment agency because the adjusted bases of the assets of T Corporation's employment agency do not exceed the adjusted bases of the assets of X Corporation's employment agency. Thus, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting used by X Corporation's employment agency immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use this method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the method of accounting for the employment agency business acquired from T Corporation to the cash receipts and disbursements method.

# Example (3). Principal method is the method used by the distributor or transferor corporation.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(2), except that the adjusted bases of the assets held by T Corporation's employment agency immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceed the adjusted bases of the assets held by X Corporation's employment agency.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The principal method for the overall method of accounting is the accrual method of accounting used by T Corporation's employment agency immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's employment agency is larger than X Corporation's employment agency. The adjusted bases of the assets of T Corporation's employment agency exceed the adjusted bases of the assets of X Corporation's employment agency, and the gross receipts of T Corporation's employment agency exceed the gross receipts of X Corporation's employment agency. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use this method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the method of accounting for the employment agency business it operated prior to the date of distribution or transfer to the accrual method of accounting used by T Corporation's employment agency immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer.

# Example (4). Impermissible principal method.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(1), except that X Corporation is prohibited under section 448 from using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting after the date of distribution or transfer.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because section 448 prohibits X Corporation from using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, X Corporation is not permitted to use the principal method for the overall method of accounting as determined in
Example
(1). Because after the date of distribution or transfer that method is not a permissible method, under paragraph (a)(4) of this section X Corporation must secure the Commissioner's consent to change to a permissible method in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

# Example (5). Voluntary change not allowable.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(4), except that T Corporation wants to discontinue using the overall accrual method of accounting for its employment agency and change to the cash receipts and disbursements method for the taxable year in which the section 381(a) transaction occurs or is expected to occur.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the Commissioner will grant a request to change a method of accounting for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer only if the requested method is the method that the acquiring corporation must use after the date of distribution or transfer. The Commissioner will not consent to a request by T Corporation to change to the cash receipts and disbursements method for the taxable year in which the section 381(a) transaction occurs or is expected to occur because X Corporation cannot use the cash receipts and disbursements
method after the date of distribution or transfer.

# Example (6). Principal methods are the acquiring corporation's methods.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation and T Corporation each publishes magazines. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Both X Corporation and T Corporation use an overall accrual method of accounting. X Corporation has elected to defer income from its subscription sales under section 455. T Corporation has not elected to defer income from its subscription sales under section 455 and instead has recognized the income from these sales in accordance with section 451. The adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's publication business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's publication business, and the gross receipts in X Corporation's publication business for the representative period exceed the gross receipts in T Corporation's publication business for the representative period. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its publication business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's publication business.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its publication business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use the principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's publication business do not exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's publication business, and the gross receipts in T Corporation's publication business do not exceed the gross receipts in X Corporation's publication business. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's publication business is not larger than X Corporation's publication business, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the accrual method used by X Corporation's publication business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The principal method for subscription sales is the section 455 deferral method used by X Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal method for either the overall method of accounting or the special method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change both the overall method of accounting and the special method of accounting for the publication business acquired from T Corporation to the accrual method and the section 455 deferral method used by X Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer.

# Example (7). Principal methods are the acquiring corporation's methods.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(6), except that the adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's publication business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's business.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The result is the same as in
Example
(6). Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's publication business is not larger than X Corporation's publication business, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the accrual method used by X Corporation's publication business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The principal method for subscription sales is the section 455 deferral method used by X Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal method for either the overall method of accounting or the special method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change both the overall method of accounting and the special method of accounting for the publication business acquired from T Corporation to the accrual method and the section 455 deferral method used by X Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer.

# Example (8). Principal method determination when larger component trade or business does not have a special method of accounting.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation and T Corporation both install ice skating rinks. Both X Corporation and T Corporation use an overall accrual method of accounting for their respective businesses. X Corporation completes its installation contracts within the contracting year and uses an accrual method of accounting to recognize the revenue from its installation contracts. T Corporation's installation contracts are subject to section 460, and T Corporation recognizes the revenue from such contracts under the percentage-of-completion method. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. The adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's installation business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's installation business, and the gross receipts in X Corporation's installation business for the representative period exceed the gross receipts in T Corporation's installation business for the representative period. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its installation
business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's installation business.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its installation business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use a principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's installation business do not exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's installation business, and the gross receipts in T Corporation's installation business do not exceed the gross receipts in X Corporation's installation business. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's installation business is not larger than X Corporation's installation business, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the accrual method used by X Corporation's installation business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal method for the overall method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the overall method of accounting for the installation business acquired from T Corporation to the accrual method used by X Corporation. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the principal method for T Corporation's long-term contracts is the percentage-of-completion method used by T Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer because X Corporation's installation business does not have a method of accounting for long-term contracts. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use T Corporation's percentage-of-completion method.

# Example (9). Principal method determination with a combined trade or business and a separate and distinct trade or business.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation operates a tennis academy as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from its trade or business of operating a golf academy. X Corporation uses the overall cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting for the tennis academy and an overall accrual method of accounting for the golf academy. T Corporation operates a tennis academy and uses an accrual method of accounting for the overall method. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its tennis academy as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's tennis academy. X Corporation will continue to operate its golf academy as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the operation of the tennis academy. The adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's tennis academy exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's tennis academy immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The gross receipts of T Corporation's tennis academy for the representative period exceed the gross receipts of X Corporation's tennis academy for that period.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its tennis academy as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use a principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Because on the date of distribution or transfer the tennis academy operated by T Corporation is larger than the tennis academy operated by X Corporation, the principal method for the overall method of accounting for the combined tennis academy business is the accrual method used by T Corporation's tennis academy immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal method for the overall method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the method of accounting for its tennis academy to the accrual method. Because X Corporation will operate the golf academy as a separate trade or business, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must continue to use the accrual method that it used immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer as the carryover method for the golf academy. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the carryover method.

# Example (10). Principal method determination with multiple component trades or businesses.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(9), except that after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its golf academy as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the tennis academy. In addition, X Corporation's component trades or businesses are larger than T Corporation's component trade or business: (1) the adjusted bases of the assets of X Corporation's tennis academy and golf academy businesses, in the aggregate, exceed the adjusted bases of the assets held by T Corporation's tennis academy; and (2) the gross receipts for the representative period of X Corporation's tennis academy and golf academy businesses, in the aggregate, exceed the
gross receipts in T Corporation's tennis academy.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's tennis academy is not larger than X Corporation's combined tennis academy and golf academy, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the method of accounting used by the component trades or businesses of X Corporation that will be combined with T Corporation's component trade or business on that date. Because on the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates two component trades or businesses with different overall methods of accounting that will be integrated after the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation may choose under paragraph (c)(2) of this section which overall method (and any special method of accounting) used by its component trades or businesses will be the principal method. X Corporation may choose to use either the accrual method used by the golf academy or the cash receipts and disbursements method used by its tennis academy as the principal method after the date of distribution or transfer, if either method is a permissible method. In accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change T Corporation's overall method of accounting to the principal method. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, X Corporation also must change either its golf academy business or its tennis academy business, depending on which principal method X Corporation selects, to the principal method.
(d)
Procedures for changing a method of accounting
—(1)
Change made to principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section
—(i)
Section 481(a) adjustment
—(A)
In general.
An acquiring corporation that changes its method of accounting or the distributor or transferor corporation's method of accounting under paragraph (a)(3) of this section does not need to secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal method. To the extent the use of a principal method constitutes a change in method of accounting, the change in method is treated as a change initiated by the acquiring corporation for purposes of section 481(a)(2). Any change to a principal method, whether the change relates to a trade or business of the acquiring corporation or a trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation, must be reflected on the acquiring corporation's federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. The amount of the section 481(a) adjustment and the adjustment period, if any, necessary to implement a change to the principal method are determined under § 1.446-1(e) and the applicable administrative procedures that govern voluntary changes in methods of accounting under section 446(e). If the Internal Revenue Code, the Income Tax Regulations, or administrative procedures require that a method of accounting be implemented on a cut-off basis, the acquiring corporation must implement the change on a cut-off basis as of the date of distribution or transfer on its federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. If the Internal Revenue Code, the Income Tax Regulations, or administrative procedures require a section 481(a) adjustment, the acquiring corporation must determine the section 481(a) adjustment and include the appropriate amount of the section 481(a) adjustment on its federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer and subsequent taxable year(s), as necessary. This adjustment is determined by the acquiring corporation as of the beginning of the day that is immediately after the date of distribution or transfer.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (d)(1)(i):

# Example.
X Corporation uses the overall cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, and T Corporation uses an overall accrual method of accounting. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. X Corporation determines that under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section X Corporation must change the method of accounting for the business acquired from T Corporation to the cash receipts and disbursements method. X Corporation will determine the section 481(a) adjustment pertaining to the change to the cash receipts and disbursements method by consolidating the adjustments (whether the amounts thereof represent increases or decreases in items of income or deductions) arising with respect to balances in the various accounts, such as accounts receivable, as of the beginning of the day that immediately follows the day on which X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation. X Corporation will reflect this adjustment, or an appropriate part thereof, on its federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer.
(ii)
Audit protection.
Notwithstanding any other provision in any other Income Tax Regulation or administrative procedure, no audit protection is provided for any change in method of accounting under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Other terms and conditions.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, other terms and conditions provided in § 1.446-1(e) and the applicable administrative procedures for voluntary changes in method of accounting under section 446(e) apply to a change in method of accounting under this section. Thus, for example, if the administrative procedures for a particular change in method of accounting have a term and condition that provides for the acceleration of the section 481(a) adjustment period, this term and condition applies to a change made under this paragraph (d)(1). However, any scope limitation in the applicable administrative procedures will not apply for purposes of making a change under this paragraph (d)(1). For example, if the administrative procedures provide as a limitation that an identical change in method of accounting is barred for a period of years, this limitation will not bar a change to the principal method made under this section.
(2)
Change made to a method of accounting under paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section
—(i)
In general.
A party to a section 381(a) transaction that changes a method of accounting under either paragraph (a)(4) or paragraph (a)(5) of this section must follow the provisions of § 1.446-(1)(e) and the applicable administrative procedures, including scope limitations, for voluntary changes in method of accounting under section 446(e), except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section. An application on Form 3115, “Application for Change in Accounting Method,” filed with the IRS to change a method of accounting under this paragraph (d)(2) should be labeled “Filed under section 381(c)(4)” at the top.
(ii)
Final year limitation.
Any scope limitation relating to the final year of a trade or business will not apply to a taxpayer that changes its method of accounting in the final year of a trade or business that is terminated as the result of a section 381(a) transaction.
(iii)
Time to file.
Under the authority of § 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii), for a change in method of accounting requiring advance consent, the application for a change in method of accounting (for example, Form 3115) must be filed with the IRS on or before the later of—
(A) The due date for filing a Form 3115 as specified in § 1.446-1(e), for example, the last day of the taxable year in which the distribution or transfer occurred, or
(B) The earlier of—
(
1
) The day that is 180 days after the date of distribution or transfer, or
(
2
) The day on which the acquiring corporation files its federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the distribution or transfer occurred.
(e)
Rules and procedures
—(1)
No method of accounting.
If a party to a section 381(a) transaction is not using a method of accounting, does not have a method of accounting for a particular item, or came into existence as a result of the transaction, the party will not be treated as having a method of accounting different from that used by another party to the section 381(a) transaction.
(2)
Elections and adoptions allowed.
If an election does not require the Commissioner's consent, an acquiring corporation or a distributor or transferor corporation is not precluded from making any election that is otherwise permissible for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. For purposes of this section, a corporation shall be deemed as having made any election as of the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. Similarly, where adoption is permissible, an acquiring corporation or a distributor or transferor corporation may adopt any permissible method of accounting for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer.
(3)
Elections continue after section 381(a) transaction
—(i)
General rule.
An acquiring corporation is not required to renew any election not otherwise requiring renewal and previously made by it or by a distributor or transferor corporation for a carryover method or
a principal method if the acquiring corporation uses the method after the section 381(a) transaction. If the acquiring corporation uses a method after the date of distribution or transfer, an election made by the acquiring corporation or by a distributor or transferor corporation for that method that was in effect on the date of distribution or transfer continues after the section 381(a) transaction as though the distribution or transfer had not occurred.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (e)(3):

# Example.
The acquiring corporation, X Corporation, previously elected to amortize bond premium under section 171. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. X Corporation determines under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section that X Corporation's method of amortizing bond premium is the principal method. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation is not required to renew its bond premium amortization election and is bound by it. Additionally, X Corporation would not be required to renew its election to amortize bond premium if the method were the carryover method under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(4)
Appropriate times for certain determinations
—(i)
Determining the method of accounting.
The method of accounting used by a party to a section 381(a) transaction on the date of distribution or transfer is the method of accounting used by that party as of the end of the day that is immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer.
(ii)
Determining whether there are separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer.
Whether an acquiring corporation will operate the trades or businesses of the parties to a section 381(a) transaction as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer will be determined as of the date of distribution or transfer based upon the facts and circumstances. Intent to combine books and records of the trades or businesses may be demonstrated by contemporaneous records and documents or by other objective evidence that reflects the acquiring corporation's ultimate plan of operation, even though the actual combination of the books and records may extend beyond the end of the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer.
(5)
Representative period for aggregating gross receipts.
The representative period for measuring gross receipts is generally the 12 consecutive months preceding the date of distribution or transfer. If a component trade or business was not in existence for the 12 consecutive months preceding the date of distribution or transfer, then all component trades or businesses of each integrated trade or business will compare their gross receipts for the period that such trade or business was in existence. For example, if the acquiring corporation's component trade or business was formed in August and the date of distribution or transfer occurred in December of the same year, the gross receipts for those five months will be compared with the gross receipts of the other component trades or businesses for the same period.

Establishing a method of accounting.
A method of accounting used by the distributor or transferor corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer that continues to be used by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer is an established method of accounting for purposes of section 446(e), whether or not such method is proper or is permitted under the Internal Revenue Code or any applicable Income Tax Regulations.
(7)
Other applicable provisions.
This section does not preempt any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code or the Income Tax Regulations that is applicable to the acquiring corporation's circumstances. For example, income, deductions, credits, allowances, and exclusions may be allocated among the parties to a section 381(a) transaction and other taxpayers under sections 269 and 482, if appropriate. Similarly, transfers of contracts accounted for using a long-term contract method of accounting are governed by the rules provided in § 1.460-4(k). Further, if other paragraphs of section 381(c) apply for purposes of determining the methods of accounting to be used following the date of distribution or transfer, section 381(c)(4) and this § 1.381(c)(4)-1 will not apply to the tax treatment of
the items. For example, this section does not apply to inventories that an acquiring corporation obtains in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Instead, the rules of section 381(c)(5) govern the inventory method to be used by the acquiring corporation after the distribution or transfer. Similarly, if the acquiring corporation assumes an obligation of the distributor or transferor corporation that gives rise to a liability after the date of distribution or transfer and to which § 1.381(c)(16)-1 applies, the deductibility of the item is determined under this section only after the rules of section 381(c)(16) are applied.
(8)
Character of items of income and deduction.
After the date of distribution or transfer, items of income and deduction have the same character in the hands of the acquiring corporation as they would have had in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation if no distribution or transfer had occurred.
(9)
Method of accounting selected by project or job.
If other sections of the Internal Revenue Code, Income Tax Regulations, or other administrative guidance permit an acquiring corporation to elect a method of accounting on a project-by-project, job-by-job, or other similar basis, then for purposes of this section the method elected with respect to each project or job is the established method only for that project or job. For example, the election under section 460 to classify a contract to perform both manufacturing and construction activities as a long-term construction contract if at least 95 percent of the estimated total allocable contract costs are reasonably allocated to the construction activities is made on a contract-by-contract basis. Accordingly, the method of accounting previously elected for a project or job generally continues after the date of distribution or transfer. However, if the trades or businesses of the parties to a section 381(a) transaction are not operated as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer, and two or more of the parties to the section 381(a) transaction previously worked on the same project or job and used different methods of accounting for the project or job immediately before the distribution or transfer, then the acquiring corporation must determine the principal method for that project or job under paragraph (c) of this section and make changes, if necessary, to the principal method in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(10)
Impermissible method of accounting.
This section does not limit the Commissioner's ability under section 446(b) to determine whether a taxpayer's method of accounting is an impermissible method or otherwise fails to clearly reflect income. For example, an acquiring corporation may not use the method of accounting determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the method fails to clearly reflect the acquiring corporation's income within the meaning of section 446(b).
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to corporate reorganizations and tax-free liquidations described in section 381(a) that occur on or after August 31, 2011.
[T.D. 9534, 76 FR 45675, Aug. 1, 2011, as amended by T.D. 9870, 84 FR 33692, July 15, 2019]
§ 1.381(c)(5)-1
Inventory method.
(a)
Introduction
—(1)
Purpose.
This section provides guidance regarding the inventory method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(5) apply and how to implement any associated change in method of accounting. See § 1.381(c)(4)-1 for guidance regarding the method of accounting or combination of methods (other than inventory and depreciation methods) an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(4) apply. See § 1.381(c)(6)-1 for guidance regarding the depreciation method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(6) apply.
(2)
Carryover method requirement for separate and distinct trades or businesses.
In a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, if an acquiring corporation continues to operate a trade or business of the parties to the section 381(a) transaction as a separate and distinct trade or business after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring
corporation must use a carryover method as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or the acquiring corporation changes the carryover method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The acquiring corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to continue a carryover method.
(3)
Principal method requirement for trades or businesses not operated as separate and distinct trades or businesses.
In a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, if an acquiring corporation does not operate the trades or businesses of the parties to the section 381(a) transaction as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation must use a principal method determined under paragraph (c) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or the acquiring corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The acquiring corporation must change to a principal method in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each integrated trade or business and need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use a principal method.
(4)
Carryover method or principal method not a permissible method.
If a carryover method or principal method is not a permissible inventory method, the acquiring corporation must secure the Commissioner's consent to change to a permissible inventory method as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the acquiring corporation must use a single inventory method for a particular type of goods after the date of distribution or transfer regardless of the number of separate and distinct trades or businesses operated on that date, the acquiring corporation must use the principal method for that type of goods as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under this paragraph (a)(4) or the acquiring corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
(5)
Voluntary change.
Any party to a section 381(a) transaction may request permission under section 446(e) to change an inventory method for the taxable year in which the transaction occurs or is expected to occur. For trades or businesses that will not operate as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer, a change in method of accounting for the taxable year that includes that date will be granted only if the requested inventory method is the method that the acquiring corporation must use after the date of distribution or transfer. The time and manner of obtaining the Commissioner's consent to change to a different inventory method is described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a). Unless otherwise noted, the carryover method is a permissible inventory method.
(i)
Example (1).
Carryover method for separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer.
(A)
Facts.
X Corporation manufactures radios and television sets. X Corporation uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuing its inventories, and capitalizes inventory costs in accordance with section 263A. T Corporation manufactures washing machines and dryers. T Corporation uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuing its inventories, and capitalizes inventory costs under section 263A using methods other than those used by X Corporation. X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates its radio and television manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from its washing machines and dryers manufacturing business.
(B)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates its manufacturing businesses as separate and distinct trades or businesses, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must use the carryover methods for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the carryover methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. As defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the carryover methods for the radios and television sets manufacturing business are the FIFO method, the cost basis of valuation, and X Corporation's methods of accounting for section 263A costs immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The carryover methods for the washing machines and dryers manufacturing business are the LIFO method, the cost basis of valuation, and T Corporation's methods of accounting for section 263A costs immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use any carryover method.
(ii)
Example (2).
Carryover method not permissible.
(A)
Facts.
X Corporation manufactures food and beverages and uses the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuing its inventories, and capitalizes costs in accordance with section 263A. T Corporation sells sporting equipment. T Corporation uses the FIFO method of inventory identification and the cost method of valuing its inventories. T Corporation does not capitalize costs under section 263A because it meets the small business taxpayer exception under section 263A. X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates the food and beverages business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the sporting equipment business, and X Corporation does not qualify for the small business taxpayer exception under section 263A for its sporting equipment business.
(B)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates the food and beverages business as a separate and distinct trade or business, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must use the carryover methods for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the carryover methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. As defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the carryover methods for the food and beverages business are the FIFO method, the cost basis of valuation, and X Corporation's methods of capitalizing costs under section 263A immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The carryover methods for the sporting equipment business are the FIFO method and the cost basis of valuation. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use any carryover method. However, because X Corporation does not qualify for the small business taxpayer exception under section 263A for its sporting equipment business, X Corporation's method of not capitalizing additional section 263A costs is an impermissible carryover method under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. X Corporation must secure the Commissioner's consent to change to a permissible method of capitalizing costs under section 263A for the sporting equipment business as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(b)

(14)
Section 481(a) adjustment.
The section 481(a) adjustment means an adjustment that must be taken into account as required under section 481(a) to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted when the taxable income of an acquiring corporation is computed under a method of accounting different from the method used to compute taxable income for the preceding taxable year.
(15)
Cut-off basis.
A cut-off basis means a manner in which a change in method of accounting is made without a section 481(a) adjustment and under which only the items arising after the beginning of the year of change (or, in the case of a change made under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, after the date of distribution or transfer) are accounted for under the new method of accounting. When it implements the change on a cut-off basis, a taxpayer using the LIFO inventory method to identify its inventory goods that makes a change in method of accounting within the LIFO inventory method from one LIFO method or sub-method to another LIFO method or sub-method uses the new LIFO inventory method to determine its current-year cost and base-year cost of ending inventories for the year of change, but does not recompute the cost of beginning inventories for the year of change using the new LIFO inventory method.
(16)

Component trade or business.
A component trade or business is a trade or business of a party to the section 381(a) transaction that will be combined and integrated with a trade or business of the other party to the section 381 transaction. See paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this section for the determination of whether a trade or business is operated as a separate and distinct trade or business after the date of distribution or transfer.
(c)
Principal method
—(1)
In general.
For each integrated trade or business, the principal method for a particular type of goods is generally the inventory method used by the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer for that type of goods. If, however, on the date of distribution or transfer the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation holds more inventory of a type of goods than the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation, the principal method for such goods is the inventory method used by the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation immediately prior to that date. For each integrated trade or business, the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation holds more inventory if, for a particular type of goods, the aggregate of the fair market value of the goods held by each component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation exceeds the aggregate of the fair market value of the goods held by each component trade or business of the acquiring corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. Alternatively, as a simplifying convention, the acquiring corporation may elect to apply the preceding sentence to the aggregate fair market value of the entire inventories, held by each component trade or business of the acquiring corporation and each component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation, that will be integrated after the date of distribution or transfer. If the component trade or business with the larger aggregate fair market value of the entire inventories does not have an inventory method for a particular type of goods immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, the principal method for that type of goods is the inventory method used by the component trade or business that does have an inventory method for that type of goods.
(2)
Multiple component trades or businesses with different principal methods.
If a party to the section 381(a) transaction has multiple component trades or businesses and more than one principal inventory method for a particular type of goods, then the acquiring corporation may choose which of the inventory methods used by such component trades or businesses will be the principal method of the integrated trade or business. The acquiring corporation must choose a principal method that is a permissible method of accounting. In general, a change to a principal method in a transaction to which section 381(a) and paragraph (a)(3) of this section apply is made under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c). Unless otherwise noted, the principal method is a permissible inventory method.

# Example (1). Principal methods are the methods used by the acquiring corporation.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation and T Corporation each manufacture tennis equipment. X Corporation's manufacturing business uses the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuing inventories, and allocates indirect costs to the property produced using the burden rate method provided in § 1.263A-1(f)(3)(i). T Corporation's manufacturing business uses the LIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuing its inventories, and allocates indirect costs to the property it produces using the standard cost method provided in § 1.263A-1(f)(3)(ii). X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. The fair market value of each particular type of goods held by X Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceeds the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by T Corporation's manufacturing business on that date. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's manufacturing business.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will
not operate its manufacturing business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use the principal methods under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The fair market value of each particular type of goods held by T Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer does not exceed the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by X Corporation's manufacturing business on that date. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's manufacturing business does not hold more inventory than X Corporation's manufacturing business, the principal methods are the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuation, and X Corporation's method of allocating indirect costs under section 263A using the burden rate method. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use these methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods for the manufacturing business acquired from T Corporation to the principal methods.

# Example (2). Principal methods are the methods used by the acquiring corporation.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(1), except that the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by X Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer is identical to the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by T Corporation's manufacturing business on that date.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The result is the same as in
Example
(1). The principal methods are the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuation, and X Corporation's method of allocating indirect costs under section 263A using the burden rate method. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods for the manufacturing business acquired from T Corporation to the principal methods.

# Example (3). Principal methods are the methods used by the distributor or transferor corporation.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(1), except that the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by T Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceeds the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by X Corporation's manufacturing business on that date.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its manufacturing business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use the principal methods under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The fair market value of each particular type of goods held by T Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceeds the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by X Corporation's manufacturing business on that date. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's manufacturing business holds more inventory than X Corporation's manufacturing business, the principal methods are the LIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuation, and T Corporation's method of allocating indirect costs under section 263A using the standard cost method. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods for the manufacturing business operated by X Corporation prior to the date of distribution or transfer to the principal methods.

# Example (4). Voluntary change allowable.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(1), except that T Corporation wants to discontinue using the LIFO method for its manufacturing business and change to the FIFO method for the taxable year in which the section 381(a) transaction occurs or is expected to occur.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the Commissioner will grant a request to change a method of accounting for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer only if the requested method is the method that the acquiring corporation must use after the date of distribution or transfer. The Commissioner will consent to a request by T Corporation to change to the FIFO method for the taxable year in which the section 381(a) transaction occurs or is expected to occur because X Corporation will use this method after the date of distribution or transfer.

# Example (5). Principal method determination when larger component trade or business does not have a method of accounting for a particular type of goods.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(1), except that T Corporation's manufacturing business has a particular type of goods that is not held by X Corporation's manufacturing business.
(ii)
Conclusion.
The result is similar to
Example
(1). In general, the principal methods are the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuation, and X Corporation's method of allocating indirect
costs to the property produced using the burden rate method. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods for the manufacturing business acquired from T Corporation to the principal methods. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the principal methods for the particular type of goods held only by T Corporation's manufacturing business are the LIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuation, and T Corporation's method of allocating indirect costs to the property it produces using the standard cost method. X Corporation must determine whether the principal methods for the type of goods previously held by T Corporation are permissible given that such methods are different than the principal methods that must be used by X for all other goods. If X Corporation's use of the standard cost method would be impermissible after the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation must change to a permissible method under section 263A for those goods in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

# Example (6). Inventory convention elected.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation manufactures planes and T Corporation manufactures planes and communications satellites. X Corporation's manufacturing business uses the FIFO method of inventory identification and values its inventories at cost or market, whichever is lower, while T Corporation's manufacturing business uses the LIFO method of inventory identification and values its inventories at cost. X Corporation's manufacturing business and T Corporation's manufacturing business use the same methods to capitalize costs under section 263A. X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. In lieu of determining the fair market value of each particular type of goods held on the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation elects to value the entire inventories of its manufacturing business and the entire inventories of T Corporation's manufacturing business in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The fair market value of the inventory held by T Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer does not exceed the fair market value of the inventory held by X Corporation's manufacturing business on that date. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's manufacturing business.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its manufacturing business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use the principal methods under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The fair market value of the entire inventory held by T Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer does not exceed the fair market value of the entire inventory of X Corporation's manufacturing business on that date. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's manufacturing business does not hold more inventory than X Corporation's manufacturing business, the principal methods are the FIFO method, the cost or market, whichever is lower, method of valuation, and X Corporation's method of capitalizing costs under section 263A on the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods for the manufacturing business acquired from T Corporation to the principal methods.

# Example (7). Principal method determination with a combined trade or business and a separate and distinct trade or business.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation manufactures tennis equipment in a trade or business that is separate and distinct from its trade or business of manufacturing golf equipment. X Corporation uses the FIFO method of inventory identification for its tennis equipment and the LIFO method of inventory identification for its golf equipment. X Corporation values the goods in both inventories at cost and allocates indirect costs to the property produced using the burden rate method provided in § 1.263A-1(f)(3)(i). T Corporation manufactures tennis equipment. T Corporation's manufacturing business uses the FIFO method of inventory identification, values inventories at cost, and allocates indirect costs to the property it produces using the standard cost method provided in § 1.263A-1(f)(3)(ii). X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, the fair market value of T Corporation's inventories in the tennis equipment manufacturing business exceeds the fair market value of the inventories held by X Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its tennis equipment manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business, but X Corporation will operate its golf equipment manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the tennis equipment manufacturing business.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its tennis equipment manufacturing business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use the principal methods under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, X Corporation elects to compare the fair market values of the entire inventories of the component trades or businesses on the date of distribution or transfer to determine whether T Corporation holds more inventory than X Corporation. The fair market value of the inventory held by T Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business exceeds the fair market value of the tennis equipment held by X Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business holds more inventory than X Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business, the principal methods for the combined tennis equipment business are the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost basis of valuation, and T Corporation's methods of allocating indirect costs under section 263A using the standard cost method provided in § 1.263A-1(f)(3)(ii). X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the methods of accounting for its tennis equipment manufacturing business to the principal methods. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, because X Corporation will operate the golf equipment manufacturing business as a separate trade or business, for the inventories held by the golf equipment manufacturing business X Corporation must continue to use the LIFO method of inventory identification, use the cost basis of valuation, and allocate indirect costs under section 263A using the burden rate method provided in § 1.263A-1(f)(3)(i). There are no changes in method of accounting for the golf manufacturing business, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use these carryover methods.

# Example (8). Principal method determination with multiple component trades or businesses.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example
(7), except that after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate the golf equipment manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the tennis equipment manufacturing business. In addition, the fair market value of the inventories of X Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business and golf equipment manufacturing business, in the aggregate, exceed the fair market value of the inventories of T Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business.
(ii)
Conclusion.
Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business does not hold more inventory than X Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business and golf equipment manufacturing business, in the aggregate, the principal method for identifying inventory is the method used by X Corporation's component trade or business on the date of distribution or transfer. However, because on the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates two separate and distinct trades or businesses with different inventory identification methods that will be combined after the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation may choose under paragraph (c)(2) of this section which method used by its component trades or businesses will be the principal method. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation may use either the FIFO method of inventory identification used by the tennis equipment manufacturing business or the LIFO method of inventory identification used by the golf equipment manufacturing business as the principal method of identification, if either method is a permissible method. For the integrated trade or business, X Corporation will use the cost method of valuation and allocate indirect costs under section 263A using the burden rate method provided in § 1.263A-1(f)(3)(i). In accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods of T Corporation's manufacturing business to the principal methods. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, X Corporation also must change either its golf equipment manufacturing business or its tennis equipment manufacturing business, depending on which principal method X Corporation selects, to the principal method.
(d)
Procedures for changing a method of accounting
—(1)
Change made to principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section
—(i)
Section 481(a) adjustment
—(A)
In general.
An acquiring corporation that changes its method of accounting or the distributor or transferor corporation's method of accounting under paragraph (a)(3) of this section does not need to secure the Commissioner's consent to use a principal method. To the extent the use of a principal method constitutes a change in method of accounting, the change in method is
treated as a change initiated by the acquiring corporation for purposes of section 481(a)(2). Any change to a principal method, whether the change relates to a trade or business of the acquiring corporation or a trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation, must be reflected on the acquiring corporation's federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. The amount of the section 481(a) adjustment and the adjustment period, if any, necessary to implement a change to the principal method are determined under § 1.446-1(e) and the applicable administrative procedures that govern voluntary changes in methods of accounting under section 446(e). If the Internal Revenue Code, the Income Tax Regulations, or administrative procedures require that a method of accounting be implemented on a cut-off basis, the acquiring corporation must implement the change, on a cut-off basis as of the date of distribution or transfer, on its federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. If the Internal Revenue Code, the Income Tax Regulations, or administrative procedures require a section 481(a) adjustment, the acquiring corporation must determine the section 481(a) adjustment and include the appropriate amount of the section 481(a) adjustment on its federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer and subsequent taxable year(s), as necessary. This adjustment is determined by the acquiring corporation as of the beginning of the day that is immediately after the date of distribution or transfer.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (d)(1)(i):

# Example.
X Corporation uses the FIFO method of inventory identification, and T Corporation uses the LIFO method of inventory identification. X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. X Corporation determines that under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory method for the business acquired from T Corporation to the FIFO method. X Corporation will determine the section 481(a) adjustment pertaining to the change to the FIFO method (whether the amounts thereof represent increases or decreases in income) as of the beginning of the day that immediately follows the day on which X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation. X Corporation will reflect this adjustment, or an appropriate part thereof, on its federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer.
(ii)
Audit protection.
Notwithstanding any other provision in any other Income Tax Regulation or administrative procedure, no audit protection is provided for any change in method of accounting under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Other terms and conditions.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, other terms and conditions provided in § 1.446-1(e) and the applicable administrative procedures for voluntary changes in method of accounting under section 446(e) apply to a change in method of accounting under this section. Thus, for example, if the administrative procedures for a particular change in method of accounting have a term and condition that provides for the acceleration of the section 481(a) adjustment period, this term and condition applies to a change made under this paragraph (d)(1). However, any scope limitation in the applicable administrative procedures will not apply for purposes of making a change under this paragraph (d)(1). For example, if the administrative procedures provide as a limitation that an identical change in method of accounting is barred for a period of years, this limitation will not bar a change to the principal method made under this section.
(2)
Change made to a method of accounting under paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section
—(i)
In general.
A party to a section 381(a) transaction that changes a method of accounting under either paragraph (a)(4) or paragraph (a)(5) of this section must follow the provisions of § 1.446-(1)(e) and the applicable administrative procedures, including scope limitations, for voluntary changes in method of accounting under section 446(e), except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section. An application on Form 3115, “Application for Change in Accounting Method,” filed
with the IRS to change a method of accounting under this paragraph (d)(2) should be labeled “Filed under section 381(c)(5)” at the top.
(ii)
Final year limitation.
Any scope limitation relating to the final year of a trade or business will not apply to a taxpayer that changes its method of accounting in the final year of a trade or business that is terminated as the result of a section 381(a) transaction.
(iii)
Time to file.
Under the authority of § 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii), for a change in method of accounting requiring advance consent, the application for a change in method of accounting (for example, Form 3115), must be filed with the IRS on or before the later of—
(A) The due date for filing a Form 3115 as specified in § 1.446-1(e), for example, the last day of the taxable year in which the distribution or transfer occurred, or
(B) The earlier of—
(
1
) The day that is 180 days after the date of distribution or transfer, or
(
2
) The day on which the acquiring corporation files its federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the distribution or transfer occurred.
(e)
Rules and procedures
—(1)
Inventory method selected for a particular type of goods.
If other sections of the Internal Revenue Code or Income Tax Regulations allow a taxpayer to elect an inventory method for a particular type of goods, the method elected with respect to those goods is the established inventory method only for those goods. For example, an election to use the LIFO inventory method to identify specified goods in inventory, such as certain products in finished goods, is the inventory method only for those products.
(2)
No method of accounting.
If a party to a section 381(a) transaction is not using an inventory method, does not have an inventory method for a particular type of goods, or came into existence as a result of the transaction, the party will not be treated as having an inventory method different from that used by another party to the section 381(a) transaction.
(3)
Elections and adoptions allowed.
If an election does not require the Commissioner's consent, an acquiring corporation or a distributor or transferor corporation is not precluded from making any election that is otherwise permissible for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. For example, an acquiring corporation may elect to identify its inventory using the LIFO inventory method in the year of the distribution or transfer. For purposes of this section, a corporation shall be deemed as having made any election as of the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. Similarly, where adoption is permissible, an acquiring corporation or a distributor or transferor corporation may adopt any permissible method of accounting for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer.
(4)
Elections continue after section 381(a) transaction
—(i)
General rule.
An acquiring corporation is not required to renew any election not requiring renewal and previously made by it or by a distributor or transferor corporation for a carryover method or a principal method if the acquiring corporation uses the method after the section 381(a) transaction. If the acquiring corporation uses a method after the date of distribution or transfer, an election made by the acquiring corporation or by a distributor or transferor corporation for that method that was in effect on the date of distribution or transfer continues after the section 381(a) transaction as though the distribution or transfer had not occurred.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (e)(4):

# Example.
Since its incorporation in 1982, X Corporation elected to use the LIFO inventory method under section 472 to identify its inventory of tennis balls. Since its incorporation in 2002, T Corporation elected to use the FIFO inventory method to identify its inventory of tennis balls. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, the fair market value of X Corporation's inventory in its tennis balls exceeds the fair market value of the tennis balls inventory held by T Corporation. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's business. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation does not hold more inventory than X Corporation, the principal method for
identifying inventory is the method used by X Corporation on the date of distribution or transfer. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation need not renew its election to identify inventory using the LIFO inventory method, and X Corporation is bound by the election.
(5)
Adopting the LIFO inventory method.
A party to a section 381(a) transaction will be deemed to be using the LIFO inventory method for a particular type of goods on the date of distribution or transfer if that party elects under section 472 to adopt that inventory method with respect to those goods for its taxable year within which the date of distribution or transfer occurs. See section 472 for the requirements to adopt the LIFO inventory method.
(6)
Inventory layers treatment
—(i)
Adjustments required after a section 381(a) transaction.
An acquiring corporation that determines the principal method of taking an inventory after a section 381(a) transaction under paragraphs (a)(3) and (c) of this section after the date of distribution or transfer may need to integrate inventories and make appropriate adjustments as provided in paragraphs (e)(6)(ii) and (e)(6)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
LIFO inventory method used after the section 381(a) transaction
—(A)
LIFO inventory method used by the acquiring corporation and the distributor or transferor corporation
—(
1
)
Principal method is the dollar-value LIFO method.
If, under paragraphs (a)(3) and (c) of this section, the acquiring corporation changes its inventory method or the inventory method of the distributor or transferor corporation from the specific goods LIFO method of pricing inventories to the dollar-value LIFO method of pricing inventories (dollar-value LIFO method) for a particular type of goods, the inventory accounted for under the specific goods method shall be placed on the dollar-value method as provided in § 1.472-8(f), and then the inventory shall be integrated with the inventory previously accounted for under the dollar-value LIFO method. If pools of each corporation are permitted or required to be combined, the pools must be combined as provided in § 1.472-8(g)(2). For purposes of combining pools, all base year inventories or layers of increment that occur in taxable years including the same December 31 shall be combined. A base year inventory or layer of increment occurring in any short taxable year of a distributor or transferor corporation shall be merged with and considered a layer of increment of its immediately preceding taxable year.
(
2
)
Principal method is the specific goods LIFO method.
If, under paragraphs (a)(3) and (c) of this section, the acquiring corporation changes its inventory method or the inventory method of the distributor or transferor corporation from the dollar-value LIFO method of pricing inventories to the specific goods LIFO method of pricing inventories, the acquiring corporation shall treat the inventory being changed to the specific goods LIFO method as having the same acquisition dates and costs as such inventory had under the dollar-value LIFO method.
(B)
Change from the FIFO inventory method to either the specific goods LIFO method or the dollar-value LIFO method.
If, under paragraphs (a)(3) and (c) of this section, the acquiring corporation changes its inventory method or the inventory method of the distributor or transferor corporation from the FIFO inventory method to either the specific goods LIFO method or the dollar-value method of pricing LIFO inventories, the inventory accounted for under the FIFO inventory method shall be treated by the acquiring corporation as having been acquired at their average unit cost in a single transaction on the date of the distribution or transfer. Thus, if an inventory of a particular type of goods is combined in an existing dollar-value pool, the goods shall be treated as if they were purchased by the acquiring corporation at the average unit cost on the date of the distribution or transfer with respect to such pool. Alternatively, if the goods are not combined in an existing pool, the goods will be treated as if they were purchased by the acquiring corporation at the average unit cost on the date of the distribution or transfer with respect to a new pool, with the base-year being the year of the section 381(a) transaction. Adjustments resulting from a restoration to cost of any write-down to market value of the inventories
shall be taken into account by the acquiring corporation ratably in each of the three taxable years beginning with the taxable year that includes the date of the distribution or transfer. See section 472(d).
(iii)
FIFO inventory method used after the section 381(a) transaction
—(A)
FIFO inventory method used by the acquiring corporation and the distributor or transferor corporation.
If, under paragraphs (a)(3) and (c) of this section, the FIFO inventory method is the principal method and the component trades or businesses of both the acquiring corporation and the distributor or transferor corporation use the FIFO method immediately prior to the distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation must treat the inventory that must change to the principal method as having the same acquisition dates and costs as such inventory had immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. However, if the principal method of valuing inventories is the cost or market, whichever is lower, method, the acquiring corporation must treat the inventories that must change to the principal method as having been acquired at cost or market, whichever is lower.
(B)
Change from either the specific goods LIFO method or the dollar-value LIFO method to the FIFO inventory method.
If, under paragraphs (a)(3) and (c) of this section, the acquiring corporation changes its inventory method or the inventory method of the distributor or transferor corporation from either the specific goods LIFO method or the dollar-value LIFO method to the FIFO inventory method, the acquiring corporation must treat the inventory accounted for under the LIFO method as having the same acquisition dates and costs that the inventory would have had if the FIFO inventory method had been used on the date of distribution or transfer. However, if the principal method of valuing inventories is the cost or market, whichever is lower, method, the acquiring corporation must treat the inventories accounted for under the LIFO method as having been acquired at cost or market, whichever is lower.
(7)
Appropriate times for certain determinations
—(i)
Determining the inventory method.
The inventory method used by a party to a section 381(a) transaction on the date of distribution or transfer is the method used by that party as of the end of the day that is immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer.
(ii)
Determining whether there are separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer.
Whether an acquiring corporation will operate the trades or businesses of the parties to a section 381(a) transaction as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer will be determined as of the date of distribution or transfer based upon the facts and circumstances. Intent to combine books and records of the trades or businesses may be demonstrated by contemporaneous records and documents or by other objective evidence that reflects the acquiring corporation's ultimate plan of operation, even though the actual combination of the books and records may extend beyond the end of the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer.
(8)
Establishing an inventory method.
An inventory method used by the distributor or transferor corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer that continues to be used by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer is an established method of accounting for purposes of section 446(e), whether or not such method is proper or is permitted under the Internal Revenue Code or any applicable Income Tax Regulations.
(9)
Other applicable provisions.
This section does not preempt any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code or the Income Tax Regulations that is applicable to the acquiring corporation's circumstances. Section 381(c)(5) and this § 1.381(c)(5)-1 determine only the inventory method to be used after a section 381(a) transaction. If other paragraphs of section 381(c) apply for purposes of determining the methods of accounting to be used following the date of distribution or transfer, section 381(c)(5) and this § 1.381(c)(5)-1 will not apply to the tax treatment of the items. Specifically, section 381(c)(5) and this § 1.381(c)(5)-1 do not apply to
assets other than inventory that an acquiring corporation obtains in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies.
(10)
Use of the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting.
If immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, an acquiring corporation or a distributor or transferor corporation uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting within the meaning of section 446(c)(1) and § 1.446-1(c)(1)(i), or is not required to use an inventory method for its goods, section 381(c)(5) and § 1.381(c)(5)-1 do not apply. Instead, section 381(c)(4) and § 1.381(c)(4)-1 must be applied to determine the methods of accounting that continue after the transaction.
(11)
Character of items of income and deduction.
After the date of distribution or transfer, items of income and deduction have the same character in the hands of the acquiring corporation as they would have had in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation if no distribution or transfer had occurred.
(12)
Impermissible inventory method.
This section does not limit the Commissioner's ability under section 446(b) to determine whether a taxpayer's inventory method is an impermissible method or otherwise fails to clearly reflect income. For example, an acquiring corporation may not use the method of accounting determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the method fails to clearly reflect the acquiring corporation's income within the meaning of section 446(b).
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to corporate reorganizations and tax-free liquidations described in section 381(a) that occur on or after August 31, 2011. The designations of paragraphs (a)(6)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section and removal of the term “small reseller” and replacement with the term “small business taxpayer” apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 5, 2021.
[T.D. 9534, 76 FR 45682, Aug. 1, 2011; 76 FR 53820, Aug. 30, 2011; T.D. 9942, 86 FR 268, Jan. 5, 2021]
§ 1.381(c)(6)-1
Depreciation method.
(a)
Carryover requirement
—(1)
Distributions in taxable years ending before July 25, 1969.
(i) Section 381(c)(6) provides that if, in a transaction in a taxable year which ends before July 25, 1969, to which section 381(a) applies, an acquiring corporation acquires depreciable property from a distributor or transferor corporation which computes its allowance for the depreciation of the property under section 167(b)(2), (3), or (4), the acquiring corporation shall compute its depreciation allowance by the same method used by the distributor or transferor corporation with respect to such property. Thus, if the distributor or transferor corporation used the sum of the years-digits method under section 167(b)(3) with respect to an asset distributed or transferred to an acquiring corporation, the acquiring corporation will be required to use the sum of the years-digits method with respect to such asset acquired. The computation of the depreciation allowance with respect to the property acquired shall be made under the provisions of section 167 and the regulations thereunder.
(ii) The rules provided in section 381(c)(6) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph will apply only with respect to that part or all of the basis of the property in the hands of the acquiring corporation immediately after the date of distribution or transfer as does not exceed the basis of the property in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation on the date of the distribution or transfer. For this purpose, the basis of the property in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation shall be the adjusted basis provided in section 1011 for the purpose of determining gain on the sale or other disposition of such property. For provisions defining the date of distribution or transfer see § 1.381(b)-1(b).
(2)
Distributions in taxable years ending after July 24, 1969.
(i) Section 381(c)(6) provides that if, in a transaction in a taxable year ending after July 24, 1969, to which section 381(a) applies, an acquiring corporation acquires depreciable property from a distributor or transferor corporation which computes its allowances for the depreciation of the property under subsection (b), (j), or (k) of section 167, the acquiring corporation shall compute its depreciation allowance by the same method used by
the distributor or transferor corporation with respect to such property. Thus, if the distributor or transferor corporation used the straight line method under section 167(b)(1) with respect to an asset distributed or transferred to an acquiring corporation, the acquiring corporation will be required to use the straight line method with respect to such asset. Similarly, if the distributor or transferor corporation elected to compute depreciation under section 167(k) with respect to property attributable to rehabilitation expenditures, and such property is transferred to an acquiring corporation, the acquiring corporation will be required to compute depreciation under section 167(k) with respect to the property acquired. The computation of the depreciation allowance with respect to the property acquired shall be made under the provisions of section 167 and the regulations thereunder.
(ii) The rules provided in section 381(c)(6) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall apply only with respect to that part or all of the basis of the property in the hands of the acquiring corporation immediately after the date of distribution or transfer as does not exceed the basis of the property in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation on the date of the distribution or transfer. For this purpose, the basis of the property in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation shall be the adjusted basis provided in section 1011 for the purpose of determining gain on the sale or other disposition of such property. For provisions defining the date of distribution or transfer see § 1.38(b)-1(b).
(b)
Portion in excess of distributor or transferor corporation's basis
—(1)
General rule.
With respect to that part of the basis of the depreciable property (other than certain section 1250 property described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) which in the hands of the acquiring corporation exceeds the adjusted basis to the distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation may use any reasonable method of computing depreciation, other than the methods provided in section 167(b)(2), (3), or (4). See paragraph (b) of § 1.167(b)-0 for methods which are acceptable under section 167(a) with respect to such property. See also sections 334(b)(1) and 362(b) for the determination of basis of property in the hands of the acquiring corporation in connection with a transaction to which section 381(a) applies.
(2)
Section 1250 property.
With respect to that part of the basis of section 1250 property acquired after July 24, 1969, which in the hands of the acquiring corporation exceeds the adjusted basis to the distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation shall be subject to the limitations contained in section 167(j)(4) (relating to used section 1250 property) or 167(j)(5) (relating to used residential rental property). Thus, for example, if section 1250 property which is not residential rental property is acquired in a section 381(a) transaction after July 24, 1969, the straight line method of depreciation (or other method allowable under section 167(j)(4)(B)) is the only acceptable method with respect to that portion of the basis of the property which, in the hands of the acquiring corporation, exceeds the adjusted basis to the transferor or distributor corporation.
(c)
Records required.
Records shall be maintained in sufficient detail to identify any depreciable property to which this section applies, and to establish the basis thereof.
(d)
Agreement under section 167(d).
To the extent not inconsistent with paragraph (b) of this section, an acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation in the case of an agreement between the distributor or transferor corporation and the district director under section 167(d) and § 1.167(d)-1 with respect to property to which section 381(c)(6) and this section apply. Thus, in the case where the basis of an asset in the hands of an acquiring corporation exceeds the basis of such asset in the hands of the distributor or the transferor corporation, such an agreement will not have the effect of permitting the acquiring corporation to compute its depreciation allowance with respect to such excess basis under the methods provided in section 167(b)(2), (3), or (4). However, the provisions of the agreement will continue to apply with respect to the useful life of the asset.
(e)
Change of method of depreciation.
Although the acquiring corporation is required to use the method of computing depreciation used by the distributor or transferor with respect to depreciable property to which this section applies, such acquiring corporation may use another method with respect to such property if consent of the Commissioner is obtained in accordance with paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1. Further, subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of § 1.167(e)-1 the acquiring corporation may change from the declining balance method described in section 167(b)(2) to the straight line method without consent of the Commissioner.
(f)
Successive transactions to which
section 381(a) applies. The provisions of this section shall apply in the case of successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies. Thus, for example, if X Corporation, a transferor corporation, used the sum of the years-digits method under section 167(b)(3) with respect to an asset transferred to Y Corporation, an acquiring corporation, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, and subsequently Y Corporation, using the same method, transfers such asset to Z Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) also applies, then Z Corporation shall be required to use the sum of the years-digits method with respect to such asset.
(g)
Illustration.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
M and N Corporations compute their taxable incomes on the basis of the calendar year. On December 31, 1959, M Corporation transfers all of its assets to N Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Included among these assets is an item of depreciable property which on that date has an adjusted basis (for determining gain) of $800,000 after M Corporation takes into account for 1959 its allowance for depreciation under section 167(b)(2). The basis attributable to the asset under section 362(b) is determined to be $900,000 in the hands of N Corporation. Under the provisions of section 381(c)(6) and paragraph (a) of this section, N Corporation is required to compute its allowance for the depreciation of the asset under section 167(b)(2) for 1960 and subsequent years but only in respect of $800,000 of its basis. N Corporation may use any reasonable method other than the methods provided in section 167(b)(2), (3), or (4) in computing its depreciation allowance of the remaining $100,000.
[T.D. 6559, 26 FR 2983, Apr. 7, 1961, as amended by T.D. 7166, 37 FR 5246, Mar. 11, 1972; 37 FR 6400, Mar. 29, 1972]
§ 1.381(c)(8)-1
Installment method.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
(1) Section 381(c)(8) provides that if, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, an acquiring corporation acquires installment obligations, the income from which the distributor or transferor corporation has elected under section 453 and the regulations thereunder to report on the installment method, then the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation would have been treated under section 453 had it not transferred the installment obligations. Thus, if the distributor or transferor corporation had properly elected to return income from the sale or other disposition of property giving rise to the obligations on the installment method, then the acquiring corporation shall be required to return the income from all such installment obligations in the same manner and to the same extent as the distributor or transferor corporation, unless consent of the Commissioner to use another method is obtained in accordance with paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1. Amounts received by the acquiring corporation on or after the date of distribution or transfer with respect to an installment sale made by the distributor or transferor corporation will not be taken into account in applying the limitation under section 453(b)(2) with respect to the amount of payments received in the year of sale or other disposition.
(2) Section 381(c)(8) and this section have no application to sales or other dispositions of property made by the acquiring corporation on or after the date of distribution or transfer. For provisions defining the date of distribution or transfer, see § 1.381(b)-1(b). See section 381(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to the proper method or combination of methods of accounting to be used by the acquiring corporation.
(b)
Basis of obligations.
The basis in the hands of an acquiring corporation of installment obligations described in
section 381(c)(8) and paragraph (a) of this section shall be the same as in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation.
(c)
Repossession of property sold in prior years.
If the acquiring corporation repossesses property, previously sold by the distributor or transferor corporation, by reason of default by the purchaser in payment of the acquired installment obligations, then the acquiring corporation shall be treated as though it were the vendor corporation for purposes of determining, under section 453 and the regulations thereunder, the gain, loss, income, or deduction with respect to the property repossessed.
[T.D. 6559, 26 FR 2983, Apr. 7, 1961]
§ 1.381(c)(9)-1
Amortization of bond discount or premium.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
If, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation assumes liability for the payment of bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation which were issued at a discount or premium, then under the provisions of section 381(c)(9) the acquiring corporation is to be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation after the date of distribution or transfer for purposes of determining the amount of amortization allowable, or includible, with respect to such discount or premium in computing taxable income. Thus, if subsequent to February 28, 1913, a distributor or transferor corporation issues bonds at a premium and the liability for them is assumed by the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the net amount of the premium is income which should be prorated or amortized over the life of the bonds, including the period during which the acquiring corporation is liable upon the obligations assumed. On the other hand, if a distributor or transferor corporation issues bonds at a discount and the liability for them is assumed by the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the net amount of the discount is deductible in computing taxable income but should be prorated or amortized over the life of the bonds, including the period during which the acquiring corporation is liable upon the obligations assumed.
(b)
Expense incurred upon issuance of bonds.
If, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation assumes liability for bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation which were issued at a discount or premium, the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation after the date of distribution or transfer with respect to the expense incurred upon the issuance of such bonds.
(c)
Purchase of bonds.
If, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation assumes liability for bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation which were issued at a discount or premium and if the acquiring corporation subsequently purchases such bonds, then the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation for the purpose of determining the amount of any income or deduction resulting from the purchase. See paragraph (c) of § 1.61-12. For rules relating to the exchange or substitution of bonds issued by the acquiring corporation for bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Exchange of new for old bonds.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if—
(1) In a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, bonds of the acquiring corporation are exchanged or substituted for bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation which were issued at a discount or premium, or
(2) Bonds of the acquiring corporation are exchanged or substituted for bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation which were issued at a discount or premium and in respect of which the acquiring corporation has assumed the liability in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies,
then, with respect to any unamortized discount, premium, or expense of issuance attributable to such bonds of the distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation.
(e)
Bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation.
For purposes of applying
section 381(c)(9), the term
bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation
includes not only bonds issued by the distributor or transferor corporation but also bonds for which the distributor or transferor corporation has assumed liability. Thus, if the distributor or transferor corporation has assumed liability for bonds in a transaction in which any unamortized discount or premium attributable to such bonds carried over to such corporation, then the acquiring corporation assuming liability for the bonds shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation after the date of distribution or transfer for purposes of determining the amount of amortization allowable, or includible, with respect to such discount or premium. On the other hand, if the distributor or transferor corporation has assumed liability for bonds in a transaction in which any unamortized discount or premium attributable to such bonds did not carry over to such corporation, then there can be no carryover to the acquiring corporation under this section.
[T.D. 6532, 26 FR 405, Jan. 19, 1961]
§ 1.381(c)(10)-1
Deferred exploration and development expenditures.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
(1) If for any taxable year a distributor or transferor corporation has elected under section 615 or section 616 (or corresponding provisions of prior law) to defer and deduct on a ratable basis any exploration or development expenditures made in connection with any ore, mineral, mine, or other natural deposit transferred to the acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a), then under the provisions of section 381(c)(10) the acquiring corporation shall be entitled to deduct such expenditures on a ratable basis in the same manner, and to the same extent, as they would have been deductible by the distributor or transferor corporation in the absence of the distribution or transfer. For this purpose, the acquiring corporation shall be treated as though it were the distributor or transferor corporation. The principles set forth in paragraph (e) of § 1.615-3 and paragraph (f) of § 1.616-2 are applicable in computing the amount of the deduction allowable to the acquiring corporation in respect of expenditures deferred by a distributor or transferor corporation.

# Example.
X and Y Corporations are both organized on January 1, 1955, and both corporations compute their taxable income on the basis of the calendar year. During 1955, X Corporation purchases a mineral property which it begins to develop in 1956. During 1956, X Corporation incurs development expenditures of $500,000 in respect of such property which it elects to defer under section 616(b). On December 31, 1956, Y Corporation acquires all of the assets of X Corporation in a reorganization to which section 381(a) applies, no gain being recognized to X Corporation on the transfer. In 1957, Y Corporation sells 150,000 units of produced ore benefited by the development expenditures incurred and deferred by X Corporation, and the number of units remaining as of the end of 1957, plus the number of units sold during that year, is estimated to be 1,000,000. In addition to its deduction for depletion, Y Corporation is, in 1957, entitled to a deduction under sections 616(b) and 381(c)(10) of $75,000 of the development expenditures previously deferred by X Corporation, that is, $500,000 × 150,000/1,000,000.
(2) If a distributor or transferor corporation has elected under section 615 or section 616 (or corresponding provisions of prior law) to defer exploration or development expenditures in respect of a mine or other natural deposit which it subsequently disposes of except for a retained economic interest therein, such as the right to royalty income or in-ore payments, and such retained economic interest is transferred to the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the acquiring corporation shall be entitled to deduct such deferred expenditures attributable to the economic interest retained on a ratable basis to the same extent they would have been deductible by the distributor or transferor corporation in the absence of the distribution or transfer. See paragraph (c) of § 1.615-3 and paragraph (c) of § 1.616-2.
(3) For purposes of this section, the terms
exploration expenditures
and
development expenditures
shall have the same meaning as that ascribed to them in the regulations under sections 615 and 616 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or under sections 23(cc) and 23(ff) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, whichever applies. See, for example,
paragraph (a) of § 1.615-1 and paragraph (a) of § 1.616-1.
(b)
Effect and identification of election previously made.
(1) The election made by a distributor or transferor corporation under the provisions of section 615 or section 616 (or corresponding provisions of prior law) to defer exploration or development expenditures in respect of any taxable year may not be revoked by the acquiring corporation for any reason whatsoever.
(2) When filing its return for the first taxable year for which it deducts exploration or development expenditures which were deferred under section 615 or section 616 (or corresponding provisions of prior law) by a distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation shall attach thereto a statement properly identifying the taxable year for which the election to defer was made by the distributor or transferor corporation, the name of the corporation which made the election, and the district director with whom the election was filed.
(3) It is unnecessary for an acquiring corporation to renew an election to defer exploration or development expenditures which was made by a distributor or transferor corporation.
(c)
Successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies.
If, by virtue of section 381(c)(10), the acquiring corporation is entitled to deduct exploration or development expenditures deferred by a distributor or transferor corporation, then such acquiring corporation shall be deemed to have made the election to defer such expenditures for purposes of applying section 381(c)(10) to any subsequent transaction in which such acquiring corporation is a distributor or transferor corporation.
(d)
Carryover of limitation requirements.
(1) If a distributor or transferor corporation transfers any mineral property to the acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) and the acquiring corporation pays or incurs exploration expenditures in a taxable year ending after the date of the distribution or transfer, then in applying the 4-year or $400,000 limitations described in section 615(c) and paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 1.615-4, whichever is applicable, the acquiring corporation shall be deemed to have been allowed any deduction which, for any taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer, was allowed to the distributor or transferor corporation under section 615(a), or under section 23(ff)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or to have made any election which, for any such preceding year, was made by the distributor or transferor corporation under section 615(b), or under section 23(ff)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Thus, in such instance, the acquiring corporation shall take into account the years in which the distributor or transferor corporation exercised the election to deduct or defer exploration expenditures and any amounts so deducted or deferred. For this purpose, it is immaterial whether the deduction has been allowed to, or the election has been made by, the distributor or transferor corporation with respect to the specific mineral property transferred by that corporation to the acquiring corporation.
(2) Generally, for purposes of applying the 4-year limitation described in paragraph (a) of § 1.615-4, if there are two or more distributor or transferor corporations that transfer any mineral property to the acquiring corporation, each taxable year of any such corporation ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer in which exploration expenditures were deducted or deferred shall be treated as a separate taxable year regardless of the fact that the taxable years of two or more such corporations normally end on the same date. However, if the date of distribution or transfer is the same with respect to more than one distributor or transferor corporation, then the taxable years of such corporations ending on the same date of distribution or transfer shall be considered as one taxable year for purposes of applying the 4-year limitation even though more than one such corporation deducted or deferred exploration expenditures for such taxable years.
(3) For purposes of applying the $400,000 limitation described in paragraph (b) of § 1.615-4, if there are two or more distributor or transferor corporations that transfer any mineral property to the acquiring corporation, any exploration expenditures which were
deducted or treated as deferred expenses by such corporations for taxable years ending after December 31, 1950, shall be taken into account by the acquiring corporation.
(4) If a distributor or transferor corporation that transfers any mineral property to the acquiring corporation was required to take into account any taxable years or amounts of its transferor, as provided by paragraph (e) of § 1.615-4, for purposes of either the 4-year limitation described in paragraph (a) of § 1.615-4 or the $400,000 limitation described in paragraph (b) of § 1.615-4, then the acquiring corporation shall also take these taxable years and amounts into account in applying the same limitations.
(5) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
M and N Corporations were organized on January 1, 1956, and each corporation computes its taxable income on the basis of the calendar year. For each of its taxable years 1956 and 1957, M Corporation expended $60,000 for exploration expenditures and exercised the option to deduct such amounts under section 615(a). N Corporation made no exploration expenditures during its taxable years 1956 and 1957. On December 31, 1957, M Corporation transferred all of its assets to N Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, no gain being recognized to the transferor corporation on the transfer. N Corporation made exploration expenditures of $100,000, $120,000, $110,000, and $100,000 for the years 1958, 1959, 1960, and 1961, respectively, which expenditures it desired to deduct under section 615(a) to the extent allowable. On the basis of these facts, N Corporation may deduct up to $100,000 for each of the years 1958 and 1959. No deduction or deferral is allowable for 1960 since the benefits of section 615(c) were previously availed of for 4 taxable years. However, N Corporation may deduct $80,000 for 1961 (the 4-year limitation not applying to such year) but, if such deduction is made, N Corporation will not be allowed any further deductions or deferrals since the $400,000 limitation of paragraph (b) of § 1.615-4 will have been reached.

# Example 2.
R and S Corporations were organized on January 1, 1955, and each corporation computes its income on the basis of the calendar year. For the 1955 taxable year neither corporation made any exploration expenditures under section 615(a). On June 30, 1956, R Corporation transferred all its assets to S Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, no gain being recognized to the transferor corporation on the transfer. During its short taxable year ending June 30, 1956, R Corporation made exploration expenditures of $60,000 which it elected to deduct under section 615. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1956, S Corporation may deduct or defer exploration expenditures up to $100,000 since this is a separate election for purposes of utilizing section 615 and is not affected by the $60,000 previously deducted by R Corporation. Assuming S Corporation exercises an election under section 615 for its taxable year ending December 31, 1956, S Corporation may elect to apply the benefits of section 615 to exploration expenditures for two more taxable years. However, for taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960 (the 4-year limitation not applying), S Corporation is entitled under section 615 to deduct or defer exploration expenditures made in such years to the extent that the combined deductions and deferrals by R and S Corporations in prior years did not exceed $400,000.

# Example 3.
O and P Corporations were organized on January 1, 1955, and each corporation computes its taxable income on the basis of the calendar year. For their taxable years 1955, 1956, and 1957, each corporation deducted exploration expenditures made in such years under section 615(a). On June 30, 1958, O Corporation transferred all its assets to P Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, no gain being recognized to the transferor corporation on the transfer. If, during its short taxable year ending June 30, 1958, O Corporation made additional exploration expenditures, it may deduct or defer such expenditures (up to $100,000) under section 615 since O Corporation has utilized section 615 in only three previous taxable years. For its taxable years ending after June 30, 1958, and beginning before July 7, 1960, P Corporation may not deduct or defer exploration expenditures under section 615, since the benefits of that section were utilized by O and P Corporations for 4 taxable years. However, for taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960 (the 4-year limitation not applying), P is entitled under section 615 to deduct or defer exploration expenditures made in such years to the extent that the combined deductions and deferrals by O and P Corporations in prior years do not exceed $400,000. See paragraph (b) of § 1.615-4.

# Example 4.
X, Y, and Z Corporations were organized on January 1, 1955, and each corporation computes its taxable income on the basis of the calendar year. For their taxable years ending December 31, 1955, X and Y Corporations each deferred $100,000 for exploration expenditures made in such taxable years under section 615(b). Z Corporation made no exploration expenditures during its taxable year ending December 31, 1955. On
March 31, 1956, X and Y Corporations transferred all their assets to Z Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, no gain being recognized to the transferor corporations on the transfer. X and Y Corporations each made exploration expenditures of $75,000 during their short taxable years ending March 31, 1956, which they deducted under section 615(a). For purposes of taxable years beginning before July 7, 1960, Z Corporation must take into account the taxable years in which X and Y Corporations deducted or deferred exploration expenditures. In so doing, each taxable year in which exploration expenditures were deducted or deferred must be taken into account except that the taxable years of X and Y Corporations ending on March 31, 1956, shall be considered as one taxable year. Therefore, Z Corporation may deduct or defer exploration expenditures in accordance with section 615 for any one taxable year ending after March 31, 1956, and beginning before July 7, 1960. However, for taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960 (the 4-year limitation not applying), Z Corporation must take into account for purposes of the $400,000 limitation all of the $350,000 of exploration expenditures deducted or deferred by X, Y, and Z Corporations during taxable years ending after December 31, 1950. Therefore, Z Corporation, assuming it has not deducted or deferred any exploration expenditures, is entitled under section 615 to deduct or defer in taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960, up to $50,000 for exploration expenditures made in such years.

# Example 5.
For purposes of this example, assume that each taxpayer computes taxable income on the basis of the calendar year. Taxpayer A, an individual who has deducted exploration expenditures of $75,000 under section 23(ff) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for each of his taxable years 1952 and 1953, transferred a mineral property to K Corporation on January 1, 1954, in a transaction in which the basis of the mineral property in the hands of K Corporation is determined under section 362(a). For its taxable year 1954 and pursuant to section 615(a)., K Corporation deducted exploration expenditures of $100,000 which it made in such year. K Corporation had made no exploration expenditures in any preceding taxable year. On December 31, 1954, K Corporation transferred all its assets to L Corporation in a reorganization to which section 381(a) applies, no gain being recognized to the transferor corporation on the transfer. Assuming that L Corporation has not deducted or deferred exploration expenditures in any preceding taxable year, L Corporation may deduct or defer exploration expenditures (up to $100,000) in accordance with section 615 for any one taxable year ending after December 31, 1954, and beginning before July 7, 1960, in view of the 4-year limitation. However, if L Corporation does not deduct or defer exploration expenditures in that period, then for taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960 (the 4-year limitation not applying), L Corporation is entitled to deduct or defer up to $150,000 (but not to exceed $100,000 per year) for exploration expenditures made in such years. See paragraph (b) of § 1.615-4.
[T.D. 6552, 26 FR 1988, Mar. 8, 1961, as amended by T.D. 6685, 28 FR 11406, Oct. 24, 1963]
§ 1.381(c)(11)-1
Contributions to pension plan, employees' annuity plans, and stock bonus and profit-sharing plans.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
Section 381(c)(11) provides that, for purposes of determining amounts deductible under section 404 for any taxable year, the acquiring corporation shall be considered after the date of distribution or transfer to be the distributor or transferor corporation in respect of any pension, annuity, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plan.
(b)
Nature of carryover.
(1) Primarily, section 381(c)(11) and this section apply to the amount of any unused deductions or excess contributions carryovers which, in the absence of the transaction causing section 381 to apply, would have been available to the distributor or transferor corporation under section 404. Thus, for example, this section applies to unused deductions under a profit-sharing or stock bonus trust which, in accordance with the second sentence of section 404(a)(3)(A), would have been available in succeeding taxable years to the transferor corporation if the transfer of assets to the acquiring corporation had not occurred.
(2) Section 381(c)(11) also permits or requires the acquiring corporation to be treated as though it were the distributor or transferor corporation for the purpose of satisfying any conditions which would have been required of the distributor or transferor corporation in the absence of the distribution or transfer, so that it may be determined whether the distributor or transferor corporation, or the acquiring corporation, is entitled to take a deduction under section 404 in respect of a trust or plan established by the distributor or transferor corporation. Thus, for example, in a case when the
taxable year of the transferor corporation ends on the date of transfer pursuant to section 381(b)(1), that corporation is entitled, pursuant to the provisions of section 404(a)(6) and paragraph (c) of § 1.404(a)-1, to a deduction in such taxable year for a payment to a qualified trust of that corporation made by the acquiring corporation after the close of such taxable year but within the time specified in section 404(a)(6). In further illustration, if the transferor corporation were to establish a qualified plan, and if the plan were maintained as a qualified plan by the acquiring corporation, then any contributions paid under the plan by the acquiring corporation (other than those which are deductible by the transferor corporation by reason of section 404(a)(6)) would be deductible under section 404 by the acquiring corporation even though the plan were exclusively for the benefit of former employees of the transferor corporation. Also, for example, if the transferor corporation were to adopt an annuity plan during its taxable year ending on the date of transfer, the acquiring corporation would be entitled, subject to the provisions of section 401(b), to amend the plan so as to make it retroactively satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(3), (4), (5), and (6) for the period beginning with the date on which the plan was put into effect.
(c)
Taxable year of deduction.
The first taxable year of the acquiring corporation in which any amount shall be allowed as a deduction to that corporation by reason of section 381(c)(11) and this section shall be its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer.
(d)
Requirements for deductions.
(1) In order for any amount paid by the acquiring corporation (other than amounts deductible under section 404(a)(5)) to be deductible by the acquiring corporation by reason of this section in respect of a trust or nontrusteed annuity plan which is established by a distributor or transferor corporation and maintained by the acquiring corporation, the contributions must be paid (or deemed to have been paid under section 404(a)(6)) by the acquiring corporation in a taxable year of that corporation which ends with or within a year of the trust for which it is exempt under section 501(a), or, in the case of a nontrusteed annuity plan, for which it meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2). See, however, section 404(a)(4) and § 1.404(a)-11 for rules relating to deductions for contributions to foreign-situs trusts. The trust or plan which is established by the distributor or transferor corporation and maintained by the acquiring corporation may separately satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) or section 404(a)(2) or may, together with other trusts or plans of the acquiring corporation, constitute a single plan which qualifies under section 401(a) or meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2).
(2) Excess contributions paid under a qualified trust or plan established by the transferor or distributor corporation may be carried over and, subject to the applicable limitations, deducted by the acquiring corporation in a taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer regardless of whether the trust is exempt, or the plan meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2), during such taxable year. There are, however, special rules for computing the limitations on the amount of excess contributions which are deductible in a taxable year ending after the trust or plan has terminated (see paragraph (a) of § 1.404(a)-13). For this purpose, the pension, annuity, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plan of the distributor or transferor corporation under which the excess contributions were made shall be considered continued (and not terminated) by the acquiring corporation if, after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation continues the plan as a separate and distinct plan of its own which continues to qualify under section 401(a), or to meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2), or consolidates or replaces that plan with a comparable plan. See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for rules relating to what constitutes a “comparable” plan.
(3) In order for any amount paid by the acquiring corporation to be deductible by the acquiring corporation as an unused deduction carried over from a qualified profit-sharing or stock bonus trust established by a distributor or
transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation must continue such trust established by the distributor or transferor corporation as a separate and distinct trust of its own which continues to qualify under section 401(a), or must consolidate or replace that trust with a comparable trust. In addition, the amount paid by the acquiring corporation will be deductible as an unused deduction carried over from the transferor or distributor corporation only if it is paid into the profit-sharing or stock bonus trust established by the transferor or distributor corporation, or the comparable trust, in a taxable year of the acquiring corporation which ends with or within a year of such trust (or such comparable trust) for which it meets the requirements of section 401(a) and is exempt under section 501(a). See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for rules relating to what constitutes a “comparable” trust.
(4) For purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, a plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of section 404(a) shall be considered comparable to another plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to either of those paragraphs, and a plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of section 404(a) shall be considered comparable to another plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to such paragraph (3). Thus, a profit-sharing plan (which qualifies under section 401(a)) established by the transferor or distributor corporation shall, for purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, be considered terminated if, after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation transfers the funds accumulated under the profit-sharing plan into a pension plan covering the same employees. In such a case, excess contributions paid under the profit-sharing plan by the distributor or transferor corporation may be carried over and deducted by the acquiring corporation in a taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer subject to the limitations in section 404(a)(3)(A). On the other hand, unused deductions attributable to the profit sharing plan may not be carried over and used by the acquiring corporation as a basis for deducting amounts contributed by it to the pension plan.
(e)
Effect of consolidation or replacement of plan on prior contributions.
If a pension, annuity, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plan which was established by a distributor or transferor corporation is terminated after the date of distribution or transfer because of consolidation or replacement with a comparable plan of the acquiring corporation, then the contributions paid to or under its plan by the distributor or transferor corporation on or before the date of distribution or transfer shall not be disallowed under section 404 merely because of the termination of the plan which was established by that corporation, provided that the termination does not cause the plan to fail to qualify under section 401(a).
(f)
Amounts deductible under section 404.
Section 381(c)(11) and this section apply only to amounts which are otherwise deductible under section 404 and the regulations thereunder. See §§ 1.404(a)-1 through 1.404(d)-1. Thus, to be deductible by reason of this section, contributions paid by the acquiring corporation must be expenses which otherwise satisfy the conditions of section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses). No deduction shall be allowed by reason of section 381(c)(11) and this section for a contribution which is allowable under section 162 but is not allowable under section 404. Thus, the acquiring corporation shall not be allowed a deduction by reason of this section in respect of a plan established by a distributor or transferor corporation if the contribution would not otherwise be deductible under section 404 by reason of section 404(c) and § 1.404(c)-1. On the other hand, any unused deductions or excess contributions of a distributor or transferor corporation which are carried over from 1939 Code years shall be deductible by the acquiring corporation if the requirements of this section, section 404(d), and § 1.404(d)-1 are satisfied.
(g)
Cost of past service credits.
In computing the cost of past service credits under a plan with respect to employees of the distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation
may include the cost of credits for periods during which the employees were in the service of the distributor or transferor corporation.
(h)
Separate carryovers required.
The excess contributions which are available to a distributor or transferor corporation under the provisions of section 404(a)(1)(D) and section 404(a)(3)(A) at the close of the date of distribution or transfer and are carried over to the acquiring corporation under this section shall be kept separate and distinct from each other and from any excess contributions which are available to the distributor or transferor corporation at that time under the provisions of section 404(a)(7) and are carried over to the acquiring corporation under this section. If there are excess contributions carried over to the acquiring corporation from more than one transferor or distributor corporation, the excess contributions of each transferor or distributor corporation shall be kept separate and distinct from those of the other transferor or distributor corporations and, with respect to each such transferor or distributor corporation, shall be kept separate and distinct as provided in the preceding sentence. See, however, paragraph (i) of this section for rules for applying the provisions of section 404(a)(3)(A) when the acquiring corporation maintains two or more profit-sharing or stock bonus trusts, one or more of which was established by a distributor or transferor corporation. The requirements in this paragraph shall apply with respect to any excess contributions which are carried over to the acquiring corporation from a distributor or transferor corporation under the provisions of section 404(d) and this section.
(i)
Limitations applicable to profit-sharing or stock bonus trusts.
When contributions are paid by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer to two or more profit-sharing or stock bonus trusts, and one or more of such trusts was established by a distributor or transferor corporation, such trusts shall be considered as a single trust in applying the provisions of section 404(a)(3)(A) under this section. Accordingly, in determining its secondary limitation, and its excess contributions carryover, under section 404(a)(3)(A) in any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation shall take into accounts its primary limitations, and the deductions allowed or allowable to it, for all prior years under the limitations provided in those sections, and also the primary limitations of, and deductions allowed or allowable to, the distributor or transferor corporation or corporations for all prior years under the limitations provided in those sections.
(j)
Successive carryovers.
The provisions of section 381(c)(11) and this section shall apply to an acquiring corporation which, in a distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies acquires the assets of a distributor or transferor corporation which has previously acquired the assets of another corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, even though, in computing an unused deductions or excess contributions carryover to the second acquiring corporation, it is necessary to take into account contributions paid by, and limitations applicable to, the first distributor or transferor corporation.
(k)
Information to be furnished by acquiring corporation.
The acquiring corporation shall furnish such information with respect to a plan established by a distributor or transferor corporation as will, consistently with the principles of section 404, establish that the provisions of such section and this section apply. For purposes of this section, the district director may require any other information that he considers necessary to determine deductions allowable under section 404 and this section or qualification under section 401. Any unused deductions or excess contributions carried over from a distributor or transferor corporation pursuant to this section shall be properly identified with the corporation which would have been permitted to use those deductions or contributions in the absence of the transaction causing section 381 to apply.
(l)
Illustration.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In 1955, X Corporation, which makes its return on the basis of the calendar year, paid $400,000 to completely fund past
service credits under a qualified pension plan and deducted 10 percent ($40,000) of that cost in each of the taxable years 1955, 1956, and 1957. The pension plan established by X Corporation had an anniversary date of January 1. On December 31, 1957, on which date the undeducted part of the cost amounted to $280,000, X Corporation transferred all its assets to Y Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. Y Corporation, which also makes its return on the basis of the calendar year, had a qualified pension plan and trust which also had an anniversary date of January 1. Since Y Corporation had many more employees than X Corporation on the date of transfer, it covered the former employees of X Corporation under its own plan. Y Corporation is entitled to deductions under section 404(a)(1)(D) and this section in 1958 and succeeding taxable years, in order of time, with respect to the undeducted balance of $280,000, to the extent of the difference between the amount paid and deductible by that corporation in each such taxable year and the maximum amount deductible by that corporation for such taxable year in accordance with the applicable limitations of section 404(a)(1). In computing the maximum amount deductible by Y Corporation for 1958 and 1959 under section 404(a)(1)(C), that corporation may include $40,000 for each year, the amount that X Corporation could have included for each of those years in computing the maximum amount that would have been deductible by X Corporation under section 404(a)(1)(C) if the merger had not occurred. Thus, assuming that Y Corporation's appropriate limitation so computed under section 404(a)(1)(C) is $1,000,000 (including the $40,000 carried over from X Corporation under this section) for each of those taxable years, and that Y Corporation contributed $925,000 to its trust in 1958 and $975,000 in 1959, then Y Corporation is entitled under section 404(a)(1)(D) and this section to deduct in 1958 $75,000, and in 1959 $25,000, of the amount ($280,000) carried over from X Corporation. The undeducted balance of such amount ($180,000) available to Y Corporation on December 31, 1959, would be deductible by that corporation in succeeding taxable years in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(D) and this section.

§ 1.381(c)(12)-1
Recovery of bad debts, prior taxes, or delinquency amounts.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
(1) If, as a result of a distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation is entitled to the recovery of a bad debt, prior tax, or delinquency amount on account of which a deduction or credit was allowed to a distributor or transferor corporation for a prior taxable year, and such debt, tax, or amount is recovered by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer, then under the provisions of section 381(c)(12) the acquiring corporation is required to include in its gross income for the taxable year of recovery the same amount of income attributable to the recovery as the distributor or transferor corporation would have been required to include under section 111 and the regulations thereunder had the distribution or transfer not occurred.
(2) The rule prescribed by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and by section 381(c)(12) with respect to bad debts, prior taxes, and delinquency amounts applies equally with respect to the recovery by the acquiring corporation of all other losses, expenditures, and accruals made on the basis of deductions from the gross income of a distributor or transferor corporation for prior taxable years, including war losses referred to in section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, but not including deductions with respect to depreciation, depletion, amortization, or amortizable bond premiums. An item which is not a “section 111 item” for purposes of the regulations under section 111 is not subject to the provisions of section 381(c)(12). The provisions of section 111(c) shall be applied with respect to a recovery by the acquiring corporation in the same manner as they would have been applied by the distributor or transferor corporation.
(b)
Amount of recovery exclusion allowable for year of recovery.
For the year of any recovery by the acquiring corporation, the amount of the recovery exclusion for the original taxable year shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of § 1.111-1. For the purpose of this paragraph and section 381(c)(12), the recovery exclusion for any year with respect to section 111 items of the acquiring corporation shall be kept separate from the recovery exclusion for any year with respect to section 111 items of each distributor or transferor corporation. The recovery by the acquiring corporation of any section 111 item of such corporation after the date
of the distribution or transfer shall be considered separately from recoveries by the acquiring corporation of any such item which was deducted or credited by a distributor or transferor corporation. Any recovery by the acquiring corporation of a section 111 item shall be excluded from the gross income of the acquiring corporation to the extent of the recovery exclusion (1) determined for the original year for which that item was deducted or credited by the specific corporation which claimed the deduction or credit and (2) reduced by the excludable recoveries (whether made by the acquiring corporation, or by the distributor or transferor corporation) in intervening years with respect to the recovery exclusion of such corporation for such original year. There shall be taken into account the effect of net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks or capital loss carryovers.

§ 1.381(c)(13)-1
Involuntary conversions.
(a)
Carryover requirement
—(1)
General rule.
Section 381(c)(13) requires that after the date of distribution or transfer the acquiring corporation, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation for purposes of applying section 1033, relating to involuntary conversions. This rule shall apply even though the property similar or related in service or use to the property converted, or the stock of a corporation owning such similar property, is purchased by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer and is not received from the distributor or transferor corporation in the transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Accordingly, if any factor essential to the application of section 1033 occurs on or before the date of distribution or transfer and any other such factor also occurs after that date, then, in accordance with section 381(c)(13) and this section, the provisions of section 1033 shall apply to the acquiring corporation in the same manner that they would have applied to the distributor or transferor corporation in the absence of the distribution or transfer. For purposes of this section, the terms
involuntary conversion
and
disposition of the converted property
shall have the meaning ascribed to them by the regulations under section 1033.
(2)
Application to other transactions.
The provisions of this section shall apply to any transaction which, under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, is treated as though it were an involuntary conversion within the meaning of section 1033. See, for example, section 1071, relating to gain from a sale or exchange to effectuate the policies of the Federal Communications Commission; and sections 1332(b)(3) and 1333(3), relating to war loss recoveries.
(b)
Conversion into similar property.
Section 1033(a)(1) provides that no gain shall be recognized if property is involuntarily converted only into property which is similar or related in service or use to the property so converted. If there is a disposition of property of a distributor or transferor corporation and, subsequent to the date of distribution or transfer, property similar or related in service or use to the property disposed of is received by the acquiring corporation as compensation for the
property so disposed of, then no gain shall be recognized to the acquiring corporation, provided that no gain would have been recognized under section 1033(a)(1) if the similar property had been received directly by the distributor or transferor corporation.

# Example.
Property of S Corporation with an adjusted basis of $100 is condemned by the local government. Shortly after the property is so condemned, S Corporation liquidates and distributes its assets to P Corporation in a distribution to which section 381(a) applies. Subsequent to the date of distribution, P Corporation receives from the government (in settlement of the condemnation proceedings) property with a market value of $500 which is similar or related in service or use to the property so condemned. No gain is recognized to either corporation upon P Corporation's receipt of the similar property, and the property so received has a basis of $100 in the hands of P Corporation on the date of its acquisition.
(c)
Conversion into money or dissimilar property when disposition occurs after December 31, 1950
—(1)
General rule.
Section 1033(a)(3) and § 1.1033(a)-2 provide rules for involuntary conversions of property into money or dissimilar property where the disposition of the converted property occurs after December 31, 1950. In such a case, the gain on the conversion, if any, shall be recognized, at the election of the taxpayer, only to the extent that the amount realized on the conversion exceeds the cost of other property purchased by the taxpayer which is similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or exceeds the cost of stock purchased by the taxpayer in the acquisition of control of a corporation owning such other property, provided (i) the taxpayer purchases such other property or stock for the purpose of replacing the property so converted and (ii) the purchase occurs during the period of time specified in section 1033(a)(3)(B). The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to involuntary conversions where the disposition of the property occurs after December 31, 1950, and where the election to have section 1033(a)(3) apply to the treatment of the gain upon the conversion is contingent upon activities of both the distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation. For purposes of section 381(c)(13), the period of time specified in section 1033(a)(3)(B) shall be determined by taking into account taxable years of, and extensions of time granted to, both the distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation.
(2)
Replacement period.
The period during which the purchase of similar property or stock must be made in order to prevent the recognition of gain on the involuntary conversion terminates 2 years (or, in the case of a disposition occurring before Dec. 31, 1969, 1 year) after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain upon the conversion is realized, or at the close of such later date as may be designated pursuant to an application of the taxpayer. See paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.1033(a)-2. Therefore, if, in a case to which this subparagraph applies, the first taxable year in which gain is realized is the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending with the close of the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation will have a maximum of only 2 years (or, in the case of a disposition occurring before Dec. 31, 1969, 1 year) after that date in which to purchase the similar property or stock, unless an extension of time has been granted upon application by the distributor, transferor, or acquiring corporation within the time prescribed. See paragraph (a) of § 1.381(b)-1 as to the termination of the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation. See paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.1033(a)-2 as to applications to extend the period within which to replace the converted property. In addition to the information otherwise required under paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.1033(a)-2, the application shall contain sufficient detail in connection with the distribution or transfer to establish that section 381(c)(13) applies to the involuntary conversion involved.
(3)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A and B Corporations compute their taxable income on the basis of the calendar year, and both corporations use the cash method of accounting. During 1970 property of A Corporation is destroyed by fire, and in January 1971, A Corporation receives
$15,000 from an insurance company as compensation for its loss of property. The adjusted basis of the property on the date of destruction is $10,000; as a consequence, A Corporation realizes a gain of $5,000 on the involuntary conversion. On June 30, 1971, B Corporation acquires all of the assets of A Corporation in a reorganization to which section 381(a) applies. In accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1033(a)-2, A Corporation reports in its return for the short taxable year ending June 30, 1971, all the details in connection with the involuntary conversion but does not include the realized gain in gross income, thereby electing to have the gain recognized only to the extent provided in section 1033(a)(3). On June 15, 1973, B Corporation purchases for $20,000 property which is similar or related in service or use to the property previously destroyed. In its return for 1973, B Corporation reports all of the details in connection with its replacement of the property, as required by paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1033(a)-2. As a result of this replacement by B Corporation, none of the gain realized by A Corporation is recognized. The replacement property which is purchased by B Corporation has a basis to that corporation of $15,000 on the date of its purchase, that is, the cost of such property ($20,000) decreased by the amount of gain not recognized to A Corporation on the involuntary conversion ($5,000).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example (1),
except that B Corporation does not purchase similar property on or before June 30, 1973, and does not apply on or before that date (in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.1033(a)-2) for an extension of time in which to make a replacement. In such event, the gain realized by A Corporation is recognized to that corporation for its taxable year ending June 30, 1971. A Corporation's tax liability for such taxable year must be recomputed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1033(a)-2 in order to reflect this additional income.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example (1),
except that the property of A Corporation is destroyed in 1968, A Corporation receives the $15,000 from an insurance company in January 1969, B Corporation acquires all of the assets of A Corporation on June 30, 1969, and A Corporation's return is filed for the short taxable year ending June 30, 1969. B Corporation would have to purchase property which is similar or related in service or use to the property previously destroyed by June 30, 1970, in order to take advantage of the provisions of section 1033.

# Example 4.
M and N Corporations compute their taxable income on the basis of the calendar year, and both corporations use the cash method of accounting. During 1970, property of M Corporation is destroyed by fire. The adjusted basis of the property on the date of destruction is $10,000. The property is insured against loss by fire, but the insurance claim is not satisfied on or before June 30, 1971, the date on which N Corporation acquires all of the assets (including the insurance claim) of M Corporation in a reorganization to which section 381(a) applies. On September 1, 1972, N Corporation receives $15,000 from the insurance company as compensation for the fire loss suffered by M Corporation. Upon receipt of the insurance proceeds, N Corporation realizes a gain of $5,000 upon the involuntary conversion; however, in its return for 1972, N Corporation elects under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1033(a)-2 to have the gain recognized only to the extent provided by section 1033(a)(3). On December 30, 1974, N Corporation purchases for $20,000 property which is similar or related in service or use to the property previously destroyed in the hands of M Corporation. As a result of this replacement by N Corporation, none of the gain realized by N Corporation in 1972 is recognized. The replacement property which is purchased by N Corporation has a basis to that corporation of $15,000 on the date of its purchase, that is, the cost of such property ($20,000) decreased by the amount of gain not recognized to N Corporation on the involuntary conversion ($5,000).

# Example 5.
R and S Corporations compute their taxable income on the basis of the calendar year, and both corporations use the cash method of accounting. During 1970 property of R Corporation is destroyed by fire. The adjusted basis of the property on the date of destruction is $10,000. In anticipation of taking the benefit of section 1033(a)(3), R Corporation purchases for $20,000 on June 1, 1971, property which is similar or related in service or use to the destroyed property. In its return for 1971, R Corporation reports all of the details in connection with the replacement of the property, as required by paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1033(a)-2. The property destroyed in 1970 is insured against loss by fire, but the insurance claim is not satisfied on or before March 1, 1972, the date on which S Corporation acquires all of the assets (including the insurance claim) of R Corporation in a reorganization to which section 381(a) applies. On October 1, 1972, S Corporation receives $12,000 from the insurance company as compensation for the fire loss suffered by R Corporation. Upon receipt of the insurance proceeds, S Corporation realizes a gain of $2,000 upon the involuntary conversion; however, in its return for 1972, S Corporation elects under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1033(a)-2 to have the gain recognized only to the extent provided by section 1033(a)(3). As a result of the replacement by R Corporation, none of the gain realized by S Corporation in 1972 is recognized. Assuming there are no adjustments for depreciation, the replacement property has a basis on October 1, 1972, of $18,000, that is,
the cost of such property ($20,000) decreased by the amount of gain not recognized to S Corporation on the involuntary conversion ($2,000)
(d)
Conversion into money when disposition occurs before January 1, 1951.
Section 1033(a)(2) provides that, if property is disposed of in an involuntary conversion before January 1, 1951, and money is received as compensation for the conversion, no gain shall be recognized if such money is forthwith expended in the acquisition of other property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or in the acquisition of control of a corporation owning such other property, or in the establishment of a replacement fund. That section also provides that, if any part of the money is not so expended, the gain, if any, shall be recognized to the extent of the money which is not so expended. For example, if, pursuant to section 381(c)(13) and section 1033(a)(2), property of a distributor or transferor corporation is disposed of before January 1, 1951, in an involuntary conversion, and the proceeds from the conversion are received by the acquiring corporation so that the gain on the conversion is realized by that corporation, the acquiring corporation may avoid recognition of the gain if it complies with the provisions of section 1033(a)(2) for nonrecognition of gain. Thus, the acquiring corporation must forthwith expend the proceeds in the acquisition of similar property or stock, or in the establishment of a replacement fund, in order to avoid recognition of the gain, if the disposition occurred before January 1, 1951. See the provisions of §§ 1.1033(a)-3 and 1.1033(a)-4 relating to involuntary conversions and replacement funds when disposition of the converted property occurred before January 1, 1951.
(e)
Successive acquiring corporations.
An acquiring corporation which, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, acquires the assets of a corporation which previously acquired the assets of another corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall be treated as such other corporation for purposes of applying sections 381(c)(13) and 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions). Thus, for example, if any factor essential to the application of section 1033 occurs on or before the date of distribution or transfer in one transaction to which section 381(a) applies, and any other such factor occurs after the date of distribution or transfer in a subsequent transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the acquiring corporation in such subsequent transaction shall be treated as the first distributor or transferor corporation subject to the rules and limitations of this section for purposes of sections 381(c)(13) and 1033.
[T.D. 6552, 26 FR 1989, Mar. 8, 1961, as amended by T.D. 7075, 35 FR 17995, Nov. 24, 1970]
§ 1.381(c)(14)-1
Dividend carryover to personal holding company.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
Section 381(c)(14) provides that an acquiring corporation shall succeed to and take into account the dividend carryover (described in section 564) of a distributor or transferor corporation in computing its dividends paid deduction under section 561 for taxable years ending after the date of distribution or transfer for which the acquiring corporation is a personal holding company under section 542. To determine the amount of such dividend carryover and to integrate it with the dividend carryover of the acquiring corporation in computing the dividends paid deduction for taxable years ending after the date of distribution or transfer, it is necessary to apply the provisions of section 564 and § 1.564-1 in accordance with this section.
(b)
Manner of computing dividend carryover
—(1)
Preceding taxable years.
If the acquiring corporation is a personal holding company under section 542 for its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending with such date is a first preceding taxable year for purposes of section 564, and the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation immediately preceding such first preceding year is a second preceding taxable year for purposes of section 564. If the acquiring corporation is a personal holding company for its second taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending with
such date is a second preceding taxable year for purposes of section 564.
(2)
Determination of dividends paid deduction and taxable income.
The dividends paid deduction of any distributor or transferor corporation (determined under section 561 but without regard to any dividend carryover) and the taxable income of any such corporation (adjusted as provided in section 545(b)) for any taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer shall be determined without reference to any dividends paid deduction, or taxable income, of the acquiring corporation or any other distributor or transferor corporation; in like manner, the dividends paid deduction and the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for any such taxable year shall be determined without reference to any dividends paid deduction, or taxable income, of a distributor or transferor corporation.
(3)
Computation of dividend carryover.
(i) For the purpose of determining the dividend carryover to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the amount of the dividend carryover from the distributor or transferor corporation shall be determined under section 564 without reference to the dividends paid deduction or taxable income of the acquiring corporation or any other corporation. If two or more transactions to which section 381(a) applies have the same date of distribution or transfer, or if a particular taxable year of the acquiring corporation is the first taxable year ending after the dates of distribution or transfer of two or more such transactions occurring on different dates, the amount of the dividend carryover from each distributor or transferor corporation shall be determined separately as provided in the preceding sentence. Except as provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, the aggregate of the dividend carryovers from each distributor or transferor corporation and the dividend carryover of the acquiring corporation (computed without regard to this section) shall constitute the dividend carryover under section 561(a)(3) of the acquiring corporation for its first taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer.
(ii) For the purpose of determining the dividend carryover to the second taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer, the excess, if any, of the dividends paid deduction (determined under section 561 without regard to any dividend carryover) over the taxable income (adjusted as provided in section 545(b)) for the taxable year of each distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation referred to as a second preceding taxable year shall be determined separately without reference to the dividends paid deduction or taxable income of any other of such corporations. The excesses thus determined shall be aggregated, and such aggregate shall be—
(
a
) Increased by the excess of the dividends paid deduction (determined without regard to any dividend carryover) over the taxable income (adjusted as provided in section 545(b)), or
(
b
) Reduced by the excess of the taxable income (adjusted as provided in section 545(b)) over the dividends paid deduction (determined without regard to any dividend carryover),
for the first preceding taxable year of the acquiring corporation. Except as provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, the amount thus determined shall constitute the dividend carryover under section 561(a)(3) of the acquiring corporation for its second taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer.
(iii) If a particular taxable year of the acquiring corporation is its first taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer of one or more transactions to which section 381(a) applies, and if the same taxable year of the acquiring corporation is also its second taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer of one or more other transactions to which section 381(a) applies, then, for the purpose of determining the dividend carryover to such taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the rules contained in both subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph shall be applied. Insofar as such taxable year
constitutes the first taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer of any transaction, the amount of the dividend carryover from any distributor or transferor corporation involved in such transaction shall be determined separately as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. Insofar as such taxable year constitutes the second taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer of any transaction, the amount of the dividend carryover from any distributor or transferor corporation involved in the transaction and the acquiring corporation shall be determined as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. The aggregate of the dividend carryovers thus determined shall constitute the dividend carryover under section 561(a)(3) of the acquiring corporation for such taxable year. See

(d)
Successive carryovers.
The provisions of this section shall apply for the purpose of determining a dividend carryover to an acquiring corporation which, in a distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies, acquires the assets of a distributor or transferor corporation which has previously acquired the assets of another corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies; even though, in computing the dividend carryover to such second acquiring corporation, it is necessary to take into account the deduction for dividends paid, and the adjusted taxable income, of the first distributor or transferor corporation.
(e)
Acquiring corporation not receiving all the assets.
The dividend carryover acquired from a distributor or transferor corporation by an acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies is not reduced by reason of the fact that the acquiring corporation does not acquire 100 percent of the assets of the distributor or transferor corporation.
(f)
Dividends paid after the close of taxable year.
A transaction to which section 381(a) applies does not prevent the application of section 563(b) to a dividend paid by a distributor or transferor corporation after the close of its taxable year ending with the date of distribution or transfer but on or before the 15th day of the third month following the close of such taxable year. However, dividends paid by the acquiring corporation may not be taken into account under section 563(b) for the purpose of determining the dividends paid deduction of the distributor or transferor corporation for its taxable year ending with the date of distribution or transfer.

§ 1.381(c)(15)-1
Indebtedness of certain personal holding companies.
(a)
Qualified indebtedness
—(1)
Carryover requirement.
If, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation assumes liability for any indebtedness which was qualified indebtedness (as defined in section 545(c) and § 1.545-3) in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation immediately before the assumption of such indebtedness, then, under section 381(c)(15), in computing its undistributed personal holding company income for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, and ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation shall be considered the distributor or transferor corporation for purposes of computing the deduction under section 545(c) and § 1.545-3. Such deduction shall be allowed to the acquiring corporation in accordance with section 545(c) and § 1.545-3.
(2)
Successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies.
If in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, an acquiring corporation assumes liability for qualified indebtedness, such acquiring
corporation shall be deemed to have incurred such qualified indebtedness for the purpose of applying section 381(c)(15) to any subsequent transaction in which such acquiring corporation is the distributor or transferor corporation.
(b)
Pre-1934 indebtedness
—(1)
Carryover requirement.
If, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation assumes liability for any indebtedness incurred, or assumed, before January 1, 1934, by a distributor or transferor corporation, then under section 381(c)(15) the acquiring corporation shall be allowed, in computing its undistributed personal holding company income for any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, a deduction under section 545(b)(7) for amounts used or irrevocably set aside to pay or to retire such indebtedness. Such deduction shall be allowed to the acquiring corporation in accordance with section 545(b)(7) and paragraph (g) of § 1.545-2 as though the indebtedness had been incurred, or assumed, by the acquiring corporation before January 1, 1934.
(2)
Successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies.
If, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, an acquiring corporation assumes liability for indebtedness described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, such acquiring corporation shall be deemed to have incurred the indebtedness before January 1, 1934, for the purpose of applying section 381(c)(15) to any subsequent transaction in which such acquiring corporation is the distributor or transferor corporation.
(c)
Special rule.
For purposes of this section, if, in a transaction otherwise described in this section, an acquiring corporation acquires real estate—(1) of which the distributor or transferor corporation is the legal or equitable owner immediately before the acquisition, and (2) which is subject to indebtedness that, with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation, is indebtedness described in this section immediately before the acquisition, then the acquiring corporation will be treated as having assumed such indebtedness, provided it shows to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that under all the facts and circumstances it bears the burden of discharging such indebtedness.

§ 1.381(c)(16)-1
Obligations of distributor or transferor corporation.
(a)
Deduction allowed to acquiring corporation.
(1) If, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation assumes an obligation of a distributor or transferor corporation which gives rise to a liability after the date of distribution or transfer and if the distributor or transferor corporation would be entitled to deduct such liability in computing taxable income were it paid or accrued after that date by such corporation, then, under the provisions of section 381(c)(16) and this section, the acquiring corporation shall be entitled to deduct such liability as if it were the distributor or transferor corporation. However, in the case of a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies, section 381(c)(16) shall not apply to an obligation which is reflected in the amount of consideration, that is, the stock, securities, or other property, transferred by the acquiring corporation to a transferor corporation or its shareholders in exchange for the property of that transferor corporation. An obligation which is so reflected in the amount of consideration will be treated as an item or tax attribute not specified in section 381(c)(16). Such an obligation is subject to section 381(c)(4). See subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. Any deduction allowed under section 381(c)(16) to the acquiring corporation shall be taken by that corporation in the taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer in which the liability is paid or accrued by that corporation, as the case may be.
(2) In order to determine whether, in the case of obligations of a distributor or transferor corporation assumed by an acquiring corporation, section 381(c)(16) and this section, or section 381(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder, apply, the following rules shall govern:
(i) If the obligation gave rise to a liability before the date of distribution or transfer, see section 381(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder.
(ii) If the obligation gives rise to a liability after the date of distribution or transfer, and the obligation was not reflected in the amount of consideration transferred by the acquiring corporation to the distributor or transferor corporation or its shareholders in exchange for the property of the distributor or transferor corporation, then section 381(c)(16) and this section shall apply.
(iii) In the case of a transaction to which section 381(a)(1) applies, if the obligation gives rise to a liability after the date of a distribution, and the obligation was reflected in the amount of consideration transferred by the acquiring corporation to the distributor corporation or its shareholders in exchange for the property of the distributor corporation, then section 381(c)(16) and this section shall apply.
(iv) In the case of a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies, if the obligation gives rise to a liability after the date of a transfer, and the obligation was reflected in the amount of consideration transferred by the acquiring corporation to the transferor corporation or its shareholders in exchange for the property of the transferor corporation, then see section 381(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder.
(3) The rules of this section apply to obligations assumed by agreement of the parties as well as by operation of law.
(4) For purposes of this section, an obligation of a distributor or transferor corporation gives rise to a liability when the liability would be accruable by a taxpayer using the accrual method of accounting notwithstanding the fact that the distributor or transferor corporation is not using the accrual method of accounting. See paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.461-1.
(5) In the case of a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies, the determination as to whether or not an obligation was reflected in the amount of consideration transferred by the acquiring corporation to the transferor corporation or its shareholders in exchange for the property of the transferor corporation shall be made on the basis of all the facts of each particular transfer. Where, on the date of distribution or transfer, the parties were aware of the existence of a specific obligation and reduced the amount of consideration to be transferred by the acquiring corporation by a specific amount because of the existence of such obligation, then such obligation shall be considered to have been reflected in the amount of consideration transferred. In the absence of such facts, it shall be presumed that the obligation was not reflected in the amount of consideration transferred.
(b)
Distribution or transfer occurring under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
Subject to the provisions of section 381(c)(16) and this section, a corporation which would have been an acquiring corporation (under the provisions of paragraph (b) of § 1.381(a)-1) in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies if the date of distribution or transfer had occurred on or after the effective date of the provisions of subchapter C, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, applicable to a liquidation or reorganization, as the case may be, shall be entitled to take a deduction for amounts paid or accrued in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, in respect of any obligation which it has assumed from a corporation which would have been a distributor or transferor corporation in such transaction. However, this paragraph shall have no application to a situation described in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section.
(c)
Examples.
The application of the foregoing rules may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X Corporation and Y Corporation compute their taxable income on the basis of the calendar year, and both corporations use an accrual method of accounting. On December 31, 1954, Y Corporation acquires the assets of X Corporation in a transfer to which section 381(a)(2) applies. By reason of State law, Y Corporation assumes responsibility for all of the obligations for which X Corporation is then, or may become, liable. The parties have no knowledge of any specific obligations of X Corporation which are not yet fixed and ascertainable, but it is agreed to reduce the amount of consideration that Y Corporation is to transfer in exchange for the assets of X Corporation by $5,000 to reflect any unforeseen contingent liabilities of X Corporation for which Y Corporation might subsequently become liable. After the date of the transfer, a claim for
damages on account of the alleged negligence of an alleged agent of X Corporation is filed. After commencement of legal action by the claimant and in order to eliminate the possibility of injury to its business, Y Corporation settles the claim in 1955 by paying the claimant the amount of $3,000. Assuming that such sum would have been deductible under section 162 if paid by X Corporation, Y Corporation is entitled to deduct such sum in accordance with the provisions of section 381(c)(16) and this section in computing its taxable income for 1955, since the claim gave rise to a liability after the date of transfer, the parties were not aware of a specific obligation, and the specific obligation was not reflected in the consideration transferred by Y Corporation in exchange for the assets of X Corporation.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example (1),
except that the claim for damages was filed prior to the transfer of X Corporation's assets to Y Corporation, but the parties considered the chances for recovery by the claimant so remote that no specific amount other than the $5,000 reduction in consideration for all contingent liabilities as a whole is reflected in the consideration transferred by Y Corporation in exchange for the assets of X Corporation. Assuming that such sum would have been deductible under section 162 if paid by X Corporation, the $3,000 paid by Y Corporation in 1955 is deductible in accordance with the provisions of section 381(c)(16) and this section in 1955.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example (1),
except that the parties consider the chances of recovery by the claimant of sufficient probability that Y Corporation reduces the amount of consideration it transfers in exchange for the assets of X Corporation by $1,000 in addition to the $5,000 reduction for all other contingent liabilities. The $3,000 paid by Y Corporation in 1955 is not deductible under section 381(c)(16) and this section, since the specific obligation was reflected in the consideration transferred by Y Corporation in exchange for the assets of X Corporation. The deductibility of the payment is accordingly governed by the provisions of section 381(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder. Similarly, if in this case Y Corporation had transferred $10,000 less in consideration for the assets of X Corporation because of this particular claim, Y Corporation would not be entitled to any deduction for the $3,000 paid in 1955 under section 381(c)(16) and this section, and the deductibility of the payment would be governed by the provisions of section 381(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder. If the date of transfer of X Corporation's assets had occurred prior to the effective date of subchapter C, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, applicable to a reorganization, no deduction would be allowed to Y Corporation under that section.

Carryover requirement.
If a determination (as defined in section 547(c)) establishes that a distributor or transferor corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies is liable for personal holding company tax imposed by section 541 (or by a corresponding provision of prior income tax law) for any taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer, then in computing such tax the deduction described in section 547 shall be allowed pursuant to section 381(c)(17) to such corporation for the amount of deficiency dividends paid by the acquiring corporation with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of section 547 and the regulations thereunder apply with respect to a deficiency dividend deduction allowable pursuant to section 381(c)(17).
(b)
Deficiency dividends paid by the acquiring corporation with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation.
A deficiency dividend paid by the acquiring corporation with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation is a distribution that would satisfy the definition of a deficiency dividend under section 547(d)(1) if paid by the distributor or transferor corporation to its own shareholders except that it shall be paid by the acquiring corporation to its own shareholders and shall be paid after the date of distribution or transfer and on, or within 90 days after, the date of the determination but before the acquiring corporation files claim under paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Claim for deduction.
A claim for a deduction under this section shall be made by the acquiring corporation on Form 976, and shall be filed within 120 days after the date of the determination. The form shall contain, or be accompanied by, the information required under paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.547-2 in sufficient detail to properly identify the facts with the distributor or
transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation. The statement required with respect to the shareholders on the date of payment of the deficiency dividend shall relate to the shareholders of the acquiring corporation, and the required certified copy of the resolution authorizing the payment of the dividend shall be that of the board of directors, or other authority, of the acquiring corporation. Necessary changes may be made in Form 976 in order to carry out the provisions of this paragraph. The claim shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the return of the distributor or transferor corporation to which such claim relates was filed.
(d)
Effect on dividends paid deduction.
A deficiency dividend paid by the acquiring corporation, which is allowable as a deduction to a distributor or transferor corporation pursuant to section 381(c)(17), shall not become a part of the dividends paid deduction of the acquiring corporation under section 561 for any taxable year.
(e)
Successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies.
The provisions of this section shall apply in the case of successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies. Thus, if X Corporation transfers its assets to Y Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies and if Y Corporation transfers its assets to Z Corporation in a subsequent transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then, subject to the provisions of this section, X Corporation may take a deficiency dividend deduction for the amount of deficiency dividends paid by Z Corporation with respect to X Corporation.
(f)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
M Corporation, a personal holding company, computes its taxable income on the basis of the calendar year. On December 31, 1956, N Corporation acquires the assets of M Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. On July 31, 1958, a determination (as defined in section 547(c)) establishes that M Corporation is liable for the taxable year 1955 for personal holding company tax in the amount of $35,500 based on undistributed personal holding company income of $42,000 for such taxable year. N Corporation complies with the provisions of this section and on September 30, 1958, distributes $42,000 to its shareholders as deficiency dividends with respect to M Corporation's taxable year 1955. The distribution of $42,000 by N Corporation is a taxable dividend under section 316(b)(2) regardless of whether N Corporation is a personal holding company for the taxable year 1958 or whether it had any current or accumulated earnings and profits. See
Example (3)
in paragraph (e) of § 1.316-1. Because N Corporation has paid deficiency dividends of $42,000 in accordance with this section, M Corporation is entitled to a deficiency dividend deduction of $42,000 for the taxable year 1955 and is thus relieved of its liability for personal holding company tax of $35,500 for such taxable year. To prevent a duplication of deductions, the amount distributed by N Corporation in 1958 does not become a part of N Corporation's dividends paid deduction under section 561 for any taxable year.

§ 1.381(c)(18)-1
Depletion on extraction of ores or minerals from the waste or residue of prior mining.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
Section 381(c)(18) provides that the acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) shall be considered as though it were the distributor or transferor corporation after the date of distribution or transfer for the purpose of determining the applicability of section 613(c)(3) (relating to extraction of ores or minerals from the ground). Thus, an acquiring corporation which has acquired the waste or residue of prior mining from a distributor or transferor corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) shall be entitled, after the date of distribution or transfer, to an allowance for depletion under section 611 in respect of ores or minerals extracted from such waste or residue if the distributor or transferor corporation would have been entitled to such an allowance for depletion in the absence of the distribution or transfer. See paragraph (f) of § 1.613-4 to determine whether a distributor or transferor corporation is entitled to an allowance for depletion with respect to the waste or residue of prior mining.
(b)
Application of section 614 to waste or residue of prior mining.
If, in a transaction described in section 381(a), the acquiring corporation acquires waste
or residue of prior mining from a distributor or transferor corporation, then the acquiring corporation shall be considered as though it were the distributor or transferor corporation for the purpose of applying section 614 and the regulations thereunder to the waste or residue so acquired. Thus, if the distributor or transferor corporation was required under paragraph (c) of § 1.614-1 to treat the waste or residue as part of the mineral deposit from which it was extracted and if the acquiring corporation acquires both the waste or residue and the mineral deposit from which it was extracted in a transaction described in section 381(a), then such waste or residue shall be treated as a part of such mineral deposit in the hands of the acquiring corporation. On the other hand, if the waste or residue was required to be treated as a separate mineral deposit in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation, such waste or residue shall be treated as a separate mineral deposit in the hands of the acquiring corporation.
[T.D. 6552, 26 FR 1991, Mar. 8, 1961, as amended by T.D. 7170, 37 FR 5373, Mar. 15, 1972]
§ 1.381(c)(19)-1
Charitable contribution carryovers in certain acquisitions.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
Section 381(c)(19) provides that, in computing taxable income for its taxable years which begin after the date of distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation shall take into account any charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation during the taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer, and in certain immediately preceding taxable years, which are in excess of the maximum amount deductible for those taxable years under section 170(b)(2) in the following manner:
(1) If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins before January 1, 1962, the acquiring corporation shall, in computing taxable income for its first 2 taxable years which begin after the date of such distribution or transfer, take into account the excess contributions made by the distributor or transferor corporation in the taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer and in the immediately preceding taxable year;
(2) If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins after December 31, 1961, the acquiring corporation shall, in computing taxable income for certain taxable years which begin after the date of distribution or transfer, take into account the excess contributions made by the distributor or transferor corporation in the taxable year ending on such date of distribution or transfer and in any of the four taxable years immediately preceding such taxable year but excluding any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1962 (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins after December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 1963, the acquiring corporation shall, in computing taxable income for its first taxable year which begins after the date of distribution or transfer, also take into account the excess contributions made by the distributor or transferor corporation in the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section).
To determine the amount of excess contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation and to integrate them with contributions made by the acquiring corporation for the purpose of determining the charitable contributions deductible by the acquiring corporation for its taxable years beginning immediately after the date of distribution or transfer, it is necessary to apply the provisions of section 170(b)(2) and § 1.170-3 (or, if applicable, section 170(b)(2) and (d)(2) and § 1.170A-11) in accordance with the conditions and limitations of section 381(c)(19) and this section. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, see section 170 for provisions of section 170(b)(2) as referred to in this section. For taxable years beginning after December 31,
1969, see section 170A for provisions of section 170(b)(2) or (d)(2) as referred to in this section. For special rules for applying section 170(d)(2) with respect to contributions paid, or treated as paid, in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, see paragraph (d) of § 1.170A-11.
(b)
Manner of computing excess charitable contribution carryovers.
(1) The amount of any charitable contribution made by a distributor or transferor corporation in any taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer, or made by the acquiring corporation in any taxable year before its taxable year beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, in excess of the amount allowable as a deduction to such corporation for such taxable year under section 170(b)(2) shall be determined by taking into account the taxable income of, and the contributions made by, that corporation only.
(2) An acquiring corporation which, in a distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies, acquires the assets of a distributor or transferor corporation which previously acquired the assets of another corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall succeed to and take into account, subject to the conditions and limitations of sections 170 and 381, the charitable contribution carryovers available to the first acquiring corporation under sections 170 and 381, including those derived by such first acquiring corporation from its distributor or transferor corporation.
(3) The excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer and in certain immediately preceding taxable years (see paragraph (c) of this section) which are not deductible by the distributor or transferor corporation because of the 5-percent limitation of section 170(b)(2) shall be available to the acquiring corporation without diminution by reason of the fact that the acquiring corporation does not acquire 100 percent of the assets of the distributor or transferor corporation. Thus, if a parent corporation owning 80 percent of all classes of stock of its subsidiary corporation were to acquire its share of the assets of the subsidiary corporation upon a complete liquidation described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of § 1.381(a)-1, then, subject to the conditions and limitations of this section, 100 percent of the excess contributions made by the subsidiary corporation would be available to the acquiring corporation.
(c)
Taxable years to which carryovers apply and amount deductible
—(1)
Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1962.
If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins before January 1, 1962:
(i) The excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year immediately preceding that ending on the date of distribution or transfer, to the extent not deductible by it because of the limitations of section 170(b)(2) in its taxable year ending on that date, shall be deductible by the acquiring corporation to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) in its first taxable year beginning after the date of distribution or transfer. Any portion of such excess which is not deductible under this section by the acquiring corporation in such first taxable year shall not be deducted by that corporation in any other taxable year.
(ii) The excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer shall first be deductible by the acquiring corporation to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section in its first taxable year beginning after that date and then, to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section, in its second taxable year beginning after that date. Any portion of such excess which is not deductible under this section by the acquiring corporation in such first and second taxable years shall not be deducted by that corporation in any other taxable year.
(2)
Taxable years beginning in 1962.
If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins after December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 1963:
(i) The excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year immediately preceding that ending on the date of distribution or transfer, to the extent not deductible by it because of the limitations of section 170(b)(2) in its taxable year ending on that date, shall be deductible by the acquiring corporation to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) in its first taxable year beginning after the date of distribution or transfer. Any portion of such excess which is not deductible under this section by the acquiring corporation in such first year shall not be deducted by that corporation in any other taxable year.
(ii) The excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer and beginning after December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 1963, shall first be deductible by the acquiring corporation to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section in its first taxable year beginning after that date and then, to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section, in its second, third, fourth, and fifth taxable year, in order of time, beginning after that date. Any portion of such excess which is not deductible under this section by the acquiring corporation in such 5 taxable years shall not be deducted by that corporation in any other taxable year.
(3)
Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962.
(i) If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins after December 31, 1962, the excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer and in each of its four immediately preceding taxable years (excluding any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1962), to the extent not deductible by it because of the limitations of section 170(b)(2) in its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer or its prior taxable years, shall be deductible by the acquiring corporation to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) (or, if applicable, section 170(d)(2)) and subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, in its taxable years which begin after the date of distribution or transfer. However, any portion of the excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in a particular taxable year, to which this subparagraph is applicable, which is not deductible under this section within the 5 taxable years immediately following the taxable year in which the contribution was paid by the distributor or transferor corporation shall not be deductible by the acquiring corporation in any other taxable year.
(ii) For purposes of determining the 5 taxable years in which the excess contributions may be deducted, all taxable years of the distributor or transferor corporation subsequent to the taxable year in which the excess contribution was made, including the taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer shall be treated as taxable years of the acquiring corporation.
(iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X Corporation and Y Corporation both compute taxable income on the calendar year basis. X Corporation has excess charitable contributions for 1962 and 1964. On December 31, 1966, X Corporation distributes all its assets to Y Corporation in a complete liquidation to which section 381(a) applies. The excess 1962 charitable contributions of X Corporation (to the extent not deductible by X because of the limitations of section 170(b)(2) in its taxable years 1963 through 1966) may be deducted by Y Corporation only in 1967. Y Corporation's taxable year 1967 is the fifth taxable year succeeding the taxable year 1962 (the year in which the excess contributions were made), and the portion of such excess contributions which is not deductible in the 5 taxable years immediately succeeding 1962 (1963 through 1967) is not deductible by Y Corporation in any other taxable year. Any excess charitable contributions for 1964 to which Y Corporation may be entitled must be deducted by Y Corporation (if deductible at all) in 1967, 1968, and 1969 since such years are the third, fourth, and fifth taxable years succeeding the taxable year 1964 (the year in which the excess contributions were paid).
(4)
General rules.
No excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation shall be deductible by the acquiring corporation in its taxable year which includes the date of
distribution or transfer. In addition, an excess charitable contribution made by a distributor or transferor corporation in a taxable year prior to the taxable year of the transfer is only deductible by the distributor or transferor corporation, subject to the limitations of section 170(b)(2) (or, if applicable, section 170(d)(2)), in its subsequent taxable years which begin on or before the date of distribution or transfer, and by the acquiring corporation in its taxable year or years beginning after the date of distribution or transfer.
(d)
Rules governing amounts deductible by acquiring corporations.
(1) In applying the provisions of section 170(b)(2) (or, if applicable, section 170(d)(2)) for the purpose of determining the amount of excess charitable contributions which are deductible by the acquiring corporation in its taxable years beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, all taxable years of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations which, with respect to a particular taxable year beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, constitute the same numbered preceding taxable year shall together be considered as a 1 taxable year even though the taxable years involved may not end on the same date. Thus, for example, all taxable years of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations which, with respect to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, constitutes the second preceding taxable year shall together be considered as 1 taxable year even though the taxable years involved may not end on the same date. Any excess charitable contributions carried over from preceding taxable years which are considered as 1 taxable year shall be taken into account by the acquiring corporation as one amount, without regard to the extent to which the contributions were made by a distributor or transferor corporation or the acquiring corporation.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph, each taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation beginning on or before the date of distribution or transfer shall be treated as a preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's taxable years beginning after such date. For example, the taxable year of a distributor or transferor corporation which ends on the date of distribution or transfer shall be considered a first preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's first taxable year beginning after that date, a second preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's second taxable year beginning after that date, and so forth with respect to succeeding taxable years of the acquiring corporation. Also, for example, the taxable year of a distributor or transferor corporation which immediately precedes its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer shall be considered a second preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's first taxable year beginning after that date.
(e)
Illustration.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) X Corporation is organized on April 1, 1956, and computes its taxable income on the basis of the fiscal year ending March 31. Y Corporation is organized on July 1, 1955, and computes its taxable income on the basis of the fiscal year ending June 30. Z Corporation is organized on January 1, 1956, and computes its taxable income on the basis of the calendar year. On June 30, 1957, X Corporation distributes all its assets to Y Corporation in a complete liquidation to which section 381(a) applies. On November 30, 1957, Y Corporation transfers all its assets to Z Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 381(a) applies.
(ii) The 5-percent limitation (computed in the manner prescribed by section 170(b)(2)), the charitable contributions actually paid, and the excess contributions with respect to each such corporation during the taxable years involved are as follows:

(iii) X Corporation was in existence for two taxable years, in each of which it made charitable contributions in excess of the maximum amount deductible for those years under section 170(b)(2). The excess contributions made in the year ending March 31, 1957, of $12,000, are deductible by X Corporation in its short taxable year ending June 30, 1957, and then by Y Corporation in its short taxable year ending November 30, 1957, in each instance in the manner and to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section. The excess contributions made by X Corporation in the year ending June 30, 1957, of $6,000, are deductible by Y Corporation in its short taxable year ending November 30, 1957, and then by Z Corporation in its taxable year 1958, in each instance in the manner and to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section.
(iv) Y Corporation was in existence for three taxable years. In the year ended June 30, 1956, its contributions in excess of the amount deductible for that year under section 170(b)(2) amounted to $14,000. Such excess is deductible by Y Corporation in its taxable year ending June 30, 1957, and, together with X Corporation's excess contributions of $18,000, in its short taxable year ending November 30, 1957, in each instance in the manner and to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section. Accordingly, since Y Corporation made no contributions in its taxable year ending June 30, 1957, its deduction for that year on account of excess contributions carried over is $10,000, an amount equal to the 5-percent limitation of section 170(b)(2). The deduction is attributable to excess contributions made by Y Corporation in the taxable year ended June 30, 1956; thus, the excess of those contributions over $10,000, namely, $4,000, is deductible by Y Corporation in its short taxable year ending November 30, 1957, in the manner and to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section. With respect to the short taxable year ending November 30, 1957, the excess contributions of the second preceding year are X Corporation's excess contributions of $12,000 made in the year ending March 31, 1957, and Y Corporation's excess contributions of $4,000 made in the year ending June 30, 1956, which were not deductible by Y Corporation in the taxable year ending June 30, 1957, because of the 5-percent limitation prescribed by section 170(b)(2), an aggregate of $16,000. Inasmuch as Y Corporation's limitation for the short taxable year ended November 30, 1957, exceeds the contributions made in that year by $1,000, the excess contributions of the second preceding taxable year are deductible in the taxable year ending November 30, 1957, to the extent of $1,000 and the remainder ($15,000) is not deductible by any corporation in any taxable year. The excess contributions of the first preceding taxable year, namely, X Corporation's excess contributions made in the short taxable year ending June 30, 1957, are deductible by Z Corporation in its taxable year 1958, in the manner and to the extent prescribed in section 170(b)(2) and this section.
(v) Z Corporation has been in existence for 3 taxable years. The contributions made in 1956 in excess of the amount deductible for that year under section 170(b)(2) amounted to $30,000. Such excess is deductible by Z Corporation in its taxable year 1957 and, together with X Corporation's excess contributions of $6,000 (derived through Y Corporation) made in the taxable year ending June 30, 1957, in the taxable year 1958, in each instance in the manner and to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section. Thus, $2,000 of the $30,000 excess contributions made in the year 1956 are deducted in 1957 and the remainder ($28,000), together with X Corporation's excess contributions of $6,000 made in the short taxable year ending June 30, 1957, are deducted in 1958 since the aggregate of such amounts plus the contributions actually made in that year does not exceed the 5-percent limitation prescribed by section 170(b)(2).

§ 1.381(c)(20)-1
Carryforward of disallowed business interest.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
Section 381(c)(20) provides that the acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) will succeed to and take into account the carryover of disallowed business interest described in section 163(j)(2) to taxable years ending after the date of distribution or transfer.
(b)
Carryover of disallowed business interest described in section 163(j)(2).
For purposes of section 381(c)(20) and this section, the term
carryover of disallowed business interest described in section 163(j)(2)
means the disallowed business interest expense carryforward (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(11)), including any disallowed disqualified interest (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(12)), and including the distributor or transferor corporation's disallowed business interest expense from the taxable year that ends on the date of distribution or transfer. For the application of section
382 to disallowed business interest expense described in section 163(j)(2), see the regulations in this part under section 382 of the Code, including but not limited to § 1.382-2.
(c)
Limitation on use of disallowed business interest expense carryforwards in the acquiring corporation's first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer
—(1)
In general.
In determining the extent to which the acquiring corporation may use disallowed business interest expense carryforwards in its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the principles of §§ 1.381(c)(1)-1 and 1.381(c)(1)-2 apply with appropriate adjustments, including but not limited to the adjustments described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section.
(2)
One date of distribution or transfer within the acquiring corporation's taxable year.
If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the disallowed business interest expense carryforwards of one or more distributor or transferor corporations on a single date of distribution or transfer within one taxable year of the acquiring corporation, then, for the acquiring corporation's first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, that part of the acquiring corporation's business interest expense deduction (if any) that is attributable to the disallowed business interest expense carryforwards of the distributor or transferor corporation is limited under this paragraph (c) to an amount equal to the post-acquisition portion of the acquiring corporation's section 163(j) limitation, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(3)
Two or more dates of distribution or transfer in the taxable year.
If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the disallowed business interest expense carryforwards of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on two or more dates of distribution or transfer within one taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the limitation to be applied under this paragraph (c) is determined by applying the principles of § 1.381(c)(1)-2(b) to the post-acquisition portion of the acquiring corporation's section 163(j) limitation, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(4)
Definition.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term
post-acquisition portion of the acquiring corporation's section 163(j) limitation
means the amount that bears the same ratio to the acquiring corporation's section 163(j) limitation (within the meaning of § 1.163(j)-1(b)(31)) (or, if the acquiring corporation is a member of a consolidated group, the consolidated group's section 163(j) limitation) for the first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer (taking into account items to which the acquiring corporation succeeds under section 381, other than disallowed business interest expense carryforwards) as the number of days in that year after the date of distribution or transfer bears to the total number of days in that year.
(5)
Examples.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5), unless otherwise stated, X, Y, and Z are taxable domestic C corporations that were incorporated on January 1, 2021 and that file their tax returns on a calendar-year basis; none of X, Y, or Z is a member of a consolidated group; the small business exemption in § 1.163(j)-2(d) does not apply; interest expense is deductible except to the extent of the potential application of section 163(j); and the facts set forth the only corporate activity. The principles of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples.
(i)
Example 1: Transfer before last day of acquiring corporation's taxable year
—(A)
Facts.
On October 31, 2022, X transferred all of its assets to Y in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. For the 2021 taxable year, X had $400x of disallowed business interest expense, and Y had $0 of disallowed business interest expense. For the taxable year ending October 31, 2022, X had an additional $350x of disallowed business interest expense (X did not deduct any of its 2021 carryforwards in its 2022 taxable year). For the taxable year ending December 31, 2022, Y had business interest expense of $100x, business interest income of $200x, and ATI of $1,000x. Y's section 163(j) limitation for the 2022 taxable year was $500x ($200x + (30 percent × $1,000x) = $500x).
(B)
Analysis.
Pursuant to § 1.163(j)-5(b)(2), Y deducts its $100x of current-
year business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(9)) before any disallowed business interest expense carryforwards (including X's carryforwards) from a prior taxable year are deducted. The aggregate disallowed business interest expense of X carried forward under section 381(c)(20) to Y's taxable year ending December 31, 2022, is $750x. However, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for Y's first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the maximum amount of X's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards that Y can deduct is equal to the post-acquisition portion of Y's section 163(j) limitation. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the post-acquisition portion of Y's section 163(j) limitation means Y's section 163(j) limitation times the ratio of the number of days in the taxable year after the date of distribution or transfer to the total number of days in that year. Therefore, only $84x of the aggregate amount ($500x × (61/365) = $84x) may be deducted by Y in that year, and the remaining $666x ($750x−$84x = $666x) is carried forward to the succeeding taxable year.
(C)
Transfer on last day of acquiring corporation's taxable year.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section, except that X's transfer of its assets to Y occurred on December 31, 2022. For the taxable year ending December 31, 2022, X had an additional $350x of disallowed business interest expense (X did not deduct any of its 2021 carryforwards in its 2022 taxable year). For the taxable year ending December 31, 2023, Y had business interest expense of $100x, business interest income of $200x, and ATI of $1,000x. Y's section 163(j) limitation for the 2023 taxable year was $500x ($200x + (30 percent × $1,000x) = $500x). The aggregate disallowed business interest expense of X carried under section 381(c)(20) to Y's taxable year ending December 31, 2023, is $750x. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not limit the amount of X's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards that may be deducted by Y in the 2023 taxable year. Since the amount of Y's section 163(j) limit for the 2023 taxable year was $500x, Y may deduct the full amount ($100x) of its own business interest expense for the 2023 taxable year, along with $400x of X's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards.
(ii)
Example 2: Multiple transferors on same date
—(A)
Facts.
On October 31, 2022, X and Y transferred all of their assets to Z in statutory mergers to which section 361 applies. For the 2021 taxable year, X had $300x of disallowed business interest expense, Y had $200x, and Z had $0. For the taxable year ending October 31, 2022, each of X and Y had an additional $125x of disallowed business interest expense (neither X nor Y deducted any of its 2021 carryforwards in 2022). For the taxable year ending December 31, 2022, Z had business interest expense of $100x, business interest income of $200x, and ATI of $1,000x. Z's section 163(j) limitation for the 2022 taxable year was $500x ($200x + (30 percent × $1,000x) = $500x).
(B)
Analysis.
The aggregate disallowed business interest expense of X and Y carried under section 381(c)(20) to Z's taxable year ending December 31, 2022, is $750x. However, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, only $84x of the aggregate amount ($500x × (61/365) = $84x) may be deducted by Z in that year. Moreover, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, this amount only may be deducted by Z in that year after Z has deducted its $100x of current-year business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(9)).
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning on or after November 13, 2020. However, taxpayers and their related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), may choose to apply the rules of this section to ta axable year beginning after December 31, 2017, so long as the taxpayers and their related parties consistently apply the rules of the section 163(j) regulations (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(37)), and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.382-1, 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, 1.383-0, 1.383-1, 1.469-9, 1.469-11, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-36, 1.1502-79, 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, and 1.383-1), and 1.1504-4, to that taxable year.
[T.D. 9905, 85 FR 56832, Sept. 14, 2020]
§ 1.381(c)(21)-1
Pre-1954 adjustments resulting from change in method of accounting.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
Section 381(c)(21) provides that, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, an acquiring corporation shall take into account the net amount of any adjustments described in section 481(b)(4) (relating to adjustments arising from changes in accounting methods initiated by the taxpayer attributable to pre-1954 Code years) of the distributor or transferor corporation to the extent that such net amount of such adjustments has not been taken into account in any taxable year, including a short taxable year, by the distributor or transferor corporation. The acquiring corporation shall take into account in each taxable year beginning with the taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer the net amount of such adjustments in the same manner and at the same time as such net amount would have been taken into account by the distributor or transferor corporation. Thus, the amount of any such adjustment which the acquiring corporation shall take into account in each taxable year shall be the same amount that would have been taken into account in each taxable year by the distributor or transferor corporation.
(b) This section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On January 1, 1960, X Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer, voluntarily changed its method of accounting giving rise to a $50,000 adjustment under section 481(a), of which $20,000 is attributable to pre-1954 Code years. Under section 481(b)(4) the $20,000 adjustment is to be spread over 1960 and the following 9 years at the rate of $2,000 each year. On November 1, 1963, all the assets of X Corporation are acquired by Y Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Y Corporation reports its income on a fiscal year ending June 30. X and Y Corporations must take into account the $20,000 adjustment at the rate of $2,000 in each taxable year in the following time and manner:
X Corporation
Calendar years 1960-62 ($2,000 × 3)
$6,000
Short taxable year ending Nov. 1, 1963 ($2,000 × 1)
2,000
$8,000
Y Corporation
Fiscal years ending:
June 30, 1964 ($2,000 × 1)
2,000
June 30, 1965-69 ($2,000 × 5)
10,000
12,000
20,000
(c)
Successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies.
The provisions of this section shall apply in the case of successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies. Thus, if R Corporation, which was taking into account adjustments described in section 481(b)(4), distributes or transfers its assets to S Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, and S Corporation was required to take into account any remaining portion of such adjustments under section 381(c)(21) and this section, and if subsequently S Corporation distributes or transfers its assets to T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then T Corporation, under section 381(c)(21) and this section, shall take into account any remaining portion of such adjustments not previously taken into account by R and S Corporations.
(d)
Acquiring corporation not receiving all the assets.
The adjustments described in this section acquired from a distributor or transferor corporation by an acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies is not reduced by reason of the fact that the acquiring corporation does not acquire 100 percent of the assets of the distributor or transferor corporation.
[T.D. 6553, 26 FR 2171, Mar. 15, 1961]
§ 1.381(c)(22)-1
Successor life insurance company.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
If in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, a distributor or transferor corporation which is an insurance company is acquired by a corporation which is an insurance company in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, section 381(c)(22) provides that the acquiring corporation shall take into account the appropriate items which the distributor or transferor corporation was required to take into account for purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore, except as otherwise provided by this section, the acquiring corporation shall take into account the items described in paragraphs (2) through (21), other than
paragraphs (14), (15), and (17), of section 381(c) and the regulations thereunder. For example, the acquiring corporation shall take into account the reserves described in section 810(c) distributed or transferred to it as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer by the distributor or transferor corporation in accordance with the provisions of section 381(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder. For provisions defining the date of distribution or transfer, see paragraph (b) of § 1.381(b)-1.
(b)
Items required to be taken into account by acquiring corporation.
If a transaction meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the acquiring corporation shall, except as otherwise provided, take into account as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer the following items of the distributor or transferor corporation:
(1) The operations loss carryovers (as determined under section 812), subject to conditions and limitations consistent with the conditions and limitations prescribed in section 381(c)(1) and the regulations thereunder. For example, a loss from operations for a loss year of a distributor or transferor corporation which ends on or before the last day of a loss year of the acquiring corporation shall be considered to be a loss from operations for a year prior to such loss year of the acquiring corporation. All references in section 381(c)(1) and the regulations thereunder to section 172 shall be construed as referring to the appropriate corresponding provisions of section 812. Thus, a reference to section 172(b) shall be construed as referring to section 812 (b) and (d). In determining the span of years for which a loss from operations may be carried, the number of taxable years for which the distributor or transferor corporation was authorized to do business as an insurance company shall be taken into account. For purposes of this determination, the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation which ends on the date of distribution or transfer shall be taken into account even though such taxable year is a period of less than 12 months.
(2)(i) The investment yield and the beginning of the year asset balance for the distributor or transferor corporation's taxable year ending with the close of the date of distribution or transfer. Such items shall be integrated with the investment yield and beginning of the year asset balance of the acquiring corporation for its first taxable year ending after such date of distribution or transfer for purposes of determining the current earnings rate of the acquiring corporation for such taxable year. Furthermore, for purposes of determining the average earnings rate of the acquiring corporation, the investment yield and mean of the assets of the distributor or transferor corporation for its 4 taxable years immediately preceding its taxable year which closes with the date of distribution or transfer shall be integrated with the investment yield and mean of the assets of the acquiring corporation for such corresponding taxable years.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X qualified as a life insurance company in 1949. Y qualified as a life insurance company in 1951. On June 30, 1961, at which time both X and Y were life insurance companies (as defined in section 801(a)), X transferred all its assets to Y in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. For its taxable year ending on June 30, 1961, X had investment yield of $15 and assets at the beginning of such taxable year of $450. For purposes of determining its current earnings rate for its taxable year ending on December 31, 1961, Y had investment yield of $45 (including the $15 of investment yield of X), assets at the beginning of such taxable year of $1,250 (including the $450 of X's assets at the beginning of its taxable year 1961), and assets at the end of such taxable year of $1,750 (after the application of section 806(a)). Under the provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the current earnings rate of Y for the taxable year 1961 would be 3 percent, determined by dividing the investment yield of Y, $45, by the mean of the assets of Y, $1,500 ($1,250 + $1,750 ÷ 2). In order to determine its average earnings rate and adjusted reserves rate for the taxable year 1961, Y would make up the following schedule:
Investment yield
Taxable year
Column 1—X
Column 2—Y
Column 3 (Col. 1 + Col. 2) integrated investment yield
Mean of assets
Column 4—X
Column 5—Y
Column 6 (Col. 4 + Col. 5) integrated means of assets
Current earnings rate of Y
Column 7 (Col. 3 ÷ Col. 6)

3.3
For the taxable year 1961, Y would have an average earnings rate of 3.2 percent, computed by taking into account the current earnings rates for the taxable year 1961 and each of the 4 taxable years immediately preceding such taxable year. The adjusted reserves rate for such taxable year would be 3 percent since the current earnings rate of 3 percent for 1961 is lower than the average earnings rate of 3.2 percent.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example (1),
except that the taxable year in issue is 1962, and the current earnings rate of Y for such taxable year was 3.8 percent. For the taxable year 1962, Y would have an average earnings rate of 3.3 percent, computed by taking into account only the current earnings rates for the taxable year 1962 and each of the 4 taxable years immediately preceding such taxable year. The adjusted reserves rate for such taxable year would be 3.3 percent since the average earnings rate of 3.3 percent is lower than the 1962 current earnings rate of 3.8 percent.
(3) To the extent there are any amounts accrued for discounts in the nature of interest which have not been included as interest paid under section 805(e)(3), the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation for purposes of including such amounts as interest paid.
(4) Any adjustment required by section 806(b) with respect to an item described in section 810(c) shall be made by the acquiring corporation in its first taxable year which begins after the date of distribution or transfer.
(5) The amount of the deduction provided by section 809(d)(6), as limited by section 809(f), for all taxable years of the distributor or transferor corporation which end on and before the date of distribution or transfer (irrespective of whether or not the distributor or transferor corporation claimed this deduction for such taxable years) for the purpose of determining the limitation under section 809(d)(6).
(6) [Reserved]
(7)(i) The dollar balances in the shareholders surplus account, policyholders surplus account, and other accounts provided, however, that the acquiring corporation is a stock life insurance company. The dollar balance in the policyholders surplus account shall reflect the amount (if any) treated as a subtraction from such account by reason of the application of the limitation provided under section 815(d)(4) immediately prior to the close of the date of distribution or transfer. To the extent that any amount must be added to the shareholders surplus account as a result of the application of the limitation provided under section 815(d)(4), the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation as of its first taxable year which begins after the date of distribution or transfer. However, any amounts attributable to money or other property not permitted to be received without the recognition of gain (
i.e.
, boot) distributed to a person other than the acquiring corporation under section 381(a) shall be treated as a distribution under section 815.
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, if the distributor or transferor corporation distributes or transfers less than 50 percent of its insurance business to the acquiring corporation, then the acquiring corporation shall succeed to a ratable portion of the dollar balances in the distributor's or transferor's shareholders surplus account, policyholders surplus account, and other accounts. The percentage of the accounts to which the acquiring corporation succeeds is determined by the ratio of the distributor's or transferor's insurance
reserves for the contracts transferred to the acquiring corporation, as maintained under section 816(b), to the distributor's or transferor's reserves for all of its contracts maintained under section 816(b) immediately before the earlier of the distribution or transfer or the adoption of the plan of liquidation or reorganization. For transactions in which the distributor liquidates pursuant to an election under section 338(h)(10), see § 1.338-11(f) for the treatment of its remaining policyholders surplus account. For all other transactions subject to this paragraph, the distributor or transferor must take into account as income its remaining policyholders surplus account to the extent the fair market value of its assets (net of liabilities) distributed or transferred to the acquiring corporation or to the transferor's shareholders pursuant to the plan of liquidation or reorganization exceeds the distributor's or transferor's remaining shareholders surplus account.
(iii) If, pursuant to a plan in existence at the time of the liquidation or reorganization, the acquiring corporation transfers any insurance or annuity contract it received in the liquidation or reorganization to another person, then, for purposes of paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section, that contract shall be deemed to have been transferred by the transferor to that other person after the adoption of the plan of liquidation or reorganization. If the transferor is an old target within the meaning of § 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2), any transfer by the acquiring corporation to the purchasing corporation (as defined in § 1.338-2(c)(11)) or to any person related to the purchasing corporation within the meaning of section 197(f)(9)(C) within two years of the transfer described in section 381(a) will be presumed to have been pursuant to a plan in existence at the time of the liquidation or reorganization.
(iv) If the acquiring corporation is a mutual life insurance company, the dollar balances in the shareholders surplus account, policyholders surplus account, and other accounts shall not be taken into account by such acquiring corporation and the distributor or transferor corporation shall be subject to the provisions of section 815(d)(2)(A) as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer.
(v) The provisions of this paragraph (b)(7) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
P buys the stock of insurance company target, T, from S for $16, and P and S make a section 338(h)(10) election for T. T transfers no insurance contracts to S, or any related party, in connection with the transaction. Further, assume that T had $10 in its policyholders surplus account and no balance in its shareholders surplus account or other accounts. Immediately before the deemed asset sale, old T is required to include as ordinary income the $10 in the policyholders surplus account.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
, except that T holds a block of life insurance contracts P does not wish to acquire, and, immediately before the sale of T stock, S causes T to distribute the unwanted block of insurance contracts to S. Further, assume that S is an insurance company, that the distribution of contracts is one of series of distributions in complete cancellation or redemption of all of its stock (the others occurring under § 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(4)(i)) that qualifies as a complete liquidation under section 332, and that old T's tax reserves with respect to the distributed contracts represent one-tenth of old T's tax reserves with respect to all of its life insurance contracts. Because T transfers less than 50 percent of its life insurance business to S in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, S succeeds to a ratable portion of old T's policyholders surplus account ($1), and old T includes as ordinary income the remaining $9 of that account.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2
, except that 14 months after the deemed asset sale, S and X, a person related to new T under section 197(f)(9)(C), engage in an indemnity reinsurance transaction involving the contracts transferred to S from old T. Because X is related to the purchasing corporation (P) under section 197(f)(9)(C), and X receives contracts from the acquiring corporation (S) that S acquired from old T within two years of the transfer from old T to S, the contracts are presumed to have been transferred pursuant to a plan in existence at the time of old T's liquidation. If S cannot establish otherwise, old T is treated as having distributed the remainder of its policyholders surplus account. In that case, in the taxable year of the indemnity reinsurance transaction, S takes into account as ordinary income the portion of the old T's accounts ($1) that old T or S has not previously taken into account as income.
(8) To the extent that any amount must be added to the shareholders surplus account as a result of an election made under section 815(d)(1) by the distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation as of its first taxable year which begins after the date of distribution or transfer.
(9) The amount of the life insurance reserves at the end of 1958, but only for the purpose of applying the limitation provided under section 815(d)(4)(B).
(10) To the extent there are amounts subject to the provisions of section 817(d), the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation.
(11) To the extent there are any installments of tax imposed by section 818(e)(3)(A) remaining to be paid, the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation for the purpose of paying such installments.
(12) The capital loss carryovers, subject to conditions and limitations consistent with the conditions and limitations prescribed in section 381(c)(3) and the regulations thereunder, except that any net capital loss of the distributor or transferor corporation for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1959, shall not be taken into account. See section 817(c).
(13)(i) The transferor's unamortized policy acquisition expenses or positive or negative capitalization requirements on its specified insurance contracts.
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(13)(i) of this section, if the distributor or transferor corporation transfers less than 50 percent of its insurance business to the acquiring corporation, then the acquiring corporation shall succeed to a ratable portion of the transferor's unamortized policy acquisition expenses or positive or negative capitalization requirements on its specified insurance contracts. The percentage of such acquisition expenses or positive or negative capitalization requirements to which the acquiring corporation succeeds is determined by the ratio of the distributor's or transferor's insurance reserves for the contracts transferred to the acquiring corporation, as maintained under section 816(b), to the distributor's or transferor's reserves for all of its contracts maintained under section 816(b) immediately before the earlier of the distribution or transfer or the adoption of the plan of liquidation or reorganization. For amounts of the distributor's or transferor's unamortized policy acquisition expenses or positive or negative capitalization requirements on its specified insurance contracts to which the acquirer does not succeed to under this paragraph, and, for transactions in which the transferor liquidates pursuant to an election under section 338(h)(10), see § 1.338-11(f) for the treatment of its capitalized amounts under section 848.
(iii) If, pursuant to a plan in existence at the time of the liquidation or reorganization, the acquiring corporation transfers any insurance or annuity contract it received in the liquidation or reorganization to another person, then, for purposes of paragraph (b)(13)(ii) of this section, that contract shall be deemed to have been transferred by the transferor to that other person after the adoption of the plan of liquidation or reorganization. If the transferor is an old target within the meaning of § 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2), any transfer by the acquiring corporation to the purchasing corporation (as defined in § 1.338-2(c)(11)) or to any person related to the purchasing corporation within the meaning of section 197(f)(9)(C) within two years of the transfer described in section 381(a) will be presumed to have been pursuant to a plan in existence at the time of the liquidation or reorganization.
(14) The special loss discount account, provided, however, that the acquiring corporation will succeed to the special loss discount account only to the extent that it is attributable to the portion of the transferor's insurance business acquired by the acquiring corporation in the section 381 transaction.

§ 1.381(c)(23)-1
Investment credit carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
(1) Section 381(c)(23) requires the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381 applies to succeed to and take into account under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, the investment credit carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation. To determine the amount of these carryovers as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer, and to integrate them with any carryovers and carrybacks of the acquiring corporation for purposes of determining the amount of credit allowed by section 38 to the acquiring corporation for taxable years ending after the date of distribution or transfer, it is necessary to apply the provisions of sections 46, 47, and 48 in accordance with the conditions and limitations of this section.
(2) The investment credit carryovers and carrybacks of the acquiring corporation determined as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be computed without reference to any unused credit of a distributor or transferor corporation. The investment credit carryovers of a distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be determined without reference to any unused credit of the acquiring corporation.
(b)
Carryback of unused credits.
An unused credit of the acquiring corporation for any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer shall not be carried back in computing the credit allowed by section 38 to a distributor or transferor corporation. However, an unused credit of the acquiring corporation for any such taxable year shall be carried back in accordance with section 46(b)(1) in computing the credit allowed to the acquiring corporation for a taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer. If a distributor or transferor corporation remains in existence after the date of distribution or transfer, an unused credit sustained by it for any taxable year beginning after
such date shall be carried back in accordance with section 46(b)(1) in computing the credit allowed by section 38 to such corporation for a taxable year ending on or before that date, but may not be carried back or over in computing the credit allowed by section 38 to the acquiring corporation.
(c)
Computation of carryovers and carrybacks.
(1) Subject to the modifications set forth in this paragraph, the provisions of § 1.46-2 shall apply in computing carryovers and carrybacks of unused credits to taxable years of the acquiring corporation.
(2)(i) The investment credit carryovers available to the distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall first be carried to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after that date. This rule applies whether the date of distribution or transfer is on the last day, or any other day, of the acquiring corporation's taxable year.
(ii) The investment credit carryovers available to the distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be carried to the acquiring corporation without diminution by reason of the fact that the acquiring corporation does not acquire 100 percent of the assets of the distributor or transferor corporation.
(3) An unused credit of a distributor or transferor corporation for a taxable year which ends on or before the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation shall be considered to be an unused credit for a year prior to such taxable year of the acquiring corporation. If the acquiring corporation has acquired the assets of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on the same date of distribution or transfer, the unused credit years of the distributor or transferor corporations shall be taken into account in the order in which such years terminate. If any one of the unused credit years of a distributor or transferor corporation ends on the same day as the unused credit year of another distributor or transferor corporation, either unused credit year may be taken into account before the other.
(4) The extent to which an investment credit carryover of a distributor or transferor corporation or of an acquiring corporation from an unused credit year ending before January 1, 1971, may be taken into account by the acquiring corporation for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1970, shall be determined without regard to the credit earned by the acquiring corporation for such year. Thus, in such a case, the amount of unused credit from such unused credit years which may be taken into account in a taxable year of the acquiring corporation beginning after December 31, 1970, shall be determined solely with reference to the limitation based on amount of tax for such taxable year (without reduction for the credit earned for such year).
(d)
Computation of carryovers when date of distribution or transfer occurs on last day of acquiring corporation's taxable year.
The computation of the investment credit carryovers from the distributor or transferor corporation and from the acquiring corporation in a case where the date of distribution or transfer occurs on the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X Corporation and Y Corporation were organized on January 1, 1971, and each corporation files its return on the calendar year basis. On December 31, 1972, X transfers all its assets to Y in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. X's credit earned and its limitation based on amount of tax for its taxable years 1971 and 1972 are as follows:
X Corporation's taxable year
Credit earned
Limitation based on amount of tax
1971
$10,000
$5,000
1972
5,000
3,000
Y's credit earned and its limitation based on amount of tax for its taxable years 1971 through 1973 are as follows:

The sequence for the allowance of unused credits of X Corporation and Y Corporation, and the computation of the carryovers to Y
Corporation's calendar year 1974, may be illustrated as follows:
(1)
X Corporation's 1971 unused credit.
The carryover to Y 1974 is $0, computed as follows:

$2,000
Excess of Y's 1973 limitation based on tax over credit earned

7,000
0
Carryover to Y's year 1974
2,000
(5) The aggregate of the investment credit carryovers to Y's year 1974 is $3,000, computed as follows:
X's 1972 unused credit
$1,000
Y's 1972 unused credit
2,000
Total
3,000
(e)
Computation of carryovers when date of distribution or transfer is not on last day of acquiring corporation's taxable year.
(1) If the date of distribution or transfer occurs on any day other than the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the amount which may be added to the amount allowable as a credit by section 38 for the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date of distribution or transfer (hereinafter called the “year of acquisition”) shall be determined in the following manner. The year of acquisition shall be considered as though it were 2 taxable years. The first of such 2 taxable years shall be referred to in this paragraph as the preacquisition part year and shall begin with the beginning of the year of acquisition and end with the close of the date of distribution or transfer. The second of such 2 taxable years shall be referred to in this paragraph as the postacquisition part year and shall begin with the day following the date of distribution or transfer and shall end with the close of the year of acquisition.
(2) The excess limitation for the year of acquisition (i.e., the excess of the limitation based on the amount of tax for such year over the amount of credit earned for such year) shall be divided between the preacquisition part year and the postacquisition part year in proportion to the number of days in each. Thus, if in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies Y Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer, acquires the assets of X Corporation on June 30, 1975, and Y Corporation has an excess limitation of $36,500 for its calendar year 1975, then the excess limitation for the preacquisition part year would be $18,100 ($36,500 × 181/365) and the excess limitation for the postacquisition part year would be $18,400 ($36,500 × 184/365).
(3) An unused credit of the acquiring corporation shall be carried to and applied against the excess limitation for the preacquisition part year and then carried to and applied against the excess limitation for the postacquisition part year, whereas an unused credit of the distributor or transferor corporation shall not be carried to the preacquisition part year but shall only be carried to and applied against the excess limitation for the postacquisition part year. For special rule relating to carryovers from taxable years ending before January 1,
1971, to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, see subparagraph (6) of this paragraph.
(4) Though considered as two separate taxable years for purposes of this paragraph, the preacquisition part year and the postacquisition part year are treated as one taxable year in determining the years to which an unused credit is carried under section 46(b)(1).
(5) The preceding subparagraphs may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X Corporation and Y Corporation were organized on January 1, 1971, and each corporation files its return on the calendar year basis. On May 1, 1972, X transfers all its assets to Y in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. X's credit earned and its limitation based on amount of tax for its taxable years 1971 and ending May 1, 1972, are as follows:

(6) If the year of acquisition is a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1970, and if there is an unused credit of the distributor or transferor corporation or of the acquiring corporation arising in an unused credit year ending before January 1, 1971, which may be carried to such year of acquisition (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section), then in applying subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph, in lieu of dividing the excess limitation for the year of acquisition between the preacquisition and postacquisition part years, only the limitation based on the amount of tax for such year (i.e., without reduction for the credit earned) shall be divided between the preacquisition and postacquisition part years. If there is also an unused credit arising in an unused credit year ending after December 31, 1970, which may be carried to the year of acquisition, then for the purpose of determining the amount of such unused credit which may be taken into account for such year of acquisition, the credit earned for the year of acquisition shall first be applied against the limitation based on amount of tax for the preacquisition part year (reduced by any investment credit carryovers to such part year from unused credit years ending before January 1, 1971) and the excess, if any, shall then be applied against the limitation based on amount of tax for the postacquisition part year (also reduced by any investment credit carryovers to such part year from unused credit years ending before January 1, 1971).
(7) Subparagraph (6) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.

(8) If the year of acquisition is a taxable year to which the limitation provided in § 1.46-2(b)(2) (relating to 20- percent limitation on carryovers and carrybacks to certain taxable years) applies, then for purposes of applying such limitation the preacquisition part year and the postacquisition part year shall each be considered a fractional part of a year, but, if the date of distribution or transfer is not on the last day of a month, the entire month in which the date of distribution or transfer occurs shall be considered as included in the preacquisition part year and no portion thereof shall be considered as included in the postacquisition part year.
(9) If the acquiring corporation succeeds to the investment credit carryovers of two or more distributor or transferor corporations on two or more dates of distribution or transfer during the same taxable year of the acquiring corporation, the manner in which the unused credits of the distributor or transferor corporations shall be applied shall be determined consistently with the rules prescribed in paragraph (c) of § 1.381(c)(1)-2.
(f)
Successive acquiring corporations.
An acquiring corporation which, in a distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies, acquires the assets of a distributor or transferor corporation which previously acquired the assets of another corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall succeed to and take into account, subject to the conditions and limitations of § 1.46-2 and this section, the investment credit carryovers available to the first acquiring corporation under § 1.46-2 and this section.

§ 1.381(c)(25)-1
Deficiency dividend of a qualified investment entity.
(a)
Carryover requirement.
If a distributor or transferor corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies—
(1) Was a qualified investment entity (within the meaning of section 860(b)) for any taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer, and
(2) A determination (as defined in section 860(e)) establishes that the transferor or distributor corporation is liable for the tax imposed by section 11(a), 56(a), 852(b), 857(b)(1), 857(b)(3)(A), or 1201(a) for such taxable year, then in determining the liability for such tax the deduction described in section 860 shall be allowed pursuant to section 381(c)(25) to such corporation for the amount of deficiency dividends paid by the acquiring corporation with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of section 860 and the regulations thereunder apply with respect to a deficiency dividend deduction allowable pursuant to section 381(c)(25).
(b)
Deficiency dividends paid by the acquiring corporation with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation.
A deficiency dividend paid by the acquiring corporation with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation must be a distribution that would satisfy the definition of a deficiency dividend under section 860(f) if paid by the distributor or transferor corporation to its own shareholders. The distribution, however, shall be paid by the acquiring corporation to its own shareholders. The distribution also shall be paid after the date of distribution or transfer and on, or within 90 days after, the date of the determination but before the acquiring corporation files a claim under paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Claim for deduction.
A claim for deduction under this section shall be made by the acquiring corporation on Form 976 and shall be filed within 120 days after the date of the determination. The form shall contain, or be accompanied by, the information required under § 1.860-2(b)(2) in sufficient detail to properly identify the facts with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation. The required certified copy of the resolution authorizing the payment of the dividend shall be that of the trustees, board of directors, or other authority, of the acquiring corporation. Necessary changes may be made in Form 976 in order to carry out the provisions of this paragraph. The claim shall be filed with the district director, or director of the internal revenue service center, with whom the return of the distributor or transferor corporation to which the claim relates was filed.
(d)
Effect on dividends paid deduction.
A deficiency dividend paid by the acquiring corporation that is allowable as a deduction to a distributor or transferor corporation pursuant to section 381(c)(25) shall not become a part of the dividends paid deduction of the acquiring corporation under section 561 for any taxable year.
(e)
Successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies.
The provisions of this section shall apply in the case of successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies. Thus, if X corporation transfers its assets to Y corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies and if Y corporation transfers its assets to Z corporation in a subsequent transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then, subject to the provisions of this section, X corporation may take a deficiency dividend deduction for the amount of deficiency dividends paid by Z corporation with respect to X corporation.

[T.D. 9487, 75 FR 33991, June 16, 2010]
§ 1.382-2
General rules for ownership change.
(a)
Certain definitions for purposes of sections 382 and 383 and the regulations thereunder.
The following definitions apply for purposes of sections 382 and 383 and the regulations thereunder.
(1)
Loss corporation
—(i)
In general.
The term
loss corporation
means a corporation which—
(A) Is entitled to use a net operating loss carryforward, a capital loss carryover, a carryover of excess foreign taxes under section 904(c), a carryforward of a general business credit under section 39, a carryover of a minimum tax credit under section 53, or a section 382 disallowed business interest carryforward described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section;
(B) For the taxable year that includes a testing date, as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section or § 1.382-2T(a)(2)(i), whichever is applicable (determined for purposes of this
paragraph (a)(1) without regard to whether the corporation is a loss corporation), has a net operating loss, a net capital loss, excess foreign taxes under section 904(c), unused general business credits under section 38, or an unused minimum tax credit under section 53; or
(C) Has a net unrealized built-in loss (determined for purposes of this paragraph (a)(1) by treating the date on which such determination is made as the change date). See section 382(h)(3) for the definition of net unrealized built-in loss.
See section 383 and § 1.383-1 for rules relating to a loss corporation that has an ownership change and has capital losses, excess foreign taxes, general business credits or minimum tax credits. Any predecessor or successor to a loss corporation described in this paragraph (a)(1) is also a loss corporation.
(ii)
Distributor or transferor loss corporation in a transaction under section 381.
Notwithstanding that a loss corporation ceases to exist under state law, if its disallowed business interest expense carryforwards, net operating loss carryforwards, excess foreign taxes, or other items described in section 381(c) are succeeded to and taken into account by an acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a), such loss corporation will be treated as continuing in existence until—
(A) Any pre-change losses (excluding pre-change credits described in § 1.383-1(c)(3)), determined as if the date of such transaction were the change date, are fully utilized or expire under section 163(j), 172, or 1212;
(B) Any net unrealized built-in losses, determined as if the date of such transaction were the change date, may no longer be treated as pre-change losses; and
(C) Any pre-change credits (described in § 1.383-1(c)(3)), determined as if the date of such transaction were the change date, are fully utilized or expire under sections 39, 53, or 904(c).
Following a transaction described in the preceding sentence, the stock of the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the stock of the loss corporation for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs with respect to the pre-change losses and net unrealized built-in losses that may be treated as pre-change losses of the distributor or transferor corporation.
(iii)
Separate accounting required for losses and credits of an acquiring corporation and a distributor or transferor loss corporation.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, pre-change losses (determined as if the testing date were the change date and treating the amount of any net unrealized built-in loss as a pre-change loss), that are succeeded to and taken into account by an acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies must be accounted for separately from losses and credits of the acquiring corporation for purposes of applying this section. See
Example (2)
of § 1.382-2T(e)(2)(iv) of this section.
(iv)
End of separate accounting for losses and credits of distributor or transferor loss corporation.
The separate tracking of owner shifts of the stock of an acquiring corporation required by paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section with respect to the net operating loss carryovers and other attributes described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section ends when a fold-in event occurs. A fold-in event is either an ownership change of the distributor or transferor corporation in connection with, or after, the transaction to which section 381(a) applies, or a period of 5 consecutive years following the section 381(a) transaction during which the distributor or transferor corporation has not had an ownership change. Starting on the day after the earlier of the change date (but not earlier than the day of the section 381(a) transaction) or the last day of the 5 consecutive year period, the losses and other attributes of the distributor or transferor corporation are treated as losses and attributes of the acquiring corporation for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs with respect to such losses. Also, for purposes of determining the beginning of the acquiring corporation's testing period, such losses are considered to arise either in a taxable year that begins not earlier than the later of the day following the change date or the day of the section 381(a) transaction, or in a taxable year
that begins 3 years before the end of the 5 consecutive year period. Pre-change losses of a distributor or transferor corporation that are subject to a limitation under section 382 continue to be subject to the limitation notwithstanding the occurrence of a fold-in event. Any ownership change that occurs in connection with, or subsequent to, the section 381 transaction may result in an additional, lesser limitation with respect to such pre-change losses.
(v)
Application to other successor corporations.
This paragraph (a)(1) also applies, as the context may require, to successor corporations other than successors in section 381(a) transactions. For example, if a corporation receives assets from the loss corporation that have basis in excess of value, the recipient corporation's basis for the assets is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the loss corporation's basis, and the amount by which basis exceeds value is material, the recipient corporation is a successor corporation subject to this paragraph (a)(1).
(2)
Pre-change loss.
The term
pre-change loss
means—
(i) Any net operating loss carryforward of the old loss corporation to the taxable year ending on the change date or in which the change date occurs;
(ii) Any net operating loss of the old loss corporation for the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs to the extent such loss is allocable to the period in such year on or before the change date;
(iii) Any recognized built-in loss for any recognition period taxable year (within the meaning of 382(h));
(iv) Any pre-change capital losses described in § 1.383-1T(c)(2)(i) and (ii);
(v) Any pre-change credits described in 1.383-1T(c)(3); and
(vi) Any section 382 disallowed business interest carryforward.
(3)
Stock
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(3)(i) and § 1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) and (iii), the term
stock
means stock other than stock described in section 1504(a)(4). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, stock that is not described in section 1504(a)(4) solely because it is entitled to vote as a result of dividend arrearages shall be treated as so described and thus shall not be considered stock. Stock described in section 1504(a)(4), however, is not excluded for purposes of determining the value of the loss corporation under section 382(e). The determination of the percentage of stock of any corporation owned by any person shall be made on the basis of the relative fair market value of the stock owned by such person to the total fair market value of the outstanding stock of the corporation. Solely for purposes of determining the percentage of stock owned by a person, each share of all the outstanding shares of stock that have the same material terms is treated as having the same value. Thus, for example, a control premium or blockage discount is disregarded in determining the percentage of stock owned by any person.
(ii)
Convertible stock.
The term
stock
includes any convertible stock. For rules regarding the treatment of certain convertible stock as an option, see § 1.382-4(d)(9)(ii).
(4)
Testing date
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, a loss corporation is required to determine whether an ownership change has occurred immediately after any owner shift, or issuance or transfer (including an issuance or transfer described in § 1.382-4(d)(8)(i) or (ii)) of an option with respect to stock of the loss corporation that is treated as exercised under § 1.382-4(d)(2). Each date on which a loss corporation is required to make a determination of whether an ownership change has occurred is referred to as a testing date. All computations of increases in percentage ownership are to be made as of the close of the testing date and any transactions described in this paragraph (a)(4) that occur on that date are treated as occurring simultaneously at the close of the testing date. See § 1.382-2T(e)(1) for the definition of owner shift. The term
option,
as used in this paragraph (a)(4), includes interests that are treated as options under § 1.382-4(d)(9).
(ii)
Exceptions.
A loss corporation is not required to determine whether an ownership change has occurred immediately after—
(A) Any transfer of stock, or an option with respect to stock, of the loss corporation in any of the circumstances described in section 382(l)(3)(B) (death, gift, divorce, etc.); or
(B) The transfer of an option described in § 1.382-4(d)(11)(i) or (ii) (relating to transfers between persons who are not 5-percent shareholders or between members of certain public groups).
(5)
Successor corporation.
A successor corporation is a distributee or transferee corporation that succeeds to and takes into account items described in section 381(c) from a corporation as the result of an acquisition of assets described in section 381(a). A successor corporation also includes, as the context may require, a corporation which receives an asset or assets from another corporation if the corporation's basis for the asset(s) is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the other corporation's basis and the amount by which basis differs from value is, in the aggregate, material.
(6)
Predecessor corporation.
A predecessor corporation is a distributor or transferor corporation that distributes or transfers its assets to an acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a). A predecessor corporation also includes, as the context may require, a corporation which transfers an asset or assets to another corporation if the transferee's basis for the asset(s) is determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the corporation's basis and the amount by which basis differs from value is, in the aggregate, material.
(7)
Section 382 disallowed business interest carryforward.
The term
section 382 disallowed business interest carryforward
includes the following items:
(i) The loss corporation's disallowed business interest expense carryforwards (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(11)), including disallowed disqualified interest (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(12)), as of the date of the ownership change.
(ii) The loss corporation's current-year business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(9)) in the change year (as defined in § 1.382-6(g)(1)) that is allocable to the pre-change period (as defined in § 1.382-6(g)(2)) under § 1.382-6(a) or (b) and that becomes disallowed business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(10)).
(8)
Testing period.
Notwithstanding the temporal limitations provided in § 1.382-2T(d)(3)(i), the testing period for a loss corporation can begin as early as the first day of the first taxable year from which there is a section 382 disallowed business interest carryforward to the first taxable year ending after the testing date.

Rules provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the rules provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section apply with respect to any convertible stock.
(ii)
Certain convertible preferred stock.
Convertible stock that, when issued, would be described in section 1504(a)(4) by disregarding subparagraph (D) thereof and by ignoring the potential participation in corporate growth that the conversion feature may offer is treated as stock described in that section (and thus is not treated as stock for the purpose of determining whether an ownership change occurs, but is taken into account for the purpose of determining the value of the loss corporation immediately before an ownership change; see sections 382(e)(1) and 382(k)(6)(A)) if—
(A) The stock was issued on or after July 20, 1988, and prior to November 5, 1992; or
(B) The stock was issued prior to July 20, 1988, and the loss corporation makes the election described in Notice 88-67, 1988-1 C.B. 555, (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter for availability of Cumulative Bulletins (C.B.)) on or before the earlier of the date prescribed in the Notice or December 7, 1992.

Rules provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A), (a)(1)(ii), (iv), and (v), (a)(2)(iv) through (vi), (a)(3)(i), and (a)(4) through (8) of this section.
The rules provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A), (a)(1)(ii), (iv), and (v), (a)(2)(iv) through (vi), (a)(3)(i), and (a)(4) through (8) of
this section apply to testing dates occurring on or after November 13, 2020. For loss corporations that have testing dates occurring before November 13, 2020, see § 1.382-2 as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2019. However, taxpayers and their related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), may choose to apply the rules of this section to testing dates occurring during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before November 13, 2020, so long as the taxpayers and their related parties consistently apply the rules of this section, the section 163(j) regulations (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(37)), §§ 1.382-1, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, 1.383-0, and 1.383-1, and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.381(c)(20)-1, 1.469-9, 1.469-11, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-36, 1.1502-79, 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, and 1.383-1), and 1.1504-4, to that taxable year.

§ 1.382-2T
Definition of ownership change under section 382, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (temporary).
(a)
Ownership change
—(1)
In general.
A corporation is a new loss corporation and thus subject to limitation under section 382 only if an ownership change has occurred with respect to such corporation. An ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if it is a loss corporation on a testing date and, immediately after the close of the testing date, the percentage of stock of the corporation owned by one or more 5-percent shareholders has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock of such corporation owned by such shareholders at any time during the testing period. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for the definition of testing date. See paragraph (d) of this section for the definition of testing period. See § 1.382-2(a)(1) and paragraph (f)(3) of this section for the respective definition of loss corporation and new loss corporation. See paragraph (g) of this section for the definition of 5-percent shareholder. See section 383 and § 1.383-1 for rules relating to loss corporations that have an ownership change and have capital loss carryovers, excess foreign taxes carried over under section 904(c), carryovers of general business credits under section 39, or unused minimum tax credits under section 53.
(2)
Events requiring a determination of whether an ownership change has occurred
—(i)
Testing dates prior to November 5, 1992.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(2)(i), a loss corporation is required to determine whether an ownership change has occurred immediately after any owner shift, any equity structure shift, or any transaction in which an option with respect to stock of the loss corporation is—
(A) Transferred to (or by) a 5-percent shareholder (or a person who would be 5-percent shareholder if the option were treated as exercised), or
(B) Issued by the loss corporation, a first tier entity, or a higher tier entity that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any transfer of stock of the loss corporation (or an option with respect to such stock) in any of the circumstances described in section 382(l)(3)(B), or any equity structure shift that is not also an owner shift, is not an event that requires the loss corporation to make a determination of whether an ownership change has occurred. For purposes of this section, each date on which a loss corporation is required to make a determination of whether an ownership change has occurred is referred to as a testing date, all computations of increases in percentage ownership are to be made as of the close of the testing date, and any transactions described in this paragraph (a)(2)(i) that occur on that date are treated as occurring simultaneously at the close of the testing date. See paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section for the respective definitions of owner shift and equity structure shift. See paragraphs (f)(9) and (14)
of this section for the respective definitions of first tier entity and higher tier entity. See paragraph (m)(4)(vii) of this section for special rules regarding the effective date of the provisions of this paragraph (a)(2)(i).
(ii) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.382-11(a).
(iii)
Records to be maintained by loss corporation.
A loss corporation shall keep such records as are necessary to determine: (A) The identity of its 5-percent shareholders, (B) the percentage of its stock owned by each such 5-percent shareholder, and (C) whether the section 382 limitation is applicable. Such records shall be retained so long as they may be material in the administration of any internal revenue law.
(b)
Nomenclature and assumptions.
For purposes of the example in this section—
(1) L is a loss corporation, and, if there is more than one loss corporation, they are designated as L
1
, L
2
, L
3
, etc.
(2) P is a corporation that is not a loss corporation, and, if there is more than one such corporation, they are designated as P

3
, etc.

(5) Unless otherwise stated—
(i) A, B, C, D, AA, BB, CC, and DD are unrelated individuals who own interests in corporations or other entities only to the extent expressly stated,
(ii) All corporations have one class of stock outstanding and each share of stock has the same fair market value as each other share,
(iii) The capital structure of the loss corporation and its business do not change over time, and
(iv) The rules of paragraphs (k)(2) and (4) of this section are not applicable.
(6) Public L represents a group of unrelated individuals and entities that own direct (and not indirect) stock ownership interests in loss corporation L, each of whom owns less than five percent of the stock of the loss corporation, and, if there is more than one loss corporation, such groups are designated as Public L

3

(c)
Computing the amount of increases in percentage ownership
—(1)
In general.
In order to determine whether an ownership change has occurred on a testing date, the loss corporation must identify each 5-percent shareholder whose percentage of stock ownership in the loss corporation immediately after the close of the testing date has increased, compared to such shareholder's lowest percentage of stock ownership in such corporation at any time during the testing period. The amount of the increase in the percentage of stock ownership in the loss corporation of each 5-percent shareholder must be computed separately by comparing the percentage ownership of each such 5-percent shareholder immediately after the close of the testing date to such shareholder's lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period. Each such increase in the percentage ownership of a 5-percent shareholder is then added together with any other such increases of other 5-percent shareholders to determine whether an ownership change has occurred. Because only those 5-percent shareholders whose percentages of stock ownership have increased are taken into account, a 5-percent shareholder is disregarded if his percentage of stock ownership, immediately after the close of the testing date, has decreased (or has remained the same), compared to his lowest percentage ownership interest on any previous date during the testing period.
(2)
Example.

# Example.
(i) A and B each own 40 percent of the outstanding L stock. The remaining 20 percent of the L stock is owned by 100 unrelated individuals, none of whom own as much as five percent of L stock (“Public L”). C negotiates with A and B to purchase all their stock in L.
(ii) The acquisitions from both A and B are completed on September 13, 1990. C's acquisition of 80 percent of L stock results in an ownership change because C's percentage ownership has increased by 80 percentage points as of the testing date, compared to his lowest percentage ownership in L at any time during the testing period (0 percent).
(3)
Related and unrelated increases in percentage stock ownership.
The determination whether an ownership change has occurred is made without regard to whether the changes in stock ownership of the loss corporation (by one or more 5-percent shareholders) result from related or unrelated events.
(4)
Example.

# Example.
(i) L has outstanding 200 shares of common stock. A, B and C respectively own 100, 50 and 50 shares of the L stock. On January 2, 1988, A sells 60 shares of L stock to B. Thus, B's percentage ownership interest in L increases by 30 percentage points, from 50 shares to 110 shares. On January 1, 1989, A purchases C's entire interest in L. Thus, A's percentage ownership interest in L increases by 25 percentage points, compared to his lowest percentage ownership interest in L, from 40 shares immediately following the January 2, 1988 sale to B to 90 shares. Even though A's ownership interest in L as of January 1, 1989 has decreased, compared to his 50 percent ownership interest at the beginning of the testing period, A is a 5-percent shareholder who must be taken into account for purposes of the computation required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section because his interest in L on that testing date (45 percent) has increased, compared to his lowest percentage ownership interest in L at any time during the testing period (20 percent following the sale to B).
(ii) Accordingly, although A and B jointly have increased their aggregate total ownership interest in L between January 2, 1988 and January 1, 1989 by only 25 percentage points (
i.e.,
the total ownership interest in L held by A and B at all times is not less than a 75 percent interest), the total of their separate increases in the percentage stock ownership of L, compared to their respective lowest percentage ownership interests at any time during the testing period, is 55 percentage points. Thus, an ownership change occurs as a result of A's acquisition of L stock on January 1, 1989.
(d)
Testing period
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d) and (m) of this section, the testing period for any testing date is the three-year period ending on the testing date. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for the definition of testing date.
(2)
Effect of a prior ownership change.
Following an ownership change, the testing period for determining whether a subsequent ownership change has occurred shall begin no earlier than the first day following the change date of the most recent ownership change. See paragraph (f)(19) of this section for the definition of change date.
(3)
Commencement of the testing period
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the testing period for any loss corporation shall not begin before the earlier of the first day of either—
(A) The first taxable year from which there is a loss or excess credit carryforward to the first taxable year ending after the testing date, or
(B) The taxable year in which the testing date occurs.
(ii)
Exception for corporations with net unrealized built-in loss.
Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section shall not apply if the corporation has a net unrealized built-in loss (determined after application of section 382(h)(3)(B)) on the testing date, unless the loss corporation establishes the taxable year in which the net unrealized built-in loss first accrued.
In that event, the testing period shall not begin before the earlier of—
(A) The first day of the taxable year in which the net unrealized built-in loss first accrued, or
(B) The day described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. See section 382(h) for the definition of net unrealized built-in loss.
(4)
Disregarding testing dates.
Any testing date that occurs before the beginning of the testing period shall be disregarded for purposes of this section.
(5)
Example.

# Example.
(i) A owns all 100 outstanding shares of L stock. A sells 40 shares to B on January 1, 1988. C purchases 20 shares of L stock from A on July 1, 1991. In determining if an ownership change occurs on the July 1,
1991 testing date, B's acquisition of L stock is disregarded because it occurred before the testing period that ends on such testing date. Thus, B's ownership interest in L does not increase during the testing period, and no ownership change results from C's acquisition.
(ii) The facts are the same as in (i), except that throughout the period during which B negotiated his stock purchase transaction with A, B knew that C intended to attempt to acquire a significant stock interest in L. Also, B and C have been partners in a number of significant business ventures. The result is the same as in (i).
(e)
Owner shift and equity structure shift
—(1)
Owner shift
—(i)
Defined.
For purposes of this section, an owner shift is any change in the ownership of the stock of a loss corporation that affects the percentage of such stock owned by any 5-percent shareholder. See paragraph (g) of this section for the definition of a 5-percent shareholder. An owner shift includes, but is not limited to, the following transactions:
(A) A purchase of disposition of loss corporation stock by a 5-percent shareholder,
(B) A section 351 exchange that affects the percentage of stock owned by a 5-percent shareholder,
(C) A redemption or a recapitalization that affects the percentage of stock owned by a 5-percent shareholder,
(D) An issuance of loss corporation stock that affects the percentage of stock owned by a 5-percent shareholder, and
(E) An equity structure shift that affects the percentage of stock owned by a 5-percent shareholder.
(ii)
Transactions between persons who are not 5-percent shareholders disregarded.
Transfers of loss corporation stock between persons who are not 5-percent shareholders of such corporation (and between members of separate public groups resulting from the application of the segregation rules of paragraphs (j)(2) and (3)(iii) of this section) are not owner shifts and thus are not taken into account. See paragraph (h)(4)(xi) of this section for a similar rule applicable to transfers of options.
(iii)
Examples.

# Example 1.
A has owned all 1000 shares of outstanding L stock for more than three years. On June 15, 1988, A sells 300 of his L shares to B. This transaction is an owner shift. No other 5-percent shareholder has increased his percentage ownership of L stock during the testing period. Thus, the owner shift resulting from B's acquisition does not result in an ownership change, because B has increased his stock ownership in L by only 30 percentage points.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example (1).
In addition, on June 15, 1989, L issues 100 shares to each of C, D and AA. The stock issuance is an owner shift. The transaction, however, does not result in an ownership change, because B, C, D and AA (the 5-percent shareholders whose stock ownership has increased as of the testing date, compared to any other time during the testing period) have increased their percentage of stock ownership in L by a total of only 46.2 percentage points during the testing period (by 23.1 percentage points [300 shares/1300 shares] for B, and 7.7 percentage points [100 shares/1300 shares] for each of C, D and AA).

# Example 3.
All 1000 shares of L stock are owned by a group of 100 unrelated individuals, none of whom own as much as five percent of L stock (“Public L”). Several of the members of Public L sell their L stock, amounting to a 30 percent ownership interest in L, to B on June 15, 1988. The sale of stock to B is an owner shift. Between June 16, 1988 and June 15, 1989, each of the remaining individuals in Public L sells his stock to another person who is not a 5-percent shareholder. Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, trading activity among the members of Public L is disregarded and does not result in an owner shift. On June 15, 1989, L issues 100 shares to each of C, D and AA. The only sale transactions by members of Public L that are taken into account in determining whether an ownership change occurs on June 15, 1989 are the sales to B on June 15, 1988. Because B, C, D and AA together have increased their percentage ownership of L stock as a result of B's purchase and the stock issuance by an amount not in excess of 50 percentage points during the testing period ending on June 15, 1988, an ownership change does not occur on that date.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example (2).
In addition, on December 15, 1989, L redeems 200 of the L shares from A. The redemption is an owner shift that results in an ownership change, because B, C, D and AA are 5-percent shareholders whose percentage ownership of L increase by a total of 54.6 percentage points during the testing period (by 27.3 percentage points [300 shares/1100 shares] for B and 9.1 percentage points [100 shares/1100 shares] for each of C, D and AA).

# Example 5.
L is owned entirely by 10,000 unrelated shareholders, none of whom owns as much as five percent of the stock of L (“Public L”). Accordingly, Public L is L's only 5-percent shareholder. See paragraph (j)(1) of this section. There are one million
shares of common stock outstanding. On December 1, 1988, L issues two million new shares of its common stock to members of the public, none of whom owned any L stock prior to the issuance. Following the public offering, no shareholder of L owns, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of L stock. Under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, however, all of the newly issued stock is treated as acquired by a 5-percent shareholder (“Public NL”) that is unrelated to Public L. Therefore, the public offering constitutes an owner shift that results in an ownership change because Public NL's percentage of stock ownership in L increased by 66
2/3
percentage points (two million shares acquired in the public offering/three million shares outstanding following the offering) over its lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (0 percent prior to the offering).

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in
Example (5),
except that L issues only 500,000 new shares of L stock on December 1, 1988, and Public NL's percentage ownership interest in L increases by only 33
1/3
percentage points (500,000 shares acquired in the public offering/1.5 million shares outstanding following the offering). During the two years following December 2, 1988, 14 percent of the stock outstanding on that date is sold over a public stock exchange. On December 3, 1990, A purchases five percent of L stock (75,000 shares) over a public stock exchange. The purchase of five percent of L stock by A is an owner shift and is presumed to have been made proportionately from Public L and Public NL under paragraph (j)(1)(vi) of this section. Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, transfers of L stock in transactions not involving A (
i.e.,
in transactions among or between members of separate public groups resulting from the application of paragraphs (j)(2) and (3) of this section) are not taken into account, and do not constitute owner shifts. (Transfers between members of Public NL and Public L, which are treated as separate 5-percent shareholders solely by virtue of paragraph (j)(2) of this section, are disregarded even if L has actual knowledge of any such transfers.) A and Public NL, the only 5-percent shareholders whose interests in L have increased during the testing period, have increased their respective stock ownership by only 36
2/3
percentage points—five percentage points for A [75,000 shares/1.5 million shares outstanding] and 31
2/3
percentage points for Public NL [((500,000 shares issued in the public offering)−(5 percent × 500,000 shares presumed to have been acquired by A)) /1.5 million shares outstanding]. Accordingly, there is no ownership change with respect to L notwithstanding that, taking into account the public trading, a change of more than 50 percentage points in the ultimate beneficial ownership of L stock occurred during the three-year period ending on the December 3, 1990 testing date.

# Example 7.
The facts are the same as in
Example 6,
except that five percent of the L stock has always been owned by P which, in turn, has always been owned by Public P. On December 6, 1990, P sells all of its L stock over a public stock exchange. Although the trading of P stock among persons that are not 5-percent share-holders (without regard to the segregation rules of paragraph (j) of this section) are disregarded under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the disposition of the L stock by P is not disregarded because the L stock is transferred in a transaction that is subject to paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section.
(2)
Equity structure shift
—(i)
Tax-free reorganizations.
An equity structure shift is any reorganization within the meaning of section 368 with respect to which the loss corporation is a party to the reorganization, except that such term does not include a reorganization described in—
(A) Section 368(a)(1)(D) or (G) unless the requirements of section 354(b)(1) are met, or
(B) Section 368(a)(1)(F).
(ii)
Transactions designated under section 382(g)(3)(B) treated as equity structure shifts.
[Reserved]
(iii)
Overlap of owner shift and equity structure shift.
Any equity structure shift that affects the percentage of loss corporation stock owned by a 5-percent shareholder also constitutes an owner shift. See paragraph (e)(i)(E) of this section
(iv)
Examples.

# Example 1.
A owns all of the stock of L and B owns all of the stock of P. On October 13, 1988, L merges into P in a reorganization described in section 368a(1)(A). As a result of the merger, A and B own 25 and 75 percent, respectively, of the stock of P. The merger is an equity structure shift (and, because it affects the percentage of L stock owned by 5-percent shareholders, it also constitutes an owner shift). On the October 13, 1988 testing date, B is a 5-percent shareholder whose stock ownership in the loss corporation following the merger has increased by 75 percentage points over his lowest percentage of stock ownership in L at any time during the testing period (0 percent prior to the merger). Accordingly, an ownership change occurs as a result of the merger. P is thus a new loss corporation and L's pre-change losses are subject to limitation under section 382.

# Example 2.
(
i
) A owns 100 percent of L
1
stock and B owns 100 percent of L
2
stock. On
January 1, 1988, L
1
merges into L
2
in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A). Immediately after the merger, A and B own 40 percent and 60 percent, respectively, of the L
2
stock. There is an equity structure shift (as well as an owner shift) with respect to both L
1
and L
2
on January 1, 1988.
(
ii
) Because the percentage of L
2
stock owned by B immediately after the merger (60 percent) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of L
1
owned by B during the testing period (0 percent prior to the merger), there is an ownership change with respect to L
1
. L
2
is a new loss corporation and thus, under § 1.382-2(a)(1)(iii) of this section, the pre-change losses of L
1
must be accounted for separately by L
2
from the losses of L
2
(immediately before the ownership change) and are subject to limitation under section 382. See § 1.382-2(a)(1)(iv) of this section for rules that end separate accounting for L
1
's pre-change losses on any testing date occurring on or after January 29, 1991.
(
iii
) L
2
is a new loss corporation because it is a successor corporation to L
1
. There is no ownership change with respect to L
2
, however, because A's stock ownership in L
2
increased by only 40 percentage points (to 40 percent) over the amount owned by A prior to the merger (0 percent). Therefore, the pre-change losses of L
2
are not limited under section 382 as a result of the merger.

# Example 3.
The result in
Example (2)
would be the same if L
1
had survived the merger (
i.e.,
L
2
merged into L
1
) with A and B owning 40 and 60 percent, respectively, of L
1
stock. L
