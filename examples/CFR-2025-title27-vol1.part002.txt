# Subpart H—Dealer Registration and Recordkeeping
§ 19.201
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
Dealer.
A person that sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product (distilled spirits, wines, and/or beer) fit for beverage use.
Retail dealer in liquors.
A dealer that sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer to any person other than a dealer.
Wholesale dealer in liquors.
A dealer that sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer to another dealer.
(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122)
§ 19.202
Dealer registration.
Every proprietor that sells or offers for sale any alcoholic product (distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register as a dealer under part 31 of this chapter. However, the proprietor's application for registration of a distilled spirits plant filed under subpart D of this part, and approval of that application by the appropriate TTB officer, will constitute the proprietor's registration as a dealer at the distilled spirits plant. Every proprietor registered as a dealer under this subpart will be classified as a wholesale dealer in liquors (see § 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. Registration covers all sales from the same location, including sales of wine, beer, or other proprietors' spirits. A proprietor who conducts business as a dealer at a location other than the distilled spirits plant must register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.
(26 U.S.C. 5124)
§ 19.203
Amending the dealer registration.
Every proprietor registered as a dealer under this subpart must maintain a current and accurate distilled spirits plant registration. Whenever there is a
change to any of the information provided in the proprietor's approved notice of registration, the proprietor must amend the registration within the time period specified in subpart E of this part. An amendment of the proprietor's distilled spirits plant registration will also serve as an amendment of the proprietor's dealer registration under this subpart. The proprietor's dealer registration will also terminate when distilled spirits plant operations under the notice of registration terminate.
(26 U.S.C. 5124)
§ 19.204
Dealer records.
Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. Distilled spirits transactions that appear in the records required by subpart V of this part will meet the proprietor's recordkeeping requirements as a dealer. For other transactions not covered in the distilled spirits plant records, such as retail sales of wine or beer in a restaurant at the distilled spirits plant, or operations as a wholesale dealer in wine or beer, the proprietor must keep the records specified for dealers in part 31 of this chapter.
(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122, 5124)

# Subpart I—Distilled Spirits Taxes
§ 19.221
Scope.
This subpart covers the taxation of distilled spirits and the procedures for payment of taxes by proprietors of distilled spirits plants. Issues covered in this subpart include tax rates, liability for tax, tax determination, return periods, filing of tax returns, forms of payment, electronic fund transfers, and credits under 26 U.S.C. 5010.
(26 U.S.C. 5001)

# Basic Provisions of Tax Law Affecting Spirits
§ 19.222
Basic tax law provisions.
(a)
Distilled spirits tax.
26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 impose a tax on all distilled spirits produced in, or imported into or brought into, the United States at the rate prescribed in section 5001 on each proof gallon and a proportionate tax at a like rate on all fractional parts of a proof gallon. For the current rate of tax see 26 U.S.C. 5001.
(b)
Products containing distilled spirits.
All products of distillation, by whatever name known, which contain distilled spirits, on which the tax imposed by law has not been paid, and any alcoholic ingredient added to such products, are considered and taxed as distilled spirits.
(c)
Wines with high alcohol content.
Wines containing more than 24 percent of alcohol by volume are taxed as distilled spirits.
(d)
Attachment of the tax.
Under 26 U.S.C. 5001(b), the tax attaches to distilled spirits as soon as the substance comes into existence as such, whether it be subsequently separated as pure or impure spirits, or be immediately, or at any subsequent time, transferred into any other substance, either in the process of original production, or by any subsequent process.
(e)
Alcohol tax is a lien on spirits.
Under 26 U.S.C. 5004, the tax becomes a first lien on the distilled spirits from the time the spirits come into existence as such. The conditions under which the first lien terminates are described in 26 U.S.C. 5004.
(f)
Tax credit for eligible wines and eligible flavors.
Under 26 U.S.C. 5010, a credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 5001 or 7652 on each proof gallon of alcohol derived from eligible wine, or from eligible flavors which do not exceed 2.5 percent of the finished product on a proof gallon basis is allowed at the time the tax is payable as if it constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.
(g)
Effective tax rates.
Where credit against the tax is desired, the proprietor liable for the tax must establish an effective tax rate in accordance with § 19.246. The effective tax rate established will be applied to each withdrawal or other taxable disposition of the distilled spirits.
(26 U.S.C. 5001, 5004, 5010, 7652)
§ 19.223
Persons liable for tax.
(a)
Distilling.
Under 26 U.S.C. 5005, the distiller of spirits is liable for the tax and each proprietor or possessor of, and person in any manner interested in the use of, any still, distilling apparatus,
or distillery, shall be jointly and severally liable for the tax on distilled spirits produced. However, a person, not an officer or director of a corporate proprietor, owning or having the right of control of not more than 10 percent of any class of stock of that proprietor, is not liable by reason of the stock ownership or control. Persons transferring spirits in bond are relieved of tax liability if:
(1) The proprietors of transferring and receiving distilled spirits plant premises are independent of each other and neither has a proprietary interest, directly or indirectly, in the business of the other, and
(2) No person liable for the tax on transferred spirits retains any interest in the spirits.
(b)
Storage on bonded premises.
Under 26 U.S.C. 5005(c) each person operating bonded premises will be liable for the tax on all spirits while the spirits are stored on the premises, and on all spirits that are in transit to the premises from the time of removal from the transferor's bonded premises, pursuant to an approved application. Liability for the tax continues until the spirits are transferred or withdrawn from bonded premises as authorized by law, or until the liability for tax is relieved under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5008(a). Claims for relief from liability for spirits lost are covered in subpart J of this part. Voluntary destruction of spirits in bond is covered in subpart Q of this part.
(c)
Withdrawals without payment of tax.
Under 26 U.S.C. 5005(e), any person who withdraws spirits from the bonded premises of a plant without payment of tax, as provided in 26 U.S.C. 5214, will be liable for the tax on the spirits from the time of withdrawal. The person will be relieved of any liability at the time the spirits are exported, deposited in a foreign trade zone, used in production of wine, deposited in a customs bonded warehouse, laden as supplies upon or used in the maintenance or repair of certain vessels or aircraft, or used for certain research, development or testing, as provided by law.
(d)
Withdrawals free of tax.
Persons liable for tax under paragraph (a) of this section, are relieved of the liability on spirits withdrawn from bonded premises free of tax under this part, at the time the spirits are withdrawn.
(e)
Withdrawn from customs custody without payment of tax.
Under 26 U.S.C. 5232(a) when imported distilled spirits in bulk containers are withdrawn from customs custody and transferred to the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant without payment of the tax imposed on imported distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 5001, the person operating the bonded premises of the distilled spirits plant to which spirits are transferred will become liable for the tax on the spirits upon their release from customs custody, and the importer will thereupon be relieved of liability for the tax.
(26 U.S.C. 5005, 5066, 5232)

# Requirements for Gauging and Tax Determination
§ 19.225
Requirement to gauge and tax determine spirits.
Before withdrawing distilled spirits from bond, the proprietor must gauge the spirits and determine the tax that is due on the spirits. This requirement applies to all spirits on which the tax will be either prepaid or deferred.
(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204, 5213)
§ 19.226
Gauges for tax determination.
There are several acceptable methods that a proprietor may use when gauging spirits for tax determination.
(a)
Cases.
If spirits are withdrawn from the bonded premises in cases, the proprietor must gauge the spirits based on the contents of the cases. The proprietor will determine the number of proof gallons of spirits in cases as provided in part 30 of this chapter. The proprietor must convert metric units of measure to U.S. units according to § 19.579.
(b)
Packages.
If spirits are withdrawn from the bonded premises in packages on the basis of an individual package gauge, each package must be gauged unless the tax is to be determined on the production or filling gauge. When gauging the packages, the proprietor must prepare a package gauge record as specified in § 19.619 and attach it to the record of tax determination that is required by § 19.611.
(c)
Tanks.
The proprietor must use weight, or an accurate mass flow meter and proof as prescribed in §§ 19.284 and 19.285, to gauge bulk spirits in tanks that are to be withdrawn on determination of tax. The proprietor must record the elements of the gauge on the record of tax determination. As an alternative, the proprietor may record gauge elements on a separate gauge record, and attach the gauge record to the record of tax determination.
(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5213)
§ 19.227
Determination of the tax.
After gauging, the proprietor must determine the tax on the spirits to be removed from the bonded premises. The proprietor must use the tax rate prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 5001 to calculate the tax, unless the product is eligible for a reduced effective tax rate as provided in 26 U.S.C. 5010. If the product is eligible for a reduced effective tax rate, the proprietor may use that rate to determine the tax. The proprietor must record the results of each tax determination in a record of tax determination as required by § 19.611.
(26 U.S.C. 5213)

# Rules for Deferred Payment and Prepayment of Taxes
§ 19.229
Deferred payment and prepayment of taxes.
There are two basic methods of paying the tax on distilled spirits withdrawn from bonded premises: Deferred payment and prepayment.
(a)
Deferred payment.
Under the deferred payment system, the proprietor may withdraw spirits from bond after tax determination but before payment of tax. The excise tax paid is based on the amount of spirits removed from bond during each return period. In order to pay taxes under the deferral system, the proprietor must file a withdrawal bond or unit bond unless the proprietor is exempt from furnishing such bond under § 19.151(d). For detailed information regarding return periods and filing requirements under the deferred system, see §§ 19.234, 19.235 and 19.236.
(b)
Prepayment.
Under the prepayment system, the proprietor must pay the distilled spirits tax after tax determination but before withdrawal of the spirits from bonded premises. See § 19.230 for conditions that require prepayment of taxes.
(26 U.S.C. 5061)
[T.D. TTB-92, 76 FR 9090, Feb. 16, 2011, as amended by T.D. TTB-146, 82 FR 1121, Jan. 4, 2017]
§ 19.230
Conditions requiring prepayment of taxes.
Under certain conditions, the proprietor must prepay the distilled spirits tax required, using TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return, before removing spirits from the bonded premises. Those conditions are:
(a) When the proprietor has not given TTB a withdrawal bond or a unit bond and the proprietor is not exempt from furnishing such bond under § 19.151(d);
(b) When the proprietor has posted a withdrawal or a unit bond, but has defaulted on any payment of tax under this section, and the tax payment remains in default. The proprietor must continue to prepay the tax until the appropriate TTB officer decides that allowing the proprietor to make deferred tax payments again will not jeopardize the revenue;
(c) When the proprietor receives a notice from the appropriate TTB officer that the tax must be prepaid. Such notice may be issued to the proprietor if—
(1) The proprietor fails to maintain records required by this part to substantiate the correctness of its tax returns; or
(2) The proprietor fails to comply with any other provision of this part; or
(d) When the proprietor's withdrawal bond, or the withdrawal coverage under its unit bond, is for less than the maximum penal sum. This condition does not apply to a proprietor who is exempt from furnishing a bond under § 19.151(d). The proprietor must prepay the tax to the extent that a withdrawal would cause the outstanding tax liability to exceed the limits of coverage under the bond.See also § 19.231 if the
bond is for less than the maximum penal sum.
(26 U.S.C. 5213, 5555)
[T.D. TTB-92, 76 FR 9090, Feb. 16, 2011, as amended by T.D. TTB-146, 82 FR 1122, Jan. 4, 2017]
§ 19.231
Accounting for bond coverage.
In cases where a proprietor must furnish a withdrawal bond or a unit bond to cover the tax on spirits withdrawn on determination of tax, and such bond is in less than the maximum penal sum, the proprietor must maintain an account for the bond to ensure that outstanding tax liabilities do not exceed the penal sum of the bond. The account must charge the bond for the amount of liability incurred on each withdrawal on determination of tax and, credit the bond for each payment of tax made with a return and for authorized credits taken on a return. If the balance of the bond account reaches zero, the proprietor may no longer defer tax payments for taxable withdrawals. Where the bond is for less than the maximum penal sum and has been allocated among two or more plants, the proprietor must maintain an account at each plant for that part of the penal sum allocated to each plant.
(26 U.S.C. 5173)
[T.D. TTB-92, 76 FR 9090, Feb. 16, 2011, as amended by T.D. TTB-146, 82 FR 1122, Jan. 4, 2017]

# Requirements for Filing Tax Returns
§ 19.233
Filing prepayment returns.
When the proprietor is required to prepay the tax prior to withdrawal of spirits from the bonded premises, the proprietor must prepay the tax with a return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return, and include the remittance with the return. The proprietor may prepay tax for one or more withdrawals with a single prepayment return on TTB F 5000.24. The proprietor will note the serial number of the TTB F 5000.24, and the date and time of the prepayment on the individual record of tax determination. The proprietor may not remove spirits from the bonded premises until the tax has been paid.
(26 U.S.C. 5061)
§ 19.234
Filing deferred payment returns.
A proprietor must pay the tax on spirits withdrawn from bond for deferred payment of tax by filing a return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return. The proprietor must execute and file TTB F 5000.24 for each return period, even when no tax is due for a particular return period. The proprietor of each bonded premises must pay the full amount of distilled spirits tax determined for all spirits released for withdrawal from the bonded premises on determination of tax during the period covered by the return (except spirits on which tax has been prepaid).
(26 U.S.C. 5061)
§ 19.235
Deferred payment return periods—annual, quarterly, and semimonthly.
(a)
Three types of return periods.
The IRC provides for three different return periods for those taxpayers who pay their taxes on a deferred basis: Annual, quarterly, and semimonthly. Taxpayers who meet certain criteria are eligible to use annual or quarterly return periods and pay their taxes on an annual or quarterly basis as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, respectively. Other taxpayers must use semimonthly return periods and pay their taxes on a semimonthly basis as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Annual return period.
Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, a taxpayer who reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $1,000 in taxes with respect to distilled spirits imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 for the current calendar year, and that was liable for not more than $1,000 in such taxes in the preceding calendar year, may choose to use an annual return period. However, the taxpayer may not use the annual return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $1,000, and any tax which has not
been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the quarterly or semimonthly period in which that date occurs. A taxpayer may choose to use either quarterly or semimonthly return periods as authorized under paragraph (c) or (e) of this section.
(c)
Quarterly return period.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and subject to paragraph (d) of this section, a taxpayer who reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in taxes with respect to distilled spirits imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 for the current calendar year, and that was liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes in the preceding calendar year, may choose to use a quarterly return period. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax which has not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
(d)
Additional rules for annual and quarterly return periods.
The following additional rules apply to the annual and quarterly return period procedures under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:
(1) A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the distilled spirits tax liability for all locations to determine eligibility for the return procedures;
(2) A taxpayer who has both domestic operations and import transactions must combine the distilled spirits tax liability on the domestic operations and the imports to determine eligibility for the return procedures;
(3) The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for purposes of determining eligibility for the return procedures. However, a taxpayer who is eligible for the return procedures, and that is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more in distilled spirits excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer (EFT). Quarterly payments via EFT must be transmitted in accordance with section 5061(e);
(4) A new taxpayer is eligible to use the return procedures the first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $1,000, in the case of the annual return procedure, or $50,000, in the case of the quarterly return procedure, in distilled spirits taxes during that calendar year; and
(5) If a taxpayer becomes ineligible to use a return procedure described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section because the taxpayer's liability exceeds $1,000 or $50,000, respectively, during a taxable year, that taxpayer may resume using that return procedure only after a full calendar year has passed during which the taxpayer's liability did not exceed $1,000 or $50,000 as the case may be. A taxpayer may not use an annual or quarterly return procedure during any calendar year in which the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for more than $1,000, in the case of the annual return procedure, or $50,000, in the case of the quarterly return procedure, in distilled spirits taxes.
(e)
Semimonthly return period.
Except in the case of a taxpayer who qualifies for, and chooses to use, annual or quarterly return periods as provided in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, all other taxpayers must use semimonthly return periods for deferred payment of tax. The semimonthly return periods will run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as otherwise provided in § 19.237.
(f)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings indicated:

When used with reference to a taxpayer,
reasonably expects
means that there is no existing or anticipated circumstances known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to exceed the prescribed limit.

§ 19.237
Special rule for semimonthly filers for the month of September.
(a)
Returns required for September.
If the proprietor is required to file semimonthly returns as provided in § 19.235(c), there are three return periods during the month of September. The first semimonthly return period is from the 1st day through the 15th day of the month and the return with remittance is due by the 29th of September. The second semimonthly return period for the month of September is divided into two payment periods. The exact dates of these periods depend upon whether the proprietor remits tax payments by EFT.
(1)
Taxpayments by EFT.
If the proprietor remits tax payments by EFT, the two payment periods for the second half of September are from the 16th through the 26th, and from the 27th through the 30th. The return on form TTB F 5000.24 and remittance for the period September 16-26 is due on or before September 29. The return on TTB F 5000.24 and remittance for the period September 27-30 is due no later than October 14.
(2)
Taxpayment other than by EFT.
If the proprietor is not required to pay the distilled spirits tax by EFT, the two payment periods for the second half of September are from the 16th through the 25th and from the 26th through the 30th. The return on TTB F 5000.24 and remittance for the period September 16-25 is due on or before September 28. The return on TTB F5000.24 and remittance for the period September 26-30 is due no later than October 14.
(b)
Amount of payment: Safe harbor rule.
— (1)
EFT Taxpayers.
The proprietor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section if by September 29 the amount paid is at least eleven-fifteenths (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred in the semimonthly return period for September
1-15, and the proprietor also pays any underpayment of tax resulting from the use of the safe harbor rule on or before October 14.
(2)
Other than EFT taxpayers.
The proprietor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the amount paid by September 28 is at least two-thirds (66.7 percent) of the tax liability incurred in the semimonthly return period for September 1-15, and the proprietor also pays any underpayment of tax resulting from the use of the safe harbor rule on or before October 14.
(c)
Weekends and holidays.
If the required tax payment due date for the return period September 16-25 (non-EFT taxpayers) or September 16-26 (EFT taxpayers), falls on a Saturday or legal holiday, the proprietor's return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day. If the required tax payment due date falls on a Sunday, the proprietor's return and payment are due on the immediately following day.
(d)

# Example.
Payment of tax for the month of September:
(1)
Facts.
X, a proprietor required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer, incurred tax liability in the amount of $30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September. For the period September 16-26, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $45,000, and for the period September 27-30, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $2,000.
(2)
Payment requirement.
X's payment of tax in the amount of $30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September is due no later than September 29. X's payment of tax for the period September 16-26 is also due no later than September 29. X may use the safe harbor rule to determine the amount of payment due for the period of September 16-26. Under the safe harbor rule, X's payment of tax must equal $22,000.00, eleven-fifteenths of the tax liability incurred during the first semimonthly period of September. Additionally, X's payment of tax in the amount of $2,000 for the period September 27-30 must be paid no later than October 14. X must also pay the underpayment of tax, $23,000.00, for the period September 16-26, no later than October 14.
(26 U.S.C. 5061)
§ 19.238
Payment by mail or courier.
(a)
Payment by mail.
The proprietor must file each return on form TTBF 5000.24 in accordance with the instructions printed on the form. If the proprietor submits the return by U.S. mail, the official postmark of the U.S. Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the return is mailed will be considered to be the date of delivery of the return and also the remittance, if included. If the postmark on the cover is illegible, the proprietor will bear the burden of proving when the postmark was made. If the proprietor sends the return with or without remittance by registered mail or certified mail, the date of registry, or the date of the postmark on the sender's postal receipt for certified mail, will be treated as the date of delivery of the return and also of the remittance, if included.
(b)
Payment by courier or other private delivery service.
A proprietor may send a return, with or without remittance, by courier or other private delivery service. If the proprietor sends the return with or without remittance with a courier or private delivery service that is available to the general public and that is at least as timely and reliable as the U.S. mail, and the delivery service has tracking and tracing procedures for its deliveries, TTB will consider the date of tender to the delivery service as recorded in the tracking and tracing record for the parcel as the date of delivery. If the proprietor sends the return, with or without remittance, by courier or other private delivery service that does not meet the above requirements, the actual date of delivery to TTB will be treated as the date of delivery of the return and also of the remittance, if included.
(26 U.S.C. 6302)
§ 19.239
Form of payment.
(a)
General.
The proprietor must pay the tax due on spirits when filing a return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return. The remittance for the tax must accompany the return and may be in any form that is authorized by § 70.61 of this chapter and acceptable to the appropriate TTB officer. Exception: This does not apply to payments that must be made by EFT. For EFT payments see § 19.240.
(b)
Consequences of default.
If a check or money order tendered in payment of taxes is not paid on presentment, or if the taxpayer is otherwise in default in payment, then any remittance made
during the period of default must be either in cash or by an acceptable certified instrument. The proprietor must continue to pay in cash or by certified instrument as long as the proprietor remains in default, and until the appropriate TTB officer finds that accepting a check will not jeopardize the revenue.
(c)
Certified instruments.
Acceptable certified instruments include certified checks, cashier's checks or treasurer's checks drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States, or under the laws of any State, Territory or possession of the United States, or a money order, as provided in § 70.61 of this chapter.
(d)
Payment of taxes.
The proprietor must make checks or money orders payable to “Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau”.
(26 U.S.C. 5061, 6311)
§ 19.240
Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.
(a)
General.
—(1)
Criteria requiring EFT payment.
Under certain conditions, a proprietor may not make payments by cash, check, or money order. Instead, the proprietor must use the services of a commercial bank to pay tax on distilled spirits tax by EFT. Payments must be made by EFT in the current calendar year if the proprietor, as a taxpayer, was liable for $5 million or more in taxes on distilled spirits during the prior calendar year. For the purpose of determining whether the proprietor is subject to this requirement, the proprietor must use the total amount of tax liability on distilled spirits incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter (gross tax liability). Gross tax liability includes the distilled spirits tax on all taxable withdrawals of spirits and taxable importations of spirits, as well as tax on spirits brought into the United States from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands during the calendar year. This figure includes taxes incurred at any and all premises at which the proprietor conducts regulated activities. The proprietor may not net out or adjust for any drawback, credits or refunds of tax that are allowed. Overpayments made in excess of actual tax liability will not be included in the gross tax liability figure.
(2)
Controlled group.
If the taxpayer is a member of a controlled group, the controlled group is treated as a single taxpayer when calculating liability of $5 million or more in distilled spirits taxes during the prior calendar year. A controlled group is a related group of taxpayers and is defined in subpart D of part 70 of this chapter.
(3)
Separate return and payment for each DSP.
When the proprietor makes payments by EFT, the proprietor must file a separate return on form TTB F 5000.24 and make a separate EFT payment for each DSP from which spirits are withdrawn upon determination of tax.
(b)
Requirements
—(1)
Notice to TTB.
If the proprietor's gross distilled spirits tax liability is $5 million or more in one calendar year, the proprietor must notify the appropriate TTB officer of this fact not later than January 10 of the following year. The proprietor must use the total amount of tax liability incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter to determine whether it must make this notification. Exception: this notice requirement does not apply if the proprietor already pays tax on distilled spirits by EFT. The notice shall be an agreement to make payments by EFT.
(2)
Separate EFT for each return.
For each return filed in accordance with this part, the proprietor will direct the bank to make an EFT to the Treasury Account for the amount of the tax reported due on the return. The proprietor must give instructions to the bank early enough for the EFT to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than close of business on the last day for filing the return as prescribed in §§ 19.236 or 19.237, as appropriate.
(3)
Discontinuing EFT payments.
If the proprietor pays tax by EFT and has a gross tax liability of less than $5 million in distilled spirits taxes during a calendar year, combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, payment by EFT will be optional in the following year. The proprietor may continue to remit tax payment by EFT as provided in this section, or the proprietor may
remit taxpayment using any acceptable method as set forth in § 19.239. If the proprietor decides to stop paying tax by EFT, the proprietor must give the appropriate TTB officer written notice of that decision. The proprietor must attach a written notice to the first return on form TTB F 5000.24 filed using a method of payment other than EFT. Such notice must state that tax is not due by EFT because the proprietor's tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than $5 million. The proprietor must further state that future tax payments will be filed with the returns on TTB F 5000.24.
(c)
Remittance
—(1)
Identifying EFT payments.
When the proprietor completes the return on TTB F 5000.24, the proprietor must indicate on the form that the tax was paid by EFT. The proprietor must file the completed TTB F 5000.24 with TTB as directed by the instructions on the form.
(2)
Credit for payment.
TTB will credit the proprietor as having made a tax payment when the Treasury Account receives the EFT. TTB considers the EFT to be received by the Treasury Account when the EFT is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.
(3)
Record of payment.
When a proprietor directs a bank to make an EFT as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data record furnished to the proprietor as part of normal banking procedures will serve as the record of payment. The proprietor will retain this document as part of the required records.
(d)
Failure to make a tax payment by EFT.
The proprietor will be subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656 for failure to make a required EFT tax payment before close of business on the last day for filing.
(e)
Procedure.
Upon receipt of a notice filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will provide the proprietor with a copy of the TTB Procedure entitled “Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer”. This publication outlines the procedure that the proprietor must follow when preparing returns and payments by EFT as required by this part. The proprietor must follow instructions provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for submitting the EFT payments that must be made to CBP.

# Requirements for Employer Identification Numbers
§ 19.242
Employer identification number.
The proprietor must enter the employer identification number (EIN) assigned to it by the Internal Revenue Service on each form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return, filed with TTB. Failure to enter the assigned EIN on TTB F 5000.24, may result in a $50.00 penalty for each occurrence as specified in § 70.113 of this chapter.
(26 U.S.C. 6109, 6723)
§ 19.243
Application for employer identification number.
(a)
Use Form SS-4.
The proprietor must obtain an employer identification number (EIN) by filing an application with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on Form SS-4. Form SS-4 is available from Internal Revenue Service Centers, from IRS District Directors, the IRS Web site at
https://www.irs.gov,
or from TTB's National Revenue Center. The proprietor may file this form with IRS by mail, telephone, or fax by following the instructions on the form.
(b)
Time limit.
If the proprietor has not already received, or applied for, an EIN at the time that the first return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return, is filed, the proprietor must file such application for an EIN not later than seven days from the date of filing the TTB F 5000.24.
(c)
One EIN only.
Each proprietor must obtain and use only one EIN, regardless of the number of places of business for which the proprietor is required to file a tax return under this subpart.
(26 U.S.C. 6109)
[T.D. TTB-92, 76 FR 9090, Feb. 16, 2011, as amended by T.D. TTB-196, 89 FR 87939, Nov. 6, 2024]

# Effective Tax Rates
§ 19.245
Tax credits under 26 U.S.C. 5010.
(a)
The distilled spirits tax.
Sections 5001 and 7652 of the IRC impose a tax on all distilled spirits produced in, or imported into, or brought into the United States at the rate prescribed in section 5001 of the IRC.
(b)
Tax credits.
Section 5010 of the IRC provides a credit for the wine and flavors content in distilled spirits products. These credits effectively reduce the rate of excise tax paid on distilled spirits products that contain eligible wines and eligible flavors. As a result, the alcohol derived from eligible wine is taxed at the rates specified for wine in 26 U.S.C. 5041, and the alcohol derived from eligible flavors is not taxed to the extent that it does not exceed 2.5 percent of the alcohol in the product. This results in an effective tax rate on the distilled spirits product that is lower than the rate prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 5001.
(c)
Eligible wine and eligible flavor.
The credit for the wine and flavor content of a distilled spirits product is allowable only if the wine or flavor contained in the product is an “eligible wine” or an “eligible flavor”. To determine whether a wine or flavor is eligible, refer to the definitions in § 19.1 and 26 U.S.C. 5010.
(d)
Application of effective tax rates.
Section 19.246 describes how the proprietor should compute the effective tax rate for each distilled spirits product containing eligible wine or eligible flavor. Sections 19.247 through 19.250 set forth several different methods that the proprietor may use in applying the effective tax rates to taxable removals of products from the proprietor's bonded premises.
(26 U.S.C. 5010)
§ 19.246
Computing the effective tax rate for a product.
(a)
How to compute effective tax rates.
In order to determine the effective tax rate for a distilled spirits product containing eligible wine or eligible flavor, the proprietor must first determine the total excise taxes due on the product from all sources including distilled spirits, eligible wine, and alcohol from eligible flavors in excess of 2.5 percent of the total proof gallons in the product. Then, the proprietor must determine the total number of proof gallons of alcohol in the product regardless of the source. By dividing the total tax (numerator) by the total number of proof gallons (denominator) the proprietor will arrive at the effective tax rate for the product in dollars per proof gallon. The proprietor will compute the effective tax rate according to the following formula:
(1)
Numerator.
The numerator will be the sum of:
(i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product (exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
(ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(1), (2), or (3), that would be imposed on the wine but for its removal to bonded premises. Three different tax classes of wine are eligible for the tax credit. The proprietor will have to repeat this step for each different tax class of eligible wine used; and
(iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such distilled spirits exceed 2.5 percent of the denominator prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2)
Denominator.
The denominator will be the sum of:
(i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
(ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, divided by 100.
(b)
Rounding numbers
—(1)
Proof gallons.
When determining the effective tax rate, the proprietor must express quantities of distilled spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors to the nearest tenth of a proof gallon.
(2)
Tax rates.
The proprietor may round the effective tax rate to as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided that the rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate
rounded to the nearest whole cent. The proprietor must be consistent and round the effective tax rates for all products to the same number of decimal places. When rounding, if the number to the right of the last decimal place to be kept is less than five, it will be dropped, if it is five or over, a unit will be added.
(c)
Example.
The
following is an example of the use of the formula.
1
Proof gallons by which distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors exceed 2.5% of the total proof gallons in the batch (100.9 − (2.5% × 3,371.8) = 16.6).
Batch Record
Distilled spirits
2249.1 proof gallons.
Eligible wine (14% alcohol by volume)
2265.0 wine gallons.
Eligible wine (19% alcohol by volume)
1020.0 wine gallons.
Eligible flavors
100.9 proof gallons.
ER16FE11.000
(26 U.S.C. 5010)
§ 19.247
Use of effective (actual) tax rates.
(a)
Select method of applying tax rate.
The proprietor may choose to apply an effective tax rate to taxable removals of distilled spirits products in accordance with § 19.248, § 19.249, or § 19.250. Any proprietor who does not elect one of these options must establish an effective tax rate for each batch of distilled spirits product on which a claim for tax credit for alcohol derived from eligible wine or eligible flavor will be made. The proprietor must compute the effective tax rates for these products in accordance with the instructions in § 19.246.
(b)
Record tax rates used.
The proprietor must record the effective tax rate used on the dump or batch records for the products as required by § 19.598. The proprietor must record the serial numbers of cases of product removed at each rate on the record of tax determination or other related record. The proprietor must keep these records available for inspection by TTB officers.
(26 U.S.C. 5010, 5207)
§ 19.248
Standard effective tax rate.
(a)
Establishing a standard effective tax rate for a product.
The proprietor may establish a permanent standard effective tax rate for any eligible distilled spirits product, rather than calculate a separate effective tax rate for each batch of product made. If the proprietor elects to use this option, the proprietor must determine the permanent
standard effective tax rate based on the least quantity and the lowest alcohol content of eligible wine or eligible flavors used to manufacture the product. Thus, the permanent standard effective tax rate is the highest tax rate that would apply to the product because it is based on a batch with the least amount of alcohol from eligible wine and flavors that qualify for the credit under 26 U.S.C. 5010. By using this method the proprietor forgoes the possible use of a lower tax rate in exchange for the convenience of using a permanent standard effective tax rate that does not have to be recomputed for each batch of product made. The proprietor must keep a permanent record of the standard effective tax rates established for each product, in accordance with § 19.615.
(b)
Batches subject to a higher tax rate.
Whenever the proprietor manufactures a batch of the product with a lesser quantity or lower alcohol content of eligible wine or eligible flavor, this will result in a higher tax rate on the product since the product will have less alcohol qualifying for the credit under 26 U.S.C. 5010 and a higher percentage of alcohol taxable at the rate published in 26 U.S.C. 5001. In such instances, the proprietor must keep the cased goods segregated from other completed cases of the same product subject to the permanent standard effective tax rate for that product. The proprietor must determine the tax rate for the nonstandard batch in accordance with § 19.247.
(c)
TTB review of standard tax rates.
If the appropriate TTB officer finds that the use of this procedure jeopardizes the revenue, or causes administrative difficulty, the proprietor upon notification from TTB must discontinue use of this procedure.
(26 U.S.C. 5010, 5207)
§ 19.249
Average effective tax rate.
(a)
Establishing an average tax rate.
The proprietor may establish an average effective tax rate for any eligible distilled spirits product based on the total proof gallons in all batches of the same composition which have been produced during the preceding 6-month period and which have been or will be bottled or packaged, in whole or in part, for domestic consumption. At the beginning of each month, the proprietor must recompute the average effective tax rate so as to include only the immediately preceding 6-month period. The proprietor must show the average tax rate established for a product in the record of average effective tax rates as prescribed in § 19.613.
(b)
TTB review of average effective tax rates.
If the appropriate TTB officer finds that the use of this procedure jeopardizes the revenue, or causes administrative difficulty, the proprietor upon notification from TTB must discontinue use of this procedure.
(26 U.S.C. 5010, 5207)
§ 19.250
Inventory reserve account.
(a) The proprietor may establish an inventory reserve account for any eligible distilled spirits product by maintaining an inventory reserve record as prescribed by § 19.614. The effective tax rate applied to each removal or other disposition will be the effective tax rate recorded on the inventory reserve record from which the removal or other disposition is depleted. With an inventory reserve account, the proprietor will tax pay removals on a first-in first-out basis regardless of which lot of product is actually removed.
(b) If the appropriate TTB officer finds that the use of this procedure jeopardizes the revenue, or causes administrative difficulty, the proprietor upon notification from TTB must discontinue use of this procedure.
(26 U.S.C. 5010, 5207)

# Assessment of Taxes by TTB
§ 19.253
Assessment of tax on spirits not accounted for or reported.
The proprietor is required by law to properly account for and report all spirits that it produces. TTB will assess the proprietor for the tax on the difference between the quantity reported and the quantity actually produced.
(26 U.S.C. 5006)
§ 19.254
Assessment of tax for losses or unauthorized removals.
(a)
Lost or destroyed in bond.
TTB will assess the proprietor for the tax on
spirits, denatured spirits, or wines in bond that are lost or destroyed if:
(1) The proprietor is liable for the tax on spirits, denatured spirits, or wines in bond, and the proprietor fails to file a claim for remission of the tax on spirits, denatured spirits, or wines that are lost or destroyed in bond as provided in § 19.263(a), or
(2) The proprietor files a claim for such loss or destruction but the claim is denied. Exception: The provisions of this section do not apply to spirits, denatured spirits, or wines on which the tax is not collectible due to the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5008(a) or (d), or 26 U.S.C. 5370, as applicable.
(b)
Unauthorized removal from bond.
(1) TTB will assess the proprietor for the tax on any spirits, denatured spirits, or wines in bond that are removed from bonded premises other than as authorized by law.
(2) TTB will assess the proprietor for tax on spirits or denatured spirits lost from casks or other packages as described in 26 U.S.C. 5006(b) if the proprietor does not pay the tax upon demand by the appropriate TTB officer.
(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5008, 5370)

# Additional Tax Provisions
§ 19.256
Tax on wine.
(a)
Imposition of tax.
All wine (including imitation, substandard, or artificial wine, and compounds sold as wine) produced in or imported into or brought into the United States is subject to tax pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5041 or 7652. The proprietor may be liable for wine taxes under 26 U.S.C. 5362(b)(3) for wine that is transferred in bond to the proprietor's distilled spirits plant. The proprietor may not remove wine from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant for consumption or sale as wine. (
See
26 U.S.C. 5362.)
(b)
Liability for tax.
Except as otherwise provided by law, the proprietor is liable for the tax on wine transferred in bond to the proprietor's distilled spirits plant from a bonded wine cellar or from another distilled spirits plant until the proprietor uses the wine in the manufacture of a distilled spirits product or properly disposes of the wine as provided elsewhere in this part.
(26 U.S.C. 5041, 5362, 7652)
§ 19.257
Imported spirits.
The proprietor will incur a tax liability greater than the internal revenue tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1), if spirits originally imported for nonbeverage purposes are transferred from customs custody to TTB bonded premises pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5232, and the proprietor subsequently decides to withdraw the spirits for beverage purposes. If the spirits would have been subject to a higher duty had they been imported for beverage purpose, the proprietor must pay a tax equal to the difference between the higher duty and the duty actually paid. Proprietors will refer to this additional tax as “additional tax—less duty” and pay it at the same time and in the same manner as the distilled spirits excise tax. Proprietors must compute the amount of “additional tax—less duty” owed by applying this rate to the total quantity of proof gallons withdrawn. The proprietor must make a separate entry on the tax return labeled “additional tax—less duty” and show the amount of tax due.
(26 U.S.C. 5001)
§ 19.258
Additional tax on nonbeverage spirits.
The additional tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(8), on imported spirits withdrawn from customs custody without payment of tax and later withdrawn from bonded premises for beverage purposes, and the related provisions of § 19.257, are not applicable to Puerto Rican or Virgin Islands spirits brought into the United States and transferred to bonded premises under the provisions of this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5172, 5178)

# Rules for Production of Spirits
§ 19.301
Distillation.
The distillation of spirits must be done in a continuous system. Distilling operations are continuous when the spirits are moved through the various steps of production as quickly as plant operation will permit. The proprietor may move the product through as many distilling or other production operations as desired, provided the operations are continuous. The collection of unfinished spirits for the purpose of redistillation is not considered to be a break in the continuity of the distilling procedure. However, the quantity and proof of any unfinished spirits must be determined and recorded before any mingling with other materials or before any further operations involving the unfinished spirits outside the continuous system. Before the production gauge, spirits may be held only as long as reasonably necessary to complete the production procedure.
(26 U.S.C. 5178, 5211, 5222)
§ 19.302
Treatment during production.
During production, the proprietor may purify or refine the spirits by using any material that will not remain in the finished product. Juniper berries and other natural aromatics or their extracted oils may be used in the distillation of gin. Spirits may be percolated through or treated with oak chips that have not been treated with any chemical. The proprietor must destroy or so treat any materials used in treatment of spirits, and which do not remain in the spirits, so as to preclude the extraction of potable spirits.

(26 U.S.C. 5201, 5215, 5223, 5243)
§ 19.316
Redistillation.
(a) TTB has established standards of identity for the various classes and types of distilled spirits. Those standards are found in part 5 of this chapter. If a proprietor intends to redistill spirits, the proprietor must ensure that the redistillation process does not cause the distillate to be become ineligible for designation in the class or type of spirits that the proprietor intends to produce. Therefore, spirits must not be redistilled at a proof lower than that allowed for the class and type at which the spirits were originally produced, unless the redistilled spirits are to be:
(1) Used in wine production;
(2) Used in the manufacture of gin or vodka; or
(3) Designated as alcohol.
(b) In order to preserve the class and type of spirits during the redistillation process, different kinds of spirits must be redistilled separately, or with distilling material of the same kind or type as that from which the spirits were originally produced. However, this restriction does not apply when:
(1) Brandy is redistilled into “spirits-fruit” or “neutral spirits-fruit”. In this case the resulting distillate must not be used for producing wine;
(2) Whiskey is redistilled into “spirits-grain” or “neutral spirits-grain”;
(3) Spirits originally distilled from different kinds of material are redistilled into “spirits-mixed” or “neutral spirits-mixed”; or
(4) The spirits are redistilled into alcohol.
(c) All spirits redistilled after the production gauge will be treated the same as if the spirits had been originally produced by the redistiller. Spirits recovered by redistillation of denatured spirits, articles, or spirits residues may not be withdrawn from bonded premises except for industrial use or after denaturation. Otherwise, all provisions of this part and 26 U.S.C. chapter 51 applicable to the original production of spirits will be applicable to the redistillation of spirits. Nothing in this section affects any provision of this chapter relating to the labeling of distilled spirits.

# Subpart R—Losses and Shortages
§ 19.461
Losses and shortages in general.
(a)
Allowable losses and shortages.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, TTB will not collect tax on spirits, denatured spirits, or wines that are lost, destroyed, or otherwise unaccounted for while in bond, and if the tax has already been paid, TTB will refund the tax.
(b)
Exceptions.
TTB will collect the tax in the case of:
(1) Theft, unless the appropriate TTB officer finds that the theft occurred without connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part of the proprietor, owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or any employee or agent of any of them;
(2) Voluntary destruction carried out other than as provided in subpart Q of this part;
(3) An unexplained shortage of bottled spirits.
(c)
Burden of proof.
When it appears that a theft occurred, the burden of proof will be on the proprietor or other person liable for the tax to establish to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the theft did not result from connivance, collusion, fraud, or negligence on the part of the proprietor, owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or any employee or agent of any of them.
(d)
Claims.
Claims for losses and shortages allowable under this section must be filed in accordance with the provisions of subpart J of this part.
(e)
Limitations.
TTB will abate, remit, credit, or refund taxes on spirits, denatured spirits, or wines lost by theft only to the extent that the claimant is not indemnified against, or recompensed for, the taxes paid or owed.
(26 U.S.C. 5008, 5370)
§ 19.462
Determination of losses in bond.
(a)
Times for determining losses.
A proprietor must determine at any of the following times whether a loss of spirits, denatured spirits, or wines has occurred:
(1) Each time a tank or bulk conveyance is emptied;
(2) Upon discovery of an accident or an unusual variation in a gauge; and
(3) When required to take a physical inventory.
(b)
Losses from theft, tampering, or unauthorized voluntary destruction.
Whenever any spirits, denatured spirits, or wines are lost or destroyed in bond, whether by theft, tampering, or unauthorized voluntary destruction, the proprietor may elect voluntarily to pay the tax on the quantity lost. If the proprietor does not elect to pay the tax, the proprietor must promptly report the loss or destruction to the appropriate TTB officer. TTB may require that the proprietor file any claim for relief from the tax in accordance with § 19.263.
(c)
Missing packages.
When a proprietor cannot locate or otherwise account for any packages of spirits, denatured spirits, or wine recorded as deposited on bonded premises, the proprietor must promptly report that fact to the appropriate TTB officer. In such case the proprietor must either pay the tax on the lost spirits, denatured spirits, or wines or file a claim for relief from the tax in accordance with § 19.263.
(d)
Excessive in-transit losses.
A proprietor must promptly report excessive in-transit losses to the appropriate TTB officer. As a general rule, when spirits, denatured spirits, or wines are received in bond in bulk conveyances TTB will consider as excessive a loss that exceeds 1 percent of the quantity consigned. However, in the case of transcontinental transfers of wine in bond, TTB will consider as excessive only a loss in excess of 2 percent of the quantity of wine consigned.
(e)
Excessive storage losses.
A proprietor must pay the tax on excessive storage account losses of spirits unless the proprietor files a claim for remission in accordance with § 19.263 and TTB allows the claim under § 19.268. TTB will consider a storage account loss as excessive when the quantity of spirits lost during a calendar quarter from all storage tanks and stored bulk conveyances exceeds 1.5 percent of the total quantity contained in the tanks and stored bulk conveyances during the calendar quarter.
(26 U.S.C. 5008, 5370)
§ 19.463
Loss of spirits from packages.
(a)
Tampering or theft.
The appropriate TTB officer may require that a proprietor pay the tax on any loss caused by tampering or theft of spirits from packages in storage unless the proprietor establishes to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the loss was not due to connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part of the proprietor. As a general rule, the tax will be assessed on the quantity of spirits that represents the difference between the quantity originally entered in the package and the quantity remaining after discovery of the tampering or theft. However, if the proprietor can show that the package had already sustained normal storage losses before the tampering or theft occurred, the proprietor may exclude the amount of the normal storage losses from the quantity to be taxpaid.
(b)
Alternative method of tax assessment.
If tampering or theft has occurred at a proprietor's plant and the proprietor has failed to use effective controls to prevent it, the appropriate TTB officer may use an alternative to the general method of tax assessment specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In this case, the appropriate TTB officer may assess on each package showing evidence of tampering or theft an amount equal to the tax on 5 proof gallons of spirits.
(26 U.S.C. 5006)
§ 19.464
Losses after tax determination.
If a proprietor sustains a loss of spirits after tax determination but prior to completion of physical removal of the spirits from bonded premises, the proprietor may file a claim in accordance with subpart J of this part.
(26 U.S.C. 5008)
§ 19.465
Shortages of bottled spirits.
(a)
Determination of shortage.
The determination of whether an unexplained shortage of bottled distilled spirits exists must be made by comparing the spirits recorded as being on hand to either the results of the physical inventory required by § 19.372 or the results of any other complete physical inventory taken by the proprietor. When the recorded quantity is greater than the quantity determined by physical inventory, the difference is an unexplained shortage. The proprietor must adjust its records to reflect the results of the physical inventory.
(b)
Payment of tax on shortage.
A proprietor must pay the tax on any unexplained shortage of bottled distilled spirits:
(1) Immediately on a prepayment return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return; or
(2) On a deferred payment return on TTB F 5000.24 for the period during which the shortage was determined.

However, the appropriate TTB officer may require a proprietor to keep records for an additional period not exceeding three years in any case where such retention is deemed appropriate for the protection of the revenue.
(26 U.S.C. 5207)
§ 19.576
Preservation of records.
A proprietor must maintain required records in a manner that will ensure their readability and availability for inspection. Whenever the condition of any record will render it unsuitable for its intended or continued use, the proprietor must create an accurate and legible reproduction of the original record. TTB will treat the reproduced record as an original record, and all of the provisions of law that would apply to the original record also will apply to the reproduced record.
(26 U.S.C. 5207, 5555)
§ 19.577
Documents that are not records.
The term “records” as used in this subpart does not include qualifying documents required under subpart D of this part, or bonds required under subpart F of this part.

# Bonds
§ 19.699
General bond requirements.
(a)
Operations bond.
Any person who plans to establish a large plant, a medium plant, or a small plant without production operations must provide an operations bond on form TTB F 5110.56, Distilled Spirits Bond, in duplicate, with the original permit application. If a proprietor fails to pay any liability covered by the bond, TTB may seek payment from the proprietor, from the surety on the bond, or from both the proprietor and the surety. Additional provisions applicable to bonds for alcohol fuel plants are found in subpart F of this part in §§ 19.155 through 19.157 and §§ 19.167 through 19.173.
(b)
Corporate surety.
A company that issues bonds is called a “corporate surety.” Proprietors must obtain the surety bonds required by this subpart from a corporate surety approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Department of the Treasury publishes a list of approved corporate surety companies in Treasury Department Circular 570, Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies. Treasury Department Circular 570 is published in the
Federal Register
annually on the first business day in July, and supplemental changes are published periodically thereafter (see
https://www.federalregister.gov
). The most recent circular and any supplemental changes to it may be viewed on the Bureau of the Fiscal Service website (see
https://fiscal.treasury.gov
).
(c)
Alternative to a corporate surety.
A proprietor may also guarantee payment under a bond without using a corporate surety, by filing a bond that guarantees payment of the liability by pledging and depositing one or more acceptable negotiable securities having a par value (face amount) equal to or greater than the penal sums of the required bonds. Should the proprietor fail to pay one or more of the guaranteed liabilities, TTB may take action to sell the deposited securities to satisfy the debt. Pledged securities will be released to the proprietor if there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is terminated; the provisions of § 19.173
apply to the release of pledged securities under this subpart. A list of securities acceptable as collateral in lieu of surety bonds is available from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Current information and guidance from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service Web site may be found at
https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov

To the residue obtained above add 2 mL of Solution A and transfer the mixture to a porcelain spot plate, filling one cavity. Immediately fill an adjacent cavity with solution B. Cover the plate with a watch glass and observe any color formation in Solution A. A decided purple or deep indigo blue color is an indication of the presence of rosin.

# Dealer Registration and Recordkeeping
§ 24.50
[Reserved]
§ 24.51
Definitions.
For purposes of §§ 24.52 through 24.54 of this part, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
Dealer.
A person who sells, or offers for sale, any alcohol product (distilled spirits, wines, and/or beer) fit for beverage use.
Retail dealer in liquors.
A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer to any person other than a dealer.
Wholesale dealer in liquors.
A dealer who sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer to another dealer.
(26 U.S.C. 5121, 5122)
[T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37404, July 28, 2009]
§ 24.52
Dealer registration.
Every proprietor who sells or offers for sale any alcohol product (distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register as a dealer in accordance with part 31 of this chapter. However, the proprietor's application to establish and operate a bonded wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house filed under subpart D of this part, and approval of that application by the appropriate TTB officer, will constitute the proprietor's registration as a dealer at the approved bonded or taxpaid wine premises. Every proprietor registered as a dealer under this section will be classified as a wholesale dealer in liquors (see § 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. Registration covers all sales from the same location, including sales of spirits, beer, or other proprietors' wine. As provided in § 31.52 of this chapter, the proprietor is subject to no additional registration for making sales of wine or beer at the customer's place of business. Otherwise, a proprietor who conducts business as a dealer at a location other than the bonded wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house must register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.
(26 U.S.C. 5124)
[T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37404, July 28, 2009]
§ 24.53
Amending the dealer registration.
Every proprietor registered as a dealer under § 24.52 must maintain a current and accurate application file under subpart D of this part. Whenever there is a change to any of the information provided in the proprietor's approved application, the proprietor must amend the application within the time period specified in subpart D of this part. An amendment of the proprietor's wine premises approved application will also amend the proprietor's dealer registration under § 24.52. The proprietor's dealer registration will also terminate when wine operations authorized under this part terminate.
(26 U.S.C. 5124)
[T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37404, July 28, 2009]
§ 24.54
Dealer records.
Every dealer is required to maintain records of transactions. Wine transactions that appear in the records required by subpart O of this part will meet the proprietor's recordkeeping requirements as a dealer. For other transactions not covered in the wine premises records, such as retail sales of distilled spirits or beer in a restaurant at the wine premises, or operations as a wholesale dealer in distilled spirits or beer, the proprietor must keep the records specified for dealers in part 31 of this chapter.

Essences produced on wine premises.
Wine, taxpaid spirits, or spirits withdrawn tax-free may be used in the production of essences on wine premises. The description of the process for producing the essence may be included as part of a formula for the production of a formula wine or a separate formula may be filed on TTB F5120.29. If a separate formula is filed for the essence, the serial number of the formula by which it is produced will be shown in the TTB F 5120.29 covering the formula wine in which it is to be used. If an essence is to be made in quantities greater than required for individual lots of formula wine, and stored on the premises, a separate formula will be filed for the essence. Essences made on wine premises with wine spirits withdrawn free of tax pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5214(a)(5) may only be used in the production of a formula wine, and may not be removed from the premises where made. Essences made on wine premises with the use of tax-free spirits withdrawn free of tax pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5214(a)(13) may only be used in the production of a nonbeverage wine or wine product and may not be removed from the premises where made.

(3) A description of how taxpaid wine or spirits, or untaxpaid wine or spirits will be identified and segregated; and
(4) Any other document or additional information the appropriate TTB officer may require.
(c)
Alternation.
After the necessary qualifying documents have been approved by the appropriate TTB officer, the proprietor may alternate wine premises as described in the application. Any portion of wine premises on which taxpaid wine is located will be considered taxpaid wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house premises and any portion of the premises on which wine not identified as taxpaid is located will be considered bonded wine premises. The proprietor shall, prior to the initial alternation of the premises, identify by portable signs or tags, or by any other method or manner satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer, either all taxpaid wine on taxpaid wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house premises or all untaxpaid wine on bonded wine premises.

§ 24.146
Bonds.
(a)
Wine bond.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the proprietor must give bond on TTB F 5120.36, Wine Bond, to cover the liability for excise taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, on wines produced or received by the proprietor. The bond will apply to wine, spirits, and volatile fruit-flavor concentrate, or other commodities subject to tax under 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, in transit to or on bonded wine premises, and to the operations of the bonded wine premises, whether the transaction or operation on which the proprietor's liability is based occurred on or off the proprietor's premises. The bond will provide that the proprietor shall faithfully comply with all provisions of law and regulation relating to activities covered by the bond. This bond has a tax obligation limit of $500 for wine removed from bonded wine premises on which the tax has been determined, but not paid, unless the total penal sum of the operations bond is $2,000 or more and the proprietor and the surety designate $1,000 of this amount as the obligation limit for wine on which the tax has been determined, but not paid.
(b)
Tax deferral bond.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, where the proprietor removes wine from bonded wine premises for consumption or sale, after determination and before payment of tax, the proprietor must, in addition to any other bond required by this part, furnish a tax deferral bond on TTB F 5120.36, Wine Bond, to ensure payment of the tax on the wine. Under the conditions provided in paragraph (a) of this section, this amount may be changed to $1,000 by the terms of the bond or through a consent of surety between the proprietor and the surety. The tax deferral bond and the wine bond may
be submitted on the same TTB F 5120.36.
(c)
Wine vinegar plant bond.
The proprietor of a wine vinegar plant who withdraws wine from a bonded wine premises without payment of tax for use in the manufacture of vinegar shall file a bond on TTB F 5510.2, Bond Covering Removal to and Use of Wine at Vinegar Plant, to ensure the payment of the tax on the wine until such wine becomes vinegar.
(d)
Bonds covering wine for nonindustrial use and industrial use
—(1)
Nonindustrial use.
A proprietor who pays tax on a deferred basis under § 24.271 is not required to provide a bond or bonds to cover operations and withdrawals of wine for nonindustrial use during any portion of a calendar year for which the proprietor is eligible to use an annual or quarterly return period under § 24.271(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(iii). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a proprietor is considered to be paying tax on a deferred basis even if the proprietor does not pay tax during every return period as long as the proprietor intends to pay tax in a future period. See §§ 24.109 and 24.132 for rules governing applying for this bond exemption. See § 24.154(b) for rules governing when an existing proprietor who has not provided a bond under this paragraph must obtain bond coverage.
(2)
Industrial use.
A proprietor is required to provide a bond or bonds to cover operations and withdrawals of wine for industrial use even if the proprietor pays tax on a deferred basis under § 24.271 and is eligible to use an annual or quarterly return period under § 24.271(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(iii). In the case of a proprietor whose operations or withdrawals involve wine for both nonindustrial and industrial use, wine is considered to be for industrial use for purposes of this paragraph unless the proprietor designates the wine as solely for nonindustrial use upon production of the wine by fermentation or upon receiving the wine and, in either case, does not thereafter mix the wine with any wine for industrial use.
(3)
Nonindustrial use and industrial use defined.
The nonindustrial and industrial uses of wine are defined in subpart D of part 1 of this chapter. Nonindustrial uses of wine include, but are not limited to, uses of wine for beverage purposes. Industrial uses of wine include the manufacture of wine or wine products not for beverage use as set forth in § 24.215.

§ 24.176
Crushing and fermentation.
(a)
Natural wine production.
Water may be used to flush equipment during the crushing process or to facilitate fermentation but the density of the juice may not be reduced below 22 degrees Brix. However, if the juice is already less than 23 degrees Brix, the use of water to flush equipment or facilitate fermentation is limited to a juice density reduction of no more than one degree Brix. At the start of fermentation no material may be added except water, sugar, concentrated fruit juice from the same kind of fruit, malo-lactic bacteria, yeast or yeast cultures grown in juice of the same kind of fruit, and yeast foods, sterilizing agents, precipitating agents or other approved fermentation adjuncts. Water may be used to rehydrate yeast to a maximum to two gallons of water for each pound of yeast; however, except for an operation involving the preparation of a yeast culture starter and must mixture for later use in initiating fermentation, the maximum volume increase of the juice after the addition of rehydrated yeast is limited to 0.5 percent. After fermentation natural wines may be blended with each other only if produced from the same kind of fruit.
(b)
Determination of wine produced.
Upon completion of fermentation or removal from the fermenter, the volume of wine will be accurately determined, recorded and reported on TTB F 5120.17, Report of Bonded Wine Premises Operations, as wine produced. Any wine or juice remaining in fermentation tanks at the end of the reporting period will be recorded and reported on TTB F 5120.17.
[T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31078, July 9, 1990, as amended by ATF-338, 58 FR 19064, Apr. 12, 1993]
§ 24.177
Chaptalization (Brix adjustment).
In producing natural grape wine from juice having a low sugar content, pure dry sugar or concentrated grape juice may be added before or during fermentation to develop alcohol. In producing natural fruit wine from juice having a low sugar content, sugar, or concentrated juice of the same kind of fruit may be added before or during fermentation to develop alcohol. The quantity of sugar or concentrated juice added may not raise the original density of the juice above 25 degrees Brix. If grape juice or grape wine is ameliorated after chaptalization, the quantity of pure dry sugar added to juice for chaptalization will be included as ameliorating material. If fruit juice or fruit wine is ameliorated after chaptalization, pure dry sugar added under this section is not considered as ameliorating material. However, if fruit juice or fruit wine is ameliorated after chaptalization and liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup is used to chaptalize the fruit juice, the volume of water
contained in the liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup will be included as ameliorating material.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1385, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5382, 5384))
[T.D. ATF-299, 55 FR 24989, June 19, 1990, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56 FR 31078, July 9, 1991; T.D. ATF-413, 64 FR 46844, Aug. 27, 1999]
§ 24.178
Amelioration.
(a)
General.
In producing natural wine from juice having a fixed acid level exceeding 5.0 grams per liter, the winemaker may adjust the fixed acid level by adding ameliorating material (water, sugar, or a combination of both) before, during and after fermentation. The fixed acid level of the juice is determined prior to fermentation and is calculated as tartaric acid for grapes, malic acid for apples, and citric acid for other fruit. Each 20 gallons of ameliorating material added to 1,000 gallons of juice or wine will reduce the fixed acid level of the juice or wine by 0.1 gram per liter (the fixed acid level of the juice or wine may not be less than 5.0 gram per liter after the addition of ameliorating material).
(b)
Limitations.
(1) Amelioration is permitted only at the bonded wine premises where the natural wine is produced.
(2) The ameliorating material added to juice or wine may not reduce the fixed acid level of the ameliorated juice or wine to less than 5.0 grams per liter.
(3) For all wine, except for wine described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the volume of ameliorating material added to juice or wine may not exceed 35 percent of the total volume of ameliorated juice or wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). Where the starting fixed acid level is or exceeds 7.69 grams per liter, a maximum of 538.4 gallons of ameliorating material may be added to each 1,000 gallons of wine or juice.
(4) For wine produced from any fruit (excluding grapes) or berry with a natural fixed acid of 20 parts per thousand or more (before any correction of such fruit or berry), the volume of ameliorating material added to juice or wine may not exceed 60 percent of the total volume of ameliorated juice or wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). If the starting fixed acid level is or exceeds 12.5 grams per liter, a maximum of 1,500 gallons of ameliorating material may be added to each 1,000 gallons of wine or juice.

§ 24.179
Sweetening.
(a)
General.
In producing natural wine, sugar, juice or concentrated fruit juice of the same kind of fruit may be added after fermentation to sweeten wine. When juice or concentrated fruit juice is added, the solids content of the finished wine may not exceed 21 percent by weight. When liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup is used, the resulting volume may not exceed the volume which would result from the maximum use of pure dry sugar only.
(b)
Grape wine.
Any natural grape wine of a winemaker's own production may have sugar added after amelioration and fermentation provided the finished wine does not exceed 17 percent total solids by weight if the alcohol content is more than 14 percent by volume or 21 percent total solids by weight if the alcohol content is not more than 14 percent by volume.
(c)
Fruit wine.
Any natural fruit wine of a winemaker's own production may have sugar added after amelioration and fermentation provided the finished wine does not exceed 21 percent total solids by weight and the alcohol content is not more than 14 percent by volume.
(d)
Specially sweetened natural wine.
Specially sweetened natural wine is produced by adding to natural wine of the winemaker's own production sufficient pure dry sugar, juice or concentrated fruit juice of the same kind of fruit, separately or in combination, so that the finished product has a total solids content between 17 percent and 35 percent by weight, and an alcohol content of not more than 14 percent by volume. Natural wine containing added wine spirits may be used in the production of specially sweetened natural wine; however, wine spirits may not be added to specially sweetened natural wine. Specially sweetened natural wines may be blended with each other,
or with natural wine or heavy bodied blending wine (including juice or concentrated fruit juice to which wine spirits have been added), in the further production of specially sweetened natural wine only if the wines (or juice) so blended are made from the same kind of fruit.

§ 24.180
Use of concentrated and unconcentrated fruit juice.
Concentrated fruit juice reduced with water to its original density, or to 22 degrees Brix, or to any degree of Brix between its original density and 22 degrees Brix, and unconcentrated fruit juice reduced with water to not less than 22 degrees Brix, is considered juice for the purpose of standard wine production. Concentrated fruit juice reduced with water to any degree of Brix greater than 22 degrees Brix may be further reduced with water to any degree of Brix between its original density and 22 degrees Brix. The proprietor, prior to using concentrated fruit juice in wine production, shall obtain a statement in which the producer certifies the kind of fruit from which it was produced and the total solids content of the juice before and after concentration. Concentrated or unconcentrated fruit juice may be used in juice or wine made from the same kind of fruit for the purposes of chaptalizing or sweetening, as provided in this part. Concentrated fruit juice, or juice which has been concentrated and reconstituted, may not be used in standard wine production if at any time it was concentrated to more than 80 degrees Brix.

§ 24.182
Use of acid to correct natural deficiencies.
(a)
General.
Acids of the kinds occurring in grapes or other fruit (including berries) may be added within the limitations of § 24.246 to juice or wine in order to correct natural deficiencies; however, no acid may be added to juice or wine which is ameliorated to correct natural deficiencies except that in the production of grape wine, tartaric acid may be used to reduce the pH of the juice or wine. If tartaric acid is used to correct the pH of grape juice or wine, the fixed acid level of the juice shall be measured prior to the addition of any tartaric acid to determine the maximum quantity of ameliorating material allowed. In addition, when using tartaric acid to reduce the pH of ameliorated grape juice or wine, the pH cannot be reduced below 3.0.
(b)
Grape wine.
Tartaric acid or malic acid, or a combination of tartaric acid and malic acid, may be added prior to or during fermentation, to grapes or juice from grapes. In addition, after fermentation is completed, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, lactic acid or tartaric acid, or a combination of two or more of these acids, may be added to correct natural deficiencies. However, the use of these acids, either prior to, during or after fermentation, may not increase the fixed acid level of the finished wine (calculated as tartaric acid) above 9.0 grams per liter. In cases where the wine contains 8.0 or more grams of total solids per 100 milliliters of wine, acids may be added to the extent that the finished wine does not contain more than 11.0 grams per liter
of fixed acid (calculated as tartaric acid).
(c)
Fruit wine.
Only citric acid may be added to citrus fruit, juice or wine, only malic acid may be added to apples, apple juice or wine, and only citric acid or malic acid may be added to other fruit (including berries) or to juice or wine derived from other fruit (including berries) to correct natural deficiencies to 9.0 grams per liter of finished wine; however, if the wine contains 8.0 or more grams of total solids per 100 milliliters of wine, acids may be added to correct natural deficiencies to the extent that the finished wine does not contain more than 11.0 grams per liter of fixed acid (calculated as malic acid for apples and citric acid for other fruit (including berries).
(d)
Other use of acid.
A winemaker desiring to use an acid other than the acids allowed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to correct natural deficiencies shall follow the procedure prescribed in § 24.250. A winemaker desiring to use acid to stabilize standard wine shall follow the requirements prescribed by § 24.244.

# Subpart H—Production of Special Natural Wine
§ 24.195
General.
Special natural wine is a flavored wine made on bonded wine premises from a base of natural wine. The flavoring added may include natural herbs, spices, fruit juices, natural aromatics, natural essences or other natural flavoring, in quantities or proportions such that the resulting product derives character and flavor distinctive from the base wine and distinguishable from other natural wine. Fruit juices may not be used to give to one natural wine the flavor of another but may be used with herbs or spices to produce a wine having a distinctive flavor. Caramel and sugar may be used in a special natural wine. However, the minimum 60 degrees Brix limitations prescribed in the definition of “Liquid pure sugar” and “Invert sugar syrup” in § 24.10 do not apply to materials used in the manufacture of vermouth. Finished vermouth will contain a minimum of 80 percent by volume natural wine.

# Subpart I—Production of Agricultural Wine
§ 24.200
General.
Agricultural wine may be produced on bonded wine premises from suitable agricultural products other than the juice of fruit. Water or sugar, or both, may be used within the limitations of this subpart in the production of agricultural wine. Agricultural wine may not be flavored or colored; however, hops may be used in the production of honey wine. Spirits may not be used in the production of the wine and a wine made from one agricultural product may not be blended with a wine made from another agricultural product. Agricultural wine made with sugar in excess of the limitations of this subpart is other than standard wine and will be segregated and clearly identified. Since grain, cereal, malt, or molasses are not suitable materials for the production of agricultural wine, these materials may not be received on bonded wine premises. Beverage alcohol products made with these materials are not classed as wine and may not be produced or stored on bonded wine premises.
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1386, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5387))
§ 24.201
Formula required.
Before producing any agricultural wine, the proprietor shall obtain an approval of the formula and process by which it is to be made pursuant to the provisions of § 24.80. Any change in a formula will be approved in advance as provided by § 24.81.

§ 24.202
Dried fruit.
In the production of wine from dried fruit, a quantity of water sufficient to restore the moisture content to that of the fresh fruit may be added. If it is desired not to restore the moisture content of the dried fruit to that of the fresh fruit, or if the moisture content is not known, sufficient water may be added to reduce the density to 22 degrees Brix. If the dried fruit liquid after restoration is found to be deficient in sugar, sufficient pure dry sugar may be added to increase the total solids content to 25 degrees Brix. After addition of water to the dried fruit, the resulting liquid may be ameliorated with either water or sugar, or
both, in such total volume as may be necessary to reduce the natural fixed acid level of the mixture to a minimum of 5.0 grams per liter; however, in no event may the volume of the ameliorating material exceed 35 percent of the total volume of the ameliorated juice or wine (calculated exclusive of pulp). Pure dry sugar may be used for sweetening. After complete fermentation or complete fermentation and sweetening, the finished product may not have a total solids content that exceeds 35 degrees Brix.

To reduce the level of volatile acidity in wine (used with ion exchange), to reduce the ethyl alcohol content of wine.
Permeable membranes that are selective for molecules not greater than 500 molecular weight with transmembrane pressures of 200 pounds per square inch (psi) and greater. The addition of water other than that originally present prior to processing will render standard wine “other than standard.” Use must not alter the vinous character of the wine. May be used in combination with osmotic transport.
Reverse osmosis
2
To reduce the ethyl alcohol content of wine and to remove off flavors in wine.
This process must use permeable membranes which are selective for molecules not greater than 150 molecular weight with transmembrane pressures of 250 psi or less.
Ultrafiltration
2
To remove proteinaceous material from wine; to reduce harsh tannic material from white wine produced from white skinned grapes; to remove pink color from blanc de noir wine; to separate red and white juice and wine into low color and high color fractions for blending purposes, to reduce the ethyl alcohol content of wine.
Permeable membranes that are selective for molecules greater than 500 and less than 25,000 molecular weight with transmembrane pressures less than 200 psi. Shall not alter vinous character.
Electrodialysis
To aid in the removal of tartrates
This process must not alter the vinous character of the wine.
Elimination of sulfur dioxide by physical process
To reduce the sulfur dioxide content of juice
Use of a physical process to remove sulfur dioxide from juice must not alter the basic character of the juice so treated
Ion exchange
Various applications in the treatment of juice or wine:
Anion, cation, and non-ionic resins, except those anionic resins in the mineral acid state, may be used in batch or continuous column processes as total or partial treatment of wine, provided that with regard to juice or finished wine;
1. Such treatment does not alter the fruit character of the juice or wine.
2. The treatment does not reduce the color of the juice or wine to less than that normally contained in such juice or wine.
3. Treatment does not increase inorganic anions in the juice or wine by more than 10 mg/L.
4. The treatment does not reduce the metallic cation concentration in the juice or wine to less than 300 mg/L.
5. The treatment does not reduce natural or fixed acid in grape wine below 4 g/L for red table wines, 3 g/L for white table wines, 2.5 g/L for all other grape wines, 4 g/L for wine other than grape wine.
6. Treatment does not reduce the pH of the juice or wine to less than pH 2.8 nor increase the pH to more than pH 4.5.
7. The resins used have not imparted to the juice or wine any material or characteristic (incidental to the resin treatment) which may be prohibited under any other section of the regulations in this part. The winemaker may employ conditioning and/or regenerating agents consisting of water, fruit acids common to the wine or juice being treated, and inorganic acids, salts and/or bases provided the conditioned or regenerated resin is rinsed with water until the resin and container are essentially free from unreacted (excess) conditioning or regenerating agents prior to the introduction of the juice or wine. 21 CFR 173.25.
Metal reducing matrix sheet processing
To reduce the level of metals such as copper and iron in wine
(1) The active ingredient, polyvinylimidazol, must not constitute more than 40% by weight of the sheet.
(2) Use of the sheet must not significantly alter the color of the wine.
Osmotic transport
2
For alcohol reduction.
(1) Use must not alter the vinous character of the wine.
(2) None of the stripping solution may migrate into the wine.
(3) May be used in combination with reverse osmosis.
Spinning cone column
2
To reduce the ethyl alcohol content of wine and to remove off flavors in wine.
Use shall not alter vinous character. For standard wine, the same amount of essence must be added back to any lot of wine as was originally removed.
Sulfide reducing matrix sheet processing
To reduce the level of sulfides in wine
(1) The active ingredient, polyvinylimidazol, must not constitute more than 40% by weight of the sheet.
(2) Use of the sheet must not significantly alter the color of the wine.
Thermal gradient processing
To separate wine into low alcohol and high alcohol wine fractions
The fractions derived from such processing shall retain vinous character. Such treatment shall not increase the alcohol content of the high alcohol fraction to more than 24 percent by volume. The addition of water other than that originally present in the wine prior to processing will render standard wine “other than standard.”
To separate juice into low Brix and high Brix juice fractions
The low Brix fraction derived from such processing may be used in wine production. The high Brix fraction derived from such processing shall not be diluted with water for use in wine production.
Thin film evaporation under reduced pressure
2
To separate wine into a low alcohol wine fraction and into a higher alcohol distillate.
Use shall not alter vinous character. Water separated with alcohol during processing may be recovered by refluxing in a closed continuous system and returned to the wine. The addition of water other than that originally present in the wine prior to processing, will render standard wine “other than standard” wine.
1
In cross-flow filtration, the wine is passed across the filter membrane (tangentially) at positive pressure relative to the permeate side. A proportion of the wine which is smaller than the membrane pore size passes through the membrane as permeate or filtrate; everything else is retained on the feed side of the membrane as retentate.
2
When used to remove ethyl alcohol (dealcoholization), this process must be done on distilled spirits plant premises. However, reverse osmosis and nanofiltration, under certain limited conditions, may be used on bonded winery premises if ethyl alcohol is only temporarily created within a closed system.

Additional labeling rules effective for “hard cider” removed from wine premises on or after January 1, 2019.
For wines removed from wine premises on or after January 1, 2019 that are taxed at the “hard cider” tax rate, the label must also include the statement “Tax class 5041(b)(6).” This statement may appear anywhere on the label.
(ii)
Wines that do not require label approval
—(A)
Adequate designation.
If the wine is not subject to label approval under 27 CFR part 4 because it either is covered by a certificate of exemption from label approval or contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, its label must bear a designation that includes enough information (when viewed with the alcohol content statement) to identify the tax class under 26 U.S.C. 5041. The wine must be identified by the term “wine” (or a word that signifies a type of wine, such as “cider,” “perry,” or “mead,” as applicable). If the wine contains more than 0.392 gram of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters, the word “sparkling” or “carbonated,” as applicable, must be included in the designation.
(

)
Additional labeling rules effective for wines eligible for the “hard cider” tax class.
For wines removed from wine premises on or after January 1, 2017, that are taxed at the “hard cider” tax rate, the designation must be consistent with a hard cider tax class. For example, the designations “hard cider,” “hard perry,” “apple wine,” “pear wine,” “apple cider,” “apple perry,” “apple pear wine,” “cider” and “perry” are consistent with the hard cider tax class. The designation “blueberry cider” is not consistent with the hard cider tax class, because it indicates that the product contains either blueberries or blueberry flavors, which are not authorized for use in wine that is eligible for the hard cider tax class. If the hard cider contains more than 0.392 gram of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters, the word “sparkling” or “carbonated,” as applicable, must be on the label.

)
Transitional rule for wines removed on or after January 1, 2017 and prior to January 1, 2019.
For wines removed on or after January 1, 2017 and prior to January 1, 2019, a label will not be deemed out of compliance with § 24.257(a)(4)(ii)(A) on the sole ground that the label does not provide enough information to identify whether the wine is eligible for a “hard cider” tax classification. On an optional basis, wines eligible for the “hard cider” tax class may include the statement “Tax class 5041(b)(6)” on the label to adequately indicate the appropriate tax class.

Additional labeling rules effective for “hard cider” removed from wine premises on or after January 1, 2019.
For wines removed from wine premises on or after January 1, 2019, that are taxed at the “hard cider” tax rate, the label must also include the statement “Tax class 5041(b)(6).” This statement may appear anywhere on the label.

(b) The information shown on any label applied to bottled or packed wine is subject to the recordkeeping requirements of § 24.314. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1381, as amended, 1407, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5368, 5388, 5662))
(c)
Use of semi-generic designations
—(1)
In general.
Semi-generic designations may be used to designate wines of an origin other than that indicated by such name only if—
(i) There appears in direct conjunction therewith an appropriate appellation of origin, as defined in part 4 of this chapter, disclosing the true place of origin of the wine, and
(ii) The wine so designated conforms to the standard of identity, if any, for such wine contained in part 4 of this chapter or, if there is no such standard, to the trade understanding of such class or type.
(2)
Determination of whether a name is semi-generic
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a name of geographic significance, which is also the designation of a class or type of wine, shall be deemed to have become semi-generic only if so found by the Administrator.
(ii)
Certain names treated as semi-generic.
The following names shall be treated as semi-generic: Angelica, Burgundy, Claret, Chablis, Champagne, Chianti, Malaga, Marsala, Madeira, Moselle, Port, Rhine Wine or Hock, Sauterne, Haut Sauterne, Sherry, Tokay.

Serial numbers or filling date.
Each container larger than four liters or each case used for removing wine for consumption or sale will be marked with a serial number or filling date at the time of filling or when such
containers or cases are prepared for removal. Serial numbers will commence with “1” and continue until the numeral “1,000,000” is reached, whereupon the series may recommence with the numeral “1.” However, the proprietor may initiate a new series after the numeral “1,000,000” has been reached provided no numeral will be used more than once during a 12-month period. If desired, a separate series of numbers with letter prefixes may be used for containers larger than four liters and for cases, or for cases filled on different bottling lines, or for removals from different loading docks. The proprietor may mark containers larger than four liters or the cases with the filling date in lieu of using a serial number or use both a serial number and the filling date. However, if the proprietor desires to change from the use of a serial number to use of a filling date, or
vice versa,
a notice will be sent to the appropriate TTB officer before making the change. Where United States or foreign wine is recased, the cases will be marked with the date of recasing, preceded by the letter “R”, in lieu of serial number or filling date.

# Subpart M—Losses of Wine
§ 24.265
Losses by theft.
The proprietor shall be liable for and pay the tax on wine unlawfully removed while on bonded wine premises, or while in transit thereto or therefrom in bond, unless the proprietor or other person responsible for the tax, establishes to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the theft did not occur as the result of connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part of the proprietor or other person responsible for the tax or the owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or their agents or employees.

§ 24.266
Inventory losses.
(a)
General.
The proprietor shall take a physical inventory of all untaxpaid wine on-hand on bonded wine premises as of the close of business each tax year, or where a cycle different from the tax year has been established as provided in § 24.313, the inventory will be taken annually at the end of that cycle, or at any time required by an appropriate TTB officer. The physical inventory of bulk and bottled or packed wine will be recorded and reported as required by § 24.313.
(b)
Bulk wine losses.
The physical inventory of bulk wine will determine losses due to spillage, leakage, soakage, evaporation, and other losses normally occurring from racking and filtering since the previous physical inventory required by this section. A claim for allowance of loss, under the provisions of § 24.65, is required for inventory losses in production or storage:
(1) Where there are circumstances indicating that all or a part of the wine reported lost was unlawfully removed, or
(2)(i)(A) Where the loss of wine on bonded wine premises during the annual period exceeds three percent of the aggregate volume of wine on-hand at the beginning of the annual period and the volume of wine received in bond during the annual period;
(B) The loss exceeds six percent of the still wine or still hard cider produced by fermentation;
(C) The loss exceeds six percent of the sparkling wine or sparkling hard cider produced by fermentation in bottles;
(D) The loss exceeds three percent of the special natural wine produced under § 24.195 or other wine produced under § 24.218;
(E) The loss exceeds three percent of the artificially carbonated wine or artificially carbonated hard cider produced; or
(F) The loss exceeds three percent of the bulk process sparkling wine or bulk process sparkling hard cider produced.
(ii) The percentage applicable to each tax class of wine will be calculated separately, unless the calculation is impracticable because of the mixture of different tax classes by addition of wine spirits or blending during the annual period, in which case the percentage will be calculated on the aggregate volume. Wine removed immediately after production for use as distilling material and on which the usual racking, clarifying, and filtering losses are not sustained, will not be included in the calculations.
(c)
Bottle and other container wine losses.
Wine filled into a bottle or other similar containers are not subject to losses due to spillage, leakage, soakage, evaporation, and other losses normally occurring from racking and filtering. In addition, wine that has been filled into a bottle or other similar containers can be accurately accounted for and any unexplained shortage is considered evidence of an unreported removal. Therefore, the proprietor shall pay the tax on any unexplained loss of untaxpaid bottled or packed wine disclosed by inventory or otherwise.

# Subpart N—Removal, Return and Receipt of Wine

# Taxpaid Removals
§ 24.270
Determination of tax.
(a)
General.
The tax on wine is determined at the time of removal from a bonded wine premises for consumption or sale. Section 5041 of 26 U.S.C., imposes an excise tax, at the rates prescribed, on all wine (including imitation, substandard, or artificial wine, and compounds sold as wine, which contain 24 percent or less of alcohol by volume) produced in or imported into the United States. Wine containing more than 24 percent of alcohol by volume is classified as distilled spirits and taxed accordingly. A wine product containing less than one-half of one percent alcohol by volume is not taxable as wine when removed from the bonded wine premises.
(b)
Tax determined and paid on the volume of wine.
The tax is determined and paid on the volume of wine:
(1) In bottles or other containers filled according to United States measure recorded to the nearest 10th gallon; or,
(2) In bottles or other containers filled according to metric measure, on the volume of wine in United States wine gallons to the nearest 10th gallon; or
(3) In the case of pipeline removals, on the volume of bulk wine removed recorded to the nearest whole gallon, five-tenths gallon being converted to the next full gallon.
(c)
Tax rates imposed on wine.
The following taxes are imposed on wine:
(1)
Tax class 5041(b)(1).
On still wines containing not more than 16 percent alcohol by volume, $1.07 per wine gallon;
(2)
Tax class 5041(b)(2).
On still wines containing more than 16 percent and not exceeding 21 percent alcohol by volume, $1.57 per wine gallon;
(3)
Tax class 5041(b)(3).
On still wines containing more than 21 percent and not exceeding 24 percent alcohol by volume, $3.15 per wine gallon;

(5)
Tax class 5041(b)(5).
On artificially carbonated wines, $3.30 per wine gallon; and
(6)
Tax class 5041(b)(6).
On hard cider, 22.6 cents per wine gallon. See § 24.331 for the definition of hard cider for purposes of determining eligibility for the hard cider tax class.
(d)
Small domestic producer tax credit.
For eligibility for the small producer tax credit, see §§ 24.278 and 24.279.
[T.D. TTB-147, 82 FR 7664, Jan. 23, 2017, as amended by T.D. TTB-196, 89 FR 87942, Nov. 6, 2024]
§ 24.271
Deferred payment return periods—annual, quarterly, and semimonthly.
(a)
General.
This section governs payment of tax on a deferred basis. The tax on wine is paid by an Excise Tax Return, TTB F 5000.24, which is filled with a remittance (check, cash, or money order) of the full amount of tax due. Prepayments of tax on wine during the period covered by the return are shown separately on the Excise Tax Return form. If no tax is due for the return period, the filing of a return is not required.
(b)
Return periods and due dates
—(1)
Return periods.
(i)
Semimonthly return period.
Except in the case of a taxpayer who qualifies for, and chooses to use, an annual or quarterly return period as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(iii) of this section, all taxpayers who defer payment of taxes must use semimonthly return periods. The semimonthly return periods run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii)
Annual return period.
Subject to paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to use an annual return period if the taxpayer was not liable for more than $1,000 in taxes with respect to wine imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5041 and 7652 in the preceding calendar year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $1,000 in such taxes during the current calendar year. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2), the last day for paying the tax and filing the return will be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar year. However, the taxpayer may not use the annual return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $1,000, and any tax that has not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the quarterly or semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
(iii)
Quarterly return period.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and subject to paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to use a quarterly return period if the taxpayer was not liable for more than $50,000 in taxes with respect to wine imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5041 and 7652 in the preceding calendar year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes during the current calendar year. In such a case the last day for paying the tax and filing the return
will be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar quarter. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax that has not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
(iv)
Additional rules for annual and quarterly return periods.
The following additional rules apply to the annual and quarterly return period procedures under this section:
(A) A “taxpayer” is an individual, corporation, partnership, or other entity that is assigned a single Employer Identification Number as defined in 26 CFR 301.7701-12;
(B) “Reasonably expects” means that there is no existing or anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to exceed the prescribed limit;
(C) A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the wine tax liability for all locations to determine eligibility for the return procedures;
(D) A taxpayer who has both domestic operations and import transactions must combine the wine tax liability on the domestic operations and the imports to determine eligibility for the return procedures;
(E) The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for purposes of determining eligibility for the return procedures. However, a taxpayer who is eligible for the return procedures, and who is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more in wine excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer (EFT). Payments via EFT must be transmitted in accordance with section 5061(e);
(F) A new taxpayer is eligible to use the return procedures the first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $1,000 (in the case of the annual return procedure) or $50,000 (in the case of the quarterly return procedure) in wine taxes during that calendar year; and
(G) If a taxpayer becomes ineligible to use a return procedure described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section because the taxpayer's liability exceeds $1,000 or $50,000, respectively, in tax liability during a taxable year, that taxpayer may resume using that return procedure only after a full calendar year has passed during which the taxpayer's liability did not exceed $1,000 or $50,000 as the case may be. A taxpayer may not use an annual or quarterly return procedure during any calendar year in which the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for more than $1,000, in the case of the annual return procedure, or $50,000, in the case of the quarterly return procedure, in wine taxes.
(2)
Semimonthly, quarterly, and annual tax return due dates.
(i)
General.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii), the taxpayer must file the semimonthly, quarterly, or annual return, with remittance, for each return period not later than the 14th day after the last day of the return period. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Due dates for 2016 annual returns.
In the case of a taxpayer filing an annual return covering the 2016 calendar year, the taxpayer must file the return, with remittance, not later than January 30, 2017.
(c)
Special September rule for taxes due by semimonthly return.
(1)
Division of second semimonthly period.
(i)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the second semimonthly period for the month of September is divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 26th day, and from the 27th day through the 30th day. The proprietor shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 16-26, no later than September 29. The proprietor shall file
a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 27-30, no later than October 14.
(ii)
Taxpayment not by electronic fund transfer.
In the case of taxes for which remittance by electronic fund transfer (EFT) is not required by § 24.272, the second semimonthly period of September is divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 25th day, and from the 26th day through the 30th day. The proprietor shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 16-25, no later than September 28. The proprietor shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 26-30, no later than October 14.
(2)
Amount of payment—Safe harbor rule.
(i)
General.
Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less than 11/15ths (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
(ii)
Taxpayment not by EFT.
Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section if the amount paid no later than September 28 is not less than 2/3rds (66.7 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.
(3)
Weekends and holidays.
If the required taxpayment due date for the period September 16-25 or September 16-26, as applicable, falls on a Saturday or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day. If the required due date falls on a Sunday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately following day.
(4)
Example: Payment of tax for the month of September.
(i)
Facts.
X, a proprietor required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer, incurred tax liability in the amount of $30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September. For the period September 16-26, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $45,000, and for the period September 27-30, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $2,000.
(ii)
Payment requirement.
X's payment of tax in the amount of $30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September is due no later than September 29 (§ 24.271(b)). X's payment of tax for the period September 16-26 is also due no later than September 29 (§ 24.271(c)(1)(i)). X may use the safe harbor rule to determine the amount of payment due for the period of September 16-26 (§ 24.271(c)(2)). Under the safe harbor rule, X's payment of tax must not be less than $21,990.00, that is, 11/15ths of the tax liability incurred during the first semimonthly period of September. Additionally, X must pay the tax in the amount of $2,000 for the period September 27-30 no later than October 14 (§ 24.271(c)(1)(i)). X must also pay the underpayment of tax, $23,010.00, for the period September 16-26, no later than October 14 (§ 24.271(c)(2)).

§ 24.272
Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.
(a)
General.
(1) During a calendar year any proprietor who is liable for a gross amount of wine excise tax equal to or exceeding $5 million combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, shall during the succeeding calendar year use a financial institution in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of wine taxes for that year. A proprietor who is required by this section to make remittance by EFT may not effect payment of wine taxes by cash, check, or money order as described in § 24.271.
(2) For the purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and importations (including wines brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any drawback, credit, or refund, for all premises from which the activities are conducted by the proprietor.
(3) For the purposes of this section, a proprietor includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C.
5061 (e)(3). Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50 percent control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.
(4) A proprietor who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT shall, for each bonded wine premises from which wine is withdrawn upon determination of tax, make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate tax return.
(b)
Requirements.
(1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, except for a proprietor already remitting the tax by EFT, each proprietor who was liable during the previous calendar year for a gross amount of wine excise tax equal to or exceeding $5 million, combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, shall give written notice to the appropriate TTB officer agreeing to make remittances by EFT.
(2) For each return filed in accordance with this subpart, the proprietor shall direct the proprietor's financial institution to make an electronic fund transfer in the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request will be made to the financial institution early enough for the transfer of funds to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return as prescribed in § 24.271. The request will take into account any time limit established by the financial institution.
(3) If the proprietor was liable during the preceding calendar year for less than $5 million in wine excise taxes, combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this chapter, the proprietor may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with return as prescribed by § 24.271. Upon filing the first return on which the proprietor chooses to discontinue remittance of the tax by EFT and to begin remittance of the tax with the tax return, the proprietor shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to the tax form stating that no wine excise tax is due by EFT because the tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than $5 million, and that the remittance will be filed with the tax return.
(c)
Remittance.
(1) The proprietor shall show on the tax return information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall file the return with TTB in accordance with the instructions on the tax form.
(2) Remittances will be considered as made when the taxpayment by electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer will be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.
(3) When the proprietor directs the financial institution to effect an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b) (2) of this section, the transfer data record furnished to the proprietor through normal banking procedures will serve as the record of payment, and will be retained as part of the required records.
(d)
Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT.
The proprietor is subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, and 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.
(e)
Procedure.
Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the proprietor a TTB Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a proprietor follows when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this subpart. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will provide the proprietor with instructions for
preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to CBP for payment of excise tax on imported wine.

§ 24.276
Prepayment of tax; proprietor in default.
When the proprietor fails to forward a payment for wine excise tax due by presentment of a check or money order, or when the proprietor is otherwise in default of payment of the tax, no wine may be removed for consumption or sale until the tax has been paid for the period of the default and until the appropriate TTB officer finds the revenue will not be jeopardized by the late payment of the tax. Any remittance made during the period of the default will be in cash, or will be in the form of a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any financial institution incorporated under the laws of the United States, or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or in the form of a money order, as provided in 27 CFR 70.61 (payment by check or money order) or in the form of an electronic fund transfer.

§ 24.278
Tax credit for certain small domestic producers.
(a)
General.
A person who produces not more than 250,000 gallons of wine during the calendar year may take a credit against any tax imposed by Title 26 of the United States Code (other than Chapters 2, 21, and 22), in an amount computed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, on the first 100,000 gallons of wine (other than champagne and other sparkling wine) removed during that year for consumption or sale. This credit applies only to wine that has been produced at a qualified bonded wine premises in the United States. The small domestic wine producer tax credit is available only to eligible proprietors engaged in the business of producing wine. A proprietor who has a basic permit to produce wine but does not produce wine during a calendar year may not take the small producer wine tax credit on wine removed during that calendar year. A proprietor who has obtained a new wine producer basic permit may not take the small producer wine tax credit on wine removed until the proprietor has produced wine. “Production” of wine includes those activities described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(b)
Special rules relating to eligibility for wine credit
—(1)
Controlled groups.
For purposes of this section and § 24.279, the term “person” includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563(a), except that the phrase “more than 50 percent” must be substituted for the phrase “at least 80 percent” wherever it appears. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups that include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. Production and removals of all members of a controlled group are treated as if they were the production and removals of a single taxpayer for the purpose of determining what credit a person may use.
(2)
Credit for transferees in bond.
A person other than the eligible small producer (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the “transferee”) may take the credit under paragraph (a) of this section that would be allowed to that producer if the wine removed by the transferee had been removed by the producer on that date, under the following conditions:
(i) Wine produced by any person would be eligible for any credit under this section if removed by that person during the calendar year;
(ii) Wine produced by that person is removed during that calendar year by the transferee to whom that wine was transferred in bond and who is liable for the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5041 with respect to that wine;
(iii) That producer holds title to that wine at the time of its removal and provides to the transferee such information as is necessary to properly determine the transferee's credit under this paragraph; and
(iv) At the time of taxable removal, the producer provides to the transferee, in writing (each retaining a copy with the record of taxpaid removal from bond pursuant to § 24.310), the following information:
(A) The names of the producer and transferee;
(B) The quantity and tax class of the wines to be shipped;
(C) The date of removal from bond for consumption or sale;
(D) A confirmation that the producer is eligible for credit, with the credit rate to which the wines are entitled; and
(E) A confirmation that the subject shipment is within the first 100,000 gallons of eligible wine removed by (or on behalf of) the producer for the calendar year.
(c)
Time for determining and allowing credit.
The credit referred to in paragraph (a) of this section will be determined at the same time as the tax is determined under 26 U.S.C. 5041(a), and will be allowable at the time any tax described in paragraph (a) of this section is payable. The credit allowable by this section is treated as if it constitutes a reduction in the rate of the tax.
(d)
Computation of credit.
The credit which may be taken on the first 100,000 gallons of wine (other than champagne and other sparkling wine) removed for consumption or sale by an eligible person during a calendar year is computed as follows:
(1) For persons who produce 150,000 gallons or less of wine during the calendar year, the credit is $0.90 per gallon for wine ($0.056 for hard cider);
(2) For persons who produce more than 150,000 gallons but not more than 250,000 gallons during the calendar year, the credit is reduced by 1 percent for every 1,000 gallons produced in excess of 150,000 gallons. For example, the credit that would be taken by a person who produced 160,500 gallons of wine and hard cider during a calendar year would be reduced by 10 percent, for a net credit against the tax of $0.81 per gallon for wine or $0.0504 for hard cider, as long as the wine or hard cider was among the first 100,000 gallons removed for consumption or sale during the calendar year.
(e)
Definitions
—(1)
Production.
For purposes of determining if a person's production of wine is within the 250,000 gallon limit, production includes, in addition to wine produced by fermentation, any increase in the volume of wine due to the winery operations of amelioration, wine spirits addition, sweetening, or production of formula wine. Production of champagne and other sparkling wines is included for purposes of determining whether total production of a winery exceeds 250,000 gallons. Production includes all wine produced at qualified bonded wine premises within the United States and wine produced outside the United States by the same person.
(2)
Removals.
For purposes of determining if a person's removals are within the 100,000 gallon limit, removals include wine that the person removed from all qualified bonded wine premises within the United States. Wine removed by a transferee in bond under paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be counted against the 100,000 gallon limit of the small producer who owns that wine, and not against the limit of the transferee in bond if the transferee is also a small producer. Champagne and other sparkling wines, which are not eligible for credit, do not count as removals against the 100,000 gallon limit.
(f)
Preparation of tax return.
A person who is eligible for the credit must show the amount of wine tax before credit on the Excise Tax Return, TTB F 5000.24, and must enter the quantity of wine subject to the credit and the applicable credit rate as the explanation for an adjusting entry in Schedule B of the return for each tax period. Where a person does not use the credit authorized by this section to directly reduce the rate of Federal excise tax on wine, that person must report on TTB F 5000.24 where the credit will be, or has been, applied. Where a transferee in bond takes credit on behalf of one or more small producers, the transferee must show in Schedule B of the return the name of each producer, each producer's credit rate, and the total credit taken on behalf of each producer during the tax return period.
(g)
Denial of deduction.
Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5041(c)(5), any deduction under 26 U.S.C. subtitle A with respect to any tax against which the credit is allowed under paragraph (a) of this section must only be for the amount of the tax as reduced by the credit.
(h)
Exception to credit.
The appropriate TTB officer will deny any tax credit taken under paragraph (a) of this section where it is determined
that the allowance of the credit would benefit a person who would otherwise fail to qualify for the use of the credit.

§ 24.279
Tax adjustments related to wine credit.
(a)
Increasing adjustments.
Persons who produce more wine than the amount used in computation of the credit, or who lose eligibility by not producing during a calendar year, must make increasing tax adjustments. Where an increasing adjustment to a person's tax return is necessary as a result of an incorrect credit rate claimed pursuant to § 24.278, that person must make the adjustment on the Excise Tax Return, TTB F 5000.24, no later than the return period in which production (or the production of the controlled group of which the person is a member) exceeds the amount used in computation of the credit. If the adjustment is due to failure to produce, the person must make the adjustment no later than the last return period of the calendar year. The adjustment is the difference between the credit taken for prior return periods in that year and the appropriate credit for those return periods. The person must make tax adjustments for all bonded wine premises where excess credits were taken against tax that year, and must include interest payable. In the case of a person who continued to deduct credit after reaching the 100,000 gallon maximum during the calendar year, that person must make an adjustment in the full amount of excess credit taken and must include interest payable under 26 U.S.C. 6601 from the date on which the excess credit was taken. In addition, the person must include the penalty payable under 26 U.S.C. 6662 if the appropriate TTB officer determines that the underpayment was due to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations and advises the person to include the penalty as part of the adjustment. The appropriate TTB officer will provide information, when requested, regarding interest rates applicable to specific time periods and regarding any applicable penalties. In the case of a controlled group of bonded wine premises that took excess credits, all member proprietors who took incorrect credits must make tax adjustments as determined in this section. In the case of a small producer who instructed a transferee in bond to take credit as authorized by § 24.278(b)(2), and subsequently determines that the credit was less or not applicable, that producer must immediately inform the transferee in bond, in writing, of the correct credit information. The transferee must make any increasing adjustment on its next tax return based on revised credit information given by the producer or a TTB officer.
(b)
Decreasing adjustments.
Where a person fails to deduct the credit or deducts less than the appropriate credit provided for by § 24.278 during the calendar year, the person may file a claim for refund of excess tax paid. The claim must be filed in accordance with § 24.69. In the case of wine removed on behalf of a small producer by a transferee in bond, if the transferee in bond was instructed to deduct credit and failed to deduct credit or deducted less than the appropriate credit and was later reimbursed for the tax by that producer, the transferee may file the claim. The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6423 and 27 CFR part 70, subpart F, will apply, and the producer and transferee in bond must show that the conditions of § 24.278(b)(2) were met.
