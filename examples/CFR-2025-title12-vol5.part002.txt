Among other things, for a loan to be considered for re-aging, the following must be true: (1) The borrower must have demonstrated a renewed willingness and ability to repay the loan; (2) the loan must have existed for at least nine months; and (3) the borrower must have made at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent cumulative amount.
(ii) The program has clearly defined policy guidelines and parameters for re-aging, as well as internal methods of ensuring the reasonableness of those guidelines and monitoring their effectiveness; and
(iii) The bank monitors both the number and dollar amount of re-aged accounts, collects and analyzes data to assess the performance of re-aged accounts, and determines the effect of re-aging practices on past due ratios;
(b) Modifications to a loan that would otherwise meet this definition of refinance, but result in the classification of a loan as a
TDR or modification to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty;
(c) Any modification made to a consumer loan pursuant to a government program, such as the Home Affordable Modification Program or the Home Affordable Refinance Program;
(d) Deferrals under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act;
(e) A contractual deferral of payments or change in interest rate that is consistent with the terms of the original loan agreement (
e.g.,
as allowed in some student loans);
(f) Except as provided above, a modification or series of modifications to a closed-end consumer loan;
(g) An advance of funds, an increase in the line of credit, or a change in the interest rate that is consistent with the terms of the loan agreement for an open-end or revolving line of credit (
e.g.,
credit cards or home equity lines of credit);
(h) For credit card loans:
(i) Replacing an existing card because the original is expiring, for security reasons, or because of a new technology or a new system;
(ii) Reissuing a credit card that has been temporarily suspended (as opposed to closed);
(iii) Temporarily increasing the line of credit;
(iv) Providing access to additional credit when a bank has internally approved a higher credit line than it has made available to the customer; or
(v) Changing the interest rate of a credit card line when mandated by law (such as in the case of the Credit CARD Act).

# 4. Nontraditional mortgage loans
Nontraditional mortgage loans include all residential loan products that allow the borrower to defer repayment of principal or interest and include all interest-only products, teaser rate mortgages, and negative amortizing mortgages, with the exception of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) or reverse mortgages. A teaser-rate mortgage loan is defined as a mortgage with a discounted initial rate where the lender offers a lower rate and lower payments for part of the mortgage term. A mortgage loan is no longer considered a nontraditional mortgage loan once the teaser rate has expired. An interest-only loan is no longer considered a nontraditional mortgage loan once the loan begins to amortize.
Banks must determine whether residential loans meet the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan as of origination, or, if the loan has been refinanced, as of refinance, as refinance is defined in this Appendix for purposes of higher-risk consumer loans. When a bank acquires a residential loan, it must determine whether the loan meets the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan using the origination criteria and analysis performed by the original lender. If this information is unavailable, the bank must obtain refreshed data from the borrower or other appropriate third party. Refreshed data for residential loans is defined as the most recent data available. The data, however, must be as of a date that is no earlier than three months before the acquisition of the residential loan. The acquiring bank must also determine whether an acquired loan is higher risk not later than three months after acquisition.
When a bank acquires loans from another entity on a recurring or programmatic basis, however, the acquiring bank may determine whether the loan meets the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan using the origination criteria and analysis performed by the original lender only if the acquiring bank verifies the information provided. Loans acquired from another entity are acquired on a recurring basis if a bank has acquired other loans from that entity at least once within the calendar year or the previous calendar year of the acquisition of the loans in question.

# 5. Higher-Risk Securitizations
Higher-risk securitizations are defined as securitization exposures (except securitizations classified as trading book), where, in aggregate, more than 50 percent of the assets backing the securitization meet either the criteria for higher-risk C
I loans or securities, higher-risk consumer loans, or nontraditional mortgage loans, except those classified as trading book. A securitization exposure is as defined in 12 CFR 324.2, as it may be amended from time to time. A higher-risk securitization excludes the maximum amount that is recoverable from the U.S. government under guarantee or insurance provisions.
A bank must determine whether a securitization is higher risk based upon information as of the date of issuance (
i.e.,
the date the securitization is sold on a market to the public for the first time). The bank must make this determination within the time limit that would apply under this Appendix if the bank were directly acquiring loans or securities of the type underlying the securitization. In making the determination, a bank must use one of the following methods:
(a) For a securitization collateralized by a static pool of loans, whose underlying collateral changes due to the sale or amortization of these loans, the 50 percent threshold is to be determined based upon the amount of higher-risk assets, as defined in this Appendix, owned by the securitization on the date of issuance of the securitization.
(b) For a securitization collateralized by a dynamic pool of loans, whose underlying collateral may change by the purchase of additional assets, including purchases made during a ramp-up period, the 50 percent threshold is to be determined based upon the highest amount of higher-risk assets, as defined in this Appendix, allowable under the portfolio guidelines of the securitization.
A bank is not required to evaluate a securitization on a continuous basis when the securitization is collateralized by a dynamic pool of loans; rather, the bank is only required to evaluate the securitization once.
A bank is required to use the information that is reasonably available to a sophisticated investor in reasonably determining whether a securitization meets the 50 percent threshold. Information reasonably available to a sophisticated investor includes, but is not limited to, offering memoranda, indentures, trustee reports, and requests for information from servicers, collateral managers, issuers, trustees, or similar third parties. When determining whether a revolving trust or similar securitization meets the threshold, a bank may use established criteria, model portfolios, or limitations published in the offering memorandum, indenture, trustee report, or similar documents.
Sufficient information necessary for a bank to make a definitive determination may not, in every case, be reasonably available to the bank as a sophisticated investor. In such a case, the bank may exercise its judgment in making the determination. In some cases, the bank need not rely upon all of the aforementioned pieces of information to make a higher-risk determination if fewer documents provide sufficient data to make the determination.
In cases in which a securitization is required to be consolidated on the balance sheet as a result of SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, and a bank has access to the necessary information, a bank may opt for an alternative method of evaluating the securitization to determine whether it is higher risk. The bank may evaluate individual loans in the securitization on a loan-by-loan basis and only report as higher risk those loans that meet the definition of a higher-risk asset; any loan within the securitization that does not meet the definition of a higher-risk asset need not be reported as such. When making this evaluation, the bank must follow the provisions of section I.B herein. Once a bank evaluates a securitization for higher-risk asset designation using this alternative evaluation method, it must continue to evaluate all securitizations that it has consolidated on the balance sheet as a result of SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, and for which it has the required information, using the alternative evaluation method. For securitizations for which the bank does not have access to information on a loan-by-loan basis, the bank must determine whether the securitization meets the 50 percent threshold in the manner previously described for other securitizations.

# B. Application of Definitions
Section I of this Appendix applies to:
(1) All construction and land development loans, whenever originated or purchased;
(2) C
I loans (as that term is defined in this Appendix) owed to a reporting bank by a higher-risk C
I borrower (as that term is defined in this Appendix) and all securities issued by a higher-risk C
I borrower, except securitizations of C
I loans, that are owned by the reporting bank;
(3) Consumer loans (as defined in this Appendix), except securitizations of consumer loans, whenever originated or purchased;
(4) Securitizations of C
I and consumer loans (as defined in this Appendix) issued on or after April 1, 2013, including those securitizations issued on or after April 1, 2013, that are partially or fully collateralized by loans originated before April 1, 2013.
For C
I loans that are either originated or refinanced by a reporting bank before April 1, 2013, or purchased by a reporting bank before April 1, 2013, where the loans are owed to the reporting bank by a borrower that does not meet the definition of a higher-risk C
I borrower as that term is defined in this Appendix (which requires, among other things, that the borrower have obtained a C
I loan or refinanced an existing C
I loan on or after April 1, 2013) and securities purchased before April 1, 2013, that are issued by an entity that does not meet the definition of a higher-risk C
I borrower, as that term is defined in this Appendix, banks must continue to use the transition guidance in the September 2012 Call Report instructions to determine whether to report the loan or security as a higher-risk asset for purposes of the higher-risk assets to Tier 1 capital and reserves ratio. A bank may opt to apply the definition of higher-risk C
I loans and securities in this Appendix to all of its C
I loans and securities, but, if it does so, it must also apply the definition of a higher-risk C
I borrower in this Appendix without regard to when the loan is originally made or refinanced (
i.e.,
whether made or refinanced before or after April 1, 2013).
For consumer loans (other than securitizations of consumer loans) originated or purchased prior to April 1, 2013, a bank must determine whether the loan met the definition of a higher-risk consumer loan no later than June 30, 2013.
For all securitizations issued before April 1, 2013, banks must either (1) continue to use the transition guidance or (2) apply the definitions in this Appendix to all of its securitizations. If a bank applies the definition of higher-risk C
I loans and securities
in this Appendix to its securitizations, it must also apply the definition of a higher-risk C
I borrower in this Appendix to all C
I borrowers without regard to when the loans to those borrowers were originally made or refinanced (
i.e.,
whether made or refinanced before or after April 1, 2013).

# II. Growth-Adjusted Portfolio Concentration Measure
The
growth-adjusted concentration measure
is the sum of the values of concentrations in each of the seven portfolios, each of the values being first adjusted for risk weights and growth. The product of the risk weight and the concentration ratio is first squared and then multiplied by the growth factor. The measure is calculated as:
ER31OC12.030
Where:
N is bank
i'
s growth-adjusted portfolio concentration measure;
13
13
The growth-adjusted portfolio concentration measure is rounded to two decimal points.
k
is a portfolio;
g
is a growth factor for bank

k;
and,
w is a risk weight for portfolio
k.
The seven portfolios (k) are defined based on the Call Report/TFR data and they are:
• Construction and land development loans;
• Other commercial real estate loans;
• First-lien residential mortgages and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (excludes CMOs, REMICS, CMO and REMIC residuals, and stripped MBS issued by non-U.S. government issuers for which the collateral consists of MBS issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies);
• Closed-end junior liens and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs);
• Commercial and industrial loans;
• Credit card loans; and
• Other consumer loans.
14 15
14
All loan concentrations should include the fair value of purchased credit impaired loans.
15
Each loan concentration category should exclude the amount of loans recoverable from the U.S. government under guarantee or insurance provisions.
The growth factor,
g,
is based on a three-year merger-adjusted growth rate for a given portfolio;
g
ranges from 1 to 1.2 where a 20 percent growth rate equals a factor of 1 and an 80 percent growth rate equals a factor of 1.2.
16
For growth rates less than 20 percent,
g
is 1; for growth rates greater than 80 percent,
g
is 1.2. For growth rates between 20 percent and 80 percent, the growth factor is calculated as:
16
The growth factor is rounded to two decimal points.
ER31OC12.031
Where:
ER31OC12.032
V is the portfolio amount as reported on the Call Report/TFR and t is the quarter for which the assessment is being determined.
The risk weight for each portfolio reflects relative peak loss rates for banks at the 90th percentile during the 1990-2009 period.
17
These loss rates were converted into equivalent risk weights as shown in Table C.1.
17
The risk weights are based on loss rates for each portfolio relative to the loss rate for C
I loans, which is given a risk weight of 1. The peak loss rates were derived as follows. The loss rate for each loan category for each bank with over $5 billion in total assets was calculated for each of the last twenty calendar years (1990-2009). The highest value of the 90th percentile of each loan category over the twenty year period was selected as the peak loss rate.

# Appendix D to Subpart A of Part 327—Description of the Loss Severity Measure
The loss severity measure applies a standardized set of assumptions to an institution's balance sheet to measure possible losses to the FDIC in the event of an institution's failure. To determine an institution's loss severity rate, the FDIC first applies assumptions about uninsured deposit and other unsecured liability runoff, and growth in insured deposits, to adjust the size and composition of the institution's liabilities. Assets are then reduced to match any reduction in liabilities.
1
The institution's asset values are then further reduced so that the Leverage ratio reaches 2 percent.
2 3
In both cases, assets are adjusted pro rata to preserve the institution's asset composition. Assumptions regarding loss rates at failure for a given asset category and the extent of secured liabilities are then applied to estimated assets and liabilities at failure to determine whether the institution has enough unencumbered assets to cover domestic deposits. Any projected shortfall is divided by current domestic deposits to obtain an end-of-period loss severity ratio. The loss severity measure is an average loss severity ratio for the three most recent quarters of data available.
1
In most cases, the model would yield reductions in liabilities and assets prior to failure. Exceptions may occur for institutions primarily funded through insured deposits which the model assumes to grow prior to failure.
2
Of course, in reality, runoff and capital declines occur more or less simultaneously as an institution approaches failure. The loss severity measure assumptions simplify this process for ease of modeling.
3
The applicable portions of the current expected credit loss methodology (CECL) transitional amounts attributable to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment and added to retained earnings for regulatory capital purposes pursuant to the regulatory capital regulations, as they may be amended from time to time (12 CFR part 3, 12 CFR part 217, 12 CFR part 324, 85 FR 61577 (Sept. 30, 2020), and 84 FR 4222 (Feb. 14, 2019)), will be removed from the calculation of the loss severity measure.

• Federal Funds Sold and Repurchase Agreements;
• Treasury and Agency Securities;
• Municipal Securities;
• Other Securities;
• Construction and Development Loans;
• Nonresidential Real Estate Loans;

• 1-4 Family Closed-End First Liens;
• 1-4 Family Closed-End Junior Liens;
• Revolving Home Equity Loans; and
• Agricultural Real Estate Loans.

The FDIC's loss given failure (LGD) is calculated as:
ER25FE11.013
An end-of-quarter loss severity ratio is LGD divided by total domestic deposits at quarter-end and the loss severity measure
for the scorecard is an average of end-of-period loss severity ratios for three most recent quarters.

Definition of Loan Mix Index.
The Loan Mix Index assigns loans in an institution's loan portfolio to the categories of loans described in the following table. Exclude from the balance of commercial and industrial loans the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program. In the event that the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program exceeds the balance of commercial and industrial loans, exclude the remaining balance from the balance of agricultural loans, up to the total amount of agricultural loans. The Loan Mix Index is calculated by multiplying the ratio of an institution's amount of loans in a particular loan category to its total assets, excluding the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program by the associated weighted average charge-off rate for that loan category, and summing the products for all loan categories. The table gives the weighted average charge-off rate for each category of loan. The Loan Mix Index excludes credit card loans.

Concentration Measure for Large Insured depository institutions (excluding Highly Complex Institutions)
The concentration score for large institutions is the higher of the following two scores:
(1) Higher-Risk Assets/Tier 1 Capital and Reserves
Sum of construction and land development (C
D) loans (funded and unfunded), higher-risk commercial and industrial (C
I) loans (funded and unfunded), nontraditional mortgages, higher-risk consumer loans, and higher-risk securitizations divided by Tier 1 capital and reserves. See Appendix C for the detailed description of the ratio
No Exclusion.
(2) Growth-Adjusted Portfolio Concentrations
The measure is calculated in the following steps:
(1) Concentration levels (as a ratio to Tier 1 capital and reserves) are calculated for each broad portfolio category:
• Constructions and land development (C
D),
• Other commercial real estate loans,
• First lien residential mortgages (including non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities),
• Closed-end junior liens and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs),
• Commercial and industrial loans (C
I),
• Credit card loans, and
• Other consumer loans.
(2) Risk weights are assigned to each loan category based on historical loss rates.
(3) Concentration levels are multiplied by risk weights and squared to produce a risk-adjusted concentration ratio for each portfolio.
(4) Three-year merger-adjusted portfolio growth rates are then scaled to a growth factor of 1 to 1.2 where a 3-year cumulative growth rate of 20 percent or less equals a factor of 1 and a growth rate of 80 percent or greater equals a factor of 1.2. If three years of data are not available, a growth factor of 1 will be assigned
Exclude from C
I loan growth rate the outstanding amount of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program.
(5) The risk-adjusted concentration ratio for each portfolio is multiplied by the growth factor and resulting values are summed
See Appendix C for the detailed description of the measure
Concentration Measure for Highly Complex Institutions
Concentration score for highly complex institutions is the highest of the following three scores:
(1) Higher-Risk Assets/Tier 1 Capital and Reserves
Sum of C
D loans (funded and unfunded), higher-risk C
I loans (funded and unfunded), nontraditional mortgages, higher-risk consumer loans, and higher-risk securitizations divided by Tier 1 capital and reserves. See Appendix C for the detailed description of the measure
No Exclusion.
(2) Top 20 Counterparty Exposure/Tier 1 Capital and Reserves
Sum of the 20 largest total exposure amounts to counterparties divided by Tier 1 capital and reserves. The total exposure amount is equal to the sum of the institution's exposure amounts to one counterparty (or borrower) for derivatives, securities financing transactions (SFTs), and cleared transactions, and its gross lending exposure (including all unfunded commitments) to that counterparty (or borrower). A counterparty includes an entity's own affiliates. Exposures to entities that are affiliates of each other are treated as exposures to one counterparty (or borrower). Counterparty exposure excludes all counterparty exposure to the U.S. Government and departments or agencies of the U.S. Government that is unconditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The exposure amount for derivatives, including OTC derivatives, cleared transactions that are derivative contracts, and netting sets of derivative contracts, must be calculated using the methodology set forth in 12 CFR 324.34(b), but without any reduction for collateral other than cash collateral that is all or part of variation margin and that satisfies the requirements of 12 CFR 324.10(c)(4)(ii)(C)(1)(ii) and (iii) and 324.10(c)(4)(ii)(C)(3) through (7). The exposure amount associated with SFTs, including cleared transactions that are SFTs, must be calculated using the standardized approach set forth in 12 CFR 324.37(b) or (c). For both derivatives and SFT exposures, the exposure amount to central counterparties must also include the default fund contribution
No Exclusion.
(3) Largest Counterparty Exposure/Tier 1 Capital and Reserves
The largest total exposure amount to one counterparty divided by Tier 1 capital and reserves. The total exposure amount is equal to the sum of the institution's exposure amounts to one counterparty (or borrower) for derivatives, SFTs, and cleared transactions, and its gross lending exposure (including all unfunded commitments) to that counterparty (or borrower). A counterparty includes an entity's own affiliates. Exposures to entities that are affiliates of each other are treated as exposures to one counterparty (or borrower). Counterparty exposure excludes all counterparty exposure to the U.S. Government and departments or agencies of the U.S. Government that is unconditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The exposure amount for derivatives, including OTC derivatives, cleared transactions that are derivative contracts, and netting sets of derivative contracts, must be calculated using the methodology set forth in 12 CFR 324.34(b), but without any reduction for collateral other than cash collateral that is all or part of variation margin and that satisfies the requirements of 12 CFR 324.10(c)(4)(ii)(C)(1)(ii) and (iii) and 324.10(c)(4)(ii)(C)(3) through (7). The exposure amount associated with SFTs, including cleared transactions that are SFTs, must be calculated using the standardized approach set forth in 12 CFR 324.37(b) or (c). For both derivatives and SFT exposures, the exposure amount to central counterparties must also include the default fund contribution
No Exclusion.
Core Earnings/Average Quarter-End Total Assets
Core earnings are defined as net income less extraordinary items and tax-adjusted realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) securities, adjusted for mergers. The ratio takes a four-quarter sum of merger-adjusted core earnings and divides it by an average of five quarter-end total assets (most recent and four prior quarters). If four quarters of data on core earnings are not available, data for quarters that are available will be added and annualized. If five quarters of data on total assets are not available, data for quarters that are available will be averaged
Prior to averaging, exclude from total assets for the applicable quarter-end periods the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program.
Credit Quality Measure.

The credit quality score is the higher of the following two scores:
(1) Criticized and Classified Items/Tier 1 Capital and Reserves
Sum of criticized and classified items divided by the sum of Tier 1 capital and reserves. Criticized and classified items include items an institution or its primary federal regulator have graded “Special Mention” or worse and include retail items under Uniform Retail Classification Guidelines, securities, funded and unfunded loans, other real estate owned (ORE), other assets, and marked-to-market counterparty positions, less credit valuation adjustments. Criticized and classified items exclude loans and securities in trading books, and the amount recoverable from the U.S. government, its agencies, or government-sponsored enterprises, under guarantee or insurance provisions

The applicable portions of the current expected credit loss methodology (CECL) transitional amounts attributable to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment and added to retained earnings for regulatory capital purposes pursuant to the regulatory capital regulations, as they may be amended from time to time (12 CFR part 3, 12 CFR part 217, 12 CFR part 324, 85 FR 61577 (Sept. 30, 2020), and 84 FR 4222 (Feb. 14, 2019)), will be removed from the sum of Tier 1 capital and reserves throughout the large bank and highly complex bank scorecards, including in the ratio of Higher-Risk Assets to Tier 1 Capital and Reserves, the Growth-Adjusted Portfolio Concentrations Measure, the ratio of Top 20 Counterparty Exposure to Tier 1 Capital and Reserves, the Ratio of Largest Counterparty Exposure to Tier 1 Capital and Reserves, the ratio of Criticized and Classified Items to Tier 1 Capital and Reserves, and the ratio of Underperforming Assets to Tier 1 Capital and Reserves. All of these ratios are described in appendix A of this subpart.
2
The credit quality score is the greater of the criticized and classified items to Tier 1 capital and reserves score or the underperforming assets to Tier 1 capital and reserves score. The market risk score is the weighted average of three scores—the trading revenue volatility to Tier 1 capital score, the market risk capital to Tier 1 capital score, and the level 3 trading assets to Tier 1 capital score. All of these ratios are described in appendix A of this subpart and the method of calculating the scores is described in appendix B of this subpart. Each score is multiplied by its respective weight, and the resulting weighted score is summed to compute the score for the market risk measure. An overall weight of 35 percent is allocated between the scores for the credit quality measure and market risk measure. The allocation depends on the ratio of average trading assets to the sum of average securities, loans and trading assets (trading asset ratio) as follows: (1) Weight for credit quality score = 35 percent * (1—trading asset ratio); and, (2) Weight for market risk score = 35 percent * trading asset ratio. In calculating the trading asset ratio, exclude from the balance of loans the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program.
(a)
Description of the loss severity measure.
The loss severity measure applies a standardized set of assumptions to an institution's balance sheet to measure possible losses to the FDIC in the event of an institution's failure. To determine an institution's loss severity rate, the FDIC first applies assumptions about uninsured deposit and other liability runoff, and growth in insured deposits, to adjust the size and composition of the institution's liabilities. Exclude total outstanding borrowings from Federal Reserve Banks under the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility from short-and long-term secured borrowings, as appropriate. Assets are then reduced to match any reduction in liabilities. Exclude from an institution's balance of commercial and industrial loans the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program. In the event that the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program exceeds the balance of commercial and industrial loans, exclude any remaining balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program first from the balance of all other loans, up to the total amount of all other loans, followed by the balance of agricultural loans, up to the total amount of agricultural loans. Increase cash balances by outstanding loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program that exceed total outstanding borrowings from Federal Reserve Banks under the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility, if any. The institution's asset values are then further reduced so that the Leverage Ratio reaches 2 percent. In both cases, assets are adjusted pro rata to preserve the institution's asset composition. Assumptions regarding loss rates at failure for a given asset category and the extent of secured liabilities are then applied to estimated assets and liabilities at failure to determine whether the institution has enough unencumbered assets to cover domestic deposits. Any projected shortfall is divided by current domestic deposits to obtain an end-of-period loss severity ratio. The loss severity measure is an average loss severity ratio for the three most recent quarters of data available. The applicable portions of the current expected credit loss methodology (CECL) transitional amounts attributable to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment and added to retained earnings for regulatory capital purposes pursuant to the regulatory capital regulations, as they may be amended from time to time (12 CFR part 3, 12 CFR part 217, 12 CFR part 324, 85 FR 61577 (Sept. 30, 2020), and 84 FR 4222 (Feb. 14, 2019)), will be removed from the calculation of the loss severity measure.

Unsecured debt adjustment
The unsecured debt adjustment shall be determined as the sum of the initial base assessment rate plus 40 basis points; that sum shall be multiplied by the ratio of an insured depository institution's long-term unsecured debt to its assessment base. The amount of the reduction in the assessment rate due to the adjustment is equal to the dollar amount of the adjustment divided by the amount of the assessment base
Exclude from the assessment base the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program and the quarterly average amount of assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility.
Depository institution debt adjustment
An insured depository institution shall pay a 50 basis point adjustment on the amount of unsecured debt it holds that was issued by another insured depository institution to the extent that such debt exceeds 3 percent of the institution's Tier 1 capital. This amount is divided by the institution's assessment base. The amount of long-term unsecured debt issued by another insured depository institution shall be calculated using the same valuation methodology used to calculate the amount of such debt for reporting on the asset side of the balance sheets
Exclude from the assessment base the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program and the quarterly average amount of assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility.
Brokered deposit adjustment
The brokered deposit adjustment shall be determined by multiplying 25 basis points by the ratio of the difference between an insured depository institution's brokered deposits and 10 percent of its domestic deposits to its assessment base
Exclude from the assessment base the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program and the quarterly average amount of assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility.

§ 327.30
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Scope.
This subpart B of part 327 implements the one-time assessment credit required by section 7(e)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1817(e)(3) and applies to insured depository institutions.
(b)
Purpose.
This subpart B of part 327 sets forth the rules for:
(1) Determination of the aggregate amount of the one-time credit;
(2) Identification of eligible insured depository institutions;
(3) Determination of the amount of each eligible institution's December 31, 1996 assessment base ratio and one-time credit;
(4) Transferability of credit amounts among insured depository institutions;
(5) Application of such credit amounts against assessments; and
(6) An institution's request for review of the FDIC's determination of a credit amount.
§ 327.31
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart and subpart C:
(a) The
average assessment rate
for any assessment period means the aggregate assessment charged all insured depository institutions for that period divided by the aggregate assessment base for that period.
(b)
Board
means the Board of Directors of the FDIC.
(c)
De facto rule
means any transaction in which an insured depository institution assumes substantially all of the deposit liabilities and acquires substantially all of the assets of any other insured depository institution at the time of the transaction.
(d) An
eligible insured depository institution:
(1) Means an insured depository institution that:
(i) Was in existence on December 31, 1996, and paid a deposit insurance assessment before December 31, 1996; or
(ii) Is a successor to an insured depository institution referred to in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section; and
(2) does not include an institution if its insured status has terminated as of or after the effective date of this regulation.
(e)
Merger
means any transaction in which an insured depository institution merges or consolidates with any other insured depository institution. Notwithstanding part 303, subpart D, for purposes of this subpart B and subpart C of this part,
merger
does not include transactions in which an insured depository institution either directly or indirectly acquires the assets of, or assumes liability to pay any deposits made in, any other insured depository institution, but there is not a legal merger or consolidation of the two insured depository institutions.
(f)
Resulting institution
refers to the acquiring, assuming, or resulting institution in a merger.
(g)
Successor
means a resulting institution or an insured depository institution that acquired part of another insured depository institution's 1996 assessment base ratio under paragraph 327.33(c) of this subpart under the
de facto
rule.
§ 327.32
Determination of aggregate credit amount.
The aggregate amount of the one-time credit shall equal $4,707,580,238.19.
§ 327.33
Determination of eligible institution's credit amount.
(a) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, allocation of the one-time credit shall be based on each eligible insured depository institution's 1996 assessment base ratio.
(b) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, an eligible insured depository institution's 1996 assessment base ratio shall consist of:
(1) Its assessment base as of December 31, 1996 (adjusted as appropriate to reflect the assessment base of December 31, 1996, of all institutions for which it is the successor), as the numerator; and
(2) The combined aggregate assessment bases of all eligible insured depository institutions, including any successor institutions, as of December 31, 1996, as the denominator.
(c) If an insured depository institution is a successor to an eligible insured depository institution under the
de facto
rule, as defined in paragraph 327.31(c) of this subpart, the successor and the eligible insured depository institution will divide the eligible insured depository institution's 1996 assessment base ratio pro rata, based on the deposit liabilities assumed in the transaction. In any subsequent transaction involving an insured depository institution that previously engaged in a transaction to which the
de facto
rule applied, the insured depository institution may not be deemed to have transferred more than its remaining 1996 assessment base ratio. If the transferring institution is no longer an insured depository institution after the transfer, the last successor will acquire the transferring institution's remaining 1996 assessment base ratio.
§ 327.34
Transferability of credits.
(a) Any remaining amount of the one-time assessment credit and the associated 1996 assessment base ratio shall transfer to a successor of an eligible insured depository institution.

The parties to the agreement shall notify the FDIC's Division of Finance and submit a written agreement, signed by legal representatives of both institutions. The parties must include documentation stating that each representative has the legal authority to bind the institution. The adjustment to credit amount and the associated 1996 assessment base ratio shall be made in the next assessment invoice that is sent at least 10 days after the FDIC's receipt of the written agreement.
(c) An eligible insured depository institution may enter into an agreement after the final determination of its 1996 assessment base ratio and one-time credit amount by the FDIC to transfer any portion of such institution's one-time credit amount to another insured depository institution. The parties to the agreement shall notify the FDIC's Division of Finance and submit a written agreement, signed by legal representatives of both institutions. The parties must include documentation stating that each representative has the legal authority to bind the institution. The adjustment to the credit amount shall be made in the next assessment invoice that is sent at least 10 days after the FDIC's receipt of the written agreement.
§ 327.35
Application of credits.
(a) Subject to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of an eligible insured depository institution's one-time credit shall be applied to the maximum extent allowable by law against that institution's quarterly assessment payment under subpart A of this part, after applying assessment credits awarded under § 327.11(c), until the institution's credit is exhausted.
(b) The following limitations shall apply to the application of the credit against assessment payments.
(1) For assessments that become due for assessment periods beginning in calendar years 2008, 2009, and 2010, the credit may not be applied to more than 90 percent of the quarterly assessment.
(2) For an insured depository institution that exhibits financial, operational, or compliance weaknesses ranging from moderately severe to unsatisfactory, or is not at least adequately capitalized (as defined pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) at the beginning of an assessment period, the amount of the credit that may be applied against the institution's quarterly assessment for that period shall not exceed the amount that the institution would have been assessed if it had been assessed at the average assessment rate for all insured institutions for that period. The FDIC shall determine the average assessment rate for an assessment period based upon its best estimate of the average rate for the period. The estimate shall be made using the best information available, but shall be made no earlier than 30 days and no later than 20 days prior to the payment due date for the period.
(3) If the FDIC has established a restoration plan pursuant to section 7(b)(3)(E) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may elect to restrict the application of credit amounts, in any assessment period, up to the lesser of:
(i) The amount of an insured depository institution's assessment for that period; or
(ii) The amount equal to 3 basis points of the institution's assessment base.
(c)
Remittance of credits.
Subject to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section, in the same assessment period that the FDIC remits the full nominal value of small bank assessment credits pursuant to § 327.11(c)(13), the FDIC shall remit the full nominal value of an institution's remaining one-time assessment credits provided under this subpart B in a single lump-sum payment to such institution.

§ 327.36
Requests for review of credit amount.
(a)(1) As soon as practicable after the publication date of this rule, the FDIC shall notify each insured depository institution by FDIC
connect
or mail of its 1996 assessment base ratio and credit amount in a Statement of One-Time Credit (“Statement”), if any. An insured depository institution may submit a request for review of the FDIC's determination of the institution's 1996 assessment base ratio or credit amount as shown on the Statement within 30 days after the effective date of this rule. Such review may be requested if:
(i) The institution disagrees with a determination as to eligibility for the credit that relates to that institution's credit amount;
(ii) The institution disagrees with the calculation of the credit as stated on the Statement; or
(iii) The institution believes that the 1996 assessment base ratio attributed to the institution on the Statement does not fully or accurately reflect its own 1996 assessment base or appropriate adjustments for successors.
(2) If an institution does not submit a timely request for review, that institution is barred from subsequently requesting review of its credit amount, subject to paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)(1) An insured depository institution may submit a request for review of the FDIC's adjustment to the credit amount in a quarterly invoice within 30 days of the date on which the FDIC provides the invoice. Such review may be requested if:
(i) The institution disagrees with the calculation of the credit as stated on the invoice; or
(ii) The institution believes that the 1996 assessment base ratio attributed to the institution due to the adjustment to the invoice does not fully or accurately reflect appropriate adjustments for successors since the last quarterly invoice.
(2) If an institution does not submit a timely request for review, that institution is barred from subsequently requesting review of its credit amount, subject to paragraph (e) of this section.
(c) The request for review shall be submitted to the Division of Finance and shall provide documentation sufficient to support the change sought by the institution. At the time of filing with the FDIC, the requesting institution shall notify, to the extent practicable, any other insured depository institution that would be directly and materially affected by granting the request for review and provide such institution with copies of the request for review, the supporting documentation, and the FDIC's procedures for requests under this subpart. In addition, the FDIC also shall make reasonable efforts, based on its official systems of records, to determine that such institutions have been identified and notified.
(d) During the FDIC's consideration of the request for review, the amount of credit in dispute shall not be available for use by any institution.
(e) Within 30 days of being notified of the filing of the request for review, those institutions identified as potentially affected by the request for review may submit a response to such request, along with any supporting documentation, to the Division of Finance, and shall provide copies to the requesting institution. If an institution that was notified under paragraph (c) does not submit a response to the request for review, that institution may not:
(1) Subsequently dispute the information submitted by other institutions on the transaction(s) at issue in the review process; or
(2) Appeal the decision by the Director of the Division of Finance.
(f) If additional information is requested of the requesting or affected institutions by the FDIC, such information shall be provided by the institution within 21 days of the date of the FDIC's request for additional information.
(g) Any institution submitting a timely request for review will receive a written response from the FDIC's Director of the Division of Finance, (or his or her designee), notifying the requesting and affected institutions of the determination of the Director as to whether the requested change is warranted. Notice of the procedures applicable to appeals under paragraph (h) of this section will be included with the Director's written determination. Whenever feasible, the FDIC will provide the institution with the aforesaid written response the later of:
(1) Within 60 days of receipt by the FDIC of the request for revision;
(2) If additional institutions have been notified by the requesting institution or the FDIC, within 60 days of the date of the last response to the notification; or
(3) If additional information has been requested by the FDIC, within 60 days of receipt of the additional information.
(h) Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, the insured depository institution that requested review under this section, or an insured depository institution materially affected by the Director's determination, that disagrees with that determination may appeal to the FDIC's Assessment Appeals Committee on the same grounds as set
forth under paragraph (a) of this section. Any such appeal must be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of the Director's written determination. Notice of the procedures applicable to appeals under this section will be included with the Director's written determination. The decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee shall be the final determination of the FDIC.
(i) Any adjustment to an institution's credits resulting from a determination by the Director of the FDIC's Assessment Appeals Committee shall be reflected in the institution's next assessment invoice. The adjustment to credits shall affect future assessments only and shall not result in a retroactive adjustment of assessment amounts owed for prior periods.

FDIC-Insured—Backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government”
shall be displayed in regular 400 italic (12.8px) and with black (hexadecimal color code #000000) lettering. The entire FDIC official digital sign shall be displayed in Source Sans Pro Web. If the FDIC official digital sign in these colors would be illegible in a digital-taking channel, due to the color of the background, the entire FDIC official digital sign shall be displayed in white (hexadecimal color code #FFFFFF).

ER18JA24.002

If a digital deposit-taking channel offers both access to deposits at an insured depository institution and non-deposit products, the insured depository institution must clearly and conspicuously display signage indicating that the non-deposit products: are not insured by the FDIC; are not deposits; and may lose value. This signage must be displayed continuously on each page relating to non-deposit products. This non-deposit signage may not be displayed in close proximity to the digital sign required by paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) One-Time Notification for Bank Customers Related to Third-Party Non-deposit Products. If a digital deposit-taking channel offers access to non-deposit products from a non-bank third party's online platform, and a logged-in bank customer attempts to access such non-deposit products, the insured depository institution must provide a one-time per web session notification on the insured depository institution's deposit-taking channel before the customer leaves the insured depository institution's digital deposit-taking channel. The notification must be dismissed by an action of the bank customer before initially accessing the third party's online platform and it must clearly, conspicuously indicate that the third party's non-deposit products: are not insured by the FDIC; are not deposits; and may lose value. Nothing in this paragraph shall be read to limit an insured depository institution's ability to include additional disclosures in the notification that may help prevent consumer confusion, including, for example, that the bank customer is leaving the insured depository institution's website.
(h)
Required changes in digital signage.
The Corporation may require any insured depository institution, upon at least thirty (30) days' written notice, to change the wording, color or placement of the FDIC official digital sign and other signs for digital deposit-taking channels when it is deemed necessary for the protection of depositors or others or to ensure consistency with this part's requirement.

(5) Without limitation, a statement regarding deposit insurance will be deemed to omit or fail to clearly and conspicuously disclose material information if the absence of such information could lead a reasonable consumer to believe any of the material misrepresentations set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section or could otherwise result in a reasonable consumer being unable to understand the extent or manner of deposit insurance provided. Examples of such material information include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) A statement made by a person other than an insured depository institution that represents or implies that an advertised product is insured by the FDIC that fails to clearly and conspicuously identify the insured depository institution(s) with which the representing party has a direct or indirect business relationship for the placement of deposits and into which the consumer's deposits may be placed;
(ii) A statement made by a person that is not an insured depository institution regarding deposit insurance that fails to clearly and conspicuously disclose that the person is not an FDIC-insured depository institution and that FDIC insurance only covers the failure of the FDIC-insured depository institution. A statement that a person is not an FDIC-insured bank and deposit insurance covers the failure of an insured bank would be considered a clear statement for purposes of this provision.
(iii) A statement made by a person regarding deposit insurance in a context where deposits and Non-Deposit products are both offered on a website in close proximity, that fails to clearly and conspicuously differentiate between insured deposits and Non-Deposit Products by disclosing that Non-Deposit Products: are not insured by the FDIC; are not deposits; and may lose value, except that:

(B) In the case of a Non-Deposit Product that is a product that allows consumers to store, send, or receive fiat money and does not fluctuate in value, failure to disclose that the Non-Deposit Product may lose value will not be a material omission for purposes of clause (b)(5)(iii) of this section.
(iv) A statement made by a person regarding pass-through deposit insurance coverage that fails to clearly and conspicuously disclose that certain conditions must be satisfied for pass-through deposit insurance coverage to apply.
(6) Without limitation, a representation is deemed to have been knowingly made if the person making the representation:

Federal Trade Commission, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, the U.S. Department of Justice, or a state bank supervisor, that such representations are false or misleading; and
(iii) Thereafter, continues to make these, or substantially-similar, representations.

held by the FDIC-supervised institution upon the unwind of any secured funding transaction (other than a collateralized deposit), secured lending transaction, asset exchange, or collateralized derivatives transaction that matures within 30 calendar days of the calculation date where the FDIC-supervised institution will provide an asset that is eligible HQLA and the counterparty will provide an asset that will be eligible HQLA.
(g)
Calculation of the adjusted excess HQLA amount.
As of the calculation date, the adjusted excess HQLA amount equals:
(1) The adjusted level 2 cap excess amount;
plus
(2) The adjusted level 2B cap excess amount.
(h)
Calculation of the adjusted level 2 cap excess amount.
As of the calculation date, the adjusted level 2 cap excess amount equals the greater of:
(1) The adjusted level 2A liquid asset amount plus the adjusted level 2B liquid asset amount minus 0.6667 times the adjusted level 1 liquid asset amount; and
(2) 0.
(i)
Calculation of the adjusted level 2B excess amount.
As of the calculation date, the adjusted level 2B excess liquid asset amount equals the greater of:
(1) The adjusted level 2B liquid asset amount minus the adjusted level 2 cap excess amount minus 0.1765 times the sum of the adjusted level 1 liquid asset amount and the adjusted level 2A liquid asset amount; and
(2) 0.

§ 329.31
Determining maturity.
(a) For purposes of calculating its liquidity coverage ratio and the components thereof under this subpart, an FDIC-supervised institution shall assume an asset or transaction matures:
(1) With respect to an instrument or transaction subject to § 329.32, on the earliest possible contractual maturity date or the earliest possible date the transaction could occur, taking into account any option that could accelerate the maturity date or the date of the transaction, except that when considering the earliest possible contractual maturity date or the earliest possible date the transaction could occur, the FDIC-supervised institution should exclude any contingent options that are triggered only by regulatory actions or changes in law or regulation, as follows:
(i) If an investor or funds provider has an option that would reduce the maturity, the FDIC-supervised institution must assume that the investor or funds provider will exercise the option at the earliest possible date;
(ii) If an investor or funds provider has an option that would extend the maturity, the FDIC-supervised institution must assume that the investor or funds provider will not exercise the option to extend the maturity;

(4) With respect to a transaction that has an open maturity, is not an operational deposit, and is subject to the provisions of § 329.32(h)(2), (h)(5), (j), or (k) or § 329.33(d) or (f), the maturity date is the first calendar day after the calculation date. Any other transaction that has an open maturity and is subject to the provisions of § 329.32 shall be considered to mature within 30 calendar days of the calculation date.
(5) With respect to a transaction subject to the provisions of § 329.33(g), on the date of the next scheduled calculation of the amount required under applicable legal requirements for the protection of customer assets with respect to each broker-dealer segregated account, in accordance with the FDIC-supervised institution's normal frequency of recalculating such requirements.

(ii) For purposes of paragraph (5)(i) of this section, the gross derivative value of a derivative transaction not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement or of a QMNA netting set is equal to the value to the FDIC-supervised institution, calculated as if no variation margin had been exchanged and no settlement payments had been made based on changes in the value of the derivative transaction or QMNA netting set.
(6)
Contributions to central counterparty mutualized loss sharing arrangements.
The fair value of an FDIC-supervised institution's contribution to a central counterparty's mutualized loss sharing arrangement (regardless of whether the contribution is included on the FDIC-supervised institution's balance sheet), multiplied by an RSF factor of 85 percent; and

(2) An FDIC-supervised institution that is no longer subject to the minimum stable funding requirement of this part pursuant to § 329.1(b)(1)(i) based on the size of total consolidated assets, cross-jurisdictional activity, total nonbank assets, weighted short-term wholesale funding, or off-balance sheet exposure calculated in accordance with the Call Report, or instructions to the FR Y-9LP, the FR Y-15, or equivalent reporting form, as applicable, for each of the four most recent calendar quarters may cease compliance with the requirements of subparts K through M of this part as of the first day of the first calendar quarter after it is no longer subject to § 329.1(b).
(c)
Reservation of authority.
The FDIC may extend or accelerate any compliance date of this part if the FDIC determines such extension or acceleration is appropriate. In determining whether an extension or acceleration is appropriate, the FDIC will consider the effect of the modification on financial stability, the period of time for which the modification would be necessary to facilitate compliance with the requirements of subparts K through M of this part, and the actions the FDIC-supervised institution is taking to come into compliance with the requirements of subparts K through M of this part.

§ 330.2
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to clarify the rules and define the terms necessary to afford deposit insurance coverage under the Act and provide rules for the recognition of deposit ownership in various circumstances.
§ 330.3
General principles.
(a)
Ownership rights and capacities.
The insurance coverage provided by the Act and this part is based upon the ownership rights and capacities in which deposit accounts are maintained at insured depository institutions. All deposits in an insured depository institution which are maintained in the same right and capacity (by or for the benefit of a particular depositor or depositors) shall be added together and insured in accordance with this part. Deposits maintained in different rights and capacities, as recognized under this part, shall be insured separately from each other. (Example: Single ownership accounts and joint ownership accounts are insured separately from each other.)
(b)
Deposits maintained in separate insured depository institutions or in separate branches of the same insured depository institution.
Any deposit accounts maintained by a depositor at one insured depository institution are insured separately from, and without regard to, any deposit accounts that the same depositor maintains at any other separately chartered and insured depository institution, even if two or more separately chartered and insured depository institutions are affiliated through common ownership. (Example: Deposits held by the same individual at
two different banks owned by the same bank holding company would be insured separately, per bank.)
The deposit accounts of a depositor maintained in the same right and capacity at different branches or offices of the same insured depository institution are not separately insured; rather they shall be added together and insured in accordance with this part.
(c)
Deposits maintained by foreigners and deposits denominated in foreign currency.
The availability of deposit insurance is not limited to citizens and residents of the United States. Any person or entity that maintains deposits in an insured depository institution is entitled to the deposit insurance provided by the Act and this part. In addition, deposits denominated in a foreign currency shall be insured in accordance with this part. Deposit insurance for such deposits shall be determined and paid in the amount of United States dollars that is equivalent in value to the amount of the deposit denominated in the foreign currency as of close of business on the date of default of the insured depository institution. The exchange rates to be used for such conversions are the 12 PM rates (the “noon buying rates for cable transfers”) quoted for major currencies by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the date of default of the insured depository institution, unless the deposit agreement specifies that some other widely recognized exchange rates are to be used for all purposes under that agreement, in which case, the rates so specified shall be used for such conversions.
(d)
Deposits in insured branches of foreign banks.
Deposits in an insured branch of a foreign bank which are payable by contract in the United States shall be insured in accordance with this part, except that any deposits to the credit of the foreign bank, or any office, branch, agency or any wholly owned subsidiary of the foreign bank, shall not be insured. All deposits held by a depositor in the same right and capacity in more than one insured branch of the same foreign bank shall be added together for the purpose of determining the amount of deposit insurance.
(e)
Deposits payable outside of the United States and certain other locations.
(1) Any obligation of an insured depository institution which is payable solely at an office of that institution located outside any State, as the term “State” is defined in section 3(a)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(a)(3)), is not a deposit for the purposes of this part.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, any obligation of an insured depository institution which is carried on the books and records of an office of that institution located outside any State, as referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, shall not be an insured deposit for purposes of this part, or any other provision of this part, notwithstanding that the obligation may also be payable at an office of that institution located within any State.
(3)
Rule of construction.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the following are not considered to be offices located outside any State, as referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section:
(i) Overseas Military Banking Facilities operated under U.S. Department of Defense regulations, 32 CFR parts 230 and 231; and
(ii) Legacy branches of U.S. insured depository institutions in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or the Republic of Palau, which for purposes of this paragraph means the number of branches operated by each U.S. insured depository institution as of August 9, 2024.
(f)
International banking facility deposits.
An “international banking facility time deposit,” as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Regulation D (12 CFR 204.8(a)(2)), or in any successor regulation, is not a deposit for the purposes of this part.
(g)
Bank investment contracts.
As required by section 11(a)(8) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(a)(8)), any liability arising under any investment contract between any insured depository institution and any employee benefit plan which expressly permits “benefit responsive withdrawals or transfers” (as defined in section 11(a)(8) of the Act) are not insured deposits for purposes of
this part. The term “substantial penalty or adjustment” used in section 11(a)(8) of the Act means, in the case of a deposit having an original term which exceeds one year, all interest earned on the amount withdrawn from the date of deposit or for six months, whichever is less; or, in the case of a deposit having an original term of one year or less, all interest earned on the amount withdrawn from the date of deposit or three months, whichever is less.
(h)
Application of state or local law to deposit insurance determinations.
In general, deposit insurance is for the benefit of the owner or owners of funds on deposit. However, while ownership under state law of deposited funds is a necessary condition for deposit insurance, ownership under state law is not sufficient for, or decisive in, determining deposit insurance coverage. Deposit insurance coverage is also a function of the deposit account records of the insured depository institution and of the provisions of this part, which, in the interest of uniform national rules for deposit insurance coverage, are controlling for purposes of determining deposit insurance coverage.
(i)
Determination of the amount of a deposit
—(1)
General rule.
The amount of a deposit is the balance of principal and interest unconditionally credited to the deposit account as of the date of default of the insured depository institution, plus the ascertainable amount of interest to that date, accrued at the contract rate (or the anticipated or announced interest or dividend rate), which the insured depository institution in default would have paid if the deposit had matured on that date and the insured depository institution had not failed. In the absence of any such announced or anticipated interest or dividend rate, the rate for this purpose shall be whatever rate was paid in the immediately preceding payment period.
(2)
Discounted certificates of deposit.
The amount of a certificate of deposit sold by an insured depository institution at a discount from its face value is its original purchase price plus the amount of accrued earnings calculated by compounding interest annually at the rate necessary to increase the original purchase price to the maturity value over the life of the certificate.
(3)
Waiver of minimum requirements.
In the case of a deposit with a fixed payment date, fixed or minimum term, or a qualifying or notice period that has not expired as of such date, interest thereon to the date of closing shall be computed according to the terms of the deposit contract as if interest had been credited and as if the deposit could have been withdrawn on such date without any penalty or reduction in the rate of earnings.
(j)
Continuation of insurance coverage following the death of a deposit owner.
The death of a deposit owner shall not affect the insurance coverage of the deposit for a period of six months following the owner's death unless the deposit account is restructured. The operation of this grace period, however, shall not result in a reduction of coverage. If an account is not restructured within six months after the owner's death, the insurance shall be provided on the basis of actual ownership in accordance with the provisions of § 330.5(a)(1).
[63 FR 25756, May 11, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 15656, Apr. 1, 1999; 78 FR 56589, Sept. 13, 2013; 89 FR 65170, Aug. 9, 2024]
§ 330.4
Continuation of separate deposit insurance after merger of insured depository institutions.
Whenever the liabilities of one or more insured depository institutions for deposits are assumed by another insured depository institution, whether by merger, consolidation, other statutory assumption or contract:
(a) The insured status of the institutions whose liabilities have been assumed terminates on the date of receipt by the FDIC of satisfactory evidence of the assumption; and
(b) The separate insurance of deposits assumed continues for six months from the date the assumption takes effect or, in the case of a time deposit, the earliest maturity date after the six-month period. In the case of time deposits which mature within six months of the date the deposits are assumed and which are renewed at the same dollar amount (either with or without accrued interest having been added to the principal amount) and for the same
term as the original deposit, the separate insurance applies to the renewed deposits until the first maturity date after the six-month period. Time deposits that mature within six months of the deposit assumption and that are renewed on any other basis, or that are not renewed and thereby become demand deposits, are separately insured only until the end of the six-month period.
§ 330.5
Recognition of deposit ownership and fiduciary relationships.
(a)
Recognition of deposit ownership
—(1)
Evidence of deposit ownership.
Except as indicated in this paragraph (a)(1) or as provided in § 330.3(j), in determining the amount of insurance available to each depositor, the FDIC shall presume that deposited funds are actually owned in the manner indicated on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution. If the FDIC, in its sole discretion, determines that the deposit account records of the insured depository institution are clear and unambiguous, those records shall be considered binding on the depositor, and the FDIC shall consider no other records on the manner in which the funds are owned. If the deposit account records are ambiguous or unclear on the manner in which the funds are owned, then the FDIC may, in its sole discretion, consider evidence other than the deposit account records of the insured depository institution for the purpose of establishing the manner in which the funds are owned. Despite the general requirements of this paragraph (a)(1), if the FDIC has reason to believe that the insured depository institution's deposit account records misrepresent the actual ownership of deposited funds and such misrepresentation would increase deposit insurance coverage, the FDIC may consider all available evidence and pay claims for insured deposits on the basis of the actual rather than the misrepresented ownership.
(2)
Recognition of deposit ownership in custodial accounts.
In the case of custodial deposits, the interest of each beneficial owner may be determined on a fractional or percentage basis. This may be accomplished in any manner which indicates that where the funds of an owner are commingled with other funds held in a custodial capacity and a portion thereof is placed on deposit in one or more insured depository institutions without allocation, the owner's insured interest in the deposit in any one insured depository institution would represent, at any given time, the same fractional share as his or her share of the total commingled funds.
(b)
Fiduciary relationships
—(1)
Recognition.
The FDIC will recognize a claim for insurance coverage based on a fiduciary relationship only if the relationship is expressly disclosed, by way of specific references, in the “deposit account records” (as defined in § 330.1(e)) of the insured depository institution. Such relationships include, but are not limited to, relationships involving a trustee, agent, nominee, guardian, executor or custodian pursuant to which funds are deposited. The express indication that the account is held in a fiduciary capacity will not be necessary, however, in instances where the FDIC determines, in its sole discretion, that the titling of the deposit account and the underlying deposit account records sufficiently indicate the existence of a fiduciary relationship. This exception may apply, for example, where the deposit account title or records indicate that the account is held by an escrow agent, title company or a company whose business is to hold deposits and securities for others.
(2)
Details of fiduciary relationships.
If the deposit account records of an insured depository institution disclose the existence of a relationship which might provide a basis for additional insurance (including the exception provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), the details of the relationship and the interests of other parties in the account must be ascertainable either from the deposit account records of the insured depository institution or from records maintained, in good faith and in the regular course of business, by the depositor or by some person or entity that has undertaken to maintain such records for the depositor.
(3)
Multi-tiered fiduciary relationships.
In deposit accounts where there are multiple levels of fiduciary relationships, there are two methods of satisfying paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this
section to obtain insurance coverage for the interests of the true beneficial owners of a deposit account.
(i) One method is to:
(A) Expressly indicate, on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, the existence of each and every level of fiduciary relationships; and
(B) Disclose, at each level, the name(s) and interest(s) of the person(s) on whose behalf the party at that level is acting.
(ii) An alternative method is to:
(A) Expressly indicate, on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, that there are multiple levels of fiduciary relationships;
(B) Disclose the existence of additional levels of fiduciary relationships in records, maintained in good faith and in the regular course of business, by parties at subsequent levels; and
(C) Disclose, at each of the levels, the name(s) and interest(s) of the person(s) on whose behalf the party at that level is acting. No person or entity in the chain of parties will be permitted to claim that they are acting in a fiduciary capacity for others unless the possible existence of such a relationship is revealed at some previous level in the chain.
(4)
Exceptions
—(i)
Deposits evidenced by negotiable instruments.
If any deposit obligation of an insured depository institution is evidenced by a negotiable certificate of deposit, negotiable draft, negotiable cashier's or officer's check, negotiable certified check, negotiable traveler's check, letter of credit or other negotiable instrument, the FDIC will recognize the owner of such deposit obligation for all purposes of claim for insured deposits to the same extent as if his or her name and interest were disclosed on the records of the insured depository institution; provided, that the instrument was in fact negotiated to such owner prior to the date of default of the insured depository institution. The owner must provide affirmative proof of such negotiation, in a form satisfactory to the FDIC, to substantiate his or her claim. Receipt of a negotiable instrument directly from the insured depository institution in default shall, in no event, be considered a negotiation of said instrument for purposes of this provision.
(ii)
Deposit obligations for payment of items forwarded for collection by depository institution acting as agent.
Where an insured depository institution in default has become obligated for the payment of items forwarded for collection by a depository institution acting solely as agent, the FDIC will recognize the holders of such items for all purposes of claim for insured deposits to the same extent as if their name(s) and interest(s) were disclosed as depositors on the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, when such claim for insured deposits, if otherwise payable, has been established by the execution and delivery of prescribed forms. The FDIC will recognize such depository institution forwarding such items for the holders thereof as agent for such holders for the purpose of making an assignment to the FDIC of their rights against the insured depository institution in default and for the purpose of receiving payment on their behalf.
[63 FR 25756, May 11, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 15656, Apr. 1, 1999]
§ 330.6
Single ownership accounts.
(a)
Individual accounts.
Funds owned by a natural person and deposited in one or more deposit accounts in his or her own name shall be added together and insured up to the SMDIA in the aggregate. Exception: Despite the general requirement in this paragraph (a), if more than one natural person has the right to withdraw funds from an individual account (excluding persons who have the right to withdraw by virtue of a Power of Attorney), the account shall be treated as a joint ownership account (although not necessarily a qualifying joint account) and shall be insured in accordance with the provisions of § 330.9, unless the deposit account records clearly indicate, to the satisfaction of the FDIC, that the funds are owned by one individual and that other signatories on the account are merely authorized to withdraw funds on behalf of the owner.
(b)
Sole proprietorship accounts.
Funds owned by a business which is a “sole proprietorship” (as defined in § 330.1(n)) and deposited in one or more deposit
accounts in the name of the business shall be treated as the individual account(s) of the person who is the sole proprietor, added to any other individual accounts of that person, and insured up to the SMDIA in the aggregate.
(c)
Single-name accounts containing community property funds.
Community property funds deposited into one or more deposit accounts in the name of one member of a husband-wife community shall be treated as the individual account(s) of the named member, added to any other individual accounts of that person, and insured up to the SMDIA in the aggregate.
(d)
Accounts of a decedent and accounts held by executors or administrators of a decedent's estate.
Funds held in the name of a decedent or in the name of the executor, administrator, or other personal representative of his or her estate and deposited into one or more deposit accounts shall be added together and insured up to the SMDIA in the aggregate; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph (d) shall affect the operation of § 330.3(j). The deposit insurance provided by this paragraph (d) shall be separate from any insurance coverage provided for the individual deposit accounts of the executor, administrator, other personal representative or the beneficiaries of the estate.
[63 FR 25756, May 11, 1998, as amended at 71 FR 14631, Mar. 23, 2006; 76 FR 41395, July 14, 2011]
§ 330.7
Accounts held by an agent, nominee, guardian, custodian or conservator.
(a)
Agency or nominee accounts.
Funds owned by a principal or principals and deposited into one or more deposit accounts in the name of an agent, custodian or nominee, shall be insured to the same extent as if deposited in the name of the principal(s). When such funds are deposited by an insured depository institution acting as a trustee of an irrevocable trust, the insurance coverage shall be governed by the provisions of § 330.13.
(b)
Guardian, custodian or conservator accounts.
Funds held by a guardian, custodian, or conservator for the benefit of his or her ward, or for the benefit of a minor under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, and deposited into one or more accounts in the name of the guardian, custodian or conservator shall, for purposes of this part, be deemed to be agency or nominee accounts and shall be insured in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Accounts held by fiduciaries on behalf of two or more persons.
Funds held by an agent, nominee, guardian, custodian, conservator or loan servicer, on behalf of two or more persons jointly, shall be treated as a joint ownership account and shall be insured in accordance with the provisions of § 330.9.
(d)
Mortgage servicing accounts.
Accounts maintained by a mortgage servicer, in a custodial or other fiduciary capacity, which are comprised of payments of principal and interest, shall be insured for the cumulative balance paid into the account by mortgagors, or in order to satisfy mortgagors' principal or interest obligations to the lender, up to the limit of the SMDIA per mortgagor. Accounts maintained by a mortgage servicer, in a custodial or other fiduciary capacity, which are comprised of payments by mortgagors of taxes and insurance premiums shall be added together and insured in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section for the ownership interest of each mortgagor in such accounts.
(e)
Custodian accounts for American Indians.
Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any interest an individual American Indian may have in funds deposited by the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the United States Department of the Interior (the “BIA”) on behalf of that person pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 162(a), or by any other disbursing agent of the United States on behalf of that person pursuant to similar authority, in an insured depository institution. The interest of each American Indian in all such accounts maintained at the same insured depository institution shall be added together and insured, up to the SMDIA, separately from any other accounts maintained by that person in the same insured depository institution.
[63 FR 25756, May 11, 1998, as amended at 71 FR 14631, Mar. 23, 2006; 73 FR 61660, Oct. 17, 2008; 74 FR 47716, Sept. 17, 2009; ; 87 FR 4470, Jan. 28, 2022]
§ 330.8
Annuity contract accounts.
(a) Funds held by an insurance company or other corporation in a deposit account for the sole purpose of funding life insurance or annuity contracts and any benefits incidental to such contracts, shall be insured separately in the amount of up to the SMDIA per annuitant, provided that, pursuant to a state statute:
(1) The corporation establishes a separate account for such funds;
(2) The account cannot be charged with the liabilities arising out of any other business of the corporation; and
(3) The account cannot be invaded by other creditors of the corporation in the event that the corporation becomes insolvent and its assets are liquidated.
(b) Such insurance coverage shall be separate from the insurance provided for any other accounts maintained by the corporation or the annuitants at the same insured depository institution.
[63 FR 25756, May 11, 1998, as amended at 71 FR 14631, Mar. 23, 2006]
§ 330.9
Joint ownership accounts.
(a)
Separate insurance coverage.
Qualifying joint accounts, whether owned as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, as tenants in common or as tenants by the entirety, shall be insured separately from any individually owned (single ownership) deposit accounts maintained by the co-owners. (Example: If A has a single ownership account and also is a joint owner of a qualifying joint account, A's interest in the joint account would be insured separately from his or her interest in the individual account.) Qualifying joint accounts in the names of both husband and wife which are comprised of community property funds shall be added together and insured up to twice the SMDIA, separately from any funds deposited into accounts bearing their individual names.
(b)
Determination of insurance coverage.
The interests of each co-owner in all qualifying joint accounts shall be added together and the total shall be insured up to the SMDIA. (Example: “A
B” have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $150,000; “A
C” have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $200,000; and “A
B
C” have a qualifying joint account with a balance of $375,000. A's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $300,000 ($75,000 plus $100,000 plus $125,000); therefore, A's interest would be insured in the amount of $250,000 and uninsured in the amount of $50,000. B's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $200,000 ($75,000 plus $125,000); therefore, B's interest would be fully insured. C's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $225,000 ($100,000 plus $125,000); therefore, C's interest would be fully insured.
(c)
Qualifying joint accounts
—(1)
Qualification requirements.
A joint deposit account shall be deemed to be a qualifying joint account, for purposes of this section, only if:
(i) All co-owners of the funds in the account are “natural persons” (as defined in § 330.1(l));
(ii) Each co-owner has personally signed, which may include signing electronically, a deposit account signature card, or the alternative method provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section is satisfied; and
(iii) Each co-owner possesses withdrawal rights on the same basis.
(2)
Limited exceptions.
The signature-card requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section shall not apply to certificates of deposit, to any deposit obligation evidenced by a negotiable instrument, or to any account maintained by an agent, nominee, guardian, custodian or conservator on behalf of two or more persons.
(3)
Evidence of deposit ownership.
All deposit accounts that satisfy the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and those accounts that come within the exception provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, shall be deemed to be jointly owned provided that, in accordance with the provisions of § 330.5(a), the FDIC determines that the deposit account records of the insured depository institution are clear and unambiguous as to the ownership of the accounts. If the deposit account records are ambiguous or unclear as to the manner in which the deposit accounts are owned, then the FDIC may, in its sole discretion, consider evidence
other than the deposit account records of the insured depository institution for the purpose of establishing the manner in which the funds are owned. The signatures of two or more persons on the deposit account signature card or the names of two or more persons on a certificate of deposit or other deposit instrument shall be conclusive evidence that the account is a joint account (although not necessarily a qualifying joint account) unless the deposit records as a whole are ambiguous and some other evidence indicates, to the satisfaction of the FDIC, that there is a contrary ownership capacity.
(4)
Alternative method to satisfy signature-card requirement.
The signature-card requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section also may be satisfied by information contained in the deposit account records of the insured depository institution establishing co-ownership of the deposit account, such as evidence that the institution has issued a mechanism for accessing the account to each co-owner or evidence of usage of the deposit account by each co-owner.
(d)
Nonqualifying joint accounts.
A deposit account held in two or more names which is not a qualifying joint account, for purposes of this section, shall be treated as being owned by each named owner, as an individual, corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association, as the case may be, and the actual ownership interest of each individual or entity in such account shall be added to any other single ownership accounts of such individual or other accounts of such entity, and shall be insured in accordance with the provisions of this part governing the insurance of such accounts.
(e)
Determination of interests.
The interests of the co-owners of qualifying joint accounts, held as tenants in common, shall be deemed equal, unless otherwise stated in the depository institution's deposit account records. This section applies regardless of whether the conjunction “and” or “or” is used in the title of a joint deposit account, even when both terms are used, such as in the case of a joint deposit account with three or more co-owners.

§ 330.10
Trust accounts.
(a)
Scope and definitions.
This section governs coverage for deposits held in connection with informal revocable trusts, formal revocable trusts, and irrevocable trusts not covered by § 330.12 (“trust accounts”). For purposes of this section:
(1)
Informal revocable trust
means a trust under which a deposit passes directly to one or more beneficiaries upon the depositor's death without a written trust agreement, commonly referred to as a payable-on-death account, in-trust-for account, or Totten trust account.
(2)
Formal revocable trust
means a revocable trust established by a written trust agreement under which a deposit passes to one or more beneficiaries upon the grantor's death.
(3)
Irrevocable trust
means an irrevocable trust established by statute or a written trust agreement, except as described in paragraph (f) of this section.
(b)
Calculation of coverage
—(1)
General calculation.
Trust deposits are insured in an amount up to the SMDIA multiplied by the total number of beneficiaries identified by each grantor, up to a maximum of 5 beneficiaries.
(2)
Aggregation for purposes of insurance limit.
Trust deposits that pass from the same grantor to beneficiaries are aggregated for purposes of determining coverage under this section, regardless of whether those deposits are held in connection with an informal revocable trust, formal revocable trust, or irrevocable trust.
(3)
Separate insurance coverage.
The deposit insurance coverage provided under this section is separate from coverage provided for other deposits at the same insured depository institution.
(4)
Equal allocation presumed.
Unless otherwise specified in the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, a deposit held in connection with a trust established by multiple grantors is presumed to have been
owned or funded by the grantors in equal shares.
(c)
Number of beneficiaries.
The total number of beneficiaries for a trust deposit under paragraph (b) of this section will be determined as follows:
(1)
Eligible beneficiaries.
Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, beneficiaries include natural persons, as well as charitable organizations and other non-profit entities recognized as such under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
(2)
Ineligible beneficiaries.
Beneficiaries do not include:
(i) The grantor of a trust; or
(ii) A person or entity that would only obtain an interest in the deposit if one or more identified beneficiaries are deceased.
(3)
Future trust(s) named as beneficiaries.
If a trust agreement provides that trust funds will pass into one or more new trusts upon the death of the grantor(s) (“future trusts”), the future trust(s) are not treated as beneficiaries of the trust; rather, the future trust(s) are viewed as mechanisms for distributing trust funds, and the beneficiaries are the natural persons or organizations that shall receive the trust funds through the future trusts.
(4)
Informal trust account payable to depositor's formal trust.
If an informal revocable trust designates the depositor's formal trust as its beneficiary, the informal revocable trust account will be treated as if titled in the name of the formal trust.
(d)
Deposit account records
—(1)
Informal revocable trusts.
The beneficiaries of an informal revocable trust must be specifically named in the deposit account records of the insured depository institution.
(2)
Formal revocable trusts.
The title of a formal trust account must include terminology sufficient to identify the account as a trust account, such as “family trust” or “living trust,” or must otherwise be identified as a testamentary trust in the account records of the insured depository institution. If eligible beneficiaries of such formal revocable trust are specifically named in the deposit account records of the insured depository institution, the FDIC shall presume the continued validity of the named beneficiary's interest in the trust consistent with § 330.5(a).
(e)
Commingled deposits of bankruptcy trustees.
If a bankruptcy trustee appointed under title 11 of the United States Code commingles the funds of various bankruptcy estates in the same account at an insured depository institution, the funds of each title 11 bankruptcy estate will be added together and insured up to the SMDIA, separately from the funds of any other such estate.
(f)
Deposits excluded from coverage under this section
—(1)
Revocable trust co-owners that are sole beneficiaries of a trust.
If the co-owners of an informal or formal revocable trust are the trust's sole beneficiaries, deposits held in connection with the trust are treated as joint ownership deposits under § 330.9.
(2)
Employee benefit plan deposits.
Deposits of employee benefit plans, even if held in connection with a trust, are treated as employee benefit plan deposits under § 330.14.
(3)
Investment company deposits.
This section shall not apply to deposits of trust funds belonging to a trust classified as a corporation under § 330.11(a)(2).
(4)
Insured depository institution as trustee of an irrevocable trust.
Deposits held by an insured depository institution in its capacity as trustee of an irrevocable trust are insured as provided in § 330.12.
[87 FR 4470, Jan. 28, 2022]
§ 330.11
Accounts of a corporation, partnership or unincorporated association.
(a)
Corporate accounts.
(1) The deposit accounts of a corporation engaged in any “independent activity” (as defined in § 330.1(g)) shall be added together and insured up to the SMDIA in the aggregate. If a corporation has divisions or units which are not separately incorporated, the deposit accounts of those divisions or units shall be added to any other deposit accounts of the corporation. If a corporation maintains deposit accounts in a representative or fiduciary capacity, such accounts shall not be treated as the deposit accounts of the corporation but shall be treated as fiduciary accounts and insured in accordance with the provisions of § 330.7.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, any trust or other business arrangement which has filed or is required to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to section 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-8) or that would be required so to register but for the fact it is not created under the laws of the United States or a state or but for sections 2(b), 3(c)(1), or 6(a)(1) of that act shall be deemed to be a corporation for purposes of determining deposit insurance coverage. An exception to this paragraph (a)(2) shall exist for any trust or other business arrangement established by a state or that is a state agency or state public instrumentality as part of a qualified tuition savings program under section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 529). A deposit account of such a trust or business arrangement shall not be deemed to be the deposit of a corporation provided that: The funds in the account may be traced to one or more particular investors or participants; and the existence of the trust relationships is disclosed in accordance with the requirements of § 330.5. If these conditions are satisfied, each participant's funds shall be insured as a deposit account of the participant.
(b)
Partnership accounts.
The deposit accounts of a partnership engaged in any “independent activity” (as defined in § 330.1(g)) shall be added together and insured up to the SMDIA in the aggregate. Such insurance coverage shall be separate from any insurance provided for individually owned (single ownership) accounts maintained by the individual partners. A partnership shall be deemed to exist, for purposes of this paragraph, any time there is an association of two or more persons or entities formed to carry on, as co-owners, an unincorporated business for profit.
(c)
Unincorporated association accounts.
The deposit accounts of an unincorporated association engaged in any independent activity shall be added together and insured up to the SMDIA in the aggregate, separately from the accounts of the person(s) or entity(ies) comprising the unincorporated association. An unincorporated association shall be deemed to exist, for purposes of this paragraph, whenever there is an association of two or more persons formed for some religious, educational, charitable, social or other noncommercial purpose.
(d)
Non-qualifying entities.
The deposit accounts of an entity which is not engaged in an “independent activity” (as defined in § 330.1(g)) shall be deemed to be owned by the person or persons owning the corporation or comprising the partnership or unincorporated association, and, for deposit insurance purposes, the interest of each person in such a deposit account shall be added to any other deposit accounts individually owned by that person and insured up to the SMDIA in the aggregate.
[63 FR 25756, May 11, 1998, as amended at 70 FR 33692, June 9, 2005; 70 FR 62059, Oct. 28, 2005; 71 FR 14631, Mar. 23, 2006]
§ 330.12
Accounts held by a depository institution as the trustee of an irrevocable trust.
(a)
Separate insurance coverage.
“Trust funds” (as defined in § 330.1(q)) held by an insured depository institution in its capacity as trustee of an irrevocable trust, whether held in its trust department, held or deposited in any other department of the fiduciary institution, or deposited by the fiduciary institution in another insured depository institution, shall be insured up to the SMDIA for each owner or beneficiary represented. This insurance shall be separate from, and in addition to, the insurance provided for any other deposits of the owners or the beneficiaries.
(b)
Determination of interests.
The insurance for funds held by an insured depository institution in its capacity as trustee of an irrevocable trust shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Allocated funds of a trust estate.
If trust funds of a particular “trust estate” (as defined in § 330.1(p)) are allocated by the fiduciary and deposited, the insurance with respect to such trust estate shall be determined by ascertaining the amount of its funds allocated, deposited and remaining to the credit of the claimant as fiduciary at the insured depository institution in default.
(2)
Interest of a trust estate in unallocated trust funds.
If funds of a particular trust estate are commingled with funds of other trust estates and deposited by the fiduciary institution in one or more insured depository institutions to the credit of the depository institution as fiduciary, without allocation of specific amounts from a particular trust estate to an account in such institution(s), the percentage interest of that trust estate in the unallocated deposits in any institution in default is the same as that trust estate's percentage interest in the entire commingled investment pool.
(c)
Limitation on applicability.
This section shall not apply to deposits of trust funds belonging to a trust which is classified as a corporation under § 330.11(a)(2).
[63 FR 25756, May 11, 1998, as amended at 71 FR 14631, Mar. 23, 2006; 76 FR 41395, July 14, 2011]

Deposits eligible for coverage under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that also are deposits of a employee benefit plan or deposits of an deferred compensation plan described in section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 457) in an insured depository institution shall be insured on a “pass-through” basis in the amount of $250,000 for the non-contingent interest of each plan participant, provided the rules in § 330.5 are satisfied.

(2) Certain retirement accounts. Deposits in an insured depository institution made in connection with the following types of retirement plans shall be aggregated and insured in the amount of up to $250,000 per participant:

(c)
Determination of interests
—(1)
Defined contribution plans.
The value of an employee's non-contingent interest in a defined contribution plan shall be deemed to be the employee's account balance as of the date of default of the insured depository institution, regardless of whether said amount was derived, in whole or in part, from contributions of the employee and/or the employer to the account.
(2)
Defined benefit plans.
The value of an employee's non-contingent interest in a defined benefit plan shall be deemed to be the present value of the employee's interest in the plan, evaluated in accordance with the method of calculation ordinarily used under such plan, as of the date of default of the insured depository institution.
(3)
Amounts taken into account.
For the purposes of applying the rule under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, only the present vested and ascertainable
interests of each participant in an employee benefit plan or “457 Plan,” excluding any remainder interest created by, or as a result of, the plan, shall be taken into account in determining the amount of deposit insurance accorded to the deposits of the plan.
(d)
Treatment of contingent interests.
In the event that employees' interests in an employee benefit plan are not capable of evaluation in accordance with the provisions of this section, or an account established for any such plan includes amounts for future participants in the plan, payment by the FDIC with respect to all such interests shall not exceed the SMDIA in the aggregate.
(e)
Overfunded pension plan deposits.
Any portion of an employee benefit plan's deposits which is not attributable to the interests of the beneficiaries under the plan shall be deemed attributable to the overfunded portion of the plan's assets and shall be aggregated and insured up to the SMDIA, separately from any other deposits.

§ 331.1
Authority, purpose, and scope.
(a)
Authority.
The regulations in this part are issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under sections 9(a)(Tenth) and 10(g) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), 12 U.S.C. 1819(a)(Tenth), 1820(g), to implement sections 24(j) and 27 of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831a(j), 1831d, and related provisions of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, Public Law 96-221, 94 Stat. 132 (1980).
(b)
Purpose.
Section 24(j) of the FDI Act, as amended by the Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997, Public Law 105-24, 111 Stat. 238 (1997), was enacted to maintain parity between State banks and national banks regarding the application of a host State's laws to branches of out-of-State banks. Section 27 of the FDI Act was enacted to provide State banks with interest rate authority similar to that provided to national banks under the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 85. The regulations in this part clarify that State-chartered banks and insured branches of foreign banks have regulatory authority in these areas parallel to the authority of national banks under regulations issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and address
other issues the FDIC considers appropriate to implement these statutes.
(c)
Scope.
The regulations in this part apply to State-chartered banks and insured branches of foreign banks.
§ 331.2
Definitions.
For purposes of this part—
Home State
means, with respect to a State bank, the State by which the bank is chartered.
Host State
means a State, other than the home State of a State bank, in which the State bank maintains a branch.
Insured branch
has the same meaning as that term in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813.
Interest
means any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor for an extension of credit, making available a line of credit, or any default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended. Interest includes, among other things, the following fees connected with credit extension or availability: numerical periodic rates; late fees; creditor-imposed not sufficient funds (NSF) fees charged when a borrower tenders payment on a debt with a check drawn on insufficient funds; overlimit fees; annual fees; cash advance fees; and membership fees. It does not ordinarily include appraisal fees, premiums and commissions attributable to insurance guaranteeing repayment of any extension of credit, finders' fees, fees for document preparation or notarization, or fees incurred to obtain credit reports.
Out-of-State State bank
means, with respect to any State, a State bank whose home State is another State.
Rate on 90-day commercial paper
means the rate quoted by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for 90-day A2/P2 nonfinancial commercial paper.
State bank
has the same meaning as that term in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813.
§ 331.3
Application of host State law.
The laws of a host State shall apply to any branch in the host State of an out-of-State State bank to the same extent as such State laws apply to a branch in the host State of an out-of-State national bank. To the extent host State law is inapplicable to a branch of an out-of-State State bank in such host State pursuant to the preceding sentence, home State law shall apply to such branch.
§ 331.4
Interest rate authority.
(a)
Interest rates.
In order to prevent discrimination against State-chartered depository institutions, including insured savings banks, or insured branches of foreign banks, if the applicable rate prescribed in this section exceeds the rate such State bank or insured branch of a foreign bank would be permitted to charge in the absence of this paragraph (a), such State bank or insured branch of a foreign bank may, notwithstanding any State constitution or statute which is preempted by section 27 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831d, take, receive, reserve, and charge on any loan or discount made, or upon any note, bill of exchange, or other evidence of debt, interest at a rate of not more than 1 percent in excess of the rate on 90-day commercial paper or at the rate allowed by the laws of the State, territory, or district where the bank is located, whichever may be greater.
(b)
Classes of institutions and loans.
A State bank or insured branch of a foreign bank located in a State may charge interest at the maximum rate permitted to any State-chartered or licensed lending institution by the law of that State. If State law permits different interest charges on specified classes of loans, a State bank or insured branch of a foreign bank making such loans is subject only to the provisions of State law relating to that class of loans that are material to the determination of the permitted interest. For example, a State bank may lawfully charge the highest rate permitted to be charged by a State-licensed small loan company, without being so licensed, but subject to State law limitations on the size of loans made by small loan companies.
(c)
Effect on State law definitions of interest.
The definition of the term
interest
in this part does not change how interest is defined by the individual States or how the State definition of interest is used solely for purposes of State law. For example, if late fees are
not
interest
under the State law of the State where a State bank is located but State law permits its most favored lender to charge late fees, then a State bank located in that State may charge late fees to its intrastate customers. The State bank also may charge late fees to its interstate customers because the fees are interest under the Federal definition of interest and an allowable charge under the State law of the State where the bank is located. However, the late fees would not be treated as interest for purposes of evaluating compliance with State usury limitations because State law excludes late fees when calculating the maximum interest that lending institutions may charge under those limitations.
(d)
Corporate borrowers.
A State bank or insured branch of a foreign bank located in a State whose State law denies the defense of usury to a corporate borrower may charge a corporate borrower any rate of interest agreed upon by the corporate borrower.
(e)
Determination of interest permissible under section 27.
Whether interest on a loan is permissible under section 27 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act is determined as of the date the loan was made.

(2) Describes the conditions under which a financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties; and
(3) Provides a method for consumers to prevent a financial institution from disclosing that information to most nonaffiliated third parties by “opting out” of that disclosure, subject to the exceptions in §§ 332.13, 332.14, and 332.15.
(b)
Scope.

Financial institutions that provide insurance products or services, provide this option, and elect to use the model form may substitute the word “policy” for “account” in this statement. Institutions that do not provide this option may eliminate this left column from the mail-in form.
(2)
FCRA Section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) opt-out.

# Regulations
§ 333.1
Classification of general character of business.
State nonmember insured banks are divided into five categories for the purpose of classifying their general character or type of business,
2
viz: commercial banks, banks and trust companies, savings banks (including mutual and stock), industrial banks, and cash depositories.
2
A bank's business may include two or more of the general classifications.
[15 FR 8644, Dec. 6, 1950]
§ 333.2
Change in general character of business.
No State nonmember insured bank (except a District bank) or branch thereof shall hereafter cause or permit any change to be made in the general character or type of business exercised by it after the effective date of this part without the prior written consent of the Corporation.
[15 FR 8644, Dec. 6, 1950]
§ 333.3
Consent required for exercise of trust powers.
Except as provided in 12 CFR 303.242(a), a State nonmember bank or State savings association seeking to exercise trust powers must obtain prior written consent from the FDIC. Procedures for obtaining the FDIC's prior written consent are set forth in 12 CFR 303.242.
[83 FR 60337, Nov. 26, 2018]
§ 333.4
Conversions from mutual to stock form.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies to the conversion of insured mutual state savings banks to the stock form of ownership. It supplements the procedural and other requirements for such conversions in subpart I of part 303 of this chapter. This section also applies, to the extent appropriate, to the reorganization of insured mutual state savings banks to the mutual holding company form of ownership. As determined by the Board of Directors of the FDIC on a case-by-case basis, the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section do not apply to mutual-to-stock conversions of insured mutual state savings banks whose capital category under § 325.103 of this chapter or § 324.403, as applicable, is “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized”. As determined by the Board of Directors of the FDIC on a case-by-case basis, the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section do not apply to mutual-to-stock conversions of insured mutual state savings banks whose capital category
under § 324.403 of this chapter is “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized”.
(b)
Definition of Eligible Depositor.
For purposes of this section,
eligible depositors
are depositors holding qualifying deposits at the bank as of a date designated in the bank's plan of conversion that is not less than one year prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversion by the converting bank's board of directors/trustees.
(c)
Requirements.
In addition to other requirements that may be imposed by the applicable state statutes and regulations and other federal statutes and regulations, including subpart I of part 303 of this chapter, an insured mutual state savings bank shall not convert to the stock form of ownership unless the following requirements are satisfied:
(1) Eligible depositors shall have higher subscription rights than employee stock ownership plans;
(2) The proposed conversion shall be approved by a vote of at least a majority of the bank's depositors and, as reasonably determined by the bank's directors or trustees, other stakeholders of the bank who are entitled to vote on the conversion, unless the applicable state law requires a higher percentage, in which case the higher percentage shall be used. Voting may be in person or by proxy; and
(3) Management shall not use proxies executed outside the context of the proposed conversion to satisfy the voting requirement imposed in the previous paragraph.
(d)
Restriction on repurchase of stock.
An insured mutual state savings bank that has converted from the mutual to stock form of ownership may not repurchase its capital stock within one year following the date of its conversion to stock form, except that stock repurchases of no greater than 5% of the bank's outstanding capital stock may be repurchased during this one-year period where compelling and valid business reasons are established, to the satisfaction of the FDIC. Any stock repurchases shall be subject to the requirements of section 18(i)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(i)(1)).
(e)
Stock benefit plan limitations.
The FDIC will presume that a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan that does not conform with the applicable percentage limitations of the regulations issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision constitutes excessive insider benefits and thereby evidences a breach of the board of directors' or trustees' fiduciary responsibility. In addition, no converted insured mutual state savings bank shall, for one year from the date of the conversion, implement a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan, other than a tax-qualified employee stock ownership plan, unless each of the following requirements is met:
(1) Each of the plans was fully disclosed in the proxy solicitation and conversion stock offering materials;
(2) All such plans are approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders, or in the case of a recently formed holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation at a duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to be held no sooner than six months after the completion of the conversion;
(3) In the case of a savings bank subsidiary of a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by a majority of stockholders other than its parent mutual holding company prior to implementation at a duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, to be held no sooner than six months following the stock issuance;
(4) For stock option plans, stock options are granted at no lower than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant; and
(5) For management or employee stock benefit plans, no conversion stock is used to fund the plans.
[59 FR 61246, Nov. 30, 1994, as amended at 63 FR 44750, Aug. 20, 1998; 68 FR 50461, Aug. 21, 2003; 78 FR 55595, Sept. 10, 2013; 83 FR 17740, Apr. 24, 2018]

# Interpretations
§ 333.101
Prior consent not required.
(a) The extension by any State nonmember insured bank of its business to
include personal, character or installment loans, or the extension by an industrial bank of its business to include the business of a commercial bank, is not a change in the general character or type of business requiring the prior written consent of the Corporation.
(b) An insured State nonmember bank or State savings association, not exercising trust powers, may act as trustee or custodian of Individual Retirement Accounts established pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (26 U.S.C. 408), Self-Employed Retirement Plans established pursuant to the Self-Employed Individuals Retirement Act of 1962 (26 U.S.C. 401), Roth Individual Retirement Accounts and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts established pursuant to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (26 U.S.C. 408A and 530 respectively), Health Savings Accounts established pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (26 U.S.C. 223), and other similar accounts without the prior written consent of the Corporation provided:
(1) The bank's or savings association's duties as trustee or custodian are essentially custodial or ministerial in nature,
(2) The bank or savings association is required to invest the funds from such plans only
(i) In its own time or savings deposits, or
(ii) In any other assets at the direction of the customer, provided the bank or savings association does not exercise any investment discretion or provide any investment advice with respect to such account assets, and
(3) The bank's or savings association's acceptance of such accounts without trust powers is not contrary to applicable State law.

Appendixes A-I to Part 334 [Reserved]
Pt. 334, App. J

# Appendix J to Part 334—Interagency Guidelines on Identity Theft Detection, Prevention, and Mitigation
Section 334.90 of this part requires each financial institution and creditor that offers or maintains one or more covered accounts, as defined in § 334.90(b)(3) of this part, to develop and provide for the continued administration of a written Program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or any existing covered account. These guidelines are intended to assist financial institutions and creditors in the formulation and maintenance of a Program that satisfies the requirements of § 334.90 of this part.

# I. The Program
In designing its Program, a financial institution or creditor may incorporate, as appropriate, its existing policies, procedures, and other arrangements that control reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft.

# II. Identifying Relevant Red Flags
(a)
Risk Factors.
A financial institution or creditor should consider the following factors in identifying relevant Red Flags for covered accounts, as appropriate:
(1) The types of covered accounts it offers or maintains;
(2) The methods it provides to open its covered accounts;
(3) The methods it provides to access its covered accounts; and
(4) Its previous experiences with identity theft.
(b)
Sources of Red Flags.
Financial institutions and creditors should incorporate relevant Red Flags from sources such as:
(1) Incidents of identity theft that the financial institution or creditor has experienced;
(2) Methods of identity theft that the financial institution or creditor has identified that reflect changes in identity theft risks; and
(3) Applicable supervisory guidance.
(c)
Categories of Red Flags.
The Program should include relevant Red Flags from the following categories, as appropriate. Examples of Red Flags from each of these categories are appended as Supplement A to this Appendix J.
(1) Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer reporting agencies or service providers, such as fraud detection services;
(2) The presentation of suspicious documents;
(3) The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information, such as a suspicious address change;
(4) The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a covered account; and
(5) Notice from customers, victims of identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the financial institution or creditor.

# III.
Detecting Red Flags.
The Program's policies and procedures should address the detection of Red Flags in connection with the opening of covered accounts and existing covered accounts, such as by:
(a) Obtaining identifying information about, and verifying the identity of, a person opening a covered account, for example, using the policies and procedures regarding identification and verification set forth in the Customer Identification Program rules implementing 31 U.S.C. 5318(l) (31 CFR 1020.220); and
(b) Authenticating customers, monitoring transactions, and verifying the validity of change of address requests, in the case of existing covered accounts.

# IV.
Preventing and Mitigating Identity Theft.
The Program's policies and procedures should provide for appropriate responses to the Red Flags the financial institution or creditor has detected that are commensurate with the degree of risk posed. In determining an appropriate response, a financial institution or creditor should consider aggravating factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account records held by the financial institution, creditor, or third party, or notice that a customer has provided information related to a covered account held by the financial institution or creditor to someone fraudulently claiming to represent the financial institution or creditor or to a fraudulent Web site. Appropriate responses may include the following:
(a) Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft;
(b) Contacting the customer;
(c) Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices that permit access to a covered account;
(d) Reopening a covered account with a new account number;
(e) Not opening a new covered account;
(f) Closing an existing covered account;
(g) Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a covered account to a debt collector;
(h) Notifying law enforcement; or
(i) Determining that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances.

# V.
Updating the Program.
Financial institutions and creditors should update the Program (including the Red Flags determined to be relevant) periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft, based on factors such as:
(a) The experiences of the financial institution or creditor with identity theft;
(b) Changes in methods of identity theft;
(c) Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft;
(d) Changes in the types of accounts that the financial institution or creditor offers or maintains; and
(e) Changes in the business arrangements of the financial institution or creditor, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.

# VI. Methods for Administering the Program
(a)
Oversight of Program.
Oversight by the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or a designated employee at the level of senior management should include:
(1) Assigning specific responsibility for the Program's implementation;
(2) Reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance by the financial institution or creditor with § 334.90 of this part; and
(3) Approving material changes to the Program as necessary to address changing identity theft risks.
(b)
Reports
—(1)
In general.
Staff of the financial institution or creditor responsible for development, implementation, and administration of its Program should report to the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or a designated employee at the level of senior management, at least annually, on compliance by the financial institution or creditor with § 334.90 of this part.
(2)
Contents of report.
The report should address material matters related to the Program and evaluate issues such as: the effectiveness of the policies and procedures of the financial institution or creditor in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; service provider arrangements; significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response; and recommendations for material changes to the Program.
(c)
Oversight of service provider arrangements.
Whenever a financial institution or creditor engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered accounts the financial institution or creditor should take steps to ensure that the activity of the service provider is conducted in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. For example, a financial institution or creditor could require the service provider by contract to have policies and procedures to detect relevant Red Flags that may arise in the performance of the service provider's activities, and either report the Red Flags to the financial institution or creditor, or to take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

# VII. Other Applicable Legal Requirements
Financial institutions and creditors should be mindful of other related legal requirements that may be applicable, such as:
(a) For financial institutions and creditors that are subject to 31 U.S.C. 5318(g), filing a Suspicious Activity Report in accordance with applicable law and regulation;
(b) Implementing any requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-1(h) regarding the circumstances under which credit may be extended when the financial institution or creditor detects a fraud or active duty alert;
(c) Implementing any requirements for furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, for example, to correct or update inaccurate or incomplete information, and to not report information that the furnisher has reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate; and
(d) Complying with the prohibitions in 15 U.S.C. 1681m on the sale, transfer, and placement for collection of certain debts resulting from identity theft.

# Supplement A to Appendix J
In addition to incorporating Red Flags from the sources recommended in section II.b. of the Guidelines in Appendix J of this part, each financial institution or creditor may consider incorporating into its Program, whether singly or in combination, Red Flags from the following illustrative examples in connection with covered accounts:

# Alerts, Notifications or Warnings from a Consumer Reporting Agency
1. A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report.
2. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a consumer report.
3. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address discrepancy, as defined in 12 CFR 1022.82(b).
4. A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as:
a. A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
b. An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
c. A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect to recently established credit relationships; or
d. An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.

# Suspicious Documents
5. Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered or forged.
6. The photograph or physical description on the identification is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the identification.
7. Other information on the identification is not consistent with information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer presenting the identification.
8. Other information on the identification is not consistent with readily accessible information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor, such as a signature card or a recent check.
9. An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.

# Suspicious Personal Identifying Information
10. Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when compared against external information sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:
a. The address does not match any address in the consumer report; or
b. The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.
11. Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of birth.
12. Personal identifying information provided is associated with known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:
a. The address on an application is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent application; or
b. The phone number on an application is the same as the number provided on a fraudulent application.
13. Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:
a. The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a prison; or
b. The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or answering service.
14. The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or other customers.
15. The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other persons opening accounts or by other customers.
16. The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete.
17. Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor.
18. For financial institutions and creditors that use challenge questions, the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report.

# Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered Account
19. Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the institution or creditor receives a request for a new, additional, or replacement card or a cell phone, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.
20. A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud. For example:
a. The majority of available credit is used for cash advances or merchandise that is easily convertible to cash (e.g., electronics equipment or jewelry); or
b. The customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
21. A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
a. Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;
b. A material increase in the use of available credit;
c. A material change in purchasing or spending patterns;
d. A material change in electronic fund transfer patterns in connection with a deposit account; or
e. A material change in telephone call patterns in connection with a cellular phone account.
22. A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of
account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
23. Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the customer's covered account.
24. The financial institution or creditor is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements.
25. The financial institution or creditor is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in connection with a customer's covered account.

# Notice From Customers, Victims of Identity Theft, Law Enforcement Authorities, or Other Persons Regarding Possible Identity Theft in Connection With Covered Accounts Held by the Financial Institution or Creditor
26. The financial institution or creditor is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.

(b)
Electronic filings.
(1) The FDIC does not participate in the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering
Analysis and Retrieval) electronic filing program (17 CFR part 232).

Beneficial Ownership Report filing requirements are provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2) All reporting persons must electronically file Beneficial Ownership Reports (FDIC Forms 3, 4, and 5), including amendments and exhibits thereto, using the Internet-based interagency Beneficial Ownership Filings System, except that a reporting person that has obtained a continuing hardship exemption under these rules may file the forms with the FDIC in paper format. For electronic filing purposes, FDIC Forms 3, 4, and 5 are accessible at the Internet-based interagency Web site for Beneficial Ownership Filings at FDIC

(4)
Adjustment of the filing date.
If an electronic filer in good faith attempts to file a beneficial ownership report with the FDIC in a timely manner but the filing is delayed due to technical difficulties beyond the electronic filer's control, the electronic filer may request an adjustment of the filing date of such submission. The FDIC may grant the request if it appears that such adjustment is appropriate and consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
(5)
Exhibits.
(i) Exhibits to an electronic filing that have not previously been filed with the FDIC shall be filed in electronic format, absent a hardship exemption.
(ii) Previously filed exhibits, whether in paper or electronic format, may be incorporated by reference into an electronic filing to the extent permitted by applicable SEC rules under the Exchange Act. An electronic filer may, at its option, restate in electronic format an exhibit incorporated by reference that originally was filed in paper format.

(6)
Continuing Hardship Exemption.
The FDIC will not accept in paper format any beneficial ownership report filing required to be submitted electronically under this part unless the filer satisfies the requirements for a continuing hardship exemption:
(i) A filer may apply in writing for a continuing hardship exemption if all or part of a filing or group of filings otherwise required to be filed in electronic format cannot be so filed without undue burden or expense. Such written application shall be made at least ten business days prior to the required due date of the filing(s) or the proposed filing date, as appropriate, or within such shorter period as may be permitted. The written application shall be sent to the Accounting and Securities Disclosure Section, Division of Risk Management Supervision, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20429, and shall
contain the information set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section.
(A) The application shall not be deemed granted until the applicant is notified by the FDIC.
(B) If the FDIC denies the application for a continuing hardship exemption, the filer shall file the required document in electronic format on the required due date or the proposed filing date or such other date as may be permitted.
(C) If the FDIC determines that the grant of the exemption is appropriate and consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors and so notifies the applicant, the filer shall follow the procedures set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section.
(ii) The request for the continuing hardship exemption shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(A) The reason(s) that the necessary hardware and software are not available without unreasonable burden and expense;
(B) The burden and expense involved to employ alternative means to make the electronic submission; and/or
(C) The reasons for not submitting electronically the document or group of documents, as well as justification for the requested time period for the exemption.
(iii) If the request for a continuing hardship exemption is granted, the electronic filer shall submit the document or group of documents for which the exemption is granted in paper format on the required due date specified in the applicable form, rule or regulation, or the proposed filing date, as appropriate. The paper format document(s) shall have placed at the top of page 1, or at the top of an attached cover page, a legend in capital letters:
IN ACCORDANCE WITH 12 CFR 335.801(b), THIS (SPECIFY DOCUMENT) IS BEING FILED IN PAPER PURSUANT TO A CONTINUING HARDSHIP EXEMPTION.
(iv) Where a continuing hardship exemption is granted with respect to an exhibit only, the paper format exhibit shall be filed with the FDIC under Form SE (17 CFR part 249). The name of the FDIC shall be substituted for the name of the SEC on the form. Form SE shall be filed as a paper cover sheet to all exhibits to Beneficial Ownership Reports submitted to the FDIC in paper form pursuant to a hardship exemption.
(v) Form SE may be filed with the FDIC up to six business days prior to, or on the date of filing of, the electronic form to which it relates but shall not be filed after such filing date. If a paper exhibit is submitted in this manner, requirements that the exhibit be filed with, provided with, or accompany the electronic filing shall be satisfied. Any requirements as to delivery or furnishing the information to persons other than the FDIC shall not be affected by this section.
(7)
Signatures.
(i) Required signatures to, or within, any electronic submission must be in typed form. When used in connection with an electronic filing, the term “signature” means an electronic entry or other form of computer data compilation of any letters or series of letters or characters comprising a name, executed, adopted or authorized as a signature.
(ii) Each signatory to an electronic filing shall manually sign a signature page or other document authenticating, acknowledging or otherwise adopting his or her signature that appears in typed form within the electronic filing. Such document shall be executed before or at the time the electronic filing is made and shall be retained by the filer for a period of five years. Upon request, an electronic filer shall furnish to the FDIC a copy of any or all documents retained pursuant to this section.
(iii) Where the FDIC's rules require a filer to furnish a national securities exchange, a national securities association, a bank, or State savings association, paper copies of a document filed with the FDIC in electronic format, signatures to such paper copies may be in typed form.
(c)
Legal proceedings.
Whenever this part or cross referenced provisions of the SEC regulations require disclosure of legal proceedings, administrative or judicial proceedings arising under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act shall be deemed material and shall be described.
(d)
Indebtedness of management.
Whenever this part of cross referenced provisions of the SEC regulations require
disclosure of indebtedness of management, extensions of credit to specified persons in excess of ten (10) percent of the equity capital accounts of the bank or State savings association or $5 million, whichever is less, shall be deemed material and shall be disclosed in addition to any other required disclosure. The disclosure of this material indebtedness shall include the largest aggregate amount of indebtedness (in dollar amounts, and as a percentage of total equity capital accounts at the time), including extensions of credit or overdrafts, endorsements and guarantees outstanding at any time since the beginning of the bank or State savings association's last fiscal year, and as of the latest practicable date.
(1) If aggregate extensions of credit to all specified persons as a group exceeded 20 percent of the equity capital accounts of the bank or State savings association at any time since the beginning of the last fiscal year, the aggregate amount of such extensions of credit shall also be disclosed.
(2) Other loans are deemed material and shall be disclosed where:
(i) The extension(s) of credit was not made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates, collateral and repayment terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other than the specified persons;
(ii) The extension(s) of credit was not made in the ordinary course of business; or
(iii) The extension(s) of credit has involved or presently involves more than a normal risk of collectibility or other unfavorable features including the restructuring of an extension of credit, or a delinquency as to payment of interest or principal.
(e)
Proxy material required to be filed.
(1) Three preliminary copies of each information statement, proxy statement, form of proxy, and other item of soliciting material to be furnished to security holders concurrently therewith, shall be filed with the FDIC by the bank, State savings association, or any other person making a solicitation subject to 12 CFR 335.401 at least ten calendar days (or 15 calendar days in the case of other than routine meetings, as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) prior to the date such item is first sent or given to any security holders, or such shorter date as may be authorized.
(2) For the purposes of this paragraph (e), a routine meeting means:
(i) A meeting with respect to which no one is soliciting proxies subject to 12 CFR 335.401 other than on behalf of the bank or State savings association and at which the bank or State savings association intends to present no matters other than:
(A) The election of directors;
(B) The election, approval or ratification of accountants;
(C) A Security holder proposal included pursuant to SEC Rule 14(a)-8 (17 CFR 240.14a-8); and

(3) Where preliminary copies of material are filed with the FDIC under this section, the printing of definitive copies for distribution to security holders should be deferred until the comments of the FDIC's staff have been received and considered.
(f)
Additional information; filing of other statements in certain cases.
(1) In addition to the information expressly required to be included in a statement, form, schedule or report, there shall be added such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
(2) The FDIC may, upon the written request of the bank or State savings association, and where consistent with the protection of investors, permit the omission of one or more of the statements or disclosures herein required, or the filing in substitution therefor of appropriate statements or disclosures of comparable character.
(3) The FDIC may also require the filing of other statements or disclosures in addition to, or in substitution for those herein required in any case where
such statements are necessary or appropriate for an adequate presentation of the financial condition of any person whose financial statements are required, or disclosure about which is otherwise necessary for the protection of investors.

§ 337.1
Scope.
The provisions of this part apply to certain banking practices which are likely to have adverse effects on the safety and soundness of insured State nonmember banks or which are likely to result in violations of law, rule, or regulation.
§ 337.2
Standby letters of credit.
(a)
Definition.
As used in this section, the term
standby letter of credit
means any letter of credit, or similar arrangement however named or described, which represents an obligation to the beneficiary on the part of the issuer: (1) To repay money borrowed by or advanced to or for the account of the account party, or (2) to make payment on account of any indebtedness undertaken by the account party, or (3) to make payment on account of any default (including any statement of default) by the account party in the performance of an obligation.
1
The term
similar arrangement
includes the creation of an acceptance or similar undertaking.
1
As defined in this paragraph (a), the term
standby letter of credit
would not include commercial letters of credit and similar instruments where the issuing bank expects the beneficiary to draw upon the issuer, which do not “guaranty” payment of a money obligation of the account party and which do not provide that payment is occasioned by default on the part of the account party.
(b)
Restriction.
A standby letter of credit issued by an insured State nonmember bank shall be combined with all other standby letters of credit and all loans for purposes of applying any legal limitation on loans of the bank (including limitations on loans to any one borrower, on loans to affiliates of the bank, or on aggregate loans);
Provided, however,
That if such standby letter of credit is subject to separate limitation under applicable State or federal law, then the separate limitation shall apply in lieu of the loan limitation.
2
2
Where the standby letter of credit is subject to a non-recourse participation agreement with another bank or other banks, this section shall apply to the issuer and each participant in the same manner as in the case of a participated loan.
(c)
Exceptions.
All standby letters of credit shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section except where:
(1) Prior to or at the time of issuance, the issuing bank is paid an amount equal to the bank's maximum liability under the standby letter of credit; or,
(2) Prior to or at the time of issuance, the issuing bank has set aside sufficient funds in a segregated deposit account, clearly earmarked for that purpose, to cover the bank's maximum liability under the standby letter of credit.
(d)
Disclosure.
Each insured State nonmember bank must maintain adequate control and subsidiary records of its standby letters of credit comparable to the records maintained in connection with the bank's direct loans so that at all times the bank's potential liability thereunder and the bank's compliance with this section may be readily determined. In addition, all such standby letters of credit must be adequately reflected on the bank's published financial statements.
§ 337.3
Limits on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of FDIC-supervised institutions.
(a) With the exception of 12 CFR 215.5(b) and (c)(3) and (4), FDIC-supervised institutions are subject to the restrictions contained in Federal Reserve Board Regulation O (12 CFR part 215) to the same extent and to the same manner as though they were member banks.
(b) For the purposes of compliance with § 215.4(b) of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O, no FDIC-supervised institution may extend credit or grant a line of credit to any of its executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders or to any related interest of any such person in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other extensions of credit and lines of credit by the FDIC-supervised institution to that person and to all related interests of that person, exceeds the greater of $25,000 or five percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus,
1
or $500,000 unless:
1
For the purposes of section 337.3, an FDIC-supervised institution's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus shall have the same meaning as found in section 215.2(i) of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O (12 CFR 215.2(i)).
(1) The extension of credit or line of credit has been approved in advance by a majority of the entire board of directors of that FDIC-supervised institution and
(2) The interested party has abstained from participating directly or indirectly in the voting.
(c)(1) No FDIC-supervised institution may extend credit in an aggregate amount greater than the amount permitted in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to a partnership in which one or more of the FDIC-supervised institution's executive officers are partners and, either individually or together, hold a majority interest. For the purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the total amount of credit extended by an FDIC-supervised institution to such partnership is considered to be extended to each executive officer of the FDIC-supervised institution who is a member of the partnership.
(2) An FDIC-supervised institution is authorized to extend credit to any executive officer of the bank for any other purpose not specified in § 215.5(c)(1) and (2) of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O (12 CFR 215.5(c)(1) and (2)) if the aggregate amount of such other extensions of credit does not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5 percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000 but in no event more than $100,000, provided, however, that no such extension of credit shall be subject to this limit if the extension of credit is secured by:
(i) A perfected security interest in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, or Treasury bills of the United States or in other such obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States;
(ii) Unconditional takeout commitments or guarantees of any department, agency, bureau, board, commission or establishment of the United States or any corporation wholly owned directly or indirectly by the United States; or
(iii) A perfected security interest in a segregated deposit account in the lending FDIC-supervised institution.
(3) For the purposes of this paragraph (c), the definitions of the terms used in Federal Reserve Board Regulation O shall apply including the exclusion of executive officers of an FDIC-supervised institution's parent bank or savings and loan holding company and executive officers of any other subsidiary of that bank or savings and loan holding company from the definition of executive officer for the purposes of complying with the loan restrictions contained in section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act. For the purposes of complying with § 215.5(d) of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O, the reference to “the amount specified for a category of credit in paragraph (c) of this section” shall be understood to refer to the amount specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this § 337.3.
(d)
Definition.
For purposes of this section,
FDIC-supervised institution
means an entity for which the FDIC is
the appropriate Federal banking agency pursuant to section 3(q) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(q).
[85 FR 3246, Jan. 21, 2020]
§ 337.4
[Reserved]
§ 337.5
Exemption.
Check guaranty card programs, customer-sponsored credit card programs, and similar arrangements in which a bank undertakes to guarantee the obligations of individuals who are its retail banking deposit customers are exempted from § 337.2:
Provided, however,
That the bank establishes the creditworthiness of the individual before undertaking to guarantee his/her obligations and that any such arrangement to which a bank's principal shareholders, directors, or executive officers are a party be in compliance with applicable provisions of Federal Reserve Regulation O (12 CFR part 215).

§ 337.7
Interest rate restrictions.
(a)
Definitions
—(1)
National rate.
The weighted average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions on a given deposit product, for which data are available, where the weights are each institution's market share of domestic deposits.
(2)
National rate cap.
The higher of:
(i) National rate plus 75 basis points, or
(ii) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points or, in the case of any nonmaturity deposit, the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.
(3)
Local market rate cap.
Ninety (90) percent of the highest interest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market area. An institution's local market rate cap shall be based upon the rate offered on a particular product type and maturity period by an insured depository institution or credit union that is accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.
(4)
Local market area.
An institution's local market area is any readily defined geographical market area in which the insured depository institution accepts or solicits deposits, which may include the State, county or metropolitan statistical area, in which the insured depository institution accepts or solicits deposits.
(5)
On-tenor and off-tenor maturities.
On-tenor maturities include the following term periods: 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 12-months, 24-months, 36-months, 48-months, and 60-months. All other term periods are considered off-tenor maturities for purposes of this section.
(b)
Computation and publication of national rate cap
—(1)
Computation.
The Corporation will compute the national rate cap for different deposit products and maturities, as determined by the Corporation based on available and reported data.
(2)
Publication.
The Corporation will publish the national rate cap monthly, but reserves the discretion to publish more or less frequently, if needed, on the Corporation's website. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, for institutions that are less than
well capitalized at the time of publication, a national rate cap that is lower than the previously published national rate cap will take effect 3 days after publication. The previously published national rate cap will remain in effect during this 3-day period.
(c)
Application
—(1)
Well-capitalized institutions.
A well-capitalized institution may pay interest without restriction by this section.
(2)
Institutions that are not well capitalized.
An institution that is not well capitalized may not: Solicit deposits by offering a rate of interest that exceeds the applicable rate cap; or, where an institution has accepted brokered deposits pursuant to a waiver described in § 337.6(c), pay a rate of interest that, at the time such deposit is accepted, exceeds the applicable rate cap. For purposes of this section, the applicable rate cap is the national rate cap or, if the institution has provided the notice and evidence described in subsection (d) of this section, the local market rate cap for deposits gathered in the institution's local market area. If an institution gathers deposits from more than one local area, it may seek to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap for deposits gathered in each respective local market area.
(d)
Notice related to local market rate cap applicability.
An insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market area to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations.
(e)
Offering products with off-tenor maturities.
If an institution seeks to offer a product with an off-tenor maturity for which the FDIC does not publish the national rate cap or that is not offered by another institution within its local market area, then the institution will be required to use the rate offered on the next lower on-tenor maturity for that product when determining its applicable national or local rate cap, respectively. For example, an institution seeking to offer a 26-month certificate of deposit must use the rate offered for a 24-month certificate of deposit to determine the institution's applicable national or local rate cap. There is no off-tenor maturity for nonmaturity products such as an interest checking account, savings account, or money market deposit account.
(f)
Discretion to delay effect of published national rate cap.
In the event of a substantial decrease in the published national rate cap from one month to the next, the Corporation may, in its discretion, delay the date on which the published national rate cap takes effect. The previously published national rate cap will remain in effect until the effective date, as determined by the Corporation, of the subsequent published national rate cap.
(g)
Treatment of nonmaturity deposits for purposes of this section.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply.
(1)
Solicitation of nonmaturity deposits.
(i) An institution solicits a nonmaturity deposit when—
(A) A nonmaturity account is opened;
(B) The institution raises the rate being paid on a nonmaturity account existing at the time when the institution was last well capitalized; or,
(C) Funds for a new depositor are credited to a nonmaturity account existing at the time when the institution was last well capitalized.
(2)
Acceptance of nonmaturity brokered deposits subject to a waiver.
A less than well capitalized institution that accepts nonmaturity brokered deposits subject to waiver, with respect to a particular deposit broker, may not pay interest in excess of the applicable rate cap on:
(i) Any new nonmaturity accounts opened by or through that particular deposit broker;
(ii) An amount of funds that exceeds the amount(s) in the account(s) that, at the time the institution fell to less than well capitalized, had been opened
by or through the particular deposit broker; or
(iii) For agency or nominee accounts, any funds for a new depositor credited to a nonmaturity account or accounts.

Pt. 339, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 339—Sample Form of Notice of Special Flood Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance
We are giving you this notice to inform you that:
The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards.
The area has been identified by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using FEMA's
Flood Insurance Rate Map
or the
Flood Hazard Boundary Map
for the following community: ______. This area has a one percent (1%) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-year mortgage loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood hazard area is 26 percent (26%).
Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the Administrator of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you would like to make such a request, please contact us for further information.
____The community in which the property securing the loan is located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Federal law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be maintained for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.
• At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must cover
the lesser of:
(1) the outstanding principal balance of the loan;
or
(2) the maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property under the NFIP.
Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures your loan and not the land itself.
• Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in the form of a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred in excess of your flood insurance if your community's participation in the NFIP is in accordance with NFIP requirements.
• Although you may not be required to maintain flood insurance on all structures, you may still wish to do so, and your mortgage lender may still require you to do so to protect the collateral securing the mortgage.
If you choose not to maintain flood insurance on a structure and it floods, you are responsible for all flood losses relating to that structure.

# Availability of Private Flood Insurance Coverage
Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be purchased through an insurance agent who will obtain the policy either directly through the NFIP or through an insurance company that participates in the NFIP. Flood insurance that provides the same level of coverage as a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP may be available from private insurers that do not participate in the NFIP. You should compare the flood insurance coverage, deductibles, exclusions, conditions, and premiums associated with flood insurance policies issued on behalf of the NFIP and policies issued on behalf of private insurance companies and contact an insurance agent as to the availability, cost, and comparisons of flood insurance coverage.

# [Escrow Requirement for Residential Loans
Federal law may require a lender or its servicer to escrow all premiums and fees for flood insurance that covers any residential building or mobile home securing a loan that is located in an area with special flood hazards. If your lender notifies you that an escrow account is required for your loan, then you must pay your flood insurance premiums and fees to the lender or its servicer with the same frequency as you make loan payments for the duration of your loan. These premiums and fees will be deposited in the escrow account, which will be used to pay the flood insurance provider.]
____Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for the property securing the loan because the community in which the property is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if the non-participating community has been identified for at least one year as containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in the community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief assistance in the event of a Federally declared flood disaster.

§ 340.1
What is the statutory authority for the regulation, what are its purpose and scope, and can the FDIC have other policies on related topics?
(a)
Authority.
The statutory authority for adopting this part is section 11(p) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), 12 U.S.C. 1821(p). Section 11(p) was added to the FDI Act by section 20 of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (Pub. L. 103-204, 107 Stat. 2369 (1993)).
(b)
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to prohibit individuals or entities that improperly profited or engaged in wrongdoing at the expense of a failed institution or covered financial company, or seriously mismanaged a failed institution, from buying assets of a failed institution from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
(c)
Scope.
(1) The restrictions of this part generally apply to sales of assets of failed institutions owned or controlled by the FDIC in any capacity.
(2) The restrictions in this section apply to the sale of assets of a subsidiary of a failed institution or a bridge depository institution if the FDIC controls the terms of the sale by agreement or in its role as shareholder.
(3) Unless we determine otherwise, this part does not apply to the sale of securities in connection with the investment of corporate and receivership funds pursuant to the Investment Policy for Liquidation Funds managed by the FDIC as it is in effect from time to time.
(4) In the case of a sale of securities backed by a pool of assets that may include assets of failed institutions by a trust or other entity, this part applies only to the sale of assets by the FDIC to an underwriter in an initial offering, and not to any other purchaser of the securities.
(5) The restrictions of this part do not apply to a sale of a security or a group or index of securities, a commodity, or any qualified financial contract that, in each case, customarily is traded through a financial intermediary, as defined in § 340.2, where the seller cannot control selection of the purchaser and the sale is consummated through that customary practice.
(6) The restrictions of this part do not apply to a judicial sale or a trustee's sale of property that secures an obligation to the FDIC where the sale is not conducted or controlled by the FDIC.
(d) The FDIC retains the authority to establish other policies restricting asset sales. Neither 12 U.S.C. 1821(p) nor this part in any way limits the authority of the FDIC to establish policies prohibiting the sale of assets to prospective purchasers who have injured any failed institution, or to other prospective purchasers, such as certain employees or contractors of the FDIC, or individuals who are not in compliance with the terms of any debt or duty owed to the FDIC. Any such policies may be independent of, in conjunction with, or in addition to the restrictions set forth in this part.

Disclosures must be readily understandable.

(iv) “NOT GUARANTEED BY THE INSTITUTION”
(v) “MAY GO DOWN IN VALUE”

(iii) With respect to those disclosures made through electronic media for which paper or oral disclosures are not required, the disclosures are not meaningfully provided if the consumer may bypass the visual text of the disclosures before purchasing an insurance product or annuity.
(7)
Consumer acknowledgment.
You must obtain from the consumer, at the time a consumer receives the disclosures required under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, or at the time of the initial purchase by the consumer of an insurance product or annuity, a written acknowledgment by the consumer that the consumer received the disclosures.

Advertisements and other promotional material for insurance products or annuities.

§ 343.50
Where insurance activities may take place.
(a)
General rule.
An institution must, to the extent practicable, keep the area where the institution conducts transactions involving insurance products or annuities physically segregated from areas where retail deposits are routinely accepted from the general public, identify the areas where insurance product or annuity sales activities occur, and clearly delineate and distinguish those areas from the areas where the institution's retail deposit-taking activities occur.
(b)
Referrals.
Any person who accepts deposits from the public in an area where such transactions are routinely conducted in the institution may refer a consumer who seeks to purchase an insurance product or annuity to a qualified person who sells that product only if the person making the referral receives no more than a one-time, nominal fee of a fixed dollar amount for each referral that does not depend on whether the referral results in a transaction.
§ 343.60
Qualification and licensing requirements for insurance sales personnel.
An institution may not permit any person to sell or offer for sale any insurance product or annuity in any part of its office or on its behalf, unless the person is at all times appropriately qualified and licensed under applicable State insurance licensing standards with regard to the specific products being sold or recommended.

for all securities sold pursuant to the offering and the parties to the contract have not expressly agreed to another date for payment of funds and delivery of securities at the time of the transaction.

(b)
Geographic requirements for facility-based assessment areas.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a bank's facility-based assessment areas must include each county in which a bank has a main office, a branch, or a deposit-taking remote service facility, as well as the surrounding counties in which the bank has originated or purchased a substantial portion of its loans (including home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans).
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, each of a bank's facility-based assessment areas must consist of a single MSA, one or more contiguous counties within an MSA, or one or more contiguous counties within the nonmetropolitan area of a State.
(3) An intermediate bank or a small bank may adjust the boundaries of its facility-based assessment areas to include only the portion of a county that it reasonably can be expected to serve, subject to paragraph (c) of this section.

(c)
Other limitations on the delineation of a facility-based assessment area.
Each of a bank's facility-based assessment areas:
(1) May not reflect illegal discrimination; and

(ii)
States with rated multistate MSAs.
The FDIC evaluates a bank and assigns conclusions and ratings for a State only if the bank maintains a main office, branch, or deposit-taking remote service facility outside the portion of the State comprising any multistate MSA identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In evaluating a bank and assigning conclusions and ratings for a State, the FDIC does not consider activities to be in the State if those activities take place in the portion of the State comprising any multistate MSA identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(iii)
States with non-rated multistate MSAs.
If a facility-based assessment area of a bank comprises a geographic area spanning two or more States within a multistate MSA that is not identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the FDIC considers activities in the entire facility-based assessment area to be in the State in which the bank maintains, within the multistate MSA, a main office, branch, or deposit-taking remote service facility. In evaluating a bank and assigning conclusions and ratings for a State, the FDIC does not consider activities to be in the State if those activities take place in any facility-based assessment area that is considered to be in another State pursuant to this paragraph (c)(1)(iii).
(iv)
States with multistate retail lending assessment areas.
In assigning Retail Lending Test conclusions for a State pursuant to § 345.22(h), the FDIC does not consider a bank's activities to be in the State if those activities take place in a retail lending assessment area consisting of counties in more than one State.

Rated multistate MSAs.
The FDIC evaluates a bank and assigns conclusions and ratings under this part in any multistate MSA in which the bank maintains a main office, a branch, or a deposit-taking remote service facility in two or more States within that multistate MSA.
(d)
Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices
—(1)
Scope.
For each State and multistate MSA, as applicable, and the institution, the FDIC's evaluation of a bank's performance under this part is adversely affected by evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The FDIC considers evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices described in this section by:
(i) The bank, including by an operating subsidiary of the bank; or
(ii) Any other affiliate related to any activities considered in the evaluation of the bank.
(2)
Discriminatory or other illegal credit practices.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, discriminatory or other illegal credit practices consist of the following:
(i) Discrimination on a prohibited basis, including in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691
et seq.
) or the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601
et seq.
);
(ii) Violations of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1639);
(iii) Violations of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45);
(iv) Violations of section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536);

); and
(ix) Any other violation of a law, rule, or regulation consistent with the types of violations in paragraphs
(d)(2)(i) through (viii) of this section, as determined by the FDIC.
(3)
Agency considerations.
In determining the effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section on the bank's assigned State, multistate MSA, and institution ratings, the FDIC will consider:
(i) The root cause or causes of any such violations of law, rule, or regulation;
(ii) The severity of any harm to any communities, individuals, small businesses, and small farms resulting from such violations;
(iii) The duration of time over which the violations occurred;
(iv) The pervasiveness of the violations;
(v) The degree to which the bank, operating subsidiary, or affiliate, as applicable, has established an effective compliance management system across the institution to self-identify risks and to take the necessary actions to reduce the risk of noncompliance and harm to communities, individuals, small businesses, and small farms; and
(vi) Any other relevant information.
(e)
Consideration of past performance.
When assigning ratings, the FDIC considers a bank's past performance. If a bank's prior rating was “Needs to Improve,” the FDIC may determine that a “Substantial Noncompliance” rating is appropriate where the bank failed to improve its performance since the previous evaluation period, with no acceptable basis for such failure.

Pt. 345, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 345—Calculations for the Retail Lending Test
This appendix, based on requirements described in §§ 345.22 and 345.28, includes the following sections:
I. Retail Lending Volume Screen
II. Retail Lending Test Distribution Metrics—Scope of Evaluation
III. Geographic Distribution Metrics and Benchmarks
IV. Borrower Distribution Metrics and Benchmarks
V. Supporting Conclusions for Major Product Lines Other Than Automobile Lending
VI. Supporting Conclusions for Automobile Lending
VII. Retail Lending Test Conclusions—All Major Product Lines
VIII. Retail Lending Test Weighting and Conclusions for States, Multistate MSAs, and the Institution

# I. Retail Lending Volume Screen
The FDIC calculates the Bank Volume Metric and the Market Volume Benchmark for a facility-based assessment area and determines whether the bank has met or surpassed the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in that facility-based assessment area.
a.
Bank Volume Metric.
The FDIC calculates the Bank Volume Metric for each facility-based assessment area by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of loans included in the Bank Volume Metric (
i.e., volume metric loans
). The bank's annual dollar volume of volume metric loans is the total dollar amount of all home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans originated or purchased by the bank in the facility-based assessment area in that year. Automobile loans are included in the bank's annual dollar amount of volume metric loans only if automobile loans are a product line for the bank.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in the facility-based assessment area. For a bank that reports deposits data pursuant to § 345.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a facility-based assessment area is the total of annual average daily balances of deposits reported by the bank in counties in the facility-based assessment area for that year. For a bank that does not report deposits data pursuant to § 345.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a facility-based assessment area is the total of deposits assigned to facilities reported by the bank in the facility-based assessment area in the FDIC's Summary of Deposits for that year.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph I.a.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph I.a.2 of this appendix.
Example A-1:
The bank has a three-year evaluation period. The bank's annual dollar amounts of
volume metric loans
are $300,000 (year 1), $300,000 (year 2), and $400,000 (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar amount of
volume metric loans
in a facility-based assessment area, over the years in the evaluation period, is therefore $1 million. The annual dollar volumes of deposits in the bank located in the facility-based assessment area are $1.7 million (year 1), $1.6 million (year 2), and $1.7 million (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volume of deposits in the facility-based assessment area, over the years in the evaluation period, is therefore $5 million. The Bank Volume Metric for the facility-based assessment area would be $1 million divided by $5 million, or 0.2 (equivalently, 20 percent).
ER01FE24.064
b.
Market Volume Benchmark.
The FDIC calculates the Market Volume Benchmark for the facility-based assessment area. For purposes of calculating the Market Volume Benchmark, a
benchmark depository institution
for a particular year is a depository institution that, in that year, was subject to reporting pursuant to § 345.42(b)(1), 12 CFR
25.42(b)(1) or 228.42(b)(1), or 12 CFR part 1003, and operated a facility included in the FDIC's Summary of Deposits data in the facility-based assessment area. The FDIC calculates the Market Volume Benchmark by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual dollar volume of volume benchmark loans. The annual dollar volume of volume benchmark loans is the total dollar volume of all home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in the facility-based assessment area in that year that are reported loans originated by benchmark depository institutions.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual dollar volume of deposits for benchmark depository institutions in the facility-based assessment area. The annual dollar volume of deposits for benchmark depository institutions in the facility-based assessment area is the sum across benchmark depository institutions of: (i) for a benchmark depository institution that reports data pursuant to § 345.42(b)(3) or 12 CFR 25.42(b)(3) or 228.42(b)(3), the total of annual average daily balances of deposits reported by that depository institution in counties in the facility-based assessment area for that year; and (ii) for a benchmark depository institution that does not report data pursuant to § 345.42(b)(3) or 12 CFR 25.42(b)(3) or 228.42(b)(3), the total of deposits assigned to facilities reported by that depository institution in counties in the facility-based assessment area in the FDIC's Summary of Deposits for that year.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph I.b.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph I.b.2 of this appendix.
Example A-2:
With reference to example A-1 to this appendix, the annual dollar volume of volume benchmark loans is $6 million (year 1), $7 million (year 2), and $7 million (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volume of volume benchmark loans, over the years in the evaluation period, is therefore $20 million. The annual dollar volume of deposits for benchmark depository institutions is $17 million (year 1), $15 million (year 2), and $18 million (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volume of deposits for benchmark depository institutions, over the years in the evaluation period, is therefore $50 million. The Market Volume Benchmark for that facility-based assessment area would be $20 million divided by $50 million, or 0.4 (equivalently, 40 percent).
ER01FE24.065
c.
Retail Lending Volume Threshold.
For each facility-based assessment area, the FDIC calculates a Retail Lending Volume Threshold by multiplying the Market Volume Benchmark for that facility-based assessment area by 0.3 (equivalently, 30 percent). A bank meets or surpasses the Retail Lending Volume Threshold in a facility-based assessment area if the Bank Volume Metric is equal to or greater than the Retail Lending Volume Threshold.
Example A-3:
Based on examples A-1 and A-2 to this appendix, the FDIC calculates the Retail Lending Volume Threshold by multiplying the Market Volume Benchmark of 40 percent by 0.3, equal to 0.12 (equivalently, 12 percent). The Bank Volume Metric, 0.2 (equivalently, 20 percent), is greater than the Retail Lending Volume Threshold. Accordingly, the bank surpasses the Retail Lending Volume Threshold.
Bank Volume Metric (20%)
Retail Lending Volume Threshold [(40%) × 0.3 = 12%]

# II. Retail Lending Distribution Metrics—Scope Of Evaluation
a.
Retail Lending Test Areas evaluated.
A bank's major product lines are evaluated in its Retail Lending Test Areas, as provided in § 345.22(d) and as described in paragraphs II.a.1 and 2 of this appendix.
1.
Large banks exempt from evaluation in retail lending assessment areas.
Pursuant to § 345.17(a)(2), a large bank is not required to delineate retail lending assessment areas in a particular calendar year if the following ratio exceeds 80 percent, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 345.12:
i. The sum, over the prior two calendar years, of the large bank's home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans if automobile loans are a product line for the large bank, originated or purchased in its facility-based assessment areas; divided by
ii. The sum, over the prior two calendar years, of the large bank's home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans if automobile loans are a product line for the large bank, originated or purchased overall.
Example A-4:
A large bank (for which automobile loans are not a product line) originated or purchased 20,000 closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and
small farm loans in the prior two calendar years, representing $6 billion in loan dollars. Of these loans, 18,000 loans, representing $4.5 billion in loan dollars, were originated or purchased in the large bank's facility-based assessment areas. As such, the large bank originated or purchased 75 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans ($4.5 billion/$6 billion) by loan dollars and 90 percent (18,000/20,000) of these loans by loan count within its facility-based assessment areas. The combination of loan dollars and loan count is 82.5 percent, or (75 + 90)/2. Thus, this large bank is not required to delineate retail lending assessment areas pursuant to § 345.17(a)(2) in the current calendar year because the 82.5 percent exceeds the 80 percent threshold.
2.
Small banks and intermediate banks evaluated in outside retail lending areas.
Pursuant to § 345.18(a)(2), the FDIC evaluates the geographic and borrower distributions of the major product lines of an intermediate bank, or a small bank that opts to be evaluated under the Retail Lending Test, in the bank's outside retail lending area if either:
i. The bank opts to have its major product lines evaluated in its outside retail lending area; or
ii. The following ratio exceeds 50 percent, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 345.12:
A. The sum, over the prior two calendar years, of the bank's home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans if automobile loans are a product line for the bank, originated or purchased outside of its facility-based assessment areas; divided by
B. The sum, over the prior two calendar years, of the bank's home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and automobile loans if automobile loans are a product line for the bank, originated or purchased overall.
b.
Product lines and major product lines.
In each of a bank's Retail Lending Test Areas, the FDIC evaluates each of a bank's major product lines, as provided in § 345.22(d)(2) and as described in paragraphs II.b.1 through 3 of this appendix.
1.
Major product line standard for facility-based assessment areas and outside retail lending areas.
Except as provided in paragraph II.b.1.iii of this appendix, a product line is a major product line in a facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area if the following ratio is 15 percent or more, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 345.12:
i. The sum, over the years of the evaluation period, of the bank's loans in the product line originated or purchased in the facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area; divided by
ii. The sum, over the years of the evaluation period, of the bank's loans in all product lines originated or purchased in the facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area.
iii. If a bank has not collected, maintained, or reported loan data on a product line in a facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area for one or more years of an evaluation period, the product line is a major product line if the FDIC determines that the product line is material to the bank's business in the facility-based assessment area or outside retail lending area.
2.
Major product line standard for retail lending assessment areas.
In a retail lending assessment area:
(i) Closed-end home mortgage loans are a major product line in any calendar year in the evaluation period in which the bank delineates a retail lending assessment area based on its closed-end home mortgage loans as determined by the standard in § 345.17(c)(1); and
(ii) Small business loans are a major product line in any calendar year in the evaluation period in which the bank delineates a retail lending assessment area based on its small business loans as determined by the standard in § 345.17(c)(2).
3.
Banks for which automobile loans are a product line.
i. If a bank's automobile loans are a product line (either because the bank is a majority automobile lender or opts to have its automobile loans evaluated pursuant to § 345.22), automobile loans are a product line for the bank for the entire evaluation period.
ii. A bank is a majority automobile lender if the following ratio, calculated at the institution level, exceeds 50 percent, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 345.12:
A. The sum, over the two calendar years preceding the first year of the evaluation period, of the bank's automobile loans originated or purchased overall; divided by
B. The sum, over the two calendar years preceding the first year of the evaluation period, of the bank's automobile loans, home mortgage loans, multifamily loans, small business loans, and small farm loans originated or purchased overall.

# III. Geographic Distribution Metrics and Benchmarks
The FDIC calculates the Geographic Bank Metric, the Geographic Market Benchmark, and the Geographic Community Benchmark for low-income census tracts and for moderate-income census tracts, respectively, as set forth in this section. For each facility-based assessment area, retail lending assessment area, and component geographic area of the bank's outside retail lending area, the FDIC includes either low-income census tracts or moderate-income census tracts (
i.e., designated census tracts
) in the numerator of the metrics and benchmarks calculations for
a particular year. To evaluate small banks and intermediate banks without data collection, maintenance and reporting requirements, the FDIC will use data collected by the bank in the ordinary course of business or through sampling of bank loan data.
a.
Calculation of Geographic Bank Metric.
The FDIC calculates the Geographic Bank Metric for low-income census tracts and for moderate-income census tracts, respectively, for each major product line in each Retail Lending Test Area. The FDIC calculates the Geographic Bank Metric by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual number of originated and purchased loans in the major product line in designated census tracts in the Retail Lending Test Area.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual number of originated and purchased loans in the major product line in the Retail Lending Test Area.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph III.a.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph III.a.2 of this appendix.
Example A-5:
The bank has a three-year evaluation period, and small farm loans are a major product line for the bank in a facility-based assessment area (FBAA-1). The bank's annual numbers of originated and purchased small farm loans (
i.e.,
the bank's originated and purchased small farm loans) are 100 (year 1), 75 (year 2), and 75 (year 3) in FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated and purchased small farm loans is therefore 250 in the evaluation period. In the low-income census tracts within FBAA-1, the bank originated and purchased 25 small farm loans (year 1), 15 small farm loans (year 2), and 10 small farm loans (year 3) (a total of 50 small farm loans). In FBAA-1, the Geographic Bank Metric for small farm loans in low-income census tracts would be 50 divided by 250, or 0.2 (equivalently, 20 percent).
In the moderate-income census tracts within FBAA-1, the bank originated and purchased 30 small farm loans (year 1), 20 small farm loans (year 2), and 10 small farm loans (year 3) (a total of 60 small farm loans). In FBAA-1, the Geographic Bank Metric for small farm loans in moderate-income census tracts would be 60 divided by 250, or 0.24 (equivalently, 24 percent).
ER01FE24.066
b.
Calculation of Geographic Market Benchmarks for facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas.
For each facility-based assessment area and retail lending assessment area, the FDIC calculates the Geographic Market Benchmark for designated census tracts for each major product line, excluding automobile loans. The FDIC calculates the Geographic Market Benchmark by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual number of reported loans in the major product line in designated census tracts in the facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area originated by all lenders.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual number of reported loans in the major product line in the facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area originated by all lenders.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph III.b.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph III.b.2 of this appendix.
Example A-6:
The Geographic Market Benchmarks for small farm loans in FBAA-1 use a three-year evaluation period. Lenders that report small farm loan data originated 500 small farm loans (year 1), 250 small farm loans (year 2), and 250 small farm loans (year 3) within FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated small farm loans is therefore 1,000 in the evaluation period. Lenders that report small farm loan data originated 200 small farm loans (year 1), 100 small farm loans (year 2) and 100 small farm loans (year 3) in low-income census tracts within FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated small farm loans in low-income census tracts within FBAA-1 is therefore 400. The Geographic Market Benchmark for small farm loans in low-income census tracts within FBAA-1 would be 400 divided by 1,000, or 0.4 (equivalently, 40 percent).
Lenders that report small farm loan data originated 100 small farm loans (year 1), 100 small farm loans (year 2), and 100 small farm loans (year 3) in moderate-income census
tracts within FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated small farm loans in moderate-income census tracts within FBAA-1 is therefore 300. The Geographic Market Benchmark for small farm loans in moderate-income census tracts within FBAA-1 would be 300 divided by 1,000, or 0.3 (equivalently, 30 percent).
ER01FE24.067
c.
Calculation of Geographic Community Benchmarks for facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas.
The FDIC calculates the Geographic Community Benchmark for designated census tracts for each major product line in each facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area.
1. For closed-end home mortgage loans, the FDIC calculates a Geographic Community Benchmark for low-income census tracts by:
i. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual number of owner-occupied housing units in low-income census tracts in the facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area.
ii. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual number of owner-occupied housing units in the facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area.

# IV. Borrower Distribution Metrics and Benchmarks
The FDIC calculates the Borrower Bank Metric, the Borrower Market Benchmark, and the Borrower Community Benchmark for each category of borrowers (
i.e., designated borrowers
), as set forth in this section.
For closed-end home mortgage loans, the FDIC calculates these metrics and benchmarks for each of the following designated borrowers: (i) low-income borrowers; and (ii) moderate-income borrowers.
For small business loans, the FDIC calculates these metrics and benchmarks for each of the following designated borrowers: (i) businesses with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less; and (ii) businesses with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million.
For small farm loans, the FDIC calculates these metrics and benchmarks for each of the following designated borrowers: (i) farms with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less; and (ii) farms with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million.
For automobile loans, the FDIC calculates these metrics and benchmarks for each of the following designated borrowers: (i) low-income borrowers; and (ii) moderate income borrowers.
To evaluate small banks and intermediate banks without data collection, maintenance and reporting requirements, the FDIC will use data collected by the bank in the ordinary course of business or through sampling of bank loan data.
a.
Calculation of Borrower Bank Metric.
The FDIC calculates the Borrower Bank Metric for each major product line and category of designated borrowers in each Retail Lending Test Area by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual number of originated and purchased loans in the major product line to designated borrowers in the Retail Lending Test Area.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual number of originated and purchased loans in the major product line in the Retail Lending Test Area.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph IV.a.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph IV.a.2 of this appendix.
Example A-8:
The bank has a three-year evaluation period, and closed-end home mortgage loans are a major product line for the bank in FBAA-1. The bank's annual numbers of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans (
i.e.,
the bank's originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans) are 30 (year 1), 40 (year 2), and 30 (year 3) in FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans is therefore 100 in the evaluation period. In FBAA-1, the bank originated and purchased 10 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 1), 3 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 2), and 7 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 3) (a total of 20 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers). In FBAA-1, the Borrower Bank Metric for closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers would be 20 divided by 100, or 0.2 (equivalently, 20 percent).
In FBAA-1, the bank also originated and purchased 12 closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers (year 1), 5 closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers (year 2), and 13 closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers (year 3) (a total of 30 closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers). In FBAA-1, the Borrower Bank Metric for closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers would be 30 divided by 100, or 0.3 (equivalently, 30 percent).
ER01FE24.069
b.
Calculation of Borrower Market Benchmarks for facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas.
For each facility-based assessment area and retail lending assessment area, the FDIC calculates the Borrower Market Metric for each major product line, excluding automobile loans, and for each category of designated borrowers by:
1. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual number of reported loans in the major product line to designated borrowers in the facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area originated by all lenders.
2. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the annual number of reported loans in the major product line in the facility-based assessment area or retail lending assessment area originated by all lenders.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph IV.b.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph IV.b.2 of this appendix.
Example A-9:
The Borrower Market Benchmarks for closed-end home mortgage loans use a three-year evaluation period. Lenders that report closed-end home mortgage loans originated 500 closed-end home mortgage loans (year 1), 275 closed-end home mortgage loans (year 2), and 225 closed-end home mortgage loans (year 3). The sum of the annual numbers of originated closed-end home mortgage loans is therefore 1,000 in the evaluation period. Lenders that report closed-end home mortgage loans originated 50 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 1), 20 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 2), and 30 closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers (year 3) in FBAA-1. The sum of the annual numbers of originated closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers within FBAA-1 is therefore 100. The Borrower Market Benchmark for closed-end home mortgage loans to low-income borrowers would be 100 divided by 1,000, or 0.1 (equivalently, 10 percent).
Lenders that report closed-end home mortgage loans originated 100 loans (year 1), 75 loans (year 2), and 25 loans (year 3) to moderate-income borrowers. The sum of the annual numbers of originated closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers within FBAA-1 is therefore 200. The Borrower Market Benchmark for closed-end home mortgage loans to moderate-income borrowers in FBAA-1 would be 200 divided by 1,000, or 0.2 (equivalently, 20 percent).

# VII. Retail Lending Test Conclusions—All Major Product Lines
a. The FDIC determines a bank's Retail Lending Test performance conclusion for a major product line in a Retail Lending Test Area by calculating a weighted performance score for each major product line:
1. The FDIC develops a weighted average performance score for each major product line in each Retail Lending Test Area as follows:
i. The FDIC creates a weighted average performance score across the categories of designated census tracts (
i.e., geographic distribution average
) and a weighted average performance score across the categories of designated borrowers (
i.e., borrower distribution average
).
ii. For the geographic distribution average of each major product line, the weighting assigned to each category of designated census tracts is based on the demographics of the Retail Testing Area as outlined in the following table:
Table 3 to Appendix A—Retail Lending, Test Geographic Distribution Average—Weights
Major product line
Category of
designated census tracts
Weight
Closed-End Home Mortgage Loans
Low-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of owner-occupied housing units in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in low-income census tracts.
Moderate-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of owner-occupied housing units in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in moderate-income census tracts.
Small Business Loans
Low-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of non-farm businesses in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in low-income census tracts.
Moderate-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of non-farm businesses in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in moderate-income census tracts.
Small Farm Loans
Low-Income Census Tracts
Percentage of total number of farms in low- and moderate-income census tracts in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are in low-income census tracts.

In the case of a Retail Lending Test Area that contains no low-income census tracts and no moderate-income census tracts, the bank will not receive a geographic distribution average for that assessment area.
Example A-11:
A large bank's closed-end home mortgage loans constitute a major product line for the bank in a facility-based assessment area. The bank's geographic distribution supporting conclusions for closed-end home mortgage loans in this facility-based assessment area are “High Satisfactory” (performance score of 7 points) for low-income census tracts and “Needs to Improve” (performance score of 3 points) for moderate-income census tracts. Owner-occupied housing units in moderate-income census tracts represents 20 percent of all owner-occupied housing units in the facility-based assessment area, and owner-occupied housing units in low-income census tracts represents 5 percent of all owner-occupied housing units in the facility-based assessment area. Accordingly, the weight assigned to the moderate-income geographic distribution performance score is 80 percent [20 percent/(20 percent + 5 percent) = 80 percent] and the weight assigned to the low-income geographic distribution performance score is 20 percent [5 percent/(20 percent + 5 percent) = 20 percent]. The bank's geographic distribution average for closed-end home mortgage loans in this facility-based assessment area is 3.8 [(7 points × 0.2 weight = 1.4) + (3 points × 0.8 weight = 2.4)].
iii. For the borrower distribution average of each major product line, the weighting assigned to each category of designated borrowers is based on the demographics of the Retail Lending Test Area as outlined in the following table:
Table 4 to Appendix A—Retail Lending Test, Borrower Distribution Average—Weights
Major product line
Categories of designated borrowers
Weight
Closed-End Home Mortgage Loans
Low-Income Borrowers
Percentage of total number of low-income and moderate-income families in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are low-income families.
Moderate-Income Borrowers
Percentage of total number of low-income and moderate-income families in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are moderate-income families.
Small Business Loans
Non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less
Percentage of total number of non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less and non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less.
Non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 and less than or equal to $1 million
Percentage of total number of non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less and non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are non-farm businesses with gross annual revenues greater than $250,00 but less than or equal to $1 million.
Small Farm Loans
Farms with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less
Percentage of total number of farms with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less and farms with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are farms with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less.
Farms with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 and less than or equal to $1 million
Percentage of total number of farms with gross annual revenues of $250,000 or less and farms with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are farms with gross annual revenues greater than $250,000 but less than or equal to $1 million.
Automobile Loans
Low-Income Borrowers
Percentage of total number of low-income and moderate-income households in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are low-income households.
Moderate-Income Borrowers
Percentage of total number of low-income and moderate-income households in the applicable Retail Lending Test Area that are moderate-income households.
Example A-12:
Building on example A-11 to this appendix, the bank's borrower distribution supporting conclusions for closed-end home mortgage loans in this facility-based assessment area are “Outstanding” (performance score of 10 points) for low-income borrowers and “Low Satisfactory” (performance score of 6 points) for moderate-income borrowers. Low-income families represent 14 percent of all families in the facility-based assessment area and moderate-income families represent 6 percent of all families in the facility-based assessment area. Accordingly, the weight assigned to the low-income borrower distribution performance score is 70 percent [14 percent/(14 percent + 6 percent) = 70 percent] and the weight assigned to the moderate-income borrower distribution performance score is 30 percent [6 percent/(14 percent + 6 percent) = 30 percent]. The bank's borrower distribution average for closed-end home mortgage loans in this facility-based assessment area is 8.8 [(10 points × 0.7 weight = 7.0) + (6 points × 0.3 weight = 1.8)].
2. For each major product line, the FDIC calculates the average of the geographic distribution average and the borrower distribution average (
i.e., product line score
). If a bank has no geographic distribution average for a product (due to the absence of both low-income census tracts and moderate-income census tracts in the geographic area), the product line score is the borrower distribution average.
Example A-13:
Based on examples A-11 and A-12 to this appendix, the bank's product line score for closed-end home mortgage loans is 6.3 [(3.8 geographic distribution average × 0.5 weight = 1.9) + (8.8 borrower distribution average × 0.5 weight = 4.4)].
b. For each Retail Lending Test Area, the FDIC calculates a weighted average of product line scores across all major product lines (
i.e., Retail Lending Test Area Score
). For each Retail Lending Test Area, the FDIC uses a ratio of the bank's loan originations and purchases in each major product line to its loan originations and purchases in all major product lines during the evaluation period, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 345.12, as weights in the weighted average.
Example A-14:
In addition to the product line score of 6.3 for closed-end home mortgage loans in example A-13 to this appendix, the bank has a product line score of 4.2 for small business lending in the same facility-based assessment area. Among major product lines, 60 percent of the bank's loans in the facility-based assessment area are closed-end home mortgages and 40 percent are small business loans based upon the combination of loan dollars and loan count. Accordingly, the weight assigned to the closed-end home mortgage product line score is 60 percent and the weight assigned to the small business product line score is 40 percent. The bank's Retail Lending Test Area Score for this facility-based assessment area is 5.46 [(6.3 closed-end home mortgage loan product line score × 0.6 weight = 3.78) + (4.2 small business loan product line score × 0.4 weight = 1.68)].
c. The FDIC then develops a Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion corresponding with the conclusion category that is nearest to the Retail Lending Test Area Score, as follows:
Recommended
conclusion
Retail lending test area score
Outstanding
8.5 or more.
High Satisfactory
6.5 or more but less than 8.5.
Low Satisfactory
4.5 or more but less than 6.5.
Needs to Improve
1.5 or more but less than 4.5.
Substantial Noncompliance
less than 1.5.
Example A-15:
Based on example A-14 to this appendix, the bank's Retail Lending Test Area Score is associated with a “Low Satisfactory” conclusion, so the bank's Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion for this facility-based assessment area is “Low Satisfactory.”
d. Once a recommended conclusion is determined for a Retail Lending Test Area, the performance context information provided in § 345.21(d) and the additional factors provided in § 345.22(g) inform the FDIC's determination of the Retail Lending Test conclusion for the Retail Lending Test Area. The agency assigns a Retail Lending Test conclusion for the Retail Lending Test Area of “Outstanding,” “High Satisfactory,” “Low Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve,” or “Substantial Noncompliance.”

# VIII. Retail Lending Test Weighting and Conclusions for States, Multistate MSAs, and the Institution
The FDIC develops the Retail Lending Test conclusions for States, multistate MSAs, and the institution as described in this section.
a. The FDIC translates Retail Lending Test conclusions for facility-based assessment areas, retail lending assessment areas, and as applicable, the outside retail lending area into numerical performance scores, as follows:
Conclusion
Performance score
Outstanding
10
High Satisfactory
7
Low Satisfactory
6
Needs to Improve
3
Substantial Noncompliance
0
b. The FDIC calculates the weighted average of Retail Lending Test Area performance scores for a State or multistate MSA, as applicable, and for the institution (
i.e., performance score for the Retail Lending Test
). For the weighted average for a State or multistate MSA, the FDIC considers facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas in the State or multistate MSA pursuant to § 345.28(c). For the weighted average for the institution, the FDIC considers all of the bank's facility-based assessment areas and retail lending assessment areas and, as applicable, the bank's outside retail lending area. Each Retail Lending Test Area performance score is weighted by the average of the following two ratios:
1. The ratio measuring the share of the bank's deposits in the Retail Lending Test Area, calculated by:
i. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in the Retail Lending Test Area.
ii. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in all Retail Lending Test Areas in the State, in the multistate MSA, or for the institution, as applicable.
iii. Dividing the result of paragraph VIII.b.1.i of this appendix by the result of paragraph VIII.b.1.ii of this appendix.
For a bank that reports deposits data pursuant to § 345.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a Retail Lending Test Area is the total of annual average daily balances of deposits reported by the bank in counties in the Retail Lending Test Area for that year. For a bank that does not report deposits data pursuant to § 345.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a Retail Lending Test Area is the total of deposits assigned to facilities reported by the bank in the Retail Lending Test Area in the FDIC's Summary of Deposits for that year.
2. The ratio measuring the share of the bank's loans in the Retail Lending Test Area, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 345.12, calculated by dividing:
i. The bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and, if a product line for the bank, automobile loans in the Retail Lending Test Area originated or purchased during the evaluation period; by
ii. The bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and, if a product line for the bank, automobile loans in all Retail Lending Test Areas in the State, in the multistate MSA, or for the institution, as applicable, originated or purchased during the evaluation period.
c. The FDIC develops a conclusion corresponding to the conclusion category that is nearest to the performance score for the Retail Lending Test for the State, the multistate MSA, or the institution, as applicable, as follows:
Conclusion
Retail lending test performance score
Outstanding
8.5 or more.
High Satisfactory
6.5 or more but less than 8.5.
Low Satisfactory
4.5 or more but less than 6.5.
Needs to Improve
1.5 or more but less than 4.5.
Substantial Noncompliance
Less than 1.5.
d. The agency considers relevant performance context information provided in § 345.21(d) to inform the FDIC's determination of the bank's Retail Lending Test conclusion for the State, the multistate MSA, or the institution, as applicable.
Example A-16:
A large bank operates in one State only, and has two facility-based assessment areas and one retail lending assessment area in that state and also engages in closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, and small farm lending (but not automobile lending, as it is not a product line for the bank) in its outside retail lending area.
Additionally:
i. Facility-based assessment area 1 (FBAA-1) is associated with 75 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank (based on dollar amount) and 10 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans (based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 345.12). The bank received a “Needs to Improve” (3 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in FBAA-1;
ii. Facility-based assessment area 2 (FBAA-2) is associated with 15 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank and 20 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans (based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 345.12). The bank received a “Low Satisfactory” (6 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in FBAA-2;
iii. The Retail lending assessment area is associated with 8 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank and 68 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans (based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 345.12). The bank received an “Outstanding” (10 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in the retail lending assessment area; and
iv. The bank's outside retail lending area, is associated with 2 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank and 2 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans (based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count as defined in § 345.12). The bank received a “High Satisfactory” (7 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in the outside retail lending area.
Calculating weights:
i. For facility-based assessment area 1: weight = 42.5 percent [(75 percent of deposits + 10 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2];
ii. For facility-based assessment area 2: weight = 17.5 percent [(15 percent of deposits + 20 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2];
iii. For the retail lending assessment area: weight = 38 percent [(8 percent of deposits + 68 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2]; and
iv. For the outside retail lending area: weight = 2 percent [(2 percent of deposits + 2 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2].
Institution Retail Lending Test Performance Score and Conclusion:
Using the relevant points values—“Outstanding” (10 points); “High Satisfactory” (7 points); “Low Satisfactory” (6 points); “Needs to Improve” (3 points); “Substantial Noncompliance” (0 points)—and based on the illustration in this example A-16, the bank's Retail Lending Test performance score for the institution is 6.3 [(0.425 weight × 3 points in facility-based assessment area 1) + (0.175 weight × 6 points in facility-based assessment area 2) + (0.38 weight × 10 points in retail lending assessment area) + (0.02 weight × 7 points in the outside retail lending area)].
A performance score of 6.3 corresponds with the conclusion category “Low Satisfactory,” so the bank's Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion at the institution level is “Low Satisfactory.” Relevant performance context information provided in § 345.21(d) may inform the FDIC's determination of the bank's conclusion at the institution level.
Example A-17:
An intermediate bank operates in a single State, has two facility-based assessment areas, and also engages in closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, and small farm lending (but not automobile lending, as automobile lending is not a product line for the bank) in its outside retail lending area.
Additionally:
i. Facility-based assessment area 1 (FBAA-1) is associated with 60 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank and 30 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans. The bank received an “Outstanding” (10 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in FBAA-1;
ii. Facility-based assessment area 2 (FBAA-2 is) associated with 40 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank and 10 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans. The bank received a “High Satisfactory” (7 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in FBAA-2; and
iii. The bank's outside retail lending area is associated with 0 percent of the deposits in all of the Retail Lending Test Areas of the bank (the bank did not voluntarily collect and maintain depositor location data, so all deposits in the bank are attributed to its branches within facility-based assessment areas) and 60 percent of the bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business
loans, and small farm loans. The bank received a “Needs to Improve” (3 points) Retail Lending Test conclusion in the outside retail lending area.
Calculating weights:
i. For FBAA-1: weight = 45 percent [(60 percent of deposits + 30 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2];
ii. For FBAA-2: weight = 25 percent [(40 percent of deposits + 10 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2]; and
iii. For the outside retail lending area: weight = 30 percent [(0 percent of deposits + 60 percent of closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans)/2].
Institution Retail Lending Test Performance Score and Conclusion:
Using the relevant points values—“Outstanding” (10 points); “High Satisfactory” (7 points); “Low Satisfactory” (6 points); “Needs to Improve” (3 points); “Substantial Noncompliance” (0 points)—and based on the illustration in this example A-17, the bank's recommended Retail Lending Test performance score at the institution level is 7.2 [(0.45 weight × 10 points in FBAA-1) + (0.25 weight × 7 points in FBAA-2) + (0.3 weight × 3 points in the outside retail lending area)].
A performance score of 7.2 corresponds with the conclusion category “High Satisfactory,” so the bank's Retail Lending Test recommended conclusion at the institution level is “High Satisfactory.” Relevant performance context information provided in § 345.21(d) may inform the FDIC's determination of the bank's conclusion at the institution level.

Example A-7.
The applicable benchmark uses a three-year evaluation period. There were 4,000 small business establishments, based upon the sum of the numbers of small business establishments over the years in the evaluation period (1,300 small business establishments in year 1, 1,300 small business establishments in year 2, and 1,400 small business establishments in year 3), in a bank's facility-based assessment area. Of these small business establishments, 500 small business establishments were in low-income census tracts, based upon the sum of the numbers of small business establishments in low-income census tracts over the years in the evaluation period (200 small business establishments in year 1,150 small business in year 2, and 150 small business establishments in year 3). The Geographic Community Benchmark for small business loans in low-income census tracts would be 500 divided by 4,000, or 0.125 (equivalently, 12.5 percent). In addition, 1,000 small business establishments in that facility-based assessment area were in moderate-income census tracts, over the years in the evaluation period (400 small business establishments in year 1,300 small business establishments in year 2, and 300 small business establishments in year 3). The Geographic Community Benchmark for small business loans in moderate-income census tracts would be 1,000 divided by 4,000, or 0.25 (equivalently, 25 percent).

# Appendix B to Part 345—Calculations for the Community Development Tests
This appendix, based on requirements described in §§ 345.24 through 345.26 and 345.28, includes the following sections:
I. Community Development Financing Tests—Calculation Components and Allocation of Community Development Loans and Community Development Investments
II. Community Development Financing Test in § 345.24—Calculations for Metrics, Benchmarks, and Combining Performance Scores
III. Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks in § 345.26—Calculations for Metrics and Benchmarks
IV. Weighting of Conclusions

# I. Community Development Financing Tests—Calculation Components and Allocation of Community Development Loans and Community Development Investments
For purposes of the Community Development Financing Test in § 345.24 and Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks in § 345.26, the FDIC identifies the community development loans and community development investments included in the numerator of the metrics and benchmarks and the deposits or assets included in the denominator of the metrics and benchmarks, as applicable, pursuant to paragraph I.a of this appendix. The FDIC determines whether to include a community development loan or community development investment in the numerator for a particular metric or benchmark pursuant to the allocation provisions in paragraph I.b of this appendix.

Community development loans and community development investments, deposits, and assets included in the community development financing metrics and benchmarks—in general.
The FDIC calculates the community development financing metrics and benchmarks in §§ 345.24 and 345.26 using community development loans and community development investments and deposits or assets, as follows:
1.
Numerator
—i.
Community development loans and community development investments considered.
The FDIC includes community development loans and community development investments originated, purchased, refinanced, or renewed by a depository institution or attributed to a depository institution pursuant to § 345.21(b) and (c) (
e.g.,
an affiliate community development loan) in the numerator of the metrics and benchmarks. The FDIC calculates the annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments by summing the dollar volume of the following community development loans and community development investments for each calendar year in an evaluation period (
i.e., annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments
):
A. The dollar volume of all community development loans originated or purchased and community development investments made, including legally binding commitments to extend credit or legally binding commitments to invest,
1
in that calendar year;
1
The dollar volume of a legally binding commitment to extend credit or legally binding commitment to invest in any given year is: (1) the full dollar volume committed; or (2) if drawn upon, the combined dollar volume of the outstanding commitment and any drawn portion of the commitment.
B. The dollar volume of any increase in the calendar year to an existing community development loan that is refinanced or renewed and in an existing community development investment that is renewed;
C. The outstanding dollar volume of community development loans originated or purchased in previous calendar years and community development investments made in previous calendar years, as of December 31 for each calendar year that the loan or investment remains on the depository institution's balance sheet; and
D. The outstanding dollar volume, less any increase reported in paragraph I.a.1.B of this appendix in the same calendar year, of a community development loan the depository institution refinanced or renewed in a calendar year subsequent to the calendar year of origination or purchase, as of December 31 for each calendar year that the loan remains on the depository institution's balance sheet, and an existing community development investment renewed in a calendar year subsequent to the calendar year of the investment, as of December 31 for each calendar year that the investment remains on the depository institution's balance sheet.
ii.
Community development loan and community development investment allocation.
To calculate the metrics and benchmarks provided in §§ 345.24 and 345.26, the FDIC includes all community development loans and community development investments that are allocated to the specific facility-based assessment area, State, multistate MSA, or nationwide area, respectively, in the numerator for the metric and benchmarks applicable to that geographic area.
See
paragraph I.b of this appendix for the community development financing allocation provisions.
2.
Denominator.
i.
Annual dollar volume of deposits.
For purposes of metrics and benchmarks in § 345.24, the FDIC calculates an annual dollar volume of deposits in a depository institution that is specific to each metric or benchmark for each calendar year in the evaluation period (
i.e., annual dollar volume of deposits
). For a depository institution that collects, maintains, and reports deposits data as provided in § 345.42 or 12 CFR 25.42 or 228.42, the annual dollar volume of deposits is determined using the annual average daily balance of deposits in the depository
institution as provided in statements (
e.g.,
monthly or quarterly statements) based on the deposit location. For a depository institution that does not collect, maintain, and report deposits data as provided in § 345.42 or 12 CFR 25.42 or 228.42, the annual dollar volume of deposits is determined using the deposits assigned to each facility pursuant to the FDIC's Summary of Deposits.
ii.
Annual dollar volume of assets.
For purposes of the metrics and benchmarks in § 345.26, the FDIC calculates an annual dollar volume of assets for each calendar year in the evaluation period (
i.e., the annual dollar volume of assets
). The annual dollar volume of assets is calculated by averaging the assets for each quarter end in the calendar year.
b.
Allocation of community development loans and community development investments.
1.
In general.
For the Community Development Financing Test in § 345.24 and the Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks in § 345.26, the FDIC considers community development loans and community development investments in the evaluation of a bank's performance in a facility-based assessment area, State and multistate MSA, as applicable, and the nationwide area, based on the data provided by the bank pursuant to § 345.42(a)(5)(ii)(E) and the specific location, if available, pursuant to § 345.42(a)(5)(ii)(D). As appropriate, the FDIC may also consider publicly available information and information provided by government or community sources that demonstrates that a community development loan or community development investment benefits or serves a facility-based assessment area, State, or multistate MSA, or the nationwide area.
2. A bank may allocate a community development loan or community development investment as follows:
i. A community development loan or community development investment that benefits or serves only one county, and not any areas beyond that one county, would have the full dollar amount of the activity allocated to that county.
ii. A community development loan or community development investment that benefits or serves multiple counties, a State, a multistate MSA, multiple States, multiple multistate MSAs, or the nationwide area is allocated according to either specific documentation that the bank can provide regarding the dollar amount allocated to each county or based on the geographic scope of the activity, as follows:
A.
Allocation approach if specific documentation is available.
A bank may allocate a community development loan or community development investment or portion of a loan or investment based on documentation that specifies the appropriate dollar volume to assign to each county, such as specific addresses and dollar volumes associated with each address, or other information that indicates the specific dollar volume of the loan or investment that benefits or serves each county.
B.
Allocation approach based on geographic scope of a community development loan or community development investment.
2
In the absence of specific documentation, the FDIC will allocate a community development loan or community development investment based on the geographic scope of the loan or investment as follows:
2
For the purposes of allocating community development loans and community development investments, the FDIC considers low- or moderate-income families to be located in a State or multistate MSA, as applicable, consistent with § 345.28(c).
1.
Allocate at the county level for a loan or investment with a geographic scope of one county;
2.
Allocate at the county level based on the proportion of low- and moderate-income families in each county for a loan or investment with a geographic scope of less than an entire State or multistate MSA;
3.
Allocate at the State or multistate MSA level for a loan or investment with a geographic scope of the entire State or multistate MSA, as applicable;
4.
Allocate at the State or multistate MSA level, as applicable, based on the proportion of low- and moderate-income families in each State or multistate MSA for a loan or investment with a geographic scope of one or more State(s) or multistate MSA(s), but not the entire nation; and
5.
Allocate at the nationwide area level for a loan or investment with a geographic scope of the entire Nation.

# II. Community Development Financing Test in § 345.24—Calculations for Metrics, Benchmarks, and Combining Performance Scores
The calculations for metrics, benchmarks, and combination of performance scores for Community Development Financing Test in § 345.24 are provided in this section. Additional information regarding relevant calculation components is set forth in paragraph I.a of this appendix.
a.
Bank Assessment Area Community Development Financing Metric.
The FDIC calculates the Bank Assessment Area Community Development Financing Metric in § 345.24(b)(1) by:
1. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the facility-based assessment area for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits located in the facility-based assessment area for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph II.a.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.a.2 of this appendix.
Example B-1:
The bank has a three-year evaluation period. The bank's annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a facility-based assessment area are $35,000 (year 1), $25,000 (year 2), and $40,000 (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a facility-based assessment area is therefore $100,000. The bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the facility-based assessment area are $3.1 million (year 1), $3.3 million (year 2), and $3.6 million (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the facility-based assessment is therefore $10 million. For the evaluation period, the Bank Assessment Area Community Development Financing Metric would be $100,000 divided by $10 million, or 0.01 (equivalently, 1 percent).
ER01FE24.072
b.
Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark.
The FDIC calculates the Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark in § 345.24(b)(2)(i) for each facility-based assessment area by:
1. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the facility-based assessment area for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of deposits located in the facility-based assessment area for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph II.b.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.b.2 of this appendix.
Example B-2:
The applicable benchmark uses a three-year evaluation period. The annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve a facility-based assessment area for all large depository institutions are $3.25 million (year 1), $3 million (year 2), and $3.75 million (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the facility-based assessment area conducted by all large depository institutions is therefore $10 million. The annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the facility-based assessment area in all large depository institutions are $330 million (year 1), $330 million (year 2), and $340 million
(year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the facility-based assessment area in all large depository institutions is therefore $1 billion. For the evaluation period, the Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark for the facility-based assessment area would be $10 million divided by $1 billion, or 0.01 (equivalently, 1 percent).
ER01FE24.073
c.
MSA and Nonmetropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmarks.
The FDIC calculates an MSA Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark to be used for each MSA in which the bank has a facility-based assessment area in the MSA. The FDIC calculates a Nonmetropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark to be used for each nonmetropolitan area in which the bank has a facility-based assessment area in the nonmetropolitan area.
1.
MSA Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark.
The FDIC calculates the MSA Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark in § 345.24(b)(2)(ii)(A) by:

The annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve metropolitan areas in the nationwide area conducted by all large depository institutions are $98 billion (year 1), $100 billion (year 2), and $102 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve metropolitan areas in the nationwide area conducted by all large depository institutions is therefore $300 billion. The annual dollar volumes of deposits located in metropolitan areas in the nationwide area in all large depository institutions are $14.9 trillion (year 1), $15 trillion (year 2), and $15.1 trillion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of deposits located in metropolitan areas in the nationwide area in all large depository institutions is therefore $45 trillion. For the evaluation period, the Metropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark would be $300 billion divided by $45 trillion, or 0.007 (equivalently, 0.7 percent).
ER01FE24.074
2.
Nonmetropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark.
The FDIC calculates the Nonmetropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark in § 345.24(b)(2)(ii)(B) by:

The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve nonmetropolitan areas in the nationwide area conducted by all large depository institutions is therefore $10 billion. The annual dollar volumes of deposits located in nonmetropolitan areas in all large depository institutions are $330 billion (year 1), $334 billion (year 2), and $336 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of deposits located in nonmetropolitan areas in the nationwide area in all large depository institutions is therefore $1 trillion. For the evaluation period, the Nonmetropolitan Nationwide Community Development Financing Benchmark would be $10 billion divided by $1 trillion, or 0.01 (equivalently, 1 percent).
ER01FE24.075
d.
Bank State Community Development Financing Metric.

The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the State conducted by a bank is therefore $50 million. The bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the State are $1.5 billion (year 1), $1.6 billion (year 2), and $1.9 billion (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the State is therefore $5 billion. For the evaluation period, the Bank State Community Development Financing Metric would be $50 million divided by $5 billion, or 0.01 (equivalently, 1 percent).
ER01FE24.076
e.
State Community Development Financing Benchmark.
The FDIC calculates the State Community Development Financing Benchmark in § 345.24(c)(2)(ii)(A) by:
1. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve all or part of a State for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing all large depository institutions' annual dollar volume of deposits located in the State for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph II.e.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.e.2 of this appendix.

The FDIC calculates the Nationwide Weighted Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark in § 345.24(e)(2)(ii)(B) by averaging all of the bank's Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmarks (see paragraph II.b of this appendix) in the nationwide area, after weighting each pursuant to paragraph II.o of this appendix.
Example B-13:
The bank has three facility-based assessment areas in the nationwide area (FBAA-1, FBAA-2, and FBAA-3).
• In FBAA-1, the bank's Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark is 2.0 percent. FBAA-1 represents 60 percent of the combined dollar volume of the deposits in the bank in FBAA-1, FBAA-2, and FBAA-3. FBAA-1 represents 40 percent of the bank's combined dollar volume of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in FBAA-1, FBAA-2, and FBAA-3. FBAA-1 represents 60 percent of the bank's number of originated and purchased
closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in FBAA-1, FBAA-2, and FBAA-3.
• In FBAA-2, the bank's Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark is 3.0 percent. FBAA-2 represents 30 percent of the combined dollar volume of the deposits in the bank in FBAA-1, FBAA-2, and FBAA-3. FBAA-2 represents 45 percent of the bank's combined dollar volume of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in FBAA-1, FBAA-2, and FBAA-3. FBAA-2 represents 35 percent of the bank's number of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in FBAA-1, FBAA-2, and FBAA-3.
• In FBAA-3, the bank's Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark is 4.0 percent. FBAA-3 represents 10 percent of the combined dollar volume of the deposits in the bank in FBAA-1, FBAA-2, and FBAA-3. FBAA-3 represents 15 percent of the bank's combined dollar volume of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in FBAA-1, FBAA-2, and FBAA-3. FBAA-3 represents 5 percent of the bank's number of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, and small farm loans in FBAA-1, FBAA-2, and FBAA-3.

Calculating weights for FBAA-2:
○ The percent of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, and small farm lending, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 345.12, for FBAA-2 is 40 percent.
ER01FE24.092
○ The weight for FBAA-2 is 35 percent.
ER01FE24.093
•
Calculating weights for FBAA-3:
○ The percent of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, and small farm lending, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 345.12, for FBAA-3 is 10 percent.
ER01FE24.094
○ The weight for FBAA-3 is 10 percent.
ER01FE24.095
• Applying the calculated weights from FBAA-1, FBAA-2, and FBAA-3:
○ The bank's Nationwide Weighted Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark is 2.55 percent.
(Weight of FBAA-1(0.55) × Benchmark in FBAA-1 (2%)) + (Weight of FBAA-2 (0.35) × Benchmark FBAA-2 (3%)) + (Weight of FBAA-3 (0.10) × Benchmark in FBAA-3 (4%)) = Nationwide Weighted Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark (2.55%)
m.
Bank Nationwide Community Development Investment Metric.
The FDIC calculates the Bank Nationwide Community Development Investment Metric in § 345.24(e)(2)(iii) for the nationwide area by:
1. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of community development investments, excluding mortgage-backed securities, that benefit or serve the nationwide area (which includes all activities within the bank's facility-based assessment areas and outside of its facility-based assessment areas within the nationwide area) for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits located in the nationwide area for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the results of paragraph II.m.1 of this appendix by the results of paragraph II.m.2 of this appendix.
Example B-14:
The bank has a three-year evaluation period. The bank's annual dollar volumes of community development investments (excluding mortgage-backed securities) that benefit or serve the nationwide area are $600 million (year 1), $680 million (year 2), and $720 million (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of community development investments (excluding mortgage-backed securities) that benefit or serve the nationwide area conducted by the bank is therefore $2 billion. The bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the nationwide area are $24 billion (year 1), $27 billion (year 2), and $29 billion (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the nationwide area is therefore $80 billion. For the evaluation period, the Bank Nationwide Community Development Investment Metric would be $2 billion divided by $80 billion, or 0.025 (equivalently, 2.5 percent).
ER01FE24.096
n.
Nationwide Community Development Investment Benchmark.
The FDIC calculates the Nationwide Community Development Investment Benchmark in § 345.24(e)(2)(iv) by:
1. Summing the annual dollar volume of community development investments that benefit or serve all or part of the nationwide area, excluding mortgage-backed securities, for each year in the evaluation period for all large depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years.
2. Summing the annual dollar volume of deposits in the nationwide area for each year in the evaluation period for all large depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph II.n.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.n.2 of this appendix.
Example B-15:
The applicable benchmark uses a three-year evaluation period. The annual dollar volumes of community development investments (excluding mortgage-backed securities) that benefit or serve the nationwide area for all large depository institutions are $350 billion (year 1), $360 billion (year 2), and $390 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development investments (excluding mortgage-backed securities) that benefit or serve the nationwide area conducted by all large depository institutions is therefore $1.1 trillion. The annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the nationwide area in all large depository institutions are $21.9 trillion (year 1), $22 trillion (year 2), and $22.1 trillion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of deposits located in the nationwide area in all large depository institutions is therefore $66 trillion. For the evaluation period, the Nationwide Community Development Investment Benchmark would be $1.1 trillion divided by $66 trillion, or 0.0167 (equivalently, 1.67 percent).
ER01FE24.097
o.
Weighting of benchmarks.
The FDIC calculates a weighted average of the Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmarks for a bank's facility-based assessment areas in each State or multistate MSA, as applicable, or the nationwide area. For the weighted average for a State or multistate MSA, the FDIC considers Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmarks for facility-based assessment areas in the State or multistate MSA pursuant to § 345.28(c). For the weighted average for the nationwide area, the FDIC considers Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmarks for all of the bank's facility-based assessment areas. Each Assessment Area Community Development Financing Benchmark is weighted by the average of the following two ratios:
1. The ratio measuring the share of the deposits in the bank in the facility-based assessment area, calculated by:
i. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in the facility-based assessment area.
ii. Summing, over the years in the evaluation period, the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in all facility-based assessment areas in the State, multistate MSA, or nationwide area, as applicable.
iii. Dividing the result of paragraph II.o.1.i of this appendix by the result of paragraph II.o.1.ii of this appendix.
For a bank that reports deposits data pursuant to § 345.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a facility-based assessment area is the total of annual average daily balances of deposits reported by the bank in counties in the facility-based assessment area for that year. For a bank that does not report deposits data pursuant to § 345.42(b)(3), the bank's annual dollar volume of deposits in a facility-based assessment area is the total of deposits assigned to facilities reported by the bank in the facility-based assessment area in the FDIC's Summary of Deposits for that year.
2. The ratio measuring the share of the bank's loans in the facility-based assessment area, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 345.12, calculated by dividing:
i. The bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and, if a product line for the bank, automobile loans in the facility-based assessment area originated or purchased during the evaluation period; by
ii. The bank's closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, and, if a product line for the bank, automobile loans in all facility-based assessment areas in the State, multistate MSA, or nationwide area, as applicable, originated or purchased during the evaluation period.
p.
Combined score for facility-based assessment area conclusions and the metrics and benchmarks analyses and the impact and responsiveness reviews.
1. As described in § 345.24(c) through (e), the FDIC assigns a conclusion corresponding to the conclusion category that is nearest to the performance score calculated in paragraph p.2.iii of this appendix for a bank's performance under the Community Development Financing Test in each State or multistate MSA, as applicable pursuant to § 345.28(c), and for the institution as follows:
Performance score
Conclusion
8.5 or more
Outstanding.
6.5 or more but less than 8.5
High Satisfactory.
4.5 or more but less than 6.5
Low Satisfactory.
1.5 or more but less than 4.5
Needs to Improve.
Less than 1.5
Substantial Noncompliance.
2. The FDIC bases a Community Development Financing Test combined performance score on the following:
i.
Component one—Weighted average of the bank's performance scores corresponding to facility-based assessment area conclusions.
The FDIC derives a performance score based on a weighted average of the performance scores corresponding to conclusions for facility-based assessment areas in each State or multistate MSA, as applicable, and the nationwide area, calculated pursuant to section IV of this appendix.
ii.
Component two—Bank score for metric and benchmarks analyses and the impact and responsiveness reviews.
For each State or multistate MSA, as applicable, and the nationwide area, the FDIC determines a performance score (as shown in paragraph IV.a of this appendix) corresponding to a conclusion category by considering the relevant metric and benchmarks and a review of the impact and responsiveness of the bank's community development loans and community development investments. In the nationwide area, for large banks that had assets greater than $10 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, the FDIC also considers whether the bank's performance under the Nationwide Community Development Investment Metric, compared to the Community Development Investment Benchmark, contributes positively to the bank's Community Development Financing Test conclusion.
iii.
Combined score.
The FDIC associates the performance score calculated pursuant to this paragraph II.p.2.iii with a conclusion category. The FDIC derives the combined performance score corresponding to a conclusion category as follows:
A. The FDIC calculates the average of two components to determine weighting:
1.
The percentage, calculated using the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 345.12, of the bank's total originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, and automobile lending, as applicable, in its facility-based assessment areas out of all of the bank's originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, and automobile lending, as applicable, in the State or multistate MSA, as applicable, or the nationwide area during the evaluation period; and
2.
The percentage of the total dollar volume of deposits in its facility-based assessment areas out of all of the deposits in the bank in the State or multistate MSA, as applicable, or the nationwide area during the
evaluation period. For purposes of this paragraph II.p.2.iii.A.
2,
“deposits” excludes deposits reported under § 345.42(b)(3)(ii).
B. If the average is:
1.
At least 80 percent, then component one receives a 50 percent weight and component two receives a 50 percent weight.
2.
At least 60 percent but less than 80 percent, then component one receives a 40 percent weight and component two receives a 60 percent weight.
3.
At least 40 percent but less than 60 percent, then component one receives a 30 percent weight and component two receives a 70 percent weight.
4.
At least 20 percent but less than 40 percent, then component one receives a 20 percent weight and component two receives an 80 percent weight.
5.
Below 20 percent, then component one receives a 10 percent weight and component two receives a 90 percent weight.

Example B-16:
• Assume that the weighted average of the bank's performance scores corresponding to its facility-based assessment area conclusions nationwide is 7.5. Assume further that the bank score for the metrics and benchmarks analysis and the review of the impact and responsiveness of the bank's community development loans and community development investments nationwide is 6.
• Assume further that 95 percent of the deposits in the bank and 75 percent of the bank's originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, and automobile loans (calculated using the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 345.12) during the evaluation period are associated with its facility-based assessment areas.
• The FDIC assigns weights for component one and component two based on the share of deposits in the bank and the share of the bank's originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, and automobile lending, calculated using the combination of loan dollars and loan count, as defined in § 345.12, associated with its facility-based assessment areas: (95 percent of deposits + 75 percent of originated and purchased closed-end home mortgage lending, small business lending, small farm lending, and automobile lending, based on the combination of loan dollars and loan count)/2 = 85 percent, which is between 80 percent and 100 percent.
• Thus, the weighted average of the bank's facility-based assessment area conclusions in the nationwide area (component one—paragraph II.p.2.i of this appendix) receives a weight of 50 percent, and the metrics and benchmarks analysis and the review of the impact and responsiveness of the bank's community development loans and community development investments in the nationwide area (component two—paragraph II.p.2.ii of this appendix) receives a weight of 50 percent.
• Using the point values—“Outstanding” (10 points); “High Satisfactory” (7 points); “Low Satisfactory” (6 points); “Needs to Improve” (3 points); “Substantial Noncompliance” (0 points)—the bank's Community Development Financing Test conclusion at the institution level is a “High Satisfactory”: (0.50 weight × 7.5 points for the weighted average of the performance scores corresponding to the bank's facility-based assessment area conclusions nationwide) + (0.50 weight × 6 points for the bank score for metrics and benchmarks analysis and review of the impact and responsiveness of the bank's community development loans and community development investments nationwide) results in a performance score of 6.75, which is closest to the point value (7) associated with “High Satisfactory.”

# III. Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks in § 345.26—Calculations for Metrics and Benchmarks
The calculations for metrics and benchmarks for Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks in § 345.26 are provided in this section. Additional information regarding relevant calculation components is set forth in paragraph I.a of this appendix.
a.

3. Dividing the result of paragraph III.b.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph III.b.2 of this appendix.
c.
Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Financing Benchmark.
The FDIC calculates the Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Financing Benchmark by:
1. Summing the annual dollar volume of community development loans and community development investments of all depository institutions that reported pursuant to § 345.42(b) or 12 CFR 25.42(b) or 228.42(b) that benefit or serve all or part of the nationwide area for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing the annual dollar volume of assets of all depository institutions that reported community development loans and community development investments pursuant to § 345.42(b) or 12 CFR 25.42(b) or 228.42(b) for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph III.c.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph III.c.2 of this appendix.
d.
Limited Purpose Bank Community Development Investment Metric.
The FDIC calculates the Limited Purpose Bank Nationwide Community Development Investment Metric, provided in § 345.26(f)(2)(iii), for the nationwide area by:
1. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of community development investments, excluding mortgage-backed securities, that benefit or serve the nationwide area for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing the bank's annual dollar volume of assets for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the results of paragraph III.d.1 of this appendix by the results of paragraph III.d.2 of this appendix.
Example B-17:
The bank has a three-year evaluation period. The bank's annual dollar volumes of community development investments (excluding mortgage-backed securities) that benefit or serve the nationwide area are $62 million (year 1), $65 million (year 2), and $73 million (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of community development investments that benefit or serve the nationwide area conducted by the bank is therefore $200 million. The bank's annual dollar volumes of assets in the bank are $2.4 billion (year 1), $2.7 billion (year 2), and $2.9 billion (year 3). The sum of the bank's annual dollar volumes of assets in the bank over the evaluation period is therefore $8 billion. For the evaluation period, the Bank Nationwide Community Development Investment Metric would be $200 million divided by $8 billion, or 0.025 (equivalently, 2.5 percent).
ER01FE24.098
e.
Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Investment Benchmark.
The FDIC calculates the Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Investment Benchmark, provided in § 345.26(f)(2)(iv), by:
1. Summing the annual dollar volume of community development investments, excluding mortgage-backed securities, of all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion, as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, that
benefit or serve all or part of the nationwide area for each year in the evaluation period.
2. Summing the annual dollar volume of assets of all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion, as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, for each year in the evaluation period.
3. Dividing the result of paragraph III.e.1 of this appendix by the result of paragraph III.e.2 of this appendix.
Example B-18:
The applicable benchmark uses a three-year evaluation period. The annual dollar volumes of community development investments (excluding mortgage-backed securities) that benefit or serve the nationwide area for all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion are $35 billion (year 1), $37 million (year 2), and $38 billion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of community development investments that benefit or serve the nationwide area conducted by all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion is therefore $110 billion. The annual dollar volumes of assets in all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion are $1.8 trillion (year 1), $2.1 trillion (year 2), and $2.1 trillion (year 3). The sum of the annual dollar volumes of assets in all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion is therefore $6 trillion. For the evaluation period, the Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Investment Benchmark would be $110 billion divided by $6 trillion, or 0.0183 (equivalently, 1.83 percent).
