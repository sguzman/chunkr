§ 151.2020
Vessels in innocent passage.
A foreign vessel that is merely traversing the territorial sea of the United States (unless bound for, entering or departing a U.S. port or navigating the internal waters of the U.S.) does not fall within the applicability of this subpart.
§ 151.2025
Ballast water management requirements.
(a) The master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of a vessel equipped with ballast tanks that operates in the waters of the United States must employ one of the following ballast water management methods:
(1) Install and operate a ballast water management system (BWMS) that has been approved by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR part 162. The BWMS must be installed in accordance with § 151.2035(b) of this subpart. Following installation, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel subject to this subpart must properly maintain the BWMS in accordance with all manufacturer specifications. Unless otherwise expressly provided for in this subpart, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of vessels employing a Coast Guard-approved BWMS must meet the applicable ballast water discharge standard (BWDS), found in § 151.2030 of
this subpart, at all times of discharge into the waters of the United States.
(2) Use only water from a U.S. public water system (PWS), as defined in 40 CFR 141.2, that meets the requirements of 40 CFR parts 141 and 143 as ballast water. Vessels using water from a PWS as ballast must maintain a record of which PWS they received the water from as well as a receipt, invoice, or other documentation from the PWS indicating that water came from that system. Furthermore, they must certify that they have met the conditions in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable, and describe in the BWM plan the procedures to be used to ensure compliance with those conditions, and thereafter document such compliance in the BW record book. Vessels using water from a PWS must use such water exclusively unless the usage is in accordance with § 151.2040 of this subpart. Vessels using PWS water as ballast must have either—
(i) Previously cleaned the ballast tanks (including removing all residual sediments) and not subsequently introduced ambient water; or
(ii) Never introduced ambient water to those tanks and supply lines.
(3) Perform complete ballast water exchange in an area 200 nautical miles from any shore prior to discharging ballast water, unless the vessel is required to employ an approved BWMS per the schedule found in § 151.2035(b) of this subpart. An alternate management system (AMS) that meets the requirements of § 151.2026 of this subpart may also be used, so long as it was installed on the vessel prior to the date that the vessel is required to comply with the BWDS in accordance with § 151.2035(b) of this subpart. If using an AMS, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel subject to this subpart may employ the AMS for no longer than 5 years from the date they would otherwise be required to comply with the BWDS in accordance with § 151.2035(b) of this subpart;
(4) Do not discharge ballast water into waters of the United States.
(5) Discharge to a facility onshore or to another vessel for purposes of treatment. Any vessel owner/operator discharging ballast water to a facility onshore or to another vessel must ensure that all vessel piping and supporting infrastructure up to the last manifold or valve immediately before the dock manifold connection of the receiving facility or similar appurtenance on a reception vessel prevents untreated ballast water from being discharged into waters of the United States.
(b) Requests for approval of BWMS must be submitted to the Commanding Officer (MSC), Attn: Marine Safety Center, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7430, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7430, or by email to
msc@uscg.mil,
in accordance with 46 CFR part 162.
(c) A vessel engaged in the foreign export of Alaskan North Slope Crude Oil must comply with §§ 151.2060 and 151.2070 of this subpart, as well as with the provisions of 15 CFR 754.2(j)(1)(iii). Section 15 CFR 754.2(j)(1)(iii) requires a mandatory program of deep water ballast exchange unless doing so would endanger the safety of the vessel or crew.
(d) This subpart does not authorize the discharge of oil or noxious liquid substances (NLS) in a manner prohibited by United States or international laws or regulations. Ballast water carried in any tank containing a residue of oil, NLS, or any other pollutant must be discharged in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
(e) This subpart does not affect or supersede any requirement or prohibition pertaining to the discharge of ballast water into the waters of the United States under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 to 1376).
(f) This subpart does not affect or supersede any requirement or prohibition pertaining to the discharge of ballast water into the waters of the United States under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1431
et seq.
).
(g) Vessels with installed BWMS for testing and evaluation by an Independent Laboratory in accordance with the requirements of 46 CFR 162.060-10 and 46 CFR 162.060-28 will be deemed to be in compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

§ 151.2040
Discharge of ballast water in extraordinary circumstances.
(a) The Coast Guard will allow the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of a vessel that cannot practicably meet the requirements of § 151.2025(a) of this subpart, either because its voyage does not take it into waters 200 nautical miles or greater from any shore for a sufficient length of time and the vessel retains ballast water onboard or because the master of the vessel has identified safety or stability concerns, to discharge ballast water in areas other than the Great Lakes and the Hudson River north of the George Washington Bridge.
(1) The Coast Guard will not allow such a discharge if the vessel is required to have a Coast Guard-approved ballast water management system (BWMS) per the implementation schedule found in § 151.2035(b) of this subpart.
(2) If the Coast Guard allows the discharge of ballast water as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel must discharge only that amount of ballast water operationally necessary to ensure the safety of the vessel for cargo operations.
(3) Ballast water records must be made available to the local Captain of the Port (COTP) upon request.
(4) Vessels on a voyage to the Great Lakes or the Hudson River north of the George Washington Bridge must comply with the requirements of 33 CFR 151.1515.
(b) If the installed BWMS required by this subpart stops operating properly during a voyage, or the vessel's BWM method is unexpectedly unavailable, the person directing the movement of the vessel must ensure that the problem is reported to the nearest COTP or District Commander as soon as practicable. The vessel may continue to the
next port of call, subject to the directions of the COTP or District Commander, as provided by part 160 of this chapter.
(1) The Coast Guard will normally allow a vessel that cannot practicably meet the requirements of § 151.2025(a)(1) of this subpart because its installed BWMS is inoperable, or the vessel's BWM method is unexpectedly unavailable, to employ one of the other ballast water management (BWM) methods listed in § 151.2025(a) of this subpart.
(2) If the master of the vessel determines that the vessel cannot employ other BWM methods due to the voyage or safety concerns listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the Coast Guard will normally allow the vessel to discharge ballast water in areas other than the Great Lakes and the Hudson River north of the George Washington Bridge.
(3) If the Coast Guard approves such an allowance, the vessel must discharge only that amount of ballast water operationally necessary to ensure the safety and stability of the vessel for cargo operations. Ballast water records must be made available to the local COTP upon request.
(c) Nothing in this subpart relieves the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of a vessel of any responsibility, including ensuring the safety and stability of the vessel and the safety of the crew and passengers.
§ 151.2050
Additional requirements—nonindigenous species reduction practices.
The master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of any vessel equipped with ballast water tanks that operates in the waters of the United States must follow these practices:
(a) Avoid the discharge or uptake of ballast water in areas within, or that may directly affect, marine sanctuaries, marine preserves, marine parks, or coral reefs.
(b) Minimize or avoid uptake of ballast water in the following areas and situations:
(1) Areas known to have infestations or populations of harmful organisms and pathogens (e.g., toxic algal blooms).
(2) Areas near sewage outfalls.
(3) Areas near dredging operations.
(4) Areas where tidal flushing is known to be poor or times when a tidal stream is known to be turbid.
(5) In darkness, when bottom-dwelling organisms may rise up in the water column.
(6) Where propellers may stir up the sediment.
(7) Areas with pods of whales, convergence zones, and boundaries of major currents.
(c) Clean the ballast tanks regularly to remove sediments. Sediments must be disposed of in accordance with local, State, and Federal regulations.
(d) Discharge only the minimal amount of ballast water essential for vessel operations while in the waters of the United States.
(e) Rinse anchors and anchor chains when the anchor is retrieved to remove organisms and sediments at their places of origin.
(f) Remove fouling organisms from the vessel's hull, piping, and tanks on a regular basis and dispose of any removed substances in accordance with local, State and Federal regulations.
(g) Maintain a ballast water management (BWM) plan that has been developed specifically for the vessel and that will allow those responsible for the plan's implementation to understand and follow the vessel's BWM strategy and comply with the requirements of this subpart. The plan must include—
(1) Detailed safety procedures;
(2) Actions for implementing the mandatory BWM requirements and practices;
(3) Detailed fouling maintenance and sediment removal procedures;
(4) Procedures for coordinating the shipboard BWM strategy with Coast Guard authorities;
(5) Identification of the designated officer(s) in charge of ensuring that the plan is properly implemented;
(6) Detailed reporting requirements and procedures for ports and places in the United States where the vessel may visit; and
(7) A translation of the plan into English, French, or Spanish if the vessel's working language is another language.
(h) Train the master, operator, person in charge, and crew on the application of ballast water and sediment management and treatment procedures.
(i) When discharging ballast water to a reception facility in the United States, discharge only to reception facilities that have an NPDES permit to discharge ballast water.
§ 151.2055
Deviation from planned voyage.
As long as ballast water exchange (BWE) is an allowable ballast water management option under §§ 151.2025 and 151.2035 of this subpart, the Coast Guard will not require a vessel to deviate from its voyage or delay the voyage in order to conduct BWE. A vessel may be required to deviate from its voyage or delay the voyage if BWE is directed by a Captain of the Port pursuant to § 151.2040(b) of this subpart.
§ 151.2060
Reporting requirements.
(a) Ballast water reporting requirements exist for each vessel subject to this subpart bound for ports or places of the United States regardless of whether a vessel operated outside of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), unless exempted in § 151.2015 of this subpart.

# Subpart F—Response Plans for Oil Facilities

# Source:
CGD 91-036, 61 FR 7917, Feb. 29, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
§ 154.1010
Purpose.
This subpart establishes oil spill response plan requirements for all marine transportation-related (MTR) facilities (hereafter also referred to as facilities) that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm or significant and substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone. The development of a response plan prepares the facility owner or operator to respond to an oil spill. These requirements specify criteria to be used during the planning process to determine the appropriate response resources. The specific criteria for response resources and their arrival times are not performance standards. The criteria are based on a set of assumptions that may not exist during an actual oil spill incident.
§ 154.1015
Applicability.
(a) This subpart applies to all MTR facilities that because of their location could reasonably be expected to cause at least substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone.
(b) The following MTR facilities that handle, store, or transport oil, in bulk, could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines and are classified as substantial harm MTR facilities:
(1) Fixed MTR onshore facilities capable of transferring oil to or from a
vessel with a capacity of 250 barrels or more and deepwater ports;
(2) Mobile MTR facilities used or intended to be used to transfer oil to or from a vessel with a capacity of 250 barrels or more; and
(3) Those MTR facilities specifically designated as substantial harm facilities by the COTP under § 154.1016.
(c) The following MTR facilities that handle, store, or transport oil in bulk could not only reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm, but also significant and substantial harm, to the environment by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone and are classified as significant and substantial harm MTR facilities:
(1) Deepwater ports, and fixed MTR onshore facilities capable of transferring oil to or from a vessel with a capacity of 250 barrels or more except for facilities that are part of a non-transportation-related fixed onshore facility with a storage capacity of less than 42,000 gallons; and
(2) Those MTR facilities specifically designated as significant and substantial harm facilities by the COTP under § 154.1016.
(d) An MTR facility owner or operator who believes the facility is improperly classified may request review and reclassification in accordance with § 154.1075.
§ 154.1016
Facility classification by COTP.
(a) The COTP may upgrade the classification of:
(1) An MTR facility not specified in § 154.1015 (b) or (c) to a facility that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment; or
(2) An MTR facility specified in § 154.1015(b) to a facility that could reasonably be expected to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment.
(b) The COTP may downgrade, the classification of:
(1) An MTR facility specified in § 154.1015(c) to a facility that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment; or
(2) An MTR facility specified in § 154.1015(b) to a facility that could not reasonably be expected to cause substantial, or significant and substantial harm to the environment.
(3) The COTP will consider downgrading an MTR facility's classification only upon receiving a written request for a downgrade of classification from the facility's owner or operator.
(c) When changing a facility classification the COTP may, as appropriate, consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to: Type and quantity of oils handled in bulk; facility spill history; age of facility; proximity to public and commercial water supply intakes; proximity to navigable waters based on the definition of navigable waters in 33 CFR 2.36; and proximity to fish and wildlife and sensitive environments.

(a) The response plan must use the appropriate criteria in this section to develop the worst case discharge.
(b) For the MTR segment of a facility, not less than—
(1) Where applicable, the loss of the entire capacity of all in-line and break out tank(s) needed for the continuous operation of the pipelines used for the purposes of handling or transporting oil, in bulk, to or from a vessel regardless of the presence of secondary containment; plus
(2) The discharge from all piping carrying oil between the marine transfer manifold and the non-transportation-related portion of the facility. The discharge from each pipe is calculated as follows: The maximum time to discover the release from the pipe in hours, plus the maximum time to shut down flow from the pipe in hours (based on historic discharge data or the best estimate in the absence of historic discharge data for the facility) multiplied by the maximum flow rate expressed in barrels per hour (based on the maximum relief valve setting or maximum system pressure when relief valves are not provided) plus the total line drainage volume expressed in barrels for the pipe between the marine manifold and the non-transportation-related portion of the facility; and
(c) For a mobile facility it means the loss of the entire contents of the container in which the oil is stored or transported.

(2) The response resources must be evaluated considering limitations for the COTP zones in which the facility operates, including but not limited to—
(i) Ice conditions;
(ii) Debris;
(iii) Temperature ranges;
(iv) Weather-related visibility; and
(v) Other appropriate environmental conditions as determined by the COTP.
(3) The COTP may reclassify a specific body of water or location within the COTP zone. Any reclassifications will be identified by the COTP in the applicable ACP. Reclassifications may be to—
(i) A more stringent operating environment if the prevailing wave conditions exceed the significant wave height criteria during more than 35 percent of the year; or
(ii) A less stringent operating environment if the prevailing wave conditions do not exceed the significant wave height criteria for the less stringent operating environment during more than 35 percent of the year.
(b) Response equipment must—
(1) Meet or exceed the operating criteria listed in Table 1 of appendix C of this part;

(4) The COTP may determine that mobilizing response resources to an area beyond the response times indicated in this paragraph invalidates the response plan. In this event, the COTP may impose additional operational restrictions (e.g., limitations on the number of transfers at a facility), or, at the COTP's discretion, the facility may operate with temporarily modified response plan development and evaluation criteria (e.g., modified response times, alternate response resources, etc.).
(e) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must identify the response resources that are available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a)(1)(4), to respond to the worst case discharge volume of petroleum oil to the maximum extent practicable.
(1) The location of these response resources must be suitable to meet the response times identified in paragraph (f) of this section for the applicable geographic area(s) of operation and response tier.
(2) The response resources must be appropriate for—
(i) The volume of the facility's worst case discharge;
(ii) Group(s) of petroleum oil as identified in § 154.1020 that are handled, stored, or transported by the facility; and
(iii) The geographic area(s) in which the facility operates.
(3) The response resources must include sufficient boom, oil recovery devices, and storage capacity to recover the worst case discharge planning volumes.
(4) The guidelines in appendix C of this part must be used for calculating the quantity of response resources required to respond at each tier to the worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable.

must be capable of operating in waters of 6 feet or less depth.
(i) Offshore—10 percent.
(ii) Nearshore/inland/Great Lakes/rivers and canals—20 percent.
(6) The COTP may determine that mobilizing response resources to an area beyond the response times indicated in this paragraph invalidates the response plan. In this event, the COTP may impose additional operational restrictions (e.g., limitations on the number of transfers at a facility), or, at the COTP's discretion, the facility may be permitted to operate with temporarily modified response plan development and evaluation criteria (e.g., modified response times, alternate response resources, etc.).
(f) Response equipment identified in a response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must be capable of arriving on scene within the times specified in this paragraph for the applicable response tier in a higher volume port area, Great Lakes, and in other areas. Response times for these tiers from the time of discovery of a discharge are—

Observation personnel must be trained in:
(i) The protocols of oil-spill reporting and assessment, including estimation of slick size, thickness, and quantity; and
(ii) The use of assessment techniques in ASTM F1779-08 (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 154.106), and familiar with the use of other guides, such as NOAA's “Open Water Oil Identification Job Aid for Aerial Observation,” and NOAA's “Characteristic Coastal Habitats” guide (available on the Internet at
http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/
use the following links in the order presented: Home|Emergency Response|Responding to Oil Spills).
(k) A response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Group I through Group IV petroleum oils must
identify response resources with firefighting capability. The owner or operator of a facility that does not have adequate firefighting resources located at the facility or that can not rely on sufficient local firefighting resources must identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a)(1)-(4), the availability of adequate firefighting resources. The response plan must also identify an individual located at the facility to work with the fire department for petroleum oil fires. This individual shall also verify that sufficient well-trained firefighting resources are available within a reasonable time to respond to a worst case discharge. The individual may be the qualified individual as defined in § 154.1020 and identified in the response plan or another appropriate individual located at the facility.
(l) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Groups I through IV petroleum oils must identify equipment and required personnel available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a) (1)-(4), to protect fish and wildlife and sensitive environments.
(1) Except as set out in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the identified response resources must include the quantities of boom sufficient to protect fish and wildlife and sensitive environments as required by § 154.1035(b)(4).
(2) The resources and response methods identified in a facility response plan must be consistent with the required resources and response methods to be used in fish and wildlife and sensitive environments, contained in the appropriate ACP. Facility owners or operators shall ensure that their response plans are in accordance with the ACP in effect 6 months prior to initial plan submission or the annual plan review required under § 154.1065(a). Facility owners or operators are not required to, but may at their option, conform to an ACP which is less than 6 months old at the time of plan submission.
(m) The response plan for a facility that handles, stores, or transports Groups I through IV petroleum oils must identify an oil spill removal organization(s) with response resources that are available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a) (1)-(4), to effect a shoreline cleanup operation commensurate with the quantity of emulsified petroleum oil to be planned for in shoreline cleanup operations.
(1) Except as required in paragraph (l)(2) of this section, the shoreline cleanup response resources required must be determined as described in appendix C of this part.
(2) The resources and response methods identified in a facility response plan must be consistent with the required shoreline cleanup resources and methods contained in the appropriate ACP. Facility owners or operators shall ensure that their response plans are in accordance with the ACP in effect 6 months prior to initial plan submission or the annual plan review required under § 154.1065(a). Facility owners or operators are not required to, but may at their option, conform to an ACP which is less than 6 months old at the time of plan submission.
(n) Appendix C of this part describes the procedures to determine the maximum extent practicable quantity of response resources that must be identified and available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a) (1)-(4), for the maximum most probable discharge volume, and for each worst case discharge response tier.
(1) Included in appendix C of this part is a cap that recognizes the practical and technical limits of response capabilities that an individual facility owner or operator can be expected to contract for in advance.
(2) Table 5 in appendix C of this part lists the caps that apply in February 18, 1993, and February 18, 1998. Depending on the quantity and type of petroleum oil handled by the facility and the facility's geographic area of operations, the resource capability caps in this table may be reached. The owner or operator of a facility whose estimated recovery capacity exceeds the applicable contracting caps in Table 5 shall identify sources of additional equipment equal to twice the cap listed in Tiers 1, 2, and 3 or the amount necessary to reach the calculated planning
volume, whichever is lower. The identified resources must be capable of arriving on scene not later than the Tier 1, 2, and 3 response times in this section. No contract is required. While general listings of available response equipment may be used to identify additional sources, a response plan must identify the specific sources, locations, and quantities of equipment that a facility owner or operator has considered in his or her planning. When listing Coast Guard classified oil spill removal organization(s) which have sufficient removal capacity to recover the volume above the response capability cap for the specific facility, as specified in Table 5 in appendix C of this part, it is not necessary to list specific quantities of equipment.
(o) The Coast Guard will continue to evaluate the environmental benefits, cost efficiency and practicality of increasing mechanical recovery capability requirements. This continuing evaluation is part of the Coast Guard's long term commitment to achieving and maintaining an optimum mix of oil spill response capability across the full spectrum of response modes. As best available technology demonstrates a need to evaluate or change mechanical recovery capacities, a review of cap increases and other requirements contained within this subpart may be performed. Any changes in the requirements of this section will occur through a public notice and comment process. During this review, the Coast Guard will determine if established caps remain practicable and if increased caps will provide any benefit to oil spill recovery operations. The review will include, at least, an evaluation of:
(1) Best available technologies for containment and recovery;
(2) Oil spill tracking technology;
(3) High rate response techniques;
(4) Other applicable response technologies; and
(5) Increases in the availability of private response resources.

Facility requirements for vessel vapor overpressure and vacuum protection.
In this section, the requirements of having a flame arrester or a flame screen at the opening of a pressure relief valve or a vacuum relief valve apply only to facilities collecting vapors of flammable, combustible, or non-high flash point liquid cargoes.
(a) A facility's vapor control system (VCS) must have the capacity for collecting cargo vapor at a rate of not less than the facility's maximum liquid transfer rate for cargoes that are vapor controlled plus the vapor growth for the cargoes and any inerting, diluting, or enriching gas that may be added to the system. Vapor growth must be considered as 25 percent of the cargo's saturated vapor pressure in pounds per square inch absolute (psia) at 115 °F, divided by 12.5 psia (the vapor pressure of gasoline at 115 °F), times the facility's maximum liquid transfer rate, unless there is experimental data for actual vapor growth for turbulent transferring under the most severe conditions for vapor growth. If the cargo is transferred at temperatures above 115 °F, the cargo's true vapor pressure (in psia) at the transferring temperature must be used when determining the vapor growth.
(b) A facility VCS must be designed to prevent the pressure in a vessel's cargo tanks from going below 80 percent of the highest setting of any of the vessel's vacuum relief valves or exceeding 80 percent of the lowest setting of any of the vessel's pressure relief valves for a non-inerted tank vessel. A facility VCS also must be designed to prevent the pressure in a vessel's cargo tanks from going below 0.2 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) or exceeding 80 percent of the lowest setting of any of the vessel's pressure relief valves for an inerted tank vessel. The system must sustain the pressure in the vessel's cargo tanks within this range at any cargo transfer rate less than or equal to the maximum transfer rate determined at the pre-transfer conference.
(c) The pressure measured at the facility vapor connection must be corrected for pressure drops across the vessel's vapor collection system, vapor collection hose or arm, and vapor line up to the location of the pressure sensor.

the facility vapor connection exceeds either—
(1) The pressure corresponding to the upper pressure determined in paragraph (b) of this section; or
(2) A lower pressure agreed upon at the pre-transfer conference.
(e) If a facility draws vapor from a vessel with a vapor-moving device, the facility vapor connection must have a pressure-sensing device, which activates an alarm meeting 33 CFR 154.2100(e) when the pressure at the facility vapor connection falls below either—
(1) The pressure corresponding to the lower pressure determined in paragraph (b) of this section; or
(2) A higher pressure agreed upon at the pre-transfer conference.
(f) The facility vapor connection must have a pressure-sensing device, independent of the device used to activate the alarm required by paragraph (d) of this section, meeting the installation requirements of paragraph (h) of this section, which activates the emergency shutdown system required by 33 CFR 154.550 when the pressure at the facility vapor connection exceeds the lower of the following:

(2) A pressure corresponding to 90 percent of the setting of the pressure relief valve at the facility vapor connection, if the facility vapor connection is installed with a pressure relief valve; or
(3) A lower pressure than the pressure in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section that is agreed upon at the pre-transfer conference.
(g) If a facility draws vapors from a vessel with a vapor-moving device, the facility vapor connection must have a pressure-sensing device, independent of the device used to activate the alarm required by paragraph (e) of this section, which closes the remotely operated cargo vapor shutoff valve required by 33 CFR 154.2101(a) when the vacuum at the facility vapor connection is more than the higher (lesser vacuum) of the following:
(1) A vacuum corresponding to 90 percent of the vessel's highest vacuum relief valve setting;
(2) A vacuum corresponding to 90 percent of the setting of the vacuum relief valve at the facility vapor connection, if the facility vapor connection is installed with a vacuum relief valve; or
(3) A lesser vacuum than the vacuum in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section that is agreed upon at the pre-transfer conference.
(h) The pressure-sensing devices required by paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section must be located in the vapor collection line between the facility vapor connection and the following:
(1) Any isolation valve, unless an interlock is provided that prevents operation of the system when the isolation valve is closed; and
(2) Any components that could plug and cause a blockage in the vapor line.
(i) A pressure-indicating device must be provided that displays the pressure in the vapor collection line between the facility vapor connection and any isolation valve or any devices which could cause a blockage in the vapor line.
(j) If a facility draws vapor from the vessel with a vapor-moving device capable of drawing more than 1 pound per square inch (psi) vacuum, a vacuum relief valve must be installed in the vapor collection line between the vapor-moving device and the facility vapor connection, which—

vapor piping, such as an undersea pipeline from a vessel moored offshore, before reaching the first pressure sensor and vacuum relief valve, the vacuum relief valve may be set at a vacuum greater than 1 psi vacuum, provided the pressure controls take into account the pressure drop across the vessel's vapor collection system, any vapor collection hoses, and the vapor piping as a function of the actual transfer rate.
(l) If the pressure in the vapor collection system can exceed 1.5 psig during a malfunction of a pressure regulator or control valve in an inerting, enriching, or diluting system, a pressure relief valve must—
(1) Be located between where the inerting, enriching, or diluting gas is introduced into the vapor collection system and the facility vapor connection;

§ 154.2104
Pigging system.
(a) If a pigging system is used to clear cargo in the cargo lines to the tank vessel while the vessel is connected to the facility vapor control system (VCS), the pigging system must be designed with the following safety features:
(1) A bypass loop installed in the main liquid cargo line that contains the pig-receiving device, through which all the liquid flow is channeled during pigging operations. The pig must act as a seal to separate the vessel from the compressed inert gas that is used to propel it as the pig travels from the pig launcher to the pig-receiving device;
(2) A mechanism for restricting liquid and gas flow so that the vessel, personnel, and environment are not endangered. The compressed inert gas flow capacity that this mechanism secures must not be more than 95 percent of the combined capacity of all vessel and facility VCS relief valves located upstream of the facility's remotely operated cargo vapor shutoff valve required by 33 CFR 154.2101(a);

(d) The response time (RT) test required by 33 CFR 154.2180 must be performed once every quarter and documented as shown in Form 154.2181(d) of this section, to determine the RT which is the largest average response time in the upscale or downscale direction.
(1) For systems that normally operate below 20 percent of calibrated range, only a span (upscale) test is required.
(2) Record the span (upscale) value, zero (downscale) cylinder gas value, and stable, initial process-measured variable value.
(3) Determine the step change, which is equal to the average difference between the initial process-measured variable value and the average final stable cylinder gas-measured value.
(4) To determine both upscale and downscale step change intervals—
(i) Inject span (or zero) cylinder gas into the sample system as close to the sample probe as possible. Existing systems that inject the gas at the analyzer box do not need to be modified. However, the gas transit time between the analyzer box and the sample probe must be taken into account;
(ii) Allow the analyzer to stabilize and record the stabilized value. A stable reading is achieved when the concentration reading deviates less than 6 percent from the measured average
concentration in 6 minutes or if it deviates less than 2 percent of the monitor's span value in 1 minute;
(iii) Stop the span (or zero) gas flow, allow the monitor to stabilize back to the measured variable value, and record the stabilized value; and
(iv) Repeat this procedure a total of three times and subtract the average final monitor reading from the average starting monitor value to determine the average upscale (or downscale) step change.
(5) Determine the response time, which is equal to the elapsed time at which 95 percent of the step change occurred.
(i) To find this value, take 5 percent of the average step change value and subtract the result from the cylinder gas analyzed value as shown in the following equation:
95% step change value = cylinder gas value − (0.05 × avg. step change)
(ii) Inject span (or zero) cylinder gas into the sample system as close to the sample probe as possible, and measure the time it takes to reach the 95 percent step change value.
(iii) Repeat the previous step (paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section) a total of three times each with span and zero cylinder gas to determine average upscale and downscale response times.
(iv) Compare the response times achieved for the upscale and downscale tests. The longer of these two times equals the response time for the analyzer.

(e) The sample system bias (SSB) test required by 33 CFR 154.2180 must be performed once every quarter and documented, to establish that the system has no additional influence on the measurement being made by the analyzer.
(1) Conduct a close CE test in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, by injecting calibration gas as close as possible to the analyzer, eliminating as much of the sample system components as possible, while still simulating the normal source operating conditions.
(2) If system integrity is maintained, and it has not become contaminated, the difference between the close and standard CE tests should be the same.

(2) Total hydrocarbon analyzers must not deviate from the reference value of the zero- or high-level calibration gas by more than 1 percent of full scale; and
(3) Pressure sensors/switches must not deviate from the reference value of the zero- or high-level calibration gas by more than 1.5 percent of full range.

# Appendix A to Part 154—Guidelines for Detonation Flame Arresters
This appendix contains the draft ASTM standard for detonation flame arresters. Devices meeting this standard will be accepted by the Commandant (CG-ENG).
1.
Scope
1.1 This standard provides the minimum requirements for design, construction, performance and testing of detonation flame arresters.
2.
Intent
2.1 This standard is intended for detonation flame arresters protecting systems containing vapors of flammable or combustible liquids where vapor temperatures do not exceed 60 °C. For all tests, the test media defined in 14.1.1 can be used except where detonation flame arresters protect systems handling vapors with a maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) below 0.9 millimeters. Detonation flame arresters protecting such systems must be tested with appropriate media (the same vapor or a media having a MESG no greater than the vapor). Various gases and their respective MESG are listed in attachment 1.
2.2 The tests in this standard are intended to qualify detonation flame arresters for all in-line applications independent of piping configuration provided the operating pressure is equal to or less than the maximum operating pressure limit specified in the manufacturer's certification and the diameter of the piping system in which the detonation arrester is to be installed is equal to or less than the piping diameter used in the testing.

# Note:
Detonation flame arresters meeting this standard as Type I devices, which are certified to be effective below 0 °C and which can sustain three stable detonations without being damaged or permanently deformed, also comply with the minimum requirements of the International Maritime Organization, Maritime Safety Committee Circular No. 373 (MSC/Circ. 373/Rev.1).

Terminology
4.1 Δ P/P
o
—The dimensionless ratio, for any deflagration and detonation test of 14.3, of the maximum pressure increase (the maximum pressure minus the initial pressure), as measured in the piping system on the side of the arrester where ignition begins by the device described in paragraph 14.3.3, to the initial absolute pressure in the piping system. The initial pressure should be greater than or equal to the maximum operating pressure specified in paragraph 11.1.7.
4.2 Deflagration—A combustion wave that propagates subsonically (as measured at the pressure and temperature of the flame front) by the transfer of heat and active chemical species to the unburned gas ahead of the flame front.
4.3 Detonation—A reaction in a combustion wave propagating at sonic or supersonic (as measured at the pressure and temperature of the flame front) velocity. A detonation is stable when it has a velocity equal to the speed of sound in the burnt gas or may be unstable (overdriven) with a higher velocity and pressure.
4.4 Detonation flame arrester—A device which prevents the transmission of a detonation and a deflagration.
4.5 Flame speed—The speed at which a flame propagates along a pipe or other system.
4.6 Flame Passage—The transmission of a flame through a device.
4.7 Gasoline Vapors—A non-leaded petroleum distillate consisting essentially of aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds with a boiling range approximating ­65 °C/75 °C.
5.
Classification
5.1 The two types of detonation flame arresters covered in this specification are classified as follows:
5.1.1 Type I—Detonation flame arresters acceptable for applications where stationary flames may rest on the device.
5.1.2 Type II—Detonation flame arresters acceptable for applications where stationary flames are unlikely to rest on the device, and further methods are provided to prevent flame passage when a stationary flame occurs. One example of “further methods” is a temperature monitor and an automatic shutoff valve.

Test Procedures for Detonation Arresters
14.1
Media/Air Mixtures
14.1.1 For vapors from flammable or combustible liquids with a MESG greater than or equal to 0.9 mm, technical grade hexane or gasoline vapors shall be used for all tests in this section except technical grade propane may be used for the deflagration/detonation tests in section 14.3. For vapors with a MESG less than 0.9 mm, the specific vapor (or alternatively, a media with a MESG less than or equal to the MESG of the vapor) must be used as the test medium in all Section 14 tests.
14.1.2 Hexane, propane, gasoline and other test vapors shall be mixed with air to form the most easily ignitable mixture.
5
14.2
Endurance Burn Test Procedure
14.2.1 An endurance burning test shall be carried out as follows:
14.2.1.1 The test rig shall consist of an apparatus producing an explosive mixture, a small tank with a diaphragm, a prototype of the detonation flame arrester and a firing source in close proximity to the test device (see Figure 1). The detonation flame arrester shall be installed so that the mixture emission is vertically upwards, or installed in the position for which it is designed and which will cause the most severe heating of the device under the prescribed endurance burn conditions. In this position the mixture shall be ignited.
14.2.1.2 Endurance burn test shall start by using the most easily ignitable test vapor/air mixture with the aid of a pilot flame or a spark igniter at the outlet. The flammable mixture may be reignited as necessary in the course of the endurance burn.
14.2.1.3 Temperature measurement will be performed on the surface of the arrester element half way between the center and its edge.
14.2.1.4 By varying the proportions of the flammable mixture and the flow rate, the detonation flame arrester shall be heated by a stable flame on the surface of the arrester until the highest obtainable temperature is reached on the ignited side or until the temperature on the side which was not ignited (protected side) rises 100 °C.
14.2.1.5 The flammable mixture proportions will then be varied again until the conditions which result in the highest temperature on the protected side are achieved. This temperature shall be maintained for a period of ten minutes, after which the flow shall be stopped and the conditions observed. The highest attainable temperature is considered to have been reached when any subsequent rise of temperature does not exceed 0.5 °C per minute over a ten minute period.
14.2.1.6 If difficulty arises in establishing the highest attainable temperature on the protected side, the following criteria shall apply. When the increase in temperature on the protected side occurs so slowly that its temperature does not rise 100 °C, the conditions which produced the highest temperature on the ignited side of the arrester will be maintained for two hours. For the condition in which the temperature on the protected side continues to rise at a rate in excess of 0.5 °C per minute for a 10 minute period, endurance burning shall be continued, using the most severe conditions of flammable mixtures and flow rate, for a period of two hours. In either of these cases, at the end of the two hour period, the flow shall be stopped and the conditions observed. The two hour interval shall be measured commencing with the setting of the conditions which produced the most severe conditions of mixture and flow rate. For Type I detonation flame arresters, flame passage shall not occur during this test. For Type II detonation flame arresters, the maximum temperature obtained, and the time elapsed from the time when the most severe conditions are set to when flame passage occurs, shall be recorded. However, for Type II detonation flame arresters the test may be terminated 15 minutes after setting the most severe conditions on the protected side.
14.3
Deflagration/Detonation Test Procedure
14.3.1 A detonation flame arrester shall be installed at one end of a pipe of the same diameter as the inlet of the detonation flame arrester (see Figure 2). The length and configuration of the test pipe shall develop a stable detonation
6
at the device and shall be capable, by change in its length or configuration, of developing deflagrations and unstable (overdriven) detonations as measured on the side of the pipe where ignition occurs (run-up side). For deflagration testing, two
test piping arrangements shall be used on the outlet side of the detonation flame arrester (the side which is not ignited). In both of the following end arrangements, the outlet side pipe diameter shall be equal to that on the run-up side. In one arrangement, the outlet side pipe shall be at least 10 pipe diameters long with a plastic bag over the free end. (Alternate end of pipe closures are also acceptable provided they easily give way during the course of the test, and the closure allows the required gas concentration to be maintained throughout the test piping arrangement.) In the other arrangement the outlet side pipe shall be fitted with a restriction located 0.6 meters from the outlet side arrester flange. The size of the restriction for each nominal size detonation flame arrester shall be as follows:
Nominal pipe diameter (inches)
Restriction diameter (inches)

The entire pipe shall be filled with the most easily ignitable vapor/air mixture to a test pressure corresponding to or greater than the upper limit of the device's maximum operating pressure (see 11.1.7). In order to obtain this test pressure, a device such as a bursting disc may be fitted on the open end of the device in place of the plastic bag. The concentration of the mixture should be verified by appropriate testing of the gas composition. The vapor/air mixture shall then be ignited.
14.3.2 Flame speeds shall be measured by optical devices capable of providing accuracy of ±5%. These devices shall be situated no more than a distance equal to 3% of the length of the run-up pipe apart with one device no more than 8 inches from the end of the test pipe to which the detonation flame arrester is attached. In addition, each outlet arrangement described in paragraph 14.3.1 shall be fitted with an optical device located no more than 8 inches from the detonation flame arrester outlet.
7
14.3.3 Explosion pressures within the pipe shall be measured by a high frequency transducer situated in the test pipe no more than 8 inches from the run-up side of the housing of the detonation flame arrester.
14.3.4 Using the first end arrangement (10 pipe diameter outlet) described in paragraph 14.3.1, a series of tests shall be conducted to determine the test pipe length and configuration that results in the maximum unstable (overdriven) detonation having the maximum measured flame speed at the detonation flame arrester. (These tests may also be carried out using a single length of pipe with igniters spaced at varying distances from the arrester.) The flame speeds, explosion pressures and test pipe configurations shall be recorded for each of these tests. The piping configuration that resulted in the highest recorded unstable (overdriven) detonation flame speed shall be used, and the device shall be subjected to at least four additional unstable (overdriven) detonations. In the course of testing, the device shall also demonstrate its ability to withstand five stable detonations, five deflagrations (as determined by flame speed) where Δ P/P
o
was less than 1 and five deflagrations (as determined by flame speed) where Δ P/P
o
was greater than 1 but less than 10. Initiation of deflagrations shall be at several locations to generate a range for Δ P/P
o
. Deflagration tests using the restricted outlet arrangement described in paragraph 14.3.1 shall then be conducted. In these tests the device shall demonstrate its ability to stop five deflagrations (as determined by flame speed) generated by the same configurations which resulted in Δ P/P
o
being less than 1 during the deflagration tests which were conducted without the restricted end arrangements, and five deflagrations (as determined by flame speed) generated by the same configurations which resulted in Δ P/P
o
being greater than 1 but less than 10 during the deflagration tests which were conducted without the restricted end arrangements. No evidence of flame passage shall occur during these tests. The flame speeds and explosion pressures for each of these tests shall be recorded.
14.3.5 A device that successfully passes the tests of 14.3.4 shall be considered to be directional (suitable for arresting a detonation advancing only from the direction as tested) except;
14.3.5.1 A device may be tested according to 14.3.4 for detonations approaching from either direction, or
14.3.5.2 The design of the device is symmetrical where each end may be considered to be identical when approached by a detonation from either direction.

Appendix B to Part 154 [Reserved]
Pt. 154, App. C

# Appendix C to Part 154—Guidelines for Determining and Evaluating Required Response Resources for Facility Response Plans

# 1. Purpose
1.1 The purpose of this appendix is to describe the procedures for identifying response resources to meet the requirements of subpart F of this part. These guidelines will be used by the facility owner or operator in preparing the response plan and by the Captain of the Port (COTP) when reviewing them. Response resources identified in subparts H and I of this part should be selected using the guidelines in section 2 and Table 1 of this appendix.

# 2. Equipment Operability and Readiness
2.1 All equipment identified in a response plan must be designed to operate in the conditions expected in the facility's geographic area. These conditions vary widely based on location and season. Therefore, it is difficult to identify a single stockpile of response equipment that will function effectively in each geographic location.
2.2 Facilities handling, storing, or transporting oil in more than one operating environment as indicated in Table 1 of this appendix must identify equipment capable of successfully functioning in each operating environment.
2.3 When identifying equipment for response plan credit, a facility owner or operator must consider the inherent limitations in the operability of equipment components and response systems. The criteria in Table 1 of this appendix should be used for evaluating the operability in a given environment. These criteria reflect the general conditions in certain operating areas.
2.3.1 The Coast Guard may require documentation that the boom identified in a response plan meets the criteria in Table 1. Absent acceptable documentation, the Coast Guard may require that the boom be tested to demonstrate that it meets the criteria in Table 1. Testing must be in accordance with ASTM F 715 (incorporated by reference, see § 154.106), or other tests approved by the Coast Guard.
2.4 Table 1 of this appendix lists criteria for oil recovery devices and boom. All other equipment necessary to sustain or support response operations in the specified operating environment must be designed to function in the same conditions. For example, boats which deploy or support skimmers or boom must be capable of being safely operated in the significant wave heights listed for the applicable operating environment.
2.5 A facility owner or operator must refer to the applicable local contingency plan or ACP, as appropriate, to determine if ice, debris, and weather-related visibility are significant factors in evaluating the operability of equipment. The local contingency plan or ACP will also identify the average temperature ranges expected in the facility's operating area. All equipment identified in a response plan must be designed to operate within those conditions or ranges.
2.6 The requirements of subparts F, G, H and I of this part establish response resource mobilization and response times. The distance of the facility from the storage location of the response resources must be used to determine whether the resources can arrive on scene within the stated time. A facility owner or operator shall include the time for notification, mobilization, and travel
time of response resources identified to meet the maximum most probable discharge and Tier 1 worst case discharge response time requirements. For subparts F and G, tier 2 and 3 response resources must be notified and mobilized as necessary to meet the requirements for arrival on scene in accordance with § 154.1045 or § 154.1047 of subpart F, or § 154.1135 of subpart G, as appropriate. An on water speed of 5 knots and a land speed of 35 miles per hour is assumed unless the facility owner or operator can demonstrate otherwise.
2.7 For subparts F and G, in identifying equipment, the facility owner or operator shall list the storage location, quantity, and manufacturer's make and model. For oil recovery devices, the effective daily recovery capacity, as determined using section 6 of this appendix must be included. For boom, the overall boom height (draft plus freeboard) should be included. A facility owner or operator is responsible for ensuring that identified boom has compatible connectors.
2.8 For subparts H and I, in identifying equipment, the facility owner or operator shall list the storage location, quantity, and manufacturer's make and model. For boom, the overall boom height (draft plus freeboard) should be included. A facility owner or operator is responsible for ensuring that identified boom has compatible connectors.

# 3. Determining Response Resources Required for the Average Most Probable Discharge
3.1 A facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient response resources available, through contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), to respond to the average most probable discharge. The equipment must be designed to function in the operating environment at the point of expected use.
3.2 The response resources must include:
3.2.1 1,000 feet of containment boom or two times the length of the largest vessel that regularly conducts oil transfers to or from the facility, whichever is greater, and a means deploying it available at the spill site within 1 hour of the discovery of a spill.
3.2.2 Oil recovery devices with an effective daily recovery capacity equal to the amount of oil discharged in an average most probable discharge or greater available at the facility within 2 hours of the detection of an oil discharge.
3.2.3 Oil storage capacity for recovered oily material indicated in section 9.2 of this appendix.

# 4. Determining Response Resources Required for the Maximum Most Probable Discharge
4.1 A facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient response resources available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), to respond to discharges up to the maximum most probable discharge volume for that facility. This will require response resources capable of containing and collecting up to 1,200 barrels of oil or 10 percent of the worst case discharge, whichever is less. All equipment identified must be designed to operate in the applicable operating environment specified in Table 1 of this appendix.
4.2 Oil recovery devices identified to meet the applicable maximum most probable discharge volume planning criteria must be located such that they arrive on scene within 6 hours in higher volume port areas (as defined in § 154.1020) and the Great Lakes and within 12 hours in all other areas.
4.3 Because rapid control, containment, and removal of oil is critical to reduce spill impact, the effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices must equal 50 percent of the planning volume applicable for the facility as determined in section 4.1 of this appendix. The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices identified in the plan must be determined using the criteria in section 6 of this appendix.
4.4 In addition to oil recovery capacity, the plan must identify sufficient quantities of containment boom available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), to arrive within the required response times for oil collection and containment and for protection of fish and wildlife and sensitive environments. While the regulation does not set required quantities of boom for oil collection and containment, the response plan must identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), the availability of the boom identified in the plan for this purpose.
4.5 The plan must indicate the availability of temporary storage capacity to meet the guidelines of section 9.2 of this appendix. If available storage capacity is insufficient to meet this level, then the effective daily recovery capacity must be derated to the limits of the available storage capacity.
4.6 The following is an example of a maximum most probable discharge volume planning calculation for equipment identification in a higher volume port area: The facility's worst case discharge volume is 20,000 barrels. Ten percent of this is 2,000 barrels. Since this is greater than 1,200 barrels, 1,200 barrels is used as the planning volume. The effective daily recovery capacity must be 50 percent of this, or 600 barrels per day. The ability of oil recovery devices to meet this capacity will be calculated using the procedures in section 6 of this appendix. Temporary storage capacity available on scene must equal twice the daily recovery rate as indicated in section 9 of this appendix, or 1,200 barrels per day. This is the information the facility owner or operator will use to
identify and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), the required response resources. The facility owner will also need to identify how much boom is available for use.

# 5. Determining Response Resources Required for the Worst Case Discharge to the Maximum Extent Practicable
5.1 A facility owner or operator shall identify and ensure availability of, by contract or other approved means, as described in § 154.1028(a), sufficient response resources to respond to the worst case discharge of oil to the maximum extent practicable. Section 7 of this appendix describes the method to determine the required response resources.
5.2 Oil spill response resources identified in the response plan and available through contract or other approved means, as described in § 154.1028(a), to meet the applicable worst case discharge planning volume must be located such that they can arrive at the scene of a discharge within the times specified for the applicable response tiers listed in § 154.1045.
5.3 The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices identified in a response plan must be determined using the criteria in section 6 of this appendix. A facility owner or operator shall identify the storage locations of all response resources that must be used to fulfill the requirements for each tier. The owner or operator of a facility whose required daily recovery capacity exceeds the applicable response capability caps in Table 5 of this appendix shall identify sources of additional equipment, their locations, and the arrangements made to obtain this equipment during a response. The owner or operator of a facility whose calculated planning volume exceeds the applicable contracting caps in Table 5 shall identify sources of additional equipment equal to twice the cap listed in Tiers 1, 2, and 3 or the amount necessary to reach the calculated planning volume, whichever is lower. The resources identified above the cap must be capable of arriving on scene not later than the Tiers 1, 2, and 3 response times in § 154.1045. No contract is required. While general listings of available response equipment may be used to identify additional sources, a response plan must identify the specific sources, locations, and quantities of equipment that a facility owner or operator has considered in his or her planning. When listing Coast Guard classified oil spill removal organization(s) which have sufficient removal capacity to recover the volume above the response capability cap for the specific facility, as specified in Table 5 of this appendix, it is not necessary to list specific quantities of equipment.
5.4 A facility owner or operator shall identify the availability of temporary storage capacity to meet the requirements of section 9.2 of this appendix. If available storage capacity is insufficient to meet this requirement, then the effective daily recovery capacity must be derated to the limits of the availabile storage capacity.
5.5 When selecting response resources necessary to meet the response plan requirements, the facility owner or operator must ensure that a portion of those resources are capable of being used in close-to-shore response activities in shallow water. The following percentages of the on-water response equipment identified for the applicable geographic area must be capable of operating in waters of 6 feet or less depth:
(i) Offshore—10 percent
(ii) Nearshore/inland/Great Lakes/rivers and canals—20 percent.
5.6 In addition to oil spill recovery devices, a facility owner or operator shall identify sufficient quantities of boom that are available, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), to arrive on scene within the required response times for oil containment and collection. The specific quantity of boom required for collection and containment will depend on the specific recovery equipment and strategies employed. A facility owner or operator shall also identify sufficient quantities of oil containment boom to protect fish and wildlife and sensitive environments for the number of days and geographic areas specified in Table 2. Sections 154.1035(b)(4)(iii) and 154.1040(a), as appropriate, shall be used to determine the amount of containment boom required, through contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), to protect fish and wildlife and sensitive environments.
5.7 A facility owner or operator must also identify, through contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), the availability of an oil spill removal organization capable of responding to a shoreline cleanup operation involving the calculated volume of oil and emulsified oil that might impact the affected shoreline. The volume of oil that must be planned for is calculated through the application of factors contained in Tables 2 and 3. The volume calculated from these tables is intended to assist the facility owner or operator in identifying a contractor with sufficient resources and expertise. This planning volume is not used explicitly to determine a required amount of equipment and personnel.

# 6. Determining Effective Daily Recovery Capacity for Oil Recovery Devices
6.1 Oil recovery devices identified by a facility owner or operator must be identified by manufacturer, model, and effective daily recovery capacity. These rates must be used
to determine whether there is sufficient capacity to meet the applicable planning criteria for the average most probable discharge, maximum most probable discharge, and worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable.
6.2 For the purpose of determining the effective daily recovery capacity of oil recovery devices, the formula listed in section 6.2.1 of this appendix will be used. This method considers potential limitations due to available daylight, weather, sea state, and percentage of emulsified oil in the recovered material. The Coast Guard may assign a lower efficiency factor to equipment listed in a response plan if it determines that such a reduction is warranted.
6.2.1 The following formula must be used to calculate the effective daily recovery capacity:
R = T × 24 hours × E
R = Effective daily recovery capacity
T = Throughout rate in barrels per hour (nameplate capacity)
E = 20 percent Efficiency factor (or lower factor as determined by Coast Guard)
6.2.2 For those devices in which the pump limits the throughput of liquid, throughput rate will be calculated using the pump capacity.
6.2.3 For belt or mop type devices, the throughput rate will be calculated using the speed of the belt or mop through the device, assumed thickness of oil adhering to or collected by the device, and surface area of the belt or mop. For purposes of this calculation, the assumed thickness of oil will be
1/4
inch.
6.2.4 Facility owners or operators including oil recovery devices whose throughput is not measurable using a pump capacity or belt/mop speed may provide information to support an alternative method of calculation. This information must be submitted following the procedures in paragraph 6.3.2 of this appendix.
6.3 As an alternative to 6.2, a facility owner or operator may submit adequate evidence that a different effective daily recovery capacity should be applied for a specific oil recovery device. Adequate evidence is actual verified performance data in spill conditions or tests using ASTM F 631 (incorporated by reference, see § 154.106), or an equivalent test approved by the Coast Guard.
6.3.1 The following formula must be used to calculate the effective daily recovery capacity under this alternative:
R = D × U
R = Effective daily recovery capacity
D = Average Oil Recovery Rate in barrels per hour (Item 26 in ASTM F 808; Item 13.2.16 in ASTM F 631; or actual performance data)
U = Hours per day that a facility owner or operator can document capability to operate equipment under spill conditions. Ten hours per day must be used unless a facility owner or operator can demonstrate that the recovery operation can be sustained for longer periods.
6.3.2 A facility owner or operator proposing a different effective daily recovery rate for use in a response plan shall provide data for the oil recovery devices listed. The following is an example of these calculations:
A weir skimmer identified in a response plan has a manufacturer's rated throughput at the pump of 267 gallons per minute (gpm).
267 gpm = 381 barrels per hour
R = 381 × 24 × .2 = 1829 barrels per day
After testing using ASTM procedures, the skimmer's oil recovery rate is determined to be 220 gpm. The facility owner of operator identifies sufficient response resources available to support operations 12 hours per day.
220 gpm = 314 barrels per hour
R = 314 × 12 = 3768 barrels per day
The facility owner or operator will be able to use the higher rate if sufficient temporary oil storage capacity is available. Determinations of alternative efficiency factors under paragraph 6.2 or alternative effective daily recovery capacities under paragraph 6.3 of this appendix will be made by Commandant (CG-CPE), Attn: Office of Crisis and Contingency Preparedness and Exercise Policy, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7516, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7516. Response contractors or equipment manufacturers may submit required information on behalf of multiple facility owners or operators directly in lieu of including the request with the response plan submission.

# 7. Calculating the Worst Case Discharge Planning Volumes
7.1 The facility owner or operator shall plan for a response to a facility's worst case discharge. The planning for on-water recovery must take into account a loss of some oil to the environment due to evaporative and natural dissipation, potential increases in volume due to emulsification, and the potential for deposit of some oil on the shoreline.
7.2 The following procedures must be used to calculate the planning volume used by a facility owner or operator for determining required on water recovery capacity:
7.2.1 The following must be determined: The worst case discharge volume of oil in the facility; the appropriate group(s) for the type of oil handled, stored, or transported at the facility (non-persistent (Group I) or persistent (Groups II, III, or IV)); and the facility's specific operating area. Facilities which handle, store, or transport oil from different petroleum oil groups must calculate each group separately. This information is to be
used with Table 2 of this appendix to determine the percentages of the total volume to be used for removal capacity planning. This table divides the volume into three categories: Oil lost to the environment; oil deposited on the shoreline; and oil available for on-water recovery.
7.2.2 The on-water oil recovery volume must be adjusted using the appropriate emulsification factor found in Table 3 of this appendix. Facilities which handle, store, or transport oil from different petroleum groups must assume that the oil group resulting in the largest on-water recovery volume will be stored in the tank or tanks identified as constituting the worst case discharge.
7.2.3 The adjusted volume is multiplied by the on-water oil recovery resource mobilization favor found in Table 4 of this appendix from the appropriate operating area and response tier to determine the total on-water oil recovery capacity in barrels per day that must be identified or contracted for to arrive on-scene with the applicable time for each response tier. Three tiers are specified. For higher volume port areas, the contracted tiers of resources must be located such that they can arrive on scene within 6, 30, and 54 hours of the discovery of an oil discharge. For all other river, inland, nearshore, offshore areas, and the Great Lakes, these tiers are 12, 36, and 60 hours.
7.2.4 The resulting on-water recovery capacity in barrels per day for each tier must be used to identify response resources necessary to sustain operations in the applicable operating area. The equipment must be capable of sustaining operations for the time period specified in Table 2 of this appendix. The facility owner or operator must identify and ensure the availability, through contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), of sufficient oil spill recovery devices to provide the effective daily recovery oil recovery capacity required. If the required capacity exceeds the applicable cap specified in Table 5 of this appendix, then a facility owner or operator shall ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), only for the quantity of resources required to meet the cap, but shall identify sources of additional resources as indicated in § 154.1045(m). The owner or operator of a facility whose planning volume exceeds the cap for 1993 must make arrangements to identify and ensure the availability, through contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), of the additional capacity in 1998 or 2003, as appropriate. For a facility that handles, stores, or transports multiple groups of oil, the required effective daily recovery capacity for each group is calculated before applying the cap.
7.3 The following procedures must be used to calculate the planning volume for identifying shoreline cleanup capacity:
7.3.1 The following must be determined: The worst case discharge volume of oil for the facility; the appropriate group(s) for the type of oil handled, stored, or transported at the facility (non-persistent (Group I) or persistent (Groups II, III, or IV)); and the operating area(s) in which the facility operates. For a facility storing oil from different groups, each group must be calculated separately. Using this information, Table 2 of this appendix must be used to determine the percentages of the total planning volume to be used for shoreline cleanup resource planning.
7.3.2 The shoreline cleanup planning volume must be adjusted to reflect an emulsification factor using the same procedure as described in section 7.2.2.
7.3.3 The resulting volume will be used to identify an oil spill removal organization with the appropriate shoreline cleanup capability.
7.3.4 The following is an example of the procedure described above: A facility receives oil from barges via a dock located on a bay and transported by piping to storage tanks. The facility handles Number 6 oil (specific gravity .96) and stores the oil in tanks where it is held prior to being burned in an electric generating plant. The MTR segment of the facility has six 18-inch diameter pipelines running one mile from the dock-side manifold to several storage tanks which are located in the non-transportation-related portion of the facility. Although the facility piping has a normal working pressure of 100 pounds per square inch, the piping has a maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) of 150 pounds per square inch. At MAWP, the pumping system can move 10,000 barrels (bbls) of Number 6 oil every hour through each pipeline. The facility has a roving watchman who is required to drive the length of the piping every 2 hours when the facility is receiving oil from a barge. The facility operator estimates that it will take approximately 10 minutes to secure pumping operations when a discharge is discovered. Using the definition of worst case discharge provided in § 154.1029(b)(ii), the following calculation is provided:
bbls.

To calculate the planning volumes for onshore recovery:
Worst case discharge: 170,184 bbls. Group IV oil
Emulsification factor (from Table 3): 1.4
Operating Area impacted: Inland
Planned percent oil onshore recovery (from Table 2): Inland 70%
Planning volumes for onshore recovery: Inland 170,184 × .7 × 1.4 = 166,780 bbls.
Conclusion: The facility owner or operator must contract with a response resource capable of managing a 166,780 barrel shoreline cleanup.
To calculate the planning volumes for on-water recovery:
Worst case discharge: 170,184 bbls. Group IV oil
Emulsification factor (from Table 3): 1.4
Operating Area impacted: Inland
Planned percent oil on-water recovery (from Table 2): Inland 50%
Planning volumes for on-water recovery: Inland 170,184 × .5 × 1.4 = 119,128 bbls.
To determine the required resources for on-water recovery for each tier, use the mobilization factors from Table 4:

× .15
× .25
× .40
Barrels per day (pbd)

47,652
Conclusion: Since the requirements for all tiers for inland exceed the caps, the facility owner will only need to contract for 10,000 bpd for Tier 1, 20,000 bpd for Tier 2, and 40,000 bpd for Tier 3. Sources for the bpd on-water recovery resources above the caps for all three Tiers need only be identified in the response plan.
Twenty percent of the capability for Inland, for all tiers, must be capable of operating in water with a depth of 6 feet or less.
The facility owner or operator will also be required to identify or ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in § 154.1028(a), sufficient response resources required under §§ 154.1035(b)(4) and 154.1045(k) to protect fish and wildlife and sensitive environments identified in the response plan for the worst case discharge from the facility.
The COTP has the discretion to accept that a facility can operate only a limited number of the total pipelines at a dock at a time. In those circumstances, the worst case discharge must include the drainage volume from the piping normally not in use in addition to the drainage volume and volume of oil discharged during discovery and shut down of the oil discharge from the operating piping.

# 8. Determining the Capability of High-Rate Response Methods
8.1. Calculate cumulative dispersant application capacity as follows:
8.1.1 A facility owner or operator must plan either for a dispersant capacity to respond to a facility's worst case discharge (WCD) of oil, or for the amount of the dispersant resource cap as required by § 154.1045(i)(3) of this chapter, whichever is the lesser amount. When planning for the cumulative application capacity required, the calculations must account for the loss of some oil to the environment due to natural dissipation causes (primarily evaporation). The following procedure must be used to determine the cumulative application requirements:
8.1.2 Determine the WCD volume of oil in gallons and the appropriate oil group for the type of petroleum oil (persistent Groups II, III, and IV). For facilities with mixed petroleum oils, assume a total WCD volume using the group that constitutes the largest portion of the oil being handled or the group with the smallest natural dissipation factor;
8.1.3 Multiply the total WCD amount in gallons by the natural dissipation factor for the appropriate oil group as follows: Group II factor is 0.50; Group III is 0.30; and Group IV is 0.10. This represents the amount of oil that can be expected to be lost to natural dissipation in a nearshore environment. Subtract the oil amount lost to natural dissipation from the total WCD amount to determine the remaining oil available for treatment by dispersant application; and
8.1.4 Multiply the oil available for dispersant treatment by the dispersant-to-oil planning application ratio of 1 part dispersant to 20 parts oil (0.05). The resulting number represents the cumulative total dispersant-application capability that must be ensured available within the first 60 hours.
8.1.5(i) The following is an example of the procedure described in paragraphs 8.1.1 through 8.1.4 above: A facility with a 1,000,000 gallon WCD of crude oil (specific gravity 0.87) is located in an area with pre-authorization for dispersant use in the nearshore environment on the U.S. East Coast:
WCD: 1,000,000 gallons, Group III oil.
Natural dissipation factor for Group III: 30 percent.
General formula to determine oil available for dispersant treatment: (WCD)−[(WCD) × (natural dissipation factor)] = available oil.
E.g., 1,000,000 gal−(1,000,000 gal × .30) = 700,000 gallons of available oil.
Cumulative application capacity = Available oil × planning application ratio (1 gal dispersant/20 gals oil = 0.05).
E.g., 700,000 gal oil × (0.05) = 35,000 gallons cumulative dispersant-application capacity.
(ii) The requirements for cumulative dispersant-application capacity (35,000 gallons) for this facility's WCD is less than the overall dispersant capability for non-Gulf Coast waters required by § 155.1045(i)(3) of this chapter. Because paragraph 8.1.1 of this appendix requires owners and operators to ensure the availability of the lesser of a facility's dispersant requirements for WCD or the amount of the dispersant cap provided for in § 154.1045(i)(3), the facility in this example would be required to ensure the availability
of 35,000 gallons of dispersant. More specifically, this facility would be required to meet the following tier requirements in § 154.1045(i)(3), which total 35,000 gallons application:
Tier 1—4,125 gallons—Completed in 12 hours.
Tier 2—23,375 gallons—Completed in 36 hours.
Tier 3—7,500 gallons—Completed in 60 hours.
8.2 Determine Effective Daily Application Capacities (EDACs) for dispersant response systems as follows:
8.2.1 EDAC planning estimates for compliance with the dispersant application requirements in § 154.1045(i)(3) are to be based on:
8.2.1.1 The spill occurring at the facility;
8.2.1.2 Specific dispersant application platform operational characteristics identified in the EDSP or as demonstrated by operational tests;
8.2.1.3 Locations of primary dispersant staging sites; and
8.2.1.4 Locations and quantities of dispersant stockpiles.
8.2.2 EDAC calculations with supporting documentation must be submitted to the NSFCC for classification as a Dispersant Oil Spill Removal Organization.
8.2.3(i) EDAC can also be calculated using the Dispersant Mission Planner 2 (EDSP). The EDSP is a downloadable application that calculates EDAC for different dispersant response systems. It is located on the Internet at:
http://www.response.restoration.noaa.gov/spilltools.
(ii) The DMP2 contains operating information for the vast majority of dispersant application platforms, including aircraft, both rotary and fixed wing, and vessels. The DMP2 produces EDAC estimates by performing calculations based on performance parameters of dispersant application platforms, locations of primary dispersant staging sites, home-based airport or port locations, and the facility location (for the spill site).
8.2.4 For each Captain of the Port zone where a dispersant response capability is required, the response plan must identify:
8.2.4.1 The type, number, and location of each dispersant-application platform intended for use to meet dispersant delivery requirements specified in § 154.1045(i)(3) of this chapter;
8.2.4.2 The amount and location of available dispersant stockpiles to support each platform; and,
8.2.4.3 A primary staging site for each platform that will serve as its base of operations for the duration of the response.
8.3 In addition to the equipment and supplies required, a facility owner or operator must identify a source of support to conduct the monitoring and post-use effectiveness evaluation required by applicable regional plans and ACPs.
8.4 Identification of the resources for dispersant application does not imply that the use of this technique will be authorized. Actual authorization for use during a spill response will be governed by the provisions of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300) and the applicable Local or Area Contingency Plan.

# 9. Additional Equipment Necessary To Sustain Response Operations
9.1 A facility owner or operator is responsible for ensuring that sufficient numbers of trained personnel and boats, aerial spotting aircraft, containment boom, sorbent materials, boom anchoring materials, and other supplies are available to sustain response operations to completion. All such equipment must be suitable for use with the primary equipment identified in the response plan. A facility owner or operator is not required to list these response resources, but shall certify their availability.
9.2 A facility owner or operator shall evaluate the availability of adequate temporary storage capacity to sustain the effective daily recovery capacities from equipment identified in the plan. Because of the inefficiencies of oil spill recovery devices, response plans must identify daily storage capacity equivalent to twice the effective daily recovery rate required on scene. This temporary storage capacity may be reduced if a facility owner or operator can demonstrate by waste stream analysis that the efficiencies of the oil recovery devices, ability to decant waste, or the availability of alternative temporary storage or disposal locations will reduce the overall volume of oily material storage requirement.
9.3 A facility owner or operator shall ensure that his or her planning includes the capability to arrange for disposal of recovered oil products. Specific disposal procedures will be addressed in the applicable ACP.

# Appendix D to Part 154—Training Elements for Oil Spill Response Plans

# 1. General
1.1 The portion of the plan dealing with training is one of the key elements of a response plan. This concept is clearly expressed by the fact that Congress, in writing OPA 90, specifically included training as one of the sections required in a vessel or facility response plan. In reviewing submitted response plans, it has been noted that the plans often do not provide sufficient information in the training section of the plan for either the user or the reviewer of the plan. In some cases, plans simply state that the crew and others will be trained in their duties and responsibilities, with no other information being provided. In other plans, information is simply given that required parties will receive the necessary worker safety training (HAZWOPER).
1.2 The training section of the plan need not be a detailed course syllabus, but it must contain sufficient information to allow the user and reviewer (or evaluator) to have an understanding of those areas that are believed to be critical. Plans should identify key skill areas and the training that is required to ensure that the individual identified will be capable of performing the duties prescribed to them. It should also describe how the training will be delivered to the various personnel. Further, this section of the plan must work in harmony with those sections of the plan dealing with exercises, the spill management team, and the qualified individual.
1.3 The material in this appendix D is not all-inclusive and is provided for guidance only.

# 2. Elements To Be Addressed
2.1 To assist in the preparation of the training section of a facility response plan, some of the key elements that should be addressed are indicated in the following sections. Again, while it is not necessary that the comprehensive training program for the company be included in the response plan, it is necessary for the plan to convey the elements that define the program as appropriate.
2.2 An effective spill response training program should consider and address the following:
2.2.1 Notification requirements and procedures.
2.2.2 Communication system(s) used for the notifications.
2.2.3 Procedures to mitigate or prevent any discharge or a substantial threat of a discharge of oil resulting from failure of manifold, mechanical loading arm, or other transfer equipment or hoses, as appropriate;
2.2.3.1 Tank overfill;
2.2.3.2 Tank rupture;
2.2.3.3 Piping rupture;
2.2.3.4 Piping leak, both under pressure and not under pressure, if applicable;
2.2.3.5 Explosion or fire;
2.2.3.6 Equipment failure (e.g., pumping system failure, relief valve failure, or other general equipment relevant to operational activities associated with internal or external facility transfers).
2.2.4 Procedures for transferring responsibility for direction of response activities from facility personnel to the spill management team.
2.2.5 Familiarity with the operational capabilities of the contracted oil spill removal organizations and the procedures to notify the activate such organizations.
2.2.6 Familiarity with the contracting and ordering procedures to acquire oil spill removal organization resources.
2.2.7 Familiarity with the ACP(s).
2.2.8 Familiarity with the organizational structures that will be used to manage the response actions.
2.2.9 Responsibilities and duties of the spill management team members in accordance with designated job responsibilities.
2.2.10 Responsibilities and authority of the qualified individual as described in the facility response plan and company response organization.
2.2.11 Responsibilities of designated individuals to initiate a response and supervise response resources.
2.2.12 Actions to take, in accordance with designated job responsibilities, in the event of a transfer system leak, tank overflow, or suspected cargo tank or hull leak.
2.2.13 Information on the cargoes handled by the vessel or facility, including familiarity with—
2.2.13.1 Cargo material safety data sheets;
2.2.13.2 Chemical characteristic of the cargo;
2.2.13.3 Special handling procedures for the cargo;
2.2.13.4 Health and safety hazards associated with the cargo; and
2.2.13.5 Spill and firefighting procedures for cargo.
2.2.14 Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements for worker health and safety (29 CFR 1910.120).

# 3. Further Considerations
In drafting the training section of the facility response plan, some further considerations are noted below (these points are raised simply as a reminder):
3.1 The training program should focus on training provided to facility personnel.
3.2 An organization is comprised of individuals, and a training program should be structured to recognize this fact by ensuring
that training is tailored to the needs of the individuals involved in the program.
3.3 An owner or operator may identify equivalent work experience which fulfills specific training requirements.
3.4 The training program should include participation in periodic announced and unannounced exercises. This participation should approximate the actual roles and responsibilities of individual specified in the plan.
3.5 Training should be conducted periodically to reinforce the required knowledge and to ensure an adequate degree of preparedness by individuals with responsibilities under the facility response plan.
3.6 Training may be delivered via a number of different means; including classroom sessions, group discussions, video tapes, self-study workbooks, resident training courses, on-the-job training, or other means as deemed appropriate to ensure proper instruction.
3.7 New employees should complete the training program prior to being assigned job responsibilities which require participation in emergency response situations.

# 4. Conclusion
The information in this appendix is only intended to assist response plan preparers in reviewing the content of and in modifying the training section of their response plans. It may be more comprehensive than is needed for some facilities and not comprehensive enough for others. The Coast Guard expects that plan preparers have determined the training needs of their organizations created by the development of the response plans and the actions identified as necessary to increase the preparedness of the company and its personnel to respond to actual or threatened discharges of oil from their facilities.

CGD 75-124a, 48 FR 45715, Oct. 6, 1983, unless otherwise noted.
§ 155.200
Definitions.
As used in this subpart:
Inland oil barge
means a tank barge carrying oil in bulk as cargo certificated by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR chapter I, subchapter D for river or canal service or lakes, bays, and sounds service.
On-deck spill
means a discharge of oil on the deck of a vessel during loading, unloading, transfer, or other shipboard operations. An on-deck spill could result from a leaking fitting, an overfill, a bad connection, or similar operational mishap. The term
on-deck spill
is used to differentiate these operational discharges from those caused by collision or grounding where the hull is punctured and a tank is ruptured, resulting in an uncontrolled discharge of oil into the marine environment.
Offshore oil barge
means a tank barge carrying oil in bulk as cargo, including dual-mode integrated tug-barges, certificated by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR chapter I, subchapter D, for navigation in waters outside the Boundary Lines, as defined in 46 CFR part 7, in any ocean or the Gulf of America; any tank barge in Great Lakes service; or any foreign flag tank barge.
Oil tanker
means a self-propelled vessel carrying oil in bulk as cargo, including integrated tug-barges designed for push-mode operation.
Vessel carrying oil as secondary cargo
means a vessel carrying oil pursuant to a permit issued under 46 CFR 30.01-5, 46 CFR 70.05-30, or 46 CFR 90.05-35 or pursuant to an International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) or Noxious Liquid Substance (NLS) certificate required by § 151.33 or § 151.35 of this chapter; or any uninspected vessel that carries oil in bulk as cargo.

§ 155.230
Emergency control systems for tank barges.
(a)
Application.
This section does not apply to foreign vessels engaged in innocent passage (that is, neither entering nor leaving a U.S. port); it applies to tank barges and vessels towing them on the following waters:
(1) On the territorial sea of the U.S. [as defined in Presidential Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988, it is the belt of waters 12 nautical miles wide with its shoreward boundary the baseline of the territorial sea], unless—
(i) The barge is being pushed ahead of, or towed alongside, the towing vessel; and
(ii) The barge's coastwise route is restricted, on its certificate of inspection (COI), so the barge may operate “in fair weather only, within 20 miles of shore,” or with words to that effect. The Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may define “fair weather” on the COI.
(2) In Great Lakes service unless—
(i) The barge is being pushed ahead of, or towed alongside, the towing vessel; and
(ii) The barge's route is restricted, on its certificate of inspection (COI), so the barge may operate “in fair weather only, within 5 miles of a harbor,” or with words to that effect. The Officer
in Charge, Marine Inspection, may define “fair weather” on the COI.
(3) On Long Island Sound. For the purposes of this section, Long Island Sound comprises the waters between the baseline of the territorial sea on the eastern end (from Watch Hill Point, Rhode Island, to Montauk Point, Long Island) and a line drawn north and south from Premium Point, New York (about 40°54.5′ N, 73°45.5′ W), to Hewlett Point, Long Island (about 40°50.5′ N, 73°45.3′ W), on the western end.
(4) In the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
(5) On the waters of Admiralty Inlet north of Marrowstone Point (approximately 48°06′ N, 122°41′ W).
(b)
Safety program.
If you are the owner or operator of a single-hull tank barge or of a vessel towing it, you must adequately man and equip either the barge or the vessel towing it so the crew can arrest the barge by employing
Measure 1,
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Moreover, the crew must be able to arrest or retrieve the barge by employing either
Measure 2
or
Measure 3,
described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, respectively. If you are the owner or operator of a double-hull tank barge, you must adequately equip it and train its crew or, if it is unmanned, train the crew of the vessel towing it, so the crew can retrieve the barge by employing
Measure 2
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(1)
Measure 1.
Each single-hull tank barge, whether manned or unmanned, must be equipped with an operable anchoring system that conforms to 46 CFR 32.15-15; except that, for barges operating only on the West Coast of the U.S., a system comprising heavy surge gear and bridle legs may serve instead of the anchoring system. Because these systems will also serve as emergency control systems, the owner or operator must ensure that they meet the following criteria:
(i)
Operation and performance.
When the barge is underway—
(A) The system is ready for immediate use;
(B) No more than two crewmembers are needed to operate the system and anchor the barge or arrest its movement;
(C) While preparing to anchor the barge or arrest its movement, the operator of the system should confer with the master or mate of the towing vessel regarding appropriate length of cable or chain to use; and
(D) Each operator of the system should wear a safety belt or harness secured by a lanyard to a lifeline, drop line, or fixed structure such as a welded padeye, if the sea or the weather warrants this precaution. Each safety belt, harness, lanyard, lifeline, and drop line must meet the specifications of ANSI A10.14 (incorporated by reference, see § 155.140).
(ii)
Maintenance and inspections.
The owner or operator of the system shall inspect it annually. The inspection must verify that the system is ready for immediate use, and must include a visual inspection of the equipment that comprises the system in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The inspection must also verify that the system is being maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The inspection need not include actual demonstration of the operation of the equipment or system.
(iii)
Training.
On each manned barge, every crewmember must be thoroughly familiar with the operation of the system. On each vessel towing an unmanned barge, every deck crewmember must be thoroughly familiar with the operation of the system installed on the barge. If during the last 12 months the system was not used to anchor or arrest the movement of the barge, then a drill on the use of the system must be conducted within the next month. The drill need not involve actual deployment of the system. However, it must allow every participant to demonstrate the competencies (that is, the knowledge, skills, and abilities) needed to ensure that everyone assigned a duty in anchoring or arresting the movement of the barge is ready to do his or her duty.
(2)
Measure 2.
If you are the owner or operator of a tank barge or a vessel towing it and this section applies to you by virtue of paragraph (a) of this section, you must have installed an emergency retrieval system or some other measure acceptable to the Coast
Guard, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Any such system must meet the following criteria:
(i)
Design.
The system must use an emergency towline with
at least
the same pulling strength as required of the primary towline. The emergency towline must be readily available on either the barge or the vessel towing it. The towing vessel must have on board equipment to regain control of the barge and continue towing (using the emergency towline), without having to place personnel on board the barge.
(ii)
Operation and performance.
The system must use a stowage arrangement that ensures the readiness of the emergency towline and the availability of all retrieval equipment for immediate use in an emergency whenever the barge is being towed astern.
(iii)
Maintenance and inspection.
The owner or operator of the system shall inspect it annually. The inspection must verify that the emergency retrieval system is ready for immediate use, and must include a visual inspection of the equipment that comprises the system in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The inspection must also verify that the system is being maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The inspection need not include actual demonstration of the operation of the equipment or system. Details concerning maintenance of towlines appear in 33 CFR 164.74(a)(3) and Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) No. 5-92. Our NVICs are available online at
http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/nvic/index.htm.
(iv)
Training.
Barge-retrieval drills must take place annually, and not more than one month after a master or mate responsible for supervising barge retrieval begins employment on a vessel that tows tank barges.
(A) Each drill must allow every participant to demonstrate the competencies (that is, the knowledge, skills, and abilities) needed to ensure that everyone assigned a duty in barge retrieval is ready to do his or her part to regain control of a drifting barge.
(B) If the drill includes actual operation of a retrieval system, it must be conducted under the supervision of the master or mate responsible for retrieval, and preferably in open waters free from navigational hazards so as to minimize risk to personnel and the environment.
(3)
Measure 3.
If you are the owner or operator of a tank barge or a vessel towing it and this section applies to you by virtue of paragraph (a) of this section, you may use an alternative measure or system fit for retrieving a barge or arresting its movement as a substitute for Measure 2, described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Before you use such a measure or system, however, it must receive the approval of the Commandant (CG-ENG). It will receive this approval if it provides protection against grounding of the tank vessel comparable to that provided by one of the other two measures described in this section.

§ 155.760
Amendment of transfer procedures.
(a) The COTP or OCMI may require the vessel operator of any vessel that is required to have transfer procedures under § 155.720 to amend those procedures if the COTP or OCMI finds that the transfer procedures do not meet the requirements of this part.
(b) The COTP or OCMI shall notify the vessel operator in writing of any inadequacies in the oil transfer procedures. The vessel operator may submit written information, views, and arguments on and proposals for amending the procedures within 14 days from the date of the COTP or OCMI notice. After considering all relevant material presented, the COTP or OCMI shall notify the vessel operator of any amendment required or adopted, or the COTP or OCMI may rescind the notice. The amendment becomes effective 30 days after the vessel operator receives the notice, unless the vessel operator petitions the Commandant to review the COTP or OCMI notice, in which case its effective date is delayed pending a decision by the Commandant. Petitions to the Commandant must be submitted in writing via the COTP or OCMI who issued the requirement to amend.
(c) If the COTP or OCMI finds that there is a condition requiring immediate action to prevent the discharge or risk of discharge that makes the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section impractical or contrary to the public interest, he or she may issue an amendment effective on the date the vessel operator receives notice of it. In such a case, the COTP or OCMI includes a brief statement of the reasons for the findings in the notice, and the vessel operator may petition the Commandant, in any manner, to review the amendment. The petition does not postpone the amendment.

# Subpart D—Tank Vessel Response Plans for Oil

# Source:
CGD 91-034, 61 FR 1081, Jan. 12, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
§ 155.1010
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to establish requirements for oil spill response plans for certain vessels. The planning criteria in this subpart are intended for use in response plan development and the identification of resources necessary to respond to the oil spill scenarios prescribed during the planning process. The development of a response plan prepares the vessel owner or operator and the vessel's crew to respond to an oil spill. The specific criteria for response resources and their arrival times are not performance standards. They are planning criteria based on a set of assumptions that may not exist during an actual oil spill incident.
§ 155.1015
Applicability.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, this subpart applies to each vessel that is constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries, oil in bulk as cargo or oil cargo residue, and that—
(1) Is a vessel of the United States;
(2) Operates on the navigable waters of the United States; or
(3) Transfers oil in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
(b) This subpart also applies to vessels which engage in oil lightering operations in the marine environment beyond the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured, when the cargo lightered is destined for a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
(c) This subpart does not apply to the following types of vessels:
(1) Public vessels and vessels deemed public vessels under 14 U.S.C. 3908.
(2) Vessels that, although constructed or adapted to carry oil in bulk as cargo or oil cargo residue, are not storing or carrying oil in bulk as cargo or oil cargo residue.
(3) Dedicated response vessels when conducting response operations.
(4) Vessels of opportunity when conducting response operations in a response area.
(5) Offshore supply vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101.
(6) Fishing or fishing tender vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101 of not more than 750 gross tons when engaged only in the fishing industry.
(7) Foreign-flag vessels engaged in innocent passage through the territorial sea or transit passage through a strait used for international navigation, unless bound for or departing from a port or place of the United States.
(8) Vessels carrying oil as a secondary cargo and measuring 400 gross tons or greater.
(d) Vessels covered by this subpart that are not operating within the navigable waters or the exclusive economic
zone of the United States must meet all requirements of this subpart except for—
(1) Identifying and ensuring, through contract or other approved means, the availability of response resources including the shore-based spill management team;
(2) Providing the geographic-specific appendices required in § 155.1035, 155.1040, or 155.1045, as appropriate; and
(3) Identifying and designating a qualified individual and alternate qualified individual required in § 155.1026.

Sections 155.1050(g), 155.1135, 155.1230(d), and 155.2230(d) set forth the required times within which the response resources must arrive on scene. Tiers are applied in three categories:
(1) Higher volume port areas;
(2) The Great Lakes; and
(3) All other operating environments, including rivers and canals, inland, nearshore, and offshore areas.
Vegetable oil
means a non-petroleum oil or fat not specifically identified elsewhere in this part that is derived from plant seeds, nuts, kernels or fruits.

(2) Vessels that intend to offload their cargo at the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) marine terminal are not required to comply with the requirements of this paragraph when they are within the offshore area and under one of the following conditions:
(i) Approaching or departing the LOOP marine terminal within the LOOP Shipping Safety Fairway as defined in 33 CFR 166.200.
(ii) Moored at the LOOP marine terminal for the purposes of cargo transfer operations or anchored in the designated anchorage area awaiting discharge.
(p) Appendix B of this part sets out caps that recognize the practical and technical limits of response capabilities for which an individual vessel owner or operator can contract in advance. Table 6 in appendix B lists the contracting caps that are applicable, as of February 18, 1993, and that are slated to apply on February 18, 1998. The owner or operator of a vessel carrying groups I through IV petroleum oil as a primary cargo, whose required daily recovery capacity exceeds the applicable contracting caps in table 6, shall identify commercial sources of additional equipment equal to twice the cap listed for each tier or the amount necessary to reach the calculated planning volume, whichever is lower, to the extent that this equipment is available. The equipment so identified must be capable of arriving on scene no later than the applicable tier response times contained in § 155.1050(g) or as quickly as the nearest available resource permits. A response plan must identify the specific sources, locations, and quantities of this additional equipment. No contract is required.
(q) The Coast Guard will continue to evaluate the environmental benefits, cost efficiency and practicality of increasing mechanical recovery capability requirements. This continuing evaluation is part of the Coast Guard's long term commitment to achieving and maintaining an optimum mix of oil spill response capability across the full spectrum of response modes. As best available technology demonstrates a need to evaluate or change mechanical recovery capacities, a review of cap increases and other requirements contained within this subpart may be performed. Any changes in the requirements of this section will occur through a public notice and comment process. During this review, the Coast Guard will determine if established caps remain practicable and if increased caps will provide any benefit to oil spill recovery operations. The review will include and evaluation of:
(1) Best available technologies for containment and recovery;
(2) Oil spill tracking technology;
(3) High rate response techniques;
(4) Other applicable response technologies; and
(5) Increases in the availability of private response resources.

# Subpart I—Salvage and Marine Firefighting

# Source:
USCG-1998-3417, 73 FR 80649, Dec. 31, 2008, unless otherwise noted.
§ 155.4010
Purpose of this subpart.
(a) The purpose of this subpart is to establish vessel response plan
salvage
and
marine firefighting
requirements for vessels, that are carrying group I-IV oils, and that are required by §§ 155.1015 and 155.5015 to have a vessel response plan.
(b)
Salvage
and
marine firefighting
actions can save lives and property, and prevent the escalation of potential oil spills to worst case discharge scenarios.
(c) A planholder must ensure by
contract or other approved means
that response resources are available to respond. However, the response criteria specified in the regulations (e.g., quantities of response resources and their arrival times) are planning criteria, not performance standards, and are based on assumptions that may not exist during an actual incident, as stated in 33 CFR 155.1010. Compliance with the regulations is based upon whether a covered response plan ensures that adequate response resources are available, not on whether the actual performance of those response resources after an incident meets specified arrival times or other planning criteria. Failure to meet specified criteria during an actual spill response does not necessarily mean that the planning requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) (33 U.S.C. 1251-1376) and regulations were not met. The Coast Guard will exercise its enforcement discretion in light of all facts and circumstances.

§ 155.4020
Complying with this subpart.
(a)(1) If you have an existing approved vessel response plan required by § 155.1015, you must have your vessel response plan updated and submitted to the Coast Guard by February 22, 2011.
(2) All new or existing vessels operating on the navigable waters of the United States or transferring oil in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, that meet the applicability requirements of § 155.1015, that do not have an approved vessel response plan, must comply with § 155.1065.
(3) Your vessel may not conduct oil transport or transfer operations if—
(i) You have not submitted a plan to the Coast Guard in accordance with § 155.1065 prior to February 22, 2011;
(ii) The Coast Guard determines that the response resources referenced in your plan do not meet the requirements of this subpart;
(iii) The contracts or agreements cited in your plan have lapsed or are otherwise no longer valid;
(iv) You are not operating in accordance with your plan; or
(v) The plan's approval has expired.

§ 155.4025
Definitions.
For the purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:
Assessment of structural stability
means completion of a vessel's stability and structural integrity assessment through the use of a salvage software program. The data used for the calculations would include information collected by the on-scene salvage professional. The assessment is intended to allow sound decisions to be made for subsequent salvage efforts. In addition, the assessment must be consistent with the conditions set forth in 33 CFR 155.240 and 155.245, as applicable.
Boundary lines
are lines drawn following the general trend of the seaward, highwater shorelines and lines continuing the general trend of the seaward, highwater shorelines across entrances to small bays, inlets and rivers as defined in 46 CFR 7.5(c).
Captain of the Port (COTP) city
means the city which is the geographical location of the COTP office. COTP city locations are listed in 33 CFR part 3.
Continental United States (CONUS)
means the contiguous 48 States and the District of Columbia.
Contract or other approved means
is any one of the following:
(1)(i) A written contractual agreement between a vessel owner or operator and resource provider. This agreement must expressly provide that the resource provider is capable of, and intends to commit to, meeting the plan requirements.
(ii) A written certification that the personnel, equipment, and capabilities required by this subpart are available and under the vessel owner or operator's direct control. If the planholder has personnel, equipment and capabilities under their direct control, they need not contract those items with a resource provider.
(iii) An alternative approved by the Coast Guard (Assistant Commandant for Response Policy (CG-5R)) and submitted in accordance with 33 CFR 155.1065(f) and 155.5067(a).
(2) As part of the contract or other approved means you must develop and sign, with your resource provider, a written funding agreement. This funding agreement is to ensure that salvage and marine firefighting responses are not delayed due to funding negotiations. The funding agreement must include a statement of how long the agreement remains in effect, and must be provided to the Coast Guard for VRP approval. In addition any written agreement with a public resource provider must be included in the
planholder's Vessel Response Plan (VRP).
Diving services support
means divers and their equipment to support salvage operations. This support may include, but not be limited to, underwater repairs, welding, placing lifting slings, or performing damage assessments.
Emergency lightering
is the process of transferring oil between two ships or other floating or land-based receptacles in an emergency situation and may require pumping equipment, transfer hoses, fenders, portable barges, shore based portable tanks, or other equipment that circumstances may dictate.
Emergency towing,
also referred to as rescue towing, means the use of towing vessels that can pull, push or make-up alongside a vessel. This is to ensure that a vessel can be stabilized, controlled or removed from a grounded position. Towing vessels must have the proper horsepower or bollard pull compatible with the size and tonnage of the vessel to be assisted.
External emergency transfer operations
means the use of external pumping equipment placed on board a vessel to move oil from one tank to another, when the vessel's own transfer equipment is not working.
External firefighting teams
means trained firefighting personnel, aside from the crew, with the capability of boarding and combating a fire on a vessel.
External vessel firefighting systems
mean firefighting resources (personnel and equipment) that are capable of combating a fire from other than on board the vessel. These resources include, but are not limited to, fire tugs, portable fire pumps, airplanes, helicopters, or shore side fire trucks.
Funding agreement
is a written agreement between a resource provider and a planholder that identifies agreed upon rates for specific equipment and services to be made available by the resource provider under the agreement. The funding agreement is to ensure that salvage and marine firefighting responses are not delayed due to funding negotiations. This agreement must be part of the contract or other approved means and must be submitted for review along with the VRP.
Great Lakes
means Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, their connecting and tributary waters, the Saint Lawrence River as far as Saint Regis, and adjacent port areas.
Heavy lift
means the use of a salvage crane, A-frames, hydraulic jacks, winches, or other equipment for lifting, righting, or stabilizing a vessel.
Inland area
means the area shoreward of the boundary lines defined in 46 CFR part 7, except that in the Gulf of America, it means the area shoreward of the lines of demarcation (COLREG lines) as defined in §§ 80.740 through 80.850 of this chapter. The inland area does not include the Great Lakes.
Making temporary repairs
means action to temporarily repair a vessel to enable it to safely move to a shipyard or other location for permanent repairs. These services include, but are not limited to, shoring, patching, drill stopping, or structural reinforcement.
Marine firefighting
means any firefighting related act undertaken to assist a vessel with a potential or actual fire, to prevent loss of life, damage or destruction of the vessel, or damage to the marine environment.
Marine firefighting pre-fire plan
means a plan that outlines the responsibilities and actions during a marine fire incident. The principle purpose is to explain the resource provider's role, and the support which can be provided, during marine firefighting incidents. Policies, responsibilities and procedures for coordination of on-scene forces are provided in the plan. It should be designed for use in conjunction with other state, regional and local contingency and resource mobilization plans.
Nearshore area
means the area extending seaward 12 miles from the boundary lines defined in 46 CFR part 7, except in the Gulf of America. In the Gulf of America, a nearshore area is one extending seaward 12 miles from the line of demarcation (COLREG lines) as defined in §§ 80.740 through 80.850 of this chapter.
Offshore area
means the area up to 38 nautical miles seaward of the outer boundary of the nearshore area.
On-site fire assessment
means that a marine firefighting professional is on scene, at a safe distance from the vessel or on the vessel, who can determine
the steps needed to control and extinguish a marine fire in accordance with a vessel's stability and structural integrity assessment if necessary.
On-site salvage assessment
means that a salvage professional is on scene, at a safe distance from the vessel or on the vessel, who has the ability to assess the vessel's stability and structural integrity. The data collected during this assessment will be used in the salvage software calculations and to determine necessary steps to salve the vessel.
Other refloating methods
means those techniques for refloating a vessel aside from using pumps. These services include, but are not limited to, the use of pontoons, air bags or compressed air.
Outside continental United States (OCONUS)
means Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and any other territory or possession of the United States.
Primary resource provider
means a resource provider listed in the vessel response plan as the principal entity contracted for providing specific salvage and/or marine firefighting services and resources, when multiple resource providers are listed for that service, for each of the COTP zones in which a vessel operates. The primary resource provider will be the point of contact for the planholder, the Federal On Scene Coordinator (FOSC) and the Unified Command, in matters related to specific resources and services, as required in § 155.4030(a).
Remote assessment and consultation
means contacting the salvage and/or marine firefighting resource providers, by phone or other means of communications to discuss and assess the situation. The person contacted must be competent to consult on a determination of the appropriate course of action and initiation of a response plan.
Resource provider
means an entity that provides personnel, equipment, supplies, and other capabilities necessary to perform salvage and/or marine firefighting services identified in the response plan, and has been arranged by contract or other approved means. The resource provider must be selected in accordance with § 155.4050. For marine firefighting services, resource providers can include public firefighting resources as long as they are able, in accordance with the requirements of § 155.4045(d), and willing to provide the services needed.
Salvage
means any act undertaken to assist a vessel in potential or actual danger, to prevent loss of life, damage or destruction of the vessel and release of its contents into the marine environment.
Salvage plan
means a plan developed to guide salvage operations except those identified as specialized salvage operations.
Special salvage operations plan
means a salvage plan developed to carry out a specialized salvage operation, including heavy lift and/or subsurface product removal.
Subsurface product removal
means the safe removal of oil from a vessel that has sunk or is partially submerged underwater. These actions can include pumping or other means to transfer the oil to a storage device.
Underwater vessel and bottom survey
means having salvage resources on scene that can perform examination and analysis of the vessel's hull and equipment below the water surface. These resources also include the ability to determine the bottom configuration and type for the body of water. This service can be accomplished through the use of equipment such as sonar, magnetometers, remotely operated vehicles or divers. When divers are used to perform these services, the time requirements for this service apply and not those of diving services support.

The planholder must still contract for heavy lift services, provide a description of the heavy lift response and an estimated response time when these services are required, however, none of the timeframes listed in the table in § 155.4030(b) will apply to these services.
(c)
Integration into the response organization.
You must ensure that all
salvage
and
marine firefighting resource providers
are integrated into the response organizations listed in your plans. The response organization must be consistent with the requirements set forth in §§ 155.1035(d), 155.1040(d), 155.1045(d), and 155.5035(d).
(d)
Coordination with other response resource providers, response organizations and OSROs.
Your plan must include provisions on how the salvage and marine firefighting resource providers will coordinate with other response resources, response organizations, and OSROs. For example, you will need to identify how salvage and marine firefighting assessment personnel will coordinate response activity with oil spill removal organizations. For services that, by law, require public assistance, there must be clear guidelines on how service providers will interact with
those organizations. The information contained in the response plan must be consistent with applicable Area Contingency Plans (ACPs) and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan as found in §§ 155.1030(h) and 155.5030(f).
(e)
Ensuring the proper emergency towing vessels are listed in your VRP.
Your VRP must identify towing vessels with the proper characteristics, horsepower, and bollard pull to tow your vessel(s). These towing vessels must be capable of operating in environments where the winds are up to 40 knots.
(f)
Ensuring the proper type and amount of transfer equipment is listed in your VRP.
Your salvage resource provider must be able to bring on scene a pumping capability that can offload the vessel's largest cargo or fuel tank, whichever is greater, in 24 hours of continuous operation. This is required for both emergency transfer and lightering operations.
(g)
Ensuring firefighting equipment is compatible with your vessel.
Your plan must list the proper type and amount of extinguishing agent needed to combat an oil fire involving your vessel's cargo fuel, other contents, and superstructure. If your primary extinguishing agent is foam or water, you must identify resources in your plan that are able to pump, for a minimum of 20 minutes, at least 0.016 gallons per minute per square foot of the deck area of your vessel, or an appropriate rate for spaces that this rate is not suitable for and if needed, an adequate source of foam. These resources described are to be supplied by the resource provider, external to the vessel's own firefighting system.
(h)
Ensuring the proper subsurface product removal.
You must have subsurface product removal capability if your vessel(s) operates in waters of 40 feet or more. Your resource provider must have the capability of removing bulk liquid cargo and fuel from your sunken vessel to a depth equal to the maximum your vessel operates in up to 150 feet.
[USCG-1998-3417, 73 FR 80649, Dec. 31, 2008; 74 FR 7648, Feb. 19, 2009; USCG-2010-0351, 75 FR 36285, June 25, 2010; USCG-2008-1070, 78 FR 60124, Sept. 30, 2013]
§ 155.4032
Other resource provider considerations.
(a)
Use of resource providers not listed in the VRP.
If another resource provider, not listed in the approved plan for the specific service required, is to be contracted for a specific response, justification for the selection of that resource provider needs to be provided to, and approved by, the FOSC. Only under exceptional circumstances will the FOSC authorize deviation from the resource provider listed in the approved vessel response plan in instances where that would best affect a more successful response.
(b)
Worker health and safety.
Your resource providers must have the capability to implement the necessary engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment controls to safeguard their workers when providing salvage and marine firefighting services, as found in 33 CFR 155.1055(e) and 29 CFR 1910.120(q).
§ 155.4035
Required pre-incident information and arrangements for the salvage and marine firefighting resource providers listed in response plans.
(a) You must provide the information listed in §§ 155.1035(c), 155.1040(c), and 155.5035(c) to your salvage and marine firefighting resource providers.
(b)
Marine firefighting pre-fire plan.
(1) You must prepare a vessel pre-fire plan in accordance with NFPA 1405, Guide for Land-Based Firefighters Who Respond to Marine Vessel Fires, Chapter 9 (Incorporation by reference,
see
§ 155.140). If the planholder's vessel pre-fire plan is one that meets another regulation, such as SOLAS Chapter II-2, Regulation 15, or international standard, a copy of that specific fire plan must also be given to the resource provider(s) instead of the NFPA 1405 pre-fire plan, and be attached to the VRP.
(2) The marine firefighting resource provider(s) you are required to identify in your plan must be given a copy of the plan. Additionally, they must certify in writing to you that they find the plan acceptable and agree to implement it to mitigate a potential or actual fire.
(3) If a marine firefighting resource provider subcontracts to other organizations, each subcontracted organization must also receive a copy of the vessel pre-fire plan.
[USCG-1998-3417, 73 FR 80649, Dec. 31, 2008, as amended by USCG-2010-0351, 75 FR 36285, June 25, 2010; USCG-2008-1070, 78 FR 60124, Sept. 30, 2013]
§ 155.4040
Response times for each salvage and marine firefighting service.
(a) You must ensure, by contract or other approved means, that your resource provider(s) is capable of providing the services within the required timeframes.
(1) If your vessel is at the pier or transiting a COTP zone within the continental United States (CONUS), the timeframes in Table 155.4030(b) apply as listed.
(2) If your vessel is at the pier or transiting a COTP zone outside the continental United States (OCONUS), the timeframes in Table 155.4030(b) apply as follows:
(i) Inland waters and nearshore area timeframes apply from the COTP city out to and including the 12 mile point.
(ii) Offshore area timeframes apply from 12 to 50 miles outside the COTP city.
(3) If your vessel transits within an OCONUS COTP zone that is outside the areas described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, but within the inland waters or the nearshore or offshore area, you must submit in writing, in your plan, the steps you will take to address salvage and marine firefighting needs in the event these services are required.
(b) The timeframe starts when anyone in your response organization receives notification of a potential or actual incident. It ends when the service reaches the ship, the outer limit of the nearshore area, the outer limit of the offshore area, the 12 or 50-mile point from the COTP city, or a point identified in your response plan for areas OCONUS.
(c) Table 155.4040(c) provides additional amplifying information for vessels transiting within the nearshore and offshore areas of CONUS or within 50 miles of an OCONUS COTP city.

Heavy lift services are not required to have definite hours for a response time. The planholder must still contract for heavy lift services, provide a description of the heavy lift response and an estimated response time when these services are required, however, none of the timeframes listed in the table in § 155.4030(b) will apply to these services.
(d)
How to apply the timeframes to your particular situation.
To apply the timeframes to your vessel's situation, follow these procedures:
(1) Identify if your vessel operates CONUS or OCONUS.
(2) If your vessel is calling at any CONUS pier or an OCONUS pier within 50 miles of a COTP city, you must list the pier location by facility name or city and ensure that the marine firefighting resource provider can reach the locations within the specified response times in Table 155.4030(b).
(3) If your vessel is transiting within CONUS inland waters, nearshore or offshore areas or the Great Lakes, you must ensure the listed salvage and marine firefighting services are capable of reaching your vessel within the appropriate response times listed in Table 155.4030(b).
(4) If your vessel is transiting within 12 miles or less from an OCONUS COTP city, you must ensure the listed salvage and marine firefighting services are capable of reaching a point 12 miles from the harbor of the COTP city within the nearshore area response times listed in Table 155.4030(b).
(5) If your vessel is transiting between 12 and 50 miles from an OCONUS COTP city, you must ensure the listed salvage and marine firefighting services are capable of reaching a point 50 miles from the harbor of the COTP city within the offshore area response times listed in Table 155.4030(b).
(6) If your vessel transits inland waters or the nearshore or offshore areas OCONUS, but is more than 50 miles from a COTP city, you must still contract for salvage and marine firefighting services and provide a description of how you intend to respond and an estimated response time when these services are required, however, none of the time limits listed in Table 155.4030(b) will apply to these services.
§ 155.4045
Required agreements or contracts with the salvage and marine firefighting resource providers.
(a) You may only list resource providers in your plan that have been arranged by contract or other approved means.
(b) You must obtain written consent from the resource provider stating that they agree to be listed in your plan. This consent must state that the resource provider agrees to provide the services that are listed in §§ 155.4030(a) through 155.4030(h), and that these services are capable of arriving within the response times listed in Table 155.4030(b). This consent may be included in the contract with the resource provider or in a separate document.
(c) This written consent must be available to the Coast Guard for inspection. The response plan must identify the location of this written consent, which must be:
(1) On board the vessel; or
(2) With a qualified individual located in the United States.
(d) Public marine firefighters may only be listed out to the maximum extent of the public resource's jurisdiction, unless other agreements are in place. A public marine firefighting resource may agree to respond beyond their jurisdictional limits, but the Coast Guard considers it unreasonable to expect public marine firefighting resources to do this.
§ 155.4050
Ensuring that the salvors and marine firefighters are adequate.
(a) You are responsible for determining the adequacy of the resource providers you intend to include in your plan.
(b) When determining adequacy of the resource provider, you must select a resource provider that meets the following selection criteria to the maximum extent possible:

# Subpart J—Nontank Vessel Response Plans

# Source:
USCG-2009-1070, 78 FR 60124, Sept. 30, 2013, unless otherwise noted.
§ 155.5010
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to establish requirements for oil spill response plans for nontank vessels. The planning criteria in this subpart are intended for use in nontank vessel oil spill response plan development and the identification of resources necessary to respond to a nontank vessel's worst case discharge or substantial threat of such a discharge. The development of a nontank vessel response plan prepares the vessel's crew and ship management to respond to an oil spill. The specific criteria for response resources and their arrival times are not performance standards. They are planning criteria based upon a set of assumptions that may not exist during an actual oil spill incident. Note to § 155.5010: For nontank vessels that are mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs), additional oil spill planning standards are found in 30 CFR part 254.
§ 155.5012
Deviation from response plan.
The owner or operator of a nontank vessel required to have a vessel response plan (VRP) under this subpart
may not deviate from the approved VRP unless the President or Federal On-Scene Coordinator determines that the deviation from the VRP would provide for a more expeditious or effective response to the spill or mitigation of its environmental effects.
§ 155.5015
Applicability.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, this subpart applies to each self-propelled vessel that—
(1) Carries oil of any kind as fuel for main propulsion;
(2) Is not a tank vessel or is not certificated as a tank vessel;
(3) Operates upon the navigable waters of the United States, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(17a); and
(4) Is 400 gross tons or more as measured under the convention measurement system in 46 U.S.C. 14302 or the regulatory measurement system of 46 U.S.C. 14502 for vessels not measured under 46 U.S.C. 14302.
(b) This subpart also applies to vessels carrying oil as secondary cargo and that meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) For Integrated Tug Barge (ITB) units that are not certificated as tank vessels, the tonnage used to determine applicability of these regulations is the aggregate tonnage of the ITB combination, and the oil capacity used to determine the worst case discharge volume is the aggregate oil capacity of the ITB combination.

Tier
means the combination of required response resources and the times within which the resources must arrive on scene. Appendix B of this part, especially Tables 5 and 6, provide specific guidance on calculating the response resources required by a respective tier. Section 155.5050(g) sets forth the required times within which the response resources must arrive on scene. Tiers are applied to three categories of areas—
(1) Higher volume port areas;
(2) The Great Lakes; and
(3) All other operating environments, including rivers and canals, inland, nearshore, offshore, and open ocean areas.
Transfer
means any movement of oil to or from a vessel by means of pumping, gravitation, or displacement. A transfer is considered to begin when the person in charge of the transferring vessel or facility and the person in charge of the receiving facility or vessel first meet to begin completing the declaration of inspection required by 33 CFR 156.150. A transfer is considered to be complete when all the connections for the transfer have been uncoupled and secured with blanks or other closure devices and both of the persons in charge have completed the declaration of inspection to include the date and time they complete the transfer.

Petitions to the Coast Guard must be submitted in writing, via the Coast Guard official who issued the requirement to amend the VRP, within 5 days of receipt of the notice.
(b) Within 21 days of notification that a VRP is not approved, the vessel owner or operator may appeal that determination to the Director of Incident Management and Preparedness Policy (CG-5RI). This appeal must be submitted in writing to Commandant (CG-5RI), Attn: Director of Incident Management and Preparedness Policy, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7516, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7516.

# Appendix B to Part 155—Determining and Evaluating Required Response Resources for Vessel Response Plans

# 1. Purpose
1.1 The purpose of this appendix is to describe the procedures for identifying response resources to meet the requirements of subparts D, E, F, G, and J of this part. These guidelines will be used by the vessel owner or operator in preparing the response plan and by the Coast Guard to review vessel response plans. Response plans submitted under subparts F and G of this part will be evaluated under the guidelines in section 2 and Table 1 of this appendix.

# 2. Equipment Operability and Readiness
2.1 All equipment identified in a response plan must be capable of operating in the conditions expected in the geographic area in which a vessel operates. These conditions vary widely based on the location and season. Therefore, it is difficult to identify a single stockpile of response equipment that will function effectively in every geographic location.
2.2 Vessels storing, handling, or transporting oil in more than one operating environment as indicated in Table 1 must identify equipment capable of successfully functioning in each operating environment. For example, vessels moving from the ocean to a river port must identify appropriate equipment designed to meet the criteria for transiting oceans, inland waterways, rivers, and canals. This equipment may be designed to operate in all of these environments or, more likely, different equipment may be designed for use in each area.
2.3 When identifying equipment for response plan credit, a vessel owner or operator must consider the inherent limitations in the operability of equipment components and response systems. The criteria in Table 1 of this appendix must be used for evaluating the operability in a given environment. These criteria reflect the general conditions in certain operating areas.
2.4 Table 1 of this appendix lists criteria for oil recovery devices and boom. All other equipment necessary to sustain or support response operations in a geographic area must be designed to function in the same conditions. For example, boats which deploy or support skimmers or boom must be capable of being safely operated in the significant wave heights listed for the applicable operating environment. The Coast Guard may require documentation that the boom identified in a response plan meets the criteria in Table 1 of this appendix. Absent acceptable documentation, the Coast Guard may require that the boom be tested to demonstrate that it meets the criteria in Table 1 of this appendix. Testing must be in accordance with certain American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) standards [ASTM F 715 (incorporated by reference, see § 155.140) Standard Methods of Testing Spill Control Barrier Membrane Materials], or other tests approved by the Coast Guard.
2.5 A vessel owner or operator must refer to the applicable Area Contingency Plan to determine if ice, debris, and weather-related visibility are significant factors in evaluating the operability of equipment. The Area Contingency Plan will also identify the average temperature ranges expected in a geographic area in which a vessel operates. All equipment identified in a response plan must be designed to operate within those conditions or ranges.
2.6 The requirements of subparts D, E, F, G, and J of this part establish response resource mobilization and response times. The location where the vessel operates farthest from the storage location of the response resources must be used to determine whether the resources are capable of arriving on scene within the time required. A vessel owner or operator must include the time for notification, mobilization, and travel time of resources identified to meet the maximum most probable discharge and Tier 1 worst case discharge requirements. For subparts D and E of this part, Tier 2 and 3 resources must be notified and mobilized as necessary to meet the requirements for arrival on scene. An on-water speed of 5 knots and a land speed of 35 miles per hour is assumed, unless the vessel owner or operator can demonstrate otherwise.
2.7 For subparts D, E, and J of this part, in identifying equipment, the vessel owner or operator must list the storage location, quantity, and manufacturer's make and model, unless the oil spill removal organization(s) providing the necessary response resources have been evaluated by the Coast Guard, and their capability has been determined to equal or exceed the response capability needed by the vessel. For oil recovery devices, the effective daily recovery capacity, as determined using section 6 of this appendix, must be included. For boom, the overall boom height (draft plus freeboard) must be included. A vessel owner or operator must ensure that identified boom has compatible connectors.
2.8 For subparts F and G of this part, in identifying equipment, the vessel owner or operator shall list the storage location, quantity, and manufacturer's make and model, unless the oil spill removal organization(s) providing the necessary response resources have been evaluated by the Coast Guard, and their capability has been determined to equal or exceed the response capability needed by the vessel. For boom, the overall boom height (draft plus freeboard) must be included. A vessel owner of operator is responsible for ensuring that identified boom has compatible connectors.

# 3. Determining Response Resources Required for the Average Most Probable Discharge
3.1 A vessel owner or operator must identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means, that sufficient response resources are available to respond to the 50-barrel average most probable discharge at the point of an oil transfer involving a vessel that carries oil as a primary cargo or a nontank vessel carrying oil as cargo. The equipment must be designed to function in the operating environment at the point of oil transfer. These resources must include—
3.1.1 Containment boom in a quantity equal to twice the length of the largest vessel involved in the transfer capable of being deployed within 1 hour of the detection of a spill at the site of oil transfer operations. If the transfer operation is more than 12 miles from shore, the containment boom must be deployed within 1 hour plus the travel time from the nearest shoreline at a speed of 5 knots.
3.1.2 Oil recovery devices with an effective daily recovery capacity of 50 barrels or greater available at the transfer site within 2 hours of the detection of an oil discharge.
3.1.3 Oil storage capacity for recovered oily material indicated in section 9.2 of this appendix.

# 4. Determining Response Resources Required for the Maximum Most Probable Discharge
4.1 A vessel owner or operator shall identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means, that sufficient response resources are available to respond to discharges up to the maximum most probable discharge volume for that vessel. The resources should be capable of containing and collecting up to 2,500 barrels of oil. All equipment identified must be designed to operate in the applicable operating environment specified in table 1 of this appendix.
4.2 To determine the maximum most probable discharge volume to be used for planning, use the lesser of—
4.2.1 2500 barrels; or
4.2.2 Ten percent of the total oil capacity.
4.3 Oil recovery devices necessary to meet the applicable maximum most probable discharge volume planning criteria must be located such that they arrive on scene within 12 hours of the discovery of a discharge in higher volume port areas and the Great Lakes, 24 hours in all other rivers and canals, inland, nearshore, and offshore areas, and 24 hours plus travel time from shore in all open ocean areas.
4.3.1 Because rapid control, containment, and removal of oil is critical to reduce spill impact, the effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices must equal 50% of the planning volume applicable for the vessel as determined in section 4.2 of this appendix. The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices identified in the plan must be determined using the criteria in section 6 of this appendix.
4.4 In addition to oil recovery capacity, the vessel owner or operator must identify in the response plan and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, sufficient boom available within the required response times for oil connection and containment, and for protection of shoreline areas. While the regulation does not set required quantities of boom for oil collection and containment, the owner or operator of a vessel must still identify in a response plan and ensure, through contract or other approved means, the availability of the boom identified in the plan for this purpose.
4.5 The plan must indicate the availability of temporary storage capacity to meet the requirements of section 9.2 of this appendix. If available storage capacity is insufficient to meet this requirement, the effective daily recovery capacity must be downgraded to the limits of the available storage capacity.
4.6 The following is an example of a maximum most probable discharge volume planning calculation for equipment identification in a higher volume port area:
The vessel's cargo capacity is 10,000 barrels, thus the planning volume is 10 percent or 1,000 barrels. The effective daily recovery capacity must be 50 percent of the planning volume, for 500 barrels per day. The ability of oil recovery devices to meet this capacity will be calculated using the procedures in section 6 of this appendix. Temporary storage capacity available on scene must equal twice the daily recovery capacity as indicated in section 9 of this appendix, or 1000 barrels per day. This figure would represent the information the vessel owner or operator would use to identify and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, the required response resources. The vessel owner would also need to identify how much boom was available for use.

# 5. Determining Response Resources Required for the Worst Case Discharge to the Maximum Extent Practicable
5.1 A vessel owner or operator, as applicable under the regulations prescribed in this part, must identify and ensure, by contract or other approved means, that sufficient response resources are available to respond to the worst case discharge of oil to the maximum extent practicable. Section 7 of this appendix describes the method to determine the required response resources.
5.2 Oil spill recovery devices identified to meet the applicable worst case discharge planning volume must be located such that they can arrive at the scene of a discharge within the time specified for the applicable response tier listed in §§ 155.1050(g) and 155.5050(g).
5.3 The effective daily recovery capacity for oil recovery devices identified in a response plan must be determined using the criteria in section 6 of this appendix. A vessel owner or operator, as applicable under the regulations prescribed in this part, must identify the storage locations of all equipment that must be used to fulfill the requirements for each tier.
5.4 A vessel owner or operator, as applicable under the regulations prescribed in this part, must identify the availability of temporary storage capacity to meet the requirements of section 9.2 of this appendix. If available storage capacity is insufficient to meet this requirement, then the effective daily recovery capacity must be downgraded to the limits of the available storage capacity.
5.5 When selecting response resources necessary to meet the response plan requirements, the vessel owner or operator, as applicable under the regulations prescribed in this part, must ensure that a portion of those resources are capable of being used in close-to-shore response activities in shallow water. The following percentages of the on-water response equipment identified for the applicable geographic area must be capable of operating in waters of 6 feet or less depth:
(i) Open ocean—none.
(ii) Offshore—10 percent.
(iii) Nearshore, inland, Great Lakes, and rivers and canals—20 percent.
5.6 In addition to oil spill recovery devices and temporary storage capacity, a vessel owner or operator, as applicable under the regulations prescribed in this part, must identify in the response plan and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, sufficient boom that can arrive on scene within the required response times for oil containment and collection. The specific quantity of boom required for collection and containment will depend on the specific recovery equipment and strategies employed. Table 2 of this appendix lists the minimum quantities of additional boom
required for shoreline protection that a vessel owner or operator must identify in the response plan and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means.
5.7 A vessel owner or operator, as applicable under the regulations prescribed in this part, must also identify in the response plan and ensure, by contract or other approved means, the availability of an oil spill removal organization capable of responding to a shoreline cleanup operation involving the calculated volume of emulsified oil that might impact the affected shoreline. The volume of oil for which a vessel owner or operator should plan for should be calculated through the application of factors contained in Tables 3 and 4 of this appendix. The volume calculated from these tables is intended to assist the vessel owner or operator in identifying a contractor with sufficient resources. This planning volume is not used explicitly to determine a required amount of equipment and personnel.

# 6. Determining Effective Daily Recovery Capacity for Oil Recovery Devices
6.1 Oil recovery devices identified by a vessel owner or operator must be identified by manufacturer, model, and effective daily recovery capacity. These capacities must be to meet the applicable planning criteria for the average most probable discharge; maximum most probable discharge; and worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable.
6.2 For the purposes of determining the effective daily recovery capacity of oil recovery devices, the following method will be used. This method considers potential limitations due to available daylight, weather, sea state, and percentage of emulsified oil in the recovered material. The Coast Guard may assign a lower efficiency factor to equipment listed in a response plan if it determines that such a reduction is warranted.
6.2.1 The following formula must be used to calculate the effective daily recovery capacity:
R = T × 24 × E
R—Effective daily recovery capacity
T—Throughput rate in barrels per hour (nameplate capacity)
E—20% efficiency factor (or lower factor as determined by the Coast Guard)
6.2.2 For those devices in which the pump limits the throughput of liquid, throughput rate will be calculated using the pump capacity.
6.2.3 For belt or mop type devices, the throughput rate will be calculated using data provided by the manufacturer on the nameplate rated capacity for the device.
6.2.4 Vessel owners or operators including in the response plan oil recovery devices whose throughput is not measurable using a pump capacity or belt or mop capacity may provide information to support an alternative method of calculation. This information must be submitted following the procedures in section 6.5 of this appendix.
6.3 As an alternative to section 6.2 of this appendix, a vessel owner or operator may submit adequate evidence that a different effective daily recovery capacity should be applied for a specific oil recovery device. Adequate evidence is actual verified performance data in spill conditions or test using certain ASTM standards [ASTM F 631 (incorporated by reference, see § 155.140) Standard Method for Testing Full Scale Advancing Spill Removal Devices], or an equivalent test approved by the Coast Guard.
6.3.1 The following formula must be used to calculate the effective daily recovery capacity under this alternative:
R = D × U
R—Effective daily recovery capacity
D—Average Oil Recovery Rate in barrels per hour (Item 13.2.16 in ASTM F 631; or actual performance data)
U—Hours per day that a vessel owner or operator can document capability to operate equipment under spill conditions. Ten hours per day must be used unless a vessel owner or operator can demonstrate that the recovery operation can be sustained for longer periods.
6.4 A vessel owner or operator submitting a response plan shall provide data that supports the effective daily recovery capacities for the oil recovery devices listed. The following is an example of these calculations:
A weir skimmer identified in a response plan has a manufacturer's rated throughput at the pump of 267 gallons per minute (gpm).
267 gpm = 381 barrels per hour
R = 381 × 24 × .2 = 1,829 barrels per day
After testing using ASTM procedures, the skimmer's oil recovery rate is determined to be 220 gpm. The vessel owner or operator identifies sufficient resources available to support operations 12 hours per day.
220 gpm = 314 barrels per hour
R = 314 × 12 = 3,768 barrels per day
A vessel owner or operator will be able to use the higher capacity if sufficient temporary oil storage capacity is available.
6.5 Determinations of alternative efficiency factors under section 6.2 or alternative effective daily recovery capacities under section 6.3 of this appendix will be made by Commandant (CG-MER), Attn: Vessel Response Plans, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7516, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7516 or
vrp@uscg.mil.
Oil spill removal organizations or equipment manufacturers may submit required information on behalf of multiple vessel owners or operators.

# 7. Calculating the Worst Case Discharge Planning Volumes
7.1 A vessel owner or operator, as applicable under the regulations prescribed in this part, must plan for a response to a vessel's worst case discharge oil planning volume. The planning for on-water recovery must take into account a loss of some oil to the environment due to evaporation and natural dissipation, potential increases in volume due to emulsification, and the potential for deposit of some oil on the shoreline.
7.2 The following procedures must be used to calculate the planning volume used by a vessel owner or operator, as applicable under the regulations prescribed in this part, for determining required on-water recovery capacity:
7.2.1 The following must be determined: the total volume of oil cargo carried; the appropriate cargo group for the type of petroleum oil carried [persistent (groups II, III, and IV) or non-persistent (group I)]; and the geographic area(s) in which the vessel operates. For vessels carrying mixed cargoes from different petroleum oil groups, each group must be calculated separately. This information is to be used with Table 3 of this appendix to determine the percentages of the total cargo volume to be used for removal capacity planning. This table divides the cargo volume into three categories: oil lost to the environment; oil deposited on the shoreline; and oil available for on-water recovery.
7.2.2 The on-water oil recovery volume must be adjusted using the appropriate emulsification factor found in Table 4 of this appendix.
7.2.3 The adjusted volume is multiplied by the on-water oil recovery resource mobilization factor found in Table 5 of this appendix from the appropriate operating area and response tier to determine the total on-water oil recovery capacity in barrels per day that must be identified or contracted for to arrive on scene within the applicable time for each response tier. Table 5 specifies three tiers. For higher volume port areas, the contracted tiers of resources must be located such that they can arrive on scene within 12, 36, and 60 hours of the discovery of an oil discharge. For the Great Lakes, these tiers are 18, 42, and 66 hours. For rivers and canals, inland, nearshore, and offshore, these tiers are 24, 48, and 72 hours. For the open ocean area, these tiers are 24, 48, and 72 hours with an additional travel time allowance of 1 hour for every additional 5 nautical miles from shore. For nontank vessels, only Tier 1 is specified.
7.2.4 The resulting on-water recovery capacity in barrels per day for each tier is used to identify response resources necessary to sustain operations in the applicable geographic area. The equipment must be capable of sustaining operations for the time period specified in Table 3 of this appendix. A vessel owner or operator, as applicable under the regulations prescribed in this part, must identify and ensure the availability of, through contract or other approved means, sufficient oil spill recovery devices to provide the effective daily oil recovery capacity required. If the required capacity exceeds the applicable cap described in Table 6 of this appendix, then a vessel owner or operator must contract only for the quantity of resources required to meet the cap, but must identify sources of additional resources as indicated in § 155.1050(p). For a vessel that carries multiple groups of oil, the required effective daily recovery capacity for each group is calculated and summed before applying the cap.
7.3 The following procedures must be used to calculate the planning volume for identifying shoreline cleanup capacity:
7.3.1 The following must be determined: The total volume of oil carried; the appropriate group for the type of petroleum oil carried [persistent (groups II, III, and IV) or non-persistent (group I)]; and the geographic area(s) in which the vessel operates. For a vessel carrying different oil groups, each group must be calculated separately. Using this information, Table 3 of this appendix must be used to determine the percentages of the total oil volume to be used for shoreline cleanup resource planning.
7.3.2 The shoreline cleanup planning volume must be adjusted to reflect an emulsification factor using the same procedure as described in section 7.2.2 of this appendix.
7.3.3 The resulting volume will be used to identify an oil spill removal organization with the appropriate shoreline cleanup capability.
7.4 The following is an example of the procedure described above:
A vessel with a 100,000 barrel capacity for #6 oil (specific gravity .96) will move from a higher volume port area to another area. The vessel's route will be 70 miles from shore.
Cargo carried: 100,000 bbls. Group IV oil Emulsification factor (from Table 4 of this appendix): 1.4 Areas transited: Inland, Nearshore, Offshore, Open ocean
Planned % on-water recovery (from Table 3 of this appendix):
Inland 50%
Nearshore 50%
Offshore 40%
Open ocean 20%
Planned % oil onshore recovery (from Table 3 of this appendix):
Inland 70%
Nearshore 70%
Offshore 30%
Open ocean 30%
General formula to determine planning volume:
(planning volume) = (capacity) × (% from Table 3 of this appendix) × (emulsification factor from Table 4 of this appendix)
Planning volumes for on-water recovery:
Inland 100,000 × .5 × 1.4 = 70,000 bbls
Nearshore 100,000 × .5 × 1.4 = 70,000 bbls
Offshore 100,000 × .4 × 1.4 = 56,000 bbls
Open ocean 100,000 × .2 × 1.4 = 28,000 bbls
Planning volumes for on shore recovery:
Inland 100,000 × .7 × 1.4 = 98,000 bbls
Nearshore 100,000 × .7 × 1.4 = 98,000 bbls
Offshore 100,000 × .3 × 1.4 = 42,000 bbls
The vessel owner or operator must contract with a response resource capable of managing a 98,000-barrel shoreline cleanup in those areas where the vessel comes closer than 50 miles to shore.
Determining required resources for on-water recovery for each tier using mobilization factors: (barrel per day on-water recovery requirements) = (on-water planning volume as calculated above) × (mobilization factor from Table 5 of this appendix).

Since the requirements for Tier 1 for inland and nearshore exceed the caps, the vessel owner would only need to contract for 10,000 barrels per day for Tier 1. No additional equipment would be required to be identified because the required Tier 3 resources are below the Tier 3 caps.
10% of the on-water recovery capability for offshore, and 20% of the capability for inland/nearshore, for all tiers, must be capable of operating in water with a depth of 6 feet or less.
The vessel owner or operator would also be required to identify or contract for quantities of boom identified in Table 2 of this appendix for the areas in which the vessel operates.

# 8. Determining the Capability of High-Rate Response Methods
8.1 Calculate cumulative dispersant application capacity requirements as follows:
8.1.1 A vessel owner or operator, as applicable under the regulations prescribed in this part, must plan either for a dispersant capacity to respond to a vessel's worst case discharge of oil, or for the amount of the dispersant resource capability as required by § 155.1050(k)(3) of this subchapter, whichever is the lesser amount. When planning for the cumulative application capacity that is required, the calculations should account for the loss of some oil to the environment due to natural dissipation causes (primarily evaporation). The following procedure should be used to determine the cumulative application requirements:
8.1.2 Determine the WCD volume of oil carried in gallons, and the appropriate oil group for the type of petroleum oil carried (Groups II, III, IV). For vessels carrying different oil groups, assume a WCD using the oil group that constitutes the largest portion of the oil being carried, or the oil group with the smallest natural dissipation factor;
8.1.3 Multiply the WCD in gallons by the natural dissipation factor for the appropriate oil group as follows: Group II factor is 0.50; Group III factor is 0.30; and Group IV factor is 0.10. This represents the amount of oil that can be expected to be lost to natural dissipation. Subtract the WCD lost to natural dissipation from the total oil amount carried to determine the remaining oil available for treatment by dispersant-application; and
8.1.4 Multiply the oil available for dispersant treatment by the dispersant to oil planning application ratio of 1 part dispersant to 20 parts oil (0.05). The resulting number represents the cumulative total dispersant-application capability that must be ensured available within the first 60 hours.
8.1.5(i) The following is an example of the procedure described in paragraphs 8.1.1 through 8.1.4 above: A vessel with a 1,000,000 gallons capacity of crude oil (specific gravity 0.87) will transit through an area with pre-authorization for dispersant use in the nearshore environment on the U.S. East Coast.
WCD: 1,000,000 gallons, Group III oil.
Natural Dissipation Factor for Group III: 30 percent.
General formula to determine oil available for dispersant treatment: ((WCD)—[(WCD) × (natural dissipation factor)] = available oil.
E.g., 1,000,000 gal−(1,000,000 gal × 0.30) = 700,000 gallons of available oil.
Cumulative application capacity = Available oil × planning application ratio (1 gal dispersant/20 gals oil = 0.05).
E.g., 700,000 gal oil × (0.05) = 35,000 gallons cumulative dispersant-application capacity.
(ii) The requirements for cumulative dispersant-application capacity (35,000) for this
vessel's WCD is less than the overall dispersant capability cap for non-Gulf Coast waters required by § 155.1050(k) of this chapter. Because paragraph 8.1.1 of this appendix requires owners and operators to ensure the availability of the lesser of a vessel's dispersant requirements for WCD or the amount of the dispersant cap provided for in § 155.1050(k)(3), the vessel in this example would be required to ensure the availability of 35,000 gallons of dispersant. More specifically, this vessel would be required to meet the following tier requirements in § 155.1050(k), which total 35,000 gallons application:
Tier—1 4,125 gallons—Completed in 12 hours.
Tier—2 23,375 gallons—Completed in 36 hours.
Tier—3 7,500 gallons—Completed in 60 hours.
8.2 Determining Effective Daily Application Capacities “EDACs” for dispersant response systems as follows:
8.2.1 EDAC planning estimates for compliance with the dispersant application requirements in § 155.1050(k)(3) are to be based on:
8.2.1.1 The spill occurring at sites 50 nautical miles off shore furthest from the primary dispersant staging site(s);
8.2.1.2 Specific dispersant application platform operational characteristics identified in the EDSP or as demonstrated by operational tests;
8.2.1.3 Locations of primary dispersant staging sites; and
8.2.1.4 Locations and quantities of dispersant stockpiles.
8.2.2 EDAC calculations with supporting documentation must be submitted to the NSFCC for classification as a Dispersant Oil Spill Removal Organization.
8.2.3(i) EDAC can also be calculated using the EDSP (EDSP). The EDSP is a downloadable application that calculates EDAC for different dispersant response systems. It is located on the Internet at:
http://www.response.restoration.noaa.gov/spilltools
(ii) The DMP2 contains operating information for the vast majority of dispersant application platforms, to include aircraft, both rotary and fixed wing, and vessels. The DMP2 produces EDAC estimates by performing calculations that are based on performance parameters of dispersant application platforms, locations of primary dispersant staging sites, home based airport or port locations, and for planning purposes, a 50 mile from shore dispersant application site. The 50 mile offshore site used in the DMP2 would be the location furthest from the primary dispersant staging site identified in the vessel response plan.
8.2.4 For each Captain of the Port Zone where a dispersant response capability is required, the response plan must identify the following:
8.2.4.1 The type, number, and location of each dispersant application platform intended for use in meeting dispersant delivery requirements specified in § 155.1050(k)(3) of this chapter;
8.2.4.2 The amount and location of available dispersant stockpiles to support each platform; and
8.2.4.3 A primary staging site for each platform that will serve as its base of operations for the duration of the response.
8.3 In addition to the equipment and supplies required, a vessel owner or operator must identify a source of support to conduct the monitoring and post-use effectiveness evaluation required by applicable Local and Area Contingency Plans.
8.4 Identification of the resources for dispersant application does not imply that the use of this technique will be authorized. Actual authorization for use during a spill response will be governed by the provisions of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300) and the applicable Local or Area Contingency Plan.

# 9. Additional Equipment Necessary To Sustain Response Operations
9.1 A vessel owner or operator is responsible for ensuring that sufficient numbers of trained personnel, boats, aerial spotting aircraft, sorbent materials, boom anchoring materials, and other resources are available to sustain response operations to completion. All such equipment must be suitable for use with the primary equipment identified in the response plan. A vessel owner or operator is not required to list these resources in the response plan, but shall certify their availability.
9.2 A vessel owner or operator shall evaluate the availability of adequate temporary storage capacity to sustain the effective daily recovery capacities from equipment identified in the plan. Because of the inefficiencies of oil spill recovery devices, response plans must identify daily storage capacity equivalent to twice the effective daily recovery capacity required on scene. This temporary storage capacity may be reduced if a vessel owner or operator can demonstrate by waste stream analysis that the efficiencies of the oil recovery devices, ability to decant water, or the availability of alternative temporary storage or disposal locations in the area(s) the vessel will operate will reduce the overall volume of oily material storage requirements.
9.3 A vessel owner or operator shall ensure that their planning includes the capability to arrange for disposal of recovered oil products. Specific disposal procedures will be addressed in the applicable Area Contingency Plan.

Pt. 155, App. C

# Appendix C to Part 155—Training Elements for Oil Spill Response Plans

# 1. General
1.1 The portion of the plan dealing with training is one of the key elements of a response plan. This concept is clearly expressed by the fact that Congress, in writing the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, specifically included training as one of the sections required in a vessel or facility response plan. In reviewing submitted response plans, it has been noted that the plans often do not provide sufficient information in the training section of the plan for either the user or the reviewer of the plan. In some cases, plans simply state that the crew and others will be training in their duties and responsibilities, with no other information being provided. In other plans, information is simply given that required parties will receive the necessary worker safety training (HAZWOPER).
1.2 The training section of the plan need not be a detailed course syllabus, but it must contain sufficient information to allow the user and reviewer (or evaluator) to have an understanding of those areas that are believed to be critical. Plans should identify key skill areas and the training that is required to ensure that the individual identified will be capable of performing the duties prescribed to them. It should also describe how the training will be delivered to the various personnel. Further, this section of the plan must work in harmony with those sections of the plan dealing with exercises, the spill management team, and the qualified individual.
1.3 The material in this appendix C is not all-inclusive and is provided for guidance only.

# 2. Elements To Be Addressed
2.1 To assist in the preparation of the training section of a vessel response plan, some of the key elements that should be addressed are indicated in the following sections. Again, while it is not necessary that the comprehensive training program for the company be included in the response plan, it is necessary for the plan to convey the elements that define the program as appropriate.
2.2 An effective spill response training program should consider and address the following:
2.2.1 Notification requirements and procedures.
2.2.2 Communication system(s) used for the notifications.
2.2.3 Procedures to mitigate or prevent any discharge or a substantial threat of a discharge of oil resulting from—
2.2.3.1 Operational activities associated with internal or external fuel and cargo transfers;
2.2.3.2 Grounding or stranding;
2.2.3.3 Collision;
2.2.3.4 Explosion or fire;
2.2.3.5 Hull failure;
2.2.3.6 Excessive list; or
2.2.3.7 Equipment failure.
2.2.4 Procedures and arrangements for emergency towing.
2.2.5 When performing shipboard mitigation measures—
2.2.5.1 Ship salvage procedures;
2.2.5.2 Damage stability; and
2.2.5.3 Hull stress considerations.
2.2.6 Procedures for transferring responsibility for direction of response activities from vessel and facility personnel to the spill management team.
2.2.7 Familiarity with the operational capabilities of the contracted oil spill removal organizations and the procedures to notify and activate such organizations.
2.2.8 Familiarity with the contracting and ordering procedures to acquire oil spill removal organization resources.
2.2.9 Familiarity with the Area Contingency Plans.
2.2.10 Familiarity with the organizational structures that will be used to manage the response actions.
2.2.11 Responsibilities and duties of the spill management team members in accordance with designated job responsibilities.
2.2.12 Responsibilities and authority of the qualified individual as described in the vessel response plan and company response organization.
2.2.13 Responsibilities of designated individuals to initiate a response and supervise shore-based response resources.
2.2.14 Actions to take, in accordance with designated job responsibilities, in the event of a transfer system leak, tank overflow, or suspected fuel or cargo tank or hull leak.
2.2.15 Information on the oil handled by the vessel or facility, including familiarity with—
2.2.15.1 Cargo material safety data sheets (including oil carried as fuel);
2.2.15.2 Chemical characteristics of all oils carried as fuel or cargo;
2.2.15.3 Special handling procedures for all oils carried as fuel or cargo;
2.2.15.4 Health and safety hazards associated with all oils carried as fuel or cargo; and
2.2.15.5 Spill and firefighting procedures for all oils carried as fuel or cargo.
2.2.16 Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements for worker health and safety (29 CFR 1910.120).

# 3. Further Considerations
In drafting the training section of the response plan, some further considerations are noted below (these points are raised simply as a reminder):
3.1 The training program should focus on training provided to vessel personnel.
3.2 An organization is comprised of individuals, and a training program should be structured to recognize this fact by ensuring that training is tailored to the needs of the individuals involved in the program.
3.3 An owner or operator may identify equivalent work experience which fulfills specific training requirements.
3.4 The training program should include participation in periodic announced and unannounced exercises. This participation should approximate the actual roles and responsibilities of individuals as specified in the response plan.
3.5 Training should be conducted periodically to reinforce the required knowledge and to ensure an adequate degree of preparedness by individuals with responsibilities under the vessel response plan.
3.6 Training may be delivered via a number of different means; including classroom sessions, group discussions, video tapes, self study workbooks, resident training courses, on-the-job training, or other means as deemed appropriate to ensure proper instruction.
3.7 New employees should complete the training program prior to being assigned job responsibilities which require participation in emergency response situations.

# 4. Conclusion
The information in this appendix is only intended to assist response plan preparers in reviewing the content of and in modifying the training section of their response plans. It may be more comprehensive than is needed for some vessels and not comprehensive enough for others. The Coast Guard expects that plan preparers have determined the training needs of their organizations created by the development of the response plans and the actions identified as necessary to increase the preparedness of the company and its personnel to respond to actual or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels.

§ 156.112
Suspension order.
The COTP or OCMI may issue a suspension order to suspend transfer operations to the vessel or facility operator when the COTP or OCMI finds there is a condition requiring action to prevent the discharge or threat of discharge of oil or hazardous material, or when the COTP or OCMI is unable to verify compliance with the regulations through an inspection. A suspension order:
(a) May be effective immediately;
(b) Is issued in writing unless it is effective immediately and then it may be issued orally and followed up in writing;
(c) Includes a statement of each condition requiring correction to—
(1) Prevent the discharge of oil or hazardous material; or
(2) Comply with § 154.735 of this chapter; and
(d) Is withdrawn when the COTP, OCMI, or District Commander, as applicable, determines that the condition requiring action to prevent the discharge or threat of discharge of oil or hazardous material has been corrected or no longer exists.
[CGD 75-124, 45 FR 7177, Jan. 31, 1980, as amended by CGD 86-034, 55 FR 36255, Sept. 4, 1990]
§ 156.113
Compliance with suspension order.
(a) No vessel or facility operator to whom a suspension order has been issued may conduct transfer operations from the time the order is effective until that order is withdrawn by the applicable COTP, OCMI, or by the District Commander.
(b) The vessel or facility operator may request reconsideration of the suspension order either orally or in writing to the COTP or OCMI who issued it. The request may contain supporting documentation and evidence that the vessel or facility operator wishes to have considered.
(c) Any person not satisfied with a ruling made under the procedure contained in paragraph (b) of this section may appeal that ruling in writing, except as allowed under paragraph (e) of this section, to the Coast Guard District Commander of the district in which the suspension order was issued. The appeal may contain supporting documentation and evidence that the appellant wishes to have considered. The appeal does not stay the effect of the suspension order while the COTP or OCMI ruling is being reviewed. The District Commander issues a ruling after reviewing the appeal.
(d) The ruling by the District Commander is final agency action.
(e) If the delay in presenting a written appeal under paragraph (c) of this section would have a significant adverse impact on the appellant, the appeal may initially be presented orally. If an initial presentation of the appeal is made orally, the appellant must submit the appeal in writing within five days of the oral presentation to the District Commander to whom the oral appeal was made, containing, at a minimum the basis for the appeal and a summary of the material presented orally.

§ 157.09
Segregated ballast.
(a) A new vessel of 70,000 tons DWT or more must have segregated ballast tanks that have a total capacity to allow the vessel to meet the draft and trim requirements in paragraph (b) of this section without recourse to the use of oil tanks for water ballast.
(b) In any ballast condition during any part of a voyage, including that of lightweight with only segregated ballast, the vessel's drafts and trim must have the capability of meeting each of the following requirements:
(1) The molded draft amidship (dm) in meters without taking into account vessel deformation must not be less than dm in the following mathematical relationship:
dm = 2.0 + 0.02L
(2) The drafts at the forward and after perpendiculars must correspond to those determined by the draft amidship as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in association with the trim by the stern of no more than 0.015L.
(3) The minimum allowable draft at the after perpendicular is that which is necessary to obtain full immersion of the propeller.
(c) The vessel may be designed to carry ballast water in cargo tanks during the condition described in § 157.35.
(d) Segregated ballast spaces, voids, and other noncargo-carrying spaces for a vessel of conventional form must be distributed:
(1) So that the mathematical average of the hypothetical collision (O
c
) and the hypothetical stranding (O
s
) outflows as determined by the application of the procedures in § 157.19 and appendix B is 80 percent or less of the maximum allowable outflow (O
A
) as determined by § 157.19(b)(1); and
(2) To protect at least 45 percent of the sum of the side and bottom shell areas, based upon projected molded dimensions, within the cargo tank length. When the vessel design configuration does not provide for the spaces to be distributed to protect at least 45 percent of the side and bottom shell areas, the spaces must be distributed so that the mathematical average of the hypothetical collision (O
c
) and the hypothetical stranding (O
s
) outflows, determined by application of the procedures in § 157.19 and appendix B, is a further 2 percent less than the maximum allowable outflow (O
a
) for each 1 percent by which the shell area protection coverage required is not achieved.
(e) A ballast space, void or other non-cargo-carrying space used to meet requirements in paragraph (d) of this section must separate the cargo tank boundaries from the shell plating of the vessel by at least 2 meters.
(f) A vessel of conventional form for application of this section has:
(1) A block coefficient of .80 or greater,
(2) A length to depth ratio between 12 and 16, and
(3) A breadth to depth ratio between 1.5 and 3.5.

(1) The monitoring system must be capable of effectively monitoring and controlling the discharge of any effluent into the sea through those overboard discharge outlets permitted by § 157.11 that are necessary to fulfill the operational requirements of the oil tanker.
(2) The discharge of dirty ballast water or other oil-contaminated water from the cargo tank areas into the sea through outlets, which are not controlled by the monitoring system is prohibited.
(3) The monitoring system must function effectively under all environmental conditions normally encountered by oil tankers, and must be designed and constructed to satisfy the specifications for approval in 46 CFR subpart 162.050. Moreover—
(i) The system must be designed so a discharge of dirty-ballast or other oil-contaminated water from the cargo tank areas cannot take place unless the monitoring system is in the normal operating mode and the relevant sampling point has been selected;
(ii) The system should sample the effluent discharge from a minimum number of discharge outlets and be arranged so that discharge overboard can take place via only one outlet at a time;
(iii) Where it is intended that more than one line be used for simultaneous discharging purposes, one oil content meter, together with a flow meter, must be installed in each discharge line. These instruments must be connected to a common processor; and
(iv) To avoid alarms because of short-term high-oil-concentration signals (spikes) causing indications of high instantaneous rates of discharge, the short-term high ppm signal may be suppressed for a maximum of 10 seconds. Alternatively, the instantaneous rate of discharge may be continuously averaged during the preceding 20 seconds or less as computed from instantaneous ppm values of the oil content meter readings received at intervals not exceeding 5 seconds.
(4) The monitoring system must comprise—
(i) An oil content meter to measure the oil content of the effluent in ppm. The meter must be approved in accordance with the provisions contained in 46 CFR subpart 162.050 and certified to take into account the range of cargoes carried;
(ii) A flow rate indicating system to measure the rate of effluent being discharged into the sea;
(iii) A ship speed indicating device to give the ship's speed in knots;
(iv) A ship position indicating device to give the ship's position-latitude and longitude;
(v) A sampling system to convey a representative sample of the effluent to the oil content meter;

(4) Sampling probes must be arranged for easy withdrawal and must, as far as practicable, be mounted at an accessible location in a vertical section of the discharge line. Should it be necessary to fit sampling probes in a horizontal section of the discharge line it must be ascertained, during the installation survey, that the pipe runs full of liquid at all times during the discharge of the effluent. Sampling probes must normally penetrate inside the discharge pipe to a distance of one quarter the diameter of that pipe.
(5) Means must be provided for cleaning the probes and piping system by the provision of permanent clean water flushing arrangements or an equivalent method. The design of the probes and piping must be such as to minimize their clogging by oil, oily residue, and other matter.
(6) The velocity of the fluid in the piping must be such that, taking into consideration the length of the piping, the overall response time must be as short as possible between an alteration in the mixture being pumped and the alteration in the oil content meter reading. In no case should the response time, including the response time of the oil content meter, be more than 40 seconds.
(7) The location of sampling probes in relation to any point of flow diversion to a slop tank must be selected with regard to the need for sampling the oily water in the recirculation mode.
(8) The arrangements for driving the sampling pump or any other pumps used in the system must account for the safety requirements of the space in which the pump is located.

(2) A flow meter must employ an operating principle which is suitable for shipboard use and, where relevant, can be used in large diameter pipes.
(3) A flow meter must be suitable for the full range of flow rates that may be encountered during normal operation. Alternatively, arrangements such as the use of two flow meters of different ranges or a restriction of the operational flow rate range may be employed if necessary to meet this requirement.
(4) The flow meter, as installed, must have an accuracy of ±10 percent, or better, of the instantaneous rate of discharge throughout the operating range for discharging the effluent.
(5) Any component part of the flow meter in contact with the effluent should be of corrosion-resistant and oil-resistant material of adequate strength.
(6) The design of the flow metering arrangements must account for the safety requirements of the space in which such metering arrangements are located.
(d)
Ship's speed indicating system.

the Coast Guard as meeting 46 CFR 42.20-5.
(a) The final waterline, taking into account sinkage, heel, and trim, must be below the lower edge of an opening through which progressive flooding may take place, such as an air pipe, or any opening that is closed by means of a weathertight door or hatch cover. This opening does not include an opening closed by a:
(1) Watertight manhole cover;
(2) Flush scuttle;
(3) Small watertight cargo tank hatch cover that maintains the high integrity of the deck;
(4) Remotely operated watertight sliding door; or
