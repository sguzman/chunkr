refers to title 30, part 1, section 1.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 5.10
Purpose and scope.
This part establishes a system under which MSHA charges a fee for services provided. This part includes the management and calculation of fees for the approval program, which includes: Application processing, testing and evaluation, approval decisions, post-approval activities, and termination of approvals.
§ 5.30
Fee calculation.
(a)
Fee calculation.
MSHA charges a fee based on an hourly rate for Approval and Certification Center (A
CC) approval program activities and other associated costs, such as travel expenses and part 15 fees. Part 15 fees for services provided to MSHA by other organizations may be set by those organizations.
(b)
Hourly rate calculation.
The hourly rate consists of direct and indirect costs of the A
CC's approval program divided by the number of direct hours worked on all approval program activities.
(1) Direct costs are compensation and benefit costs for hours worked on approval program activities.
(2) Indirect costs are a proportionate share of the following A
CC costs:
(i) Compensation and benefit hours worked in support of all A
CC activities;
(ii) A
CC building and equipment depreciation costs;
(iii) A
CC utilities, facility and equipment maintenance, and supplies and materials; and
(iv) Information Technology and other services the Department of Labor provides to the A
CC.
(c)
Fees are charged for
—
(1) Application processing (
e.g.
, administrative and technical review of applications, computer tracking, and status reporting);
(2) Testing and evaluation (
e.g.
, analysis of drawings, technical evaluation, testing, test set up and test tear down, and internal quality control activities);
(3) Approval decisions (
e.g.
, consultation on applications, records control and security, document preparation); and
(4) Two post-approval activities: changes to approvals and post-approval product audits.
(d)
Fees are not charged for
—
(1) Technical assistance not related to processing an approval application;
(2) Technical programs, including development of new technology programs;
(3) Participation in research conducted by other government agencies or private organizations; and
(4) Regulatory review activities, including participation in the development of health and safety standards, regulations, and legislation.
(e)
Fee estimate.
Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, on completion of an initial administrative review of the application, the A
CC will prepare a maximum fee estimate for each application. A
CC will begin the technical evaluation after the applicant authorizes the fee estimate.
(1) The applicant may pre-authorize an expenditure for services, and may further choose to pre-authorize either a maximum dollar amount or an expenditure without a specified maximum amount.
(i) All applications containing a pre-authorization statement will be put in the queue for the technical evaluation on completion of an initial administrative review.
(ii) MSHA will concurrently prepare a maximum fee estimate for applications containing a statement pre-authorizing a maximum dollar amount, and will provide the applicant with this estimate.
(2) Where MSHA's estimated maximum fee exceeds the pre-authorized maximum dollar amount, the applicant has the choice of cancelling the action and paying for all work done up to the time of the cancellation, or authorizing MSHA's estimate.
(3) Under the Revised Acceptance Modification Program (RAMP), MSHA expedites applications for acceptance of minor changes to previously approved, certified, accepted, or evaluated products. The applicant must pre-authorize a fixed dollar amount, set by MSHA, for processing the application.
(f) If unforeseen circumstances are discovered during the evaluation, and MSHA determines that these circumstances would result in the actual costs exceeding either the pre-authorized expenditure or the authorized maximum fee estimate, as appropriate, MSHA will prepare a revised maximum fee estimate for completing the evaluation. The applicant will have the option of either cancelling the action and paying for services rendered or authorizing MSHA's revised estimate, in which case MSHA will continue to test and evaluate the product.
(g) If the actual cost of processing the application is less than MSHA's maximum fee estimate, MSHA will charge the actual cost.
§ 5.40
Fee administration.
Applicants and approval holders will be billed for all fees, including actual travel expenses, if any, when approval program activities are completed. Invoices will contain specific payment instruction, including the address to mail payments and authorized methods of payment.
§ 5.50
Fee revisions.
The hourly rate will remain in effect for at least one year and be subject to revision at least once every three years.

§ 6.1
Purpose and effective date.
This part sets out alternate requirements for testing and evaluation of products MSHA approves for use in gassy underground mines. It permits manufacturers of certain products who seek MSHA approval to use an independent laboratory to perform, in whole or part, the necessary testing and evaluation for approval. It also permits manufacturers to have their products approved based on non-MSHA product safety standards once MSHA has determined that the non-MSHA standards are equivalent to MSHA's applicable product approval requirements or can be modified to provide at least the same degree of protection as those MSHA requirements. The provisions of this part may be used by applicants for product approval under parts 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 33, 35, and 36. This rule is effective August 18, 2003.
§ 6.2
Definitions.
The following definitions apply in this part.
Applicant.
An individual or organization that manufactures or controls the assembly of a product and applies to MSHA for approval of that product.
Approval.
A written document issued by MSHA which states that a product has met the applicable requirements of part 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 33, 35, or 36. The definition is based on the existing definitions of “approval” in the parts specified above. It is expanded to include “certification” and “acceptance” because these terms also are used to denote MSHA approval.
Approval holder.
An applicant whose application for approval of a product under part 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 33, 35 or 36 of this chapter has been approved by MSHA.
Equivalent non-MSHA product safety standards.
A non-MSHA product safety standard, or group of standards, determined by MSHA to provide at least the same degree of protection as the applicable MSHA product approval requirements in parts 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 33, 35, and 36, or which in modified form provide at least the same degree of protection.
Independent laboratory.
A laboratory that:
(1) has been recognized by a laboratory accrediting organization to test and evaluate products to a product safety standard, and
(2) is free from commercial, financial, and other pressures that may influence the results of the testing and evaluation process.
Post-approval product audit.
The examination, testing, or both, by MSHA of approved products selected by MSHA to determine whether those products meet the applicable product approval requirements and have been manufactured as approved.
Product safety standard.
A document, or group of documents, that specifies the requirements for the testing and evaluation of a product for use in explosive gas and dust atmospheres, and, when appropriate, includes documents addressing the flammability properties of products.
[68 FR 36417, June 17, 2003, as amended at 73 FR 80609, Dec. 31, 2008]
§ 6.10
Use of independent laboratories.
(a) MSHA will accept testing and evaluation performed by an independent laboratory for purposes of MSHA product approval provided that MSHA receives as part of the application:
(1) Written evidence of the laboratory's independence and current recognition by a laboratory accrediting organization;
(2) Complete technical explanation of how the product complies with each requirement in the applicable MSHA product approval requirements;
(3) Identification of components or features of the product that are critical to the safety of the product; and
(4) All documentation, including drawings and specifications, as submitted to the independent laboratory by the applicant and as required by the applicable part under this chapter.
(b) Product testing and evaluation performed by independent laboratories for purposes of MSHA approval must comply with the applicable MSHA product approval requirements.
(c) Product testing and evaluation must be conducted or witnessed by the laboratory's personnel.
(d) After review of the information required under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, MSHA will notify the applicant if additional information or testing is required. The applicant must provide this information, arrange any additional or repeat tests and notify MSHA of the location, date, and time of the test(s). MSHA may observe any additional testing conducted by an independent laboratory. Further, MSHA may decide to conduct the additional or repeated tests at the applicant's expense. The applicant must supply any additional components necessary for testing and evaluation.
(e) Upon request by MSHA, but not more than once a year, except for cause, approval holders of products approved based on independent laboratory testing and evaluation must make such products available for post-approval audit at a mutually agreeable site at no cost to MSHA.
(f) Once the product is approved, the approval holder must notify MSHA of all product defects of which they become aware.
§ 6.20
MSHA acceptance of equivalent non-MSHA product safety standards.
(a) MSHA will accept non-MSHA product safety standards, or groups of standards, as equivalent after determining that they:
(1) Provide at least the same degree of protection as MSHA's product approval requirements in parts 14, 18, 19, 20, 33, 35 and 36 of this chapter; or
(2) Can be modified to provide at least the same degree of protection as those MSHA requirements.
(b) MSHA will publish its intent to review any non-MSHA product safety standard for equivalency in the
Federal Register
for the purpose of soliciting public input.
(c) A listing of all equivalency determinations will be published in this part 6 and the applicable approval parts. The listing will state whether MSHA accepts the non-MSHA product safety standards in their original form, or whether MSHA will require modifications to demonstrate equivalency. If modifications are required, they will be provided in the listing. MSHA will notify the public of each equivalency determination and will publish a summary of the basis for its determination. MSHA will provide equivalency determination reports to the public upon request to the Approval and Certification Center.
(d) After MSHA has determined that non-MSHA product safety standards are equivalent and has notified the public of such determinations, applicants may seek MSHA product approval based on such non-MSHA product safety standards.
[68 FR 36417, June 17, 2003, as amended at 73 FR 80609, Dec. 31, 2008]
§ 6.30
MSHA listing of equivalent non-MSHA product safety standards.
MSHA evaluated the following non-MSHA product safety standards and determined that they provide at least the same degree of protection as current MSHA requirements with or without modifications as indicated:
(a) The International Electrotechnical Commission's (IEC) standards for Electrical Apparatus for Explosive Gas Atmospheres, Part 0, General Requirements (IEC 60079-0, Fourth Edition, 2004-01) and Part 1, Electrical Apparatus for Explosive Gas Atmospheres, Flameproof Enclosures “d” (IEC 60079-1, Fifth Edition, 2003-11) must be modified in order to provide at least the same degree of protection as MSHA explosion-proof enclosure requirements included in parts 7 and 18 of this chapter. Refer to §§ 7.10(c)(1) and 18.6(a)(3)(i) for a list of the required modifications. The IEC standards may be inspected at the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Electrical Safety Division, Approval and Certification Center, 765 Technology Drive, Triadelphia, WV 26059, and may be purchased from International Electrical Commission, Central Office 3, rue de Varembé, P.O. Box 131, CH-1211 GENEVA 20, Switzerland.

The Director of the Federal Register approves this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. The IEC standards may be inspected at the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Electrical Safety Division, Approval and Certification Center, 765 Technology Drive, Triadelphia, WV 26059, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:
http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.
These IEC standards may be obtained from International Electrical Commission, Central Office 3, rue de Varembé, P.O. Box 131, CH-1211 GENEVA 20, Switzerland.
(i) Enclosures associated with an electric motor assembly shall be made of metal and not have a compartment exceeding ten (10) feet in length. External surfaces of enclosures shall not exceed 150 °C (302 °F) in normal operation.
(ii) Enclosures shall be rugged in construction and should meet existing requirements for minimum bolt size and spacing and for minimum wall, cover, and flange thicknesses specified in paragraph (g)(19) of § 7.304 Technical requirements. Enclosure fasteners should be uniform in size and length, be provided at all corners, and be secured from loosening by lockwashers or equivalent. An engineering analysis shall be provided for enclosure designs that deviate from the existing requirements. The analysis shall show that the proposed enclosure design meets or exceeds the mechanical strength of a comparable enclosure designed to 150 psig according to existing requirements, and that flamepath clearances in excess of existing requirements will not be produced at an internal pressure of 150 psig. This shall be verified by explosion testing the enclosure at a minimum of 150 psig.
(iii) Enclosures shall be designed to withstand a minimum pressure of at least 150 psig without leakage through any welds or castings, rupture of any part that affects explosion-proof integrity, clearances exceeding those permitted under existing requirements along flame-arresting paths, or permanent distortion exceeding 0.040-inch per linear foot.
(iv) Flamepath clearances, including clearances between fasteners and the holes through which they pass, shall not exceed those specified in existing requirements. No intentional gaps in flamepaths are permitted.
(v) The minimum lengths of the flame arresting paths, based on enclosure volume, shall conform to those specified in existing requirements to the nearest metric equivalent value (e.g., 12.5 mm, 19 mm, and 25 mm are considered equivalent to
1/2
inch,
3/4
inch and 1 inch respectively for plane and cylindrical joints). The widths of any grooves for o-rings shall be deducted in measuring the widths of flame-arresting paths.
(vi) Gaskets shall not be used to form any part of a flame-arresting path. If o-rings are installed within a flamepath, the location of the o-rings shall meet existing requirements.
(vii) Cable entries into enclosures shall be of a type that utilizes either flame-resistant rope packing material or sealing rings (grommets). If plugs and mating receptacles are mounted to an enclosure wall, they shall be of explosion-proof construction. Insulated bushings or studs shall not be installed in the outside walls of enclosures. Lead entrances utilizing sealing compounds and flexible or rigid metallic conduit are not permitted.
(viii) Unused lead entrances shall be closed with a metal plug that is secured by spot welding, brazing, or equivalent.
(ix) Special explosion tests are required for electric motor assemblies that share leads (electric conductors)
through a common wall with another explosion-proof enclosure, such as a motor winding compartment and a conduit box. These tests are required to determine the presence of any pressure piling conditions in either enclosure when one or more of the insulating barriers, sectionalizing terminals, or other isolating parts are sequentially removed from the common wall between the enclosures. Enclosures that exhibit pressures during these tests that exceed those specified in existing requirements must be provided with a warning tag. The durable warning tag must indicate that the insulating barriers, sectionalizing terminals, or other isolating parts be maintained in order to insure the explosion-proof integrity for either enclosure sharing a common wall. A warning tag is not required if the enclosures withstand a static pressure of twice the maximum value observed in the explosion tests.
(2) [Reserved]
(d) After MSHA has determined that non-MSHA product safety standards are equivalent and has notified the public of such determinations, applicants may seek MSHA product approval based on such non-MSHA product safety standards.

-inches long and spaced alternately along the length of the burner tube. The burner jets must be canted so that they point toward each other in pairs and the flame from these pairs impinge upon each other.
§ 7.27
Test for flame resistance of brattice cloth.
(a)
Test procedures.
(1) Prepare 6 samples of brattice cloth 40 inches wide by 48 inches long.
(2) Prior to testing, condition each sample for a minimum of 24 hours at a temperature of 70 ±10 °F (21 ±5.5 °C) and a relative humidity of 55 ±10%.
(3) For each test, suspend the sample in the gallery by wrapping the brattice cloth around the rod and clamping each end and the center. The brattice cloth must hang 4 inches from the gallery floor.
(4) Use a front exhaust system to remove smoke escaping from the gallery. The exhaust system must remain on during all testing, but not affect the air flow in the gallery.
(5) Set the methane-fueled impinged jet burner to yield a flame height of 12
inches as measured at the outermost tip of the flame.
(6) Apply the burner to the front lower edge of the brattice cloth and keep it in contact with the material for 25 seconds or until 1 foot of material, measured horizontally, is consumed, whichever occurs first. If the material shrinks during application of the burner flame, move the burner flame to maintain contact with 1 foot of the material. If melting material might clog the burner orifices, rotate the burner slightly during application of the flame.
(7) Test 3 samples in still air and 3 samples with an average of 125 ft./min. of air flowing past the sample.
(8) Record the propagation length and duration of burning for each of the 6 samples. The duration of burning is the total burning time of the specimen during the flame test. This includes the burn time of any material that falls on the floor of the test gallery during the igniting period. However, the suspended specimen is considered burning only after the burner is removed. Should the burning time of a suspended specimen and a specimen on the floor coincide, count the coinciding burning time only once.
(9) Calculate the average duration of burning for the first 3 samples (still air) and the second 3 samples (125 ft./min. air flow).
(b)
Acceptable performance.
The brattice cloth shall meet each of the following criteria:
(1) Flame propagation of less than 4 feet in each of the six tests.
(2) An average duration of burning of less than 1 minute in both groups of three tests.
(3) A duration of burning not exceeding two minutes in each of the six tests.

§ 7.28
Test for flame resistance of rigid ventilation tubing.
(a)
Test procedures.
(1) Prepare 6 samples of ventilation tubing 48 inches in length with all flared or thickened ends removed. Any sample with a cross-sectional dimension greater than 24 inches must be tested in a 24-inch size.
(2) For each test, suspend the sample in the center of the gallery by running a wire through the 48-inch length of tubing.
(3) Use a front exhaust system to remove smoke escaping from the gallery. The exhaust system must remain on during all testing but not affect the air flow in the gallery.
(4) Set the methane-fueled impinged jet burner to yield a flame height of 12 inches as measured at the outermost tip of the flame.
(5) Apply the burner to the front lower edge of the tubing so that two-thirds of the burner is under the tubing and the remaining third is exposed to allow the flames to curl onto the inside of the tubing. Keep the burner in contact with the material for 60 seconds. If melting material might clog the burner orifices, rotate the burner slightly during application of the flame.
(6) Test 3 samples in still air and 3 samples with an average of 125 ft./min. of air flowing past the sample.
(7) Record the propagation length and duration of burning for each of the 6 samples. The duration of burn is the total burning time of the specimen during the flame test. This includes the burning time of any material that falls on the floor of the test gallery during the igniting period. However, the suspended specimen is considered burning only after the burner is removed. Should the burning time of a suspended specimen and a specimen on the floor coincide, count the coinciding burn time only once.
(8) Calculate the average duration of burning for the first 3 samples (still air) and the second 3 samples (125 ft./min. air flow).
(b)
Acceptable performance.
The ventilation tubing shall meet each of the following criteria:
(1) Flame propagation of less than 4 feet in each of the 6 tests.
(2) An average duration of burning of less than 1 minute in both groups of 3 tests.

§ 7.100
Explosion tests.
(a)
Test procedures.
(1) Prepare to test the diesel power package as follows:
(i) Perform a detailed check of parts against the drawings and specifications submitted under § 7.97 to determine that the parts and drawings agree.
(ii) Remove all parts that do not contribute to the operation or ensure the explosion-proof integrity of the diesel power package such as the air cleaner and exhaust gas dilution system.
(iii) Fill coolant system fluid and engine oil to the engine manufacturer's recommended levels.
(iv) Interrupt fuel supply to the injector pump.
(v) Establish a preliminary low water level for systems using the wet exhaust conditioner as a flame arrester.
(2) Perform static and dynamic tests of the intake system as follows:
(i) Install the diesel power package in an explosion test chamber which is large enough to contain the complete diesel power package. The chamber must be sufficiently darkened and provide viewing capabilities of the flame-arresting paths to allow observation during testing of any discharge of flame or ignition of the flammable mixture surrounding the diesel power package. Couple the diesel power package to an auxiliary drive mechanism. Attach a pressure measuring device, a temperature measuring device, and an ignition source to the intake system. The pressure measuring device shall be capable of indicating the peak pressure accurate to ±1 pound-per-square inch gauge (psig) at 100 psig static pressure and shall have a frequency response of 40 Hertz or greater. The ignition source shall be an electric spark with a minimum energy of 100 millijoules. The ignition source shall be located immediately adjacent to the intake manifold and the pressure and temperature devices shall be located immediately adjacent to the flame arrester.
(ii) For systems using the wet exhaust conditioner as an exhaust flame arrester, fill the exhaust conditioner to the specified high or normal operating water level.
(iii) Fill the test chamber with a mixture of natural gas and air or methane and air. If natural gas is used, the content of combustible hydrocarbons shall total at least 98.0 percent, by volume, with the remainder being inert. At least 80.0 percent, by volume, of the gas shall be methane. For all tests, the methane or natural gas concentration shall be 8.5 ±1.8 percent, by volume, and the oxygen concentration shall be no less than 18 percent, by volume.
(iv) Using the auxiliary drive mechanism, motor the engine to fill the intake and exhaust systems with the flammable mixture. The intake system, exhaust system, and test chamber gas concentration shall not differ by more than ±0.3 percent, by volume, at the time of ignition.
(v) For static tests, stop the engine, actuate the ignition source, and observe the peak pressure. The peak pressure shall not exceed 110 psig. If the peak pressure exceeds 110 psig, construction changes shall be made that result in a reduction of pressure to 110
psig or less, or the system shall be tested in accordance with the static pressure test of § 7.104 with the pressure parameter replaced with a static pressure of twice the highest value recorded.
(vi) If the peak pressure does not exceed 110 psig or if the system meets the static pressure test requirements of this section and there is no discharge of visible flames or glowing particles or ignition of the flammable mixture in the chamber, a total of 20 tests shall be conducted in accordance with the explosion test specified above.
(vii) For dynamic tests, follow the same procedures for static tests, except actuate the ignition source while motoring the engine. Forty dynamic tests shall be conducted at two speeds, twenty at 1800 ±200 RPM and twenty at 1000 ±200 RPM. Under some circumstances, during dynamic testing the flammable mixture may continue to burn within the diesel power package after ignition. This condition can be recognized by the presence of a rumbling noise and a rapid increase in temperature. This can cause the flame-arrester to reach temperatures which can ignite the surrounding flammable mixture. Ignition of the flammable mixture in the test chamber under these circumstances does not constitute failure of the flame arrester. However; if this condition is observed, the test operator should immediately stop the engine and allow components to cool to prevent damage to the components.
(3) Perform static and dynamic tests of the exhaust system as follows:
(i) Prepare the diesel power package for explosion tests according to § 7.100(a)(2)(i) as follows:
(A) Install the ignition source immediately adjacent to the exhaust manifold.
(B) Install pressure measuring devices in each segment as follows: immediately adjacent to the exhaust conditioner inlet; in the exhaust conditioner; and immediately adjacent to the flame arrester, if applicable.
(C) Install a temperature device immediately adjacent to the exhaust conditioner inlet.
(ii) If the exhaust system is provided with a spaced-plate flame arrester in addition to an exhaust conditioner, explosion tests of the exhaust system shall be performed as described for the intake system in accordance with this section. Water shall not be present in a wet exhaust conditioner for the tests.
(iii) If the wet exhaust conditioner is used as the exhaust flame arrester, explosion testing of this type of system shall be performed as described for the intake system in accordance with this section with the following modifications:
(A) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at 2 inches below the minimum allowable low water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be opened. These openings may include lines which connect the reserve water supply to the wet exhaust conditioner, insert flanges, float flanges, and cover plates. These entrances are opened during this test to verify that they are not flame paths.
(B) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at 2 inches below the minimum allowable low water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner (except the exhaust conditioner outlet) which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be closed. These openings are closed to simulate normal operation.
(C) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at the specified high or normal operating water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be opened.
(D) Twenty static tests, twenty dynamic tests at 1800 ±200 RPM, and twenty dynamic tests at 1000 ±200 RPM shall be conducted at the specified high or normal operating water level. All entrances in the wet exhaust conditioner (except the exhaust conditioner outlet) which do not form explosion-proof joints shall be closed.
(iv) After successful completion of the explosion tests of the exhaust system, the minimum allowable low water level, for a wet exhaust conditioner used as the exhaust flame arrester, shall be determined by adding two
inches to the lowest water level that passed the explosion tests.
(v) A determination shall be made of the maximum grade on which the wet exhaust conditioner can be operated retaining the flame-arresting characteristics.
(b)

The explosion tests shall not result in any of the following—
(1) Discharge of flame or glowing particles.
(2) Visible discharge of gas through gasketed joints.
(3) Ignition of the flammable mixture in the test chamber.

(5) Clearances, in excess of those specified in this subpart, along accessible flame-arresting paths, following any necessary retightening of fastenings.
(6) Pressure exceeding 110 psig, unless the intake system or exhaust system has withstood a static pressure of twice the highest value recorded in the explosion tests of this section following the static pressure test procedures of § 7.104.
(7) Permanent distortion of any planar surface of the diesel power package exceeding 0.04-inches/linear foot.
(8) Permanent deformation exceeding 0.002-inch between the plates of spaced-plate flame arrester designs.

explosive gas mixture to surround and fill the motor assembly being tested. The chamber must be sufficiently darkened and provide viewing capabilities of the flame-arresting paths to allow observation during testing of any discharge of flame or ignition of the explosive mixture surrounding the motor assembly.
(2) A methane gas supply with at least 98 by volume per centum of combustible hydrocarbons, with the remainder being inert. At least 80 percent by volume of the gas shall be methane.
(3) Coal dust having a minimum of 22 percent dry volatile matter and a minimum heat constant of 11,000 moist BTU (coal containing natural bed moisture but not visible surface water) ground to a fineness of minus 200 mesh U.S. Standard sieve series.
(4) An electric spark ignition source with a minimum of 100 millijoules of energy.
(5) A pressure recording system that will indicate the pressure peaks resulting from the ignition and combustion of explosive gas mixtures within the enclosure being tested.
(b)
General test procedures.
(1) Motor assemblies being tested shall—
(i) Be equipped with unshielded bearings regardless of the type of bearings specified; and
(ii) Have all parts that do not contribute to the operation or assure the explosion-proof integrity of the enclosure, such as oil seals, grease fittings, hose conduit, cable clamps, and outer bearing caps (which do not house the bearings) removed from the motor assembly.
(2) Each motor assembly shall be placed in the explosion test chamber and tested as follows:
(i) The motor assembly shall be filled with and surrounded by an explosive mixture of the natural gas supply and air. The chamber gas concentrations shall be between 6.0 by volume per centum and the motor assembly natural gas concentration just before ignition of each test. Each externally visible flame-arresting path fit shall be observed for discharge of flames for at least two of the tests, including one with coal dust added.
(ii) A single spark source is used for all testing. Pressure shall be measured at each end of the winding compartment simultaneously during all tests. Quantity and location of test holes shall permit ignition on each end of the winding compartment and recording of pressure on the same and opposite ends as the ignition.
(iii) Motor assemblies incorporating a conduit box shall have the pressure in the conduit box recorded simultaneously with the other measured pressures during all tests. Quantity and location of test holes in the conduit box shall permit ignition and recording of pressure as required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4)(i) of this section.
(iv) The motor assembly shall be completely purged and recharged with a fresh explosive gas mixture from the chamber or by injection after each test. The chamber shall be completely purged and recharged with a fresh explosive gas mixture as necessary. The oxygen level of the chamber gas mixture shall be no less than 18 percent by volume for testing. In the absence of oxygen monitoring equipment, the maximum number of tests conducted before purging shall be less than or equal to the chamber volume divided by forty times the volume occupied by the motor assembly.
(c)
Test procedures.
(1) Eight tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume within the winding compartment shall be conducted, with the rotor stationary during four tests and rotating at rated speed (rpm) during four tests. The ignition shall be at one end of the winding compartment for two stationary and two rotating tests, and then switched to the opposite end for the remaining four tests. If a nonisolated conduit box is used, then two additional tests, one stationary and one rotating, shall be conducted with ignition in the conduit box at a point furthest away from the opening between the conduit box and the winding compartment.
(2) Four tests at 7.0 ±0.3 percent methane by volume within the winding compartment shall be conducted with the rotor stationary, 2 ignitions at each end.
(3) Four tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume plus coal dust shall be conducted. A quantity of coal dust
equal to 0.05 ounces per cubic foot of internal free volume of the winding compartment plus the nonisolated conduit box shall be introduced into each end of the winding compartment and nonisolated conduit box to coat the interior surface before conducting the first of the four tests. The coal dust introduced into the conduit box shall be proportional to its volume. The remaining coal dust shall be equally divided between the winding compartment ends. For two tests, one stationary and one rotating, the ignition shall be either in the conduit box or one end of the connected winding compartment, whichever produced the highest pressure in the previous tests. The two remaining tests, one stationary and one rotating, shall be conducted with the ignition in the winding compartment end furthest away from the conduit box.
(4) For motor assemblies incorporating a conduit box which is isolated from the winding compartment by an isolating barrier the following additional tests shall be conducted—
(i) For conduit boxes with an internal free volume greater than 150 cubic inches, two ignition points shall be used, one as close to the geometric center of the conduit box as practical and the other at the furthest point away from the isolating barrier between the conduit box and the winding compartment. Recording of pressure shall be on the same and opposite sides as the ignition point furthest from the isolating barrier between the conduit box and the winding compartment. Conduit boxes with an internal free volume of 150 cubic inches or less shall have one test hole for ignition located as close to the geometric center of the conduit box as practical and one for recording of pressure located on a side of the conduit box.
(ii) The conduit box shall be tested separately. Six tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume within the conduit box shall be conducted followed by two tests at 7.0 ±0.3 percent methane by volume. Then two tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume with a quantity of coal dust equal to 0.05 ounces per cubic foot of internal free volume of the conduit box and meeting the specifications in paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall be conducted. For conduit boxes with an internal free volume of more than 150 cubic inches, the number of tests shall be evenly divided between each ignition point.
(iii) The motor assembly shall be tested following removal of the isolating barrier or one sectionalizing terminal (as applicable). Six tests at 9.4 ±0.4 percent methane by volume in the winding compartment and conduit box shall be conducted using three ignition locations. The ignition shall be at one end of the winding compartment for one stationary and one rotating test; the opposite end for one stationary and one rotating test; and at the ignition point that produced the highest pressure on the previous test in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section in the conduit box for one stationary and one rotating test. Motor assemblies that use multiple sectionalizing terminals shall have one test conducted as each additional terminal is removed. Each of these tests shall use the rotor state and ignition location that produced the highest pressure in the previous tests.
(d) A motor assembly incorporating a conduit box that is isolated from the winding compartment that exhibits pressures exceeding 110 psig, while testing during removal of any or all isolating barriers as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, shall have a warning statement on the approval plate. This statement shall warn that the isolating barrier must be maintained to ensure the explosion-proof integrity of the motor assembly. A statement is not required when the motor assembly has withstood a static pressure of twice the maximum pressure recorded in the explosion tests of paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The static pressure test shall be conducted on the motor assembly with all isolating barriers removed, and in accordance with § 7.307 of this part.

§ 7.407
Test for flame resistance of electric cables and cable splices.
(a)
Test procedure.
(1) For electric cables, prepare 3 specimens of cable, each 3 feet in length, by removing 5 inches of jacket material and 2
1/2
inches of conductor insulation from both ends of each test specimen. For splices, prepare a splice specimen in each of 3 sections of MSHA-approved flame-resistant cable. The cable shall be of the type that the splice kit is designed to repair. The finished splice shall not exceed 18 inches or be less than 6 inches in length for test purposes. The spliced cables shall be 3 feet in length with the midpoint of the splice located 14 inches from one end. Both ends of each of the spliced cables shall be prepared by removing 5 inches of jacket material and 2
1/2
inches of conductor insulation. The type, amperage, voltage rating, and construction of the cable shall be compatible with the splice kit design. Each splice shall be made in accordance with the instructions provided with the splice kit.
(2) Prior to testing, condition each test specimen for a minimum of 24 hours at a temperature of 70 ±10 °F (21.1 ±5.5 °C) and a relative humidity of 55 ±10 percent. These environmental conditions shall be maintained during testing.
(3) For electric cables, locate the sensing element of the temperature measuring device 26 inches from one end of each test specimen. For splices, locate the sensing element 12 inches from the midpoint of the splice and 10 inches from the end of the cable. The sensing element must be secured so that it remains in direct contact with the metallic portion of the power conductor for the duration of the flame-resistant test. If a thermocouple-type temperature measuring instrument is used, connect the sensing element through the cable jacket and power conductor insulation. Other means for monitoring conductor temperature may be used, provided the temperature measurement is made at the same location. If the jacket and conductor insulation must be disturbed to insert the temperature measuring device, each must be restored as closely as possible to its original location and maintained there for the duration of the testing.
(4) Center the test specimen horizontally in the test chamber on the three rods. The three rods shall be positioned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the test specimen and at the same height, which permits the tip of the inner cone from the flame of the gas burner, when adjusted in accordance with the test procedure, to touch the jacket of the test specimen. The specimen shall be maintained at this level for the duration of the flame test. The two outermost rods shall be placed so that 1 inch of cable jacket extends beyond each rod. For electric cables, the third rod shall be placed 14 inches from the end of the test specimen nearer the temperature monitoring location on the specimen. For splices, the third rod shall be placed between the splice and the temperature monitoring
location at a distance 8 inches from the midpoint of the splice. The specimen shall be free from external air currents during testing.
(5) Adjust the gas burner to give an overall blue flame 5 inches high with a 3-inch inner cone. There shall be no persistence of yellow coloration.
(6) Connect all power conductors of the test specimen to the current source. The connections shall be secure and compatible with the size of the cable's power conductors in order to reduce contact resistance.
(7) Energize all power conductors of the test specimen with an effective heating current value of 5 times the power conductor ampacity rating (to the nearest whole ampere) at an ambient temperature of 104 °F (40 °C).
(8) Monitor the electric current through the power conductors of the test specimen with the current measuring device. Adjust the amount of heating current, as required, to maintain the proper effective heating current value within ±5 percent until the power conductors reach a temperature of 400 °F (204.4 °C).
(9) For electric cables, apply the tip of the inner cone from the flame of the gas burner directly beneath the test specimen for 60 seconds at a location 14 inches from one end of the cable and between the supports separated by a 16-inch distance. For splices, apply the tip of the inner cone from the flame of a gas burner for 60 seconds beneath the midpoint of the splice jacket.
(10) After subjecting the test specimen to external flame for the specified time, fully remove the flame of the gas from beneath the specimen without disturbing air currents within the test chamber. Simultaneously turn off the heating current.
(11) Record the amount of time the test specimen continues to burn after the flame from the gas burner has been removed. The duration of burning includes the burn time of any material that falls from the test specimen after the flame from the gas has been removed.
(12) Record the length of burned (charred) area of each test specimen measured longitudinally along the cable axis.
(13) Repeat the procedure for the remaining two specimens.

(a)
Chemical composition.
The chemical composition of the explosive shall be within the tolerances furnished by the applicant.
(b)
Rate-of-detonation test.
The explosive shall propagate completely in the rate-of-detonation test. The test is conducted at an ambient temperature between 68 and 86 °F. Nongelatinous explosives are initiated with a test detonator only, while gelatinous explosives are initiated with a test detonator and a 60-gram tetryl pellet booster. The test is conducted on—
(1) A 50-inch column of 1
1/4
inch diameter cartridges; and
(2) A 50-inch column of the smallest diameter cartridges less than 1
1/4
inches submitted for testing.
(c)
Air-gap sensitivity.
The air-gap sensitivity of the explosive shall be at least 2 inches at the minimum product firing temperature and 3 inches at a temperature between 68 and 86 °F, and the explosive shall propagate completely.
(1) Air-gap sensitivity of the explosive is determined in the explosion-by-influence test using the 7-inch cartridge method. The air-gap sensitivity is determined for 1
1/4
inch diameter cartridges and each cartridge diameter smaller than 1
1/4
inches. Explosives are initiated with a test detonator.
(2) The 7-inch cartridge method is conducted with two 8-inch cartridges. One inch is cut off the end of each cartridge. The cartridges are placed in a paper tube, the cut ends facing each other, with the appropriate 2-inch or 3-inch air gap between them. The test is
conducted at a temperature between 68 and 86 °F and at the minimum product firing temperature proposed by the applicant, or 41 °F, whichever is lower. The test temperature at which the explosive propagates completely will be specified in the approval as the minimum product firing temperature at which the explosive is approved for use.
(d)
Gallery Test 7.
The explosive shall yield a value of at least 450 grams for the lower 95 percent confidence limit (L
95
) on the weight for 50 percent probability of ignition (W
50
) in gallery test 7 and shall propagate completely. The L
95
and W
50
values for the explosive are determined by using the Bruceton up-and-down method. A minimum of 20 trials are made with explosive charges of varying weights, including wrapper and seals. Each charge is primed with a test detonator, then tamped and stemmed with one pound of dry-milled fire clay into the borehole of a steel cannon. The cannon is fired into air containing 7.7 to 8.3 percent of natural gas. The air temperature is between 68 and 86 °F.
(e)
Gallery Test 8.
The explosive shall yield a value of at least 350 grams for the weight for 50 percent probability of ignition (W
CDG
) in gallery test 8 and shall propagate completely. The (W
CDG
) value for the explosive is determined using the Bruceton up-and-down method. A minimum of 10 tests are made with explosive charges of varying weights, including wrapper and seals. Each charge is primed with a test detonator, then tamped into the borehole of a steel cannon. The cannon is fired into a mixture of 8 pounds of bituminous coal dust predispersed into 640 cubic feet of air containing 3.8 to 4.2 percent of natural gas. The air temperature is between 68 and 86 °F.
(f)
Pendulum-friction test.
The explosive shall show no perceptible reaction in the pendulum-friction test with the hard fiber-faced shoe. Ten trials of the test are conducted by releasing the steel shoe from a height of 59 inches. If there is evidence of sensitivity, the test is repeated with the hard fiber-faced shoe.
(g)
Toxic gases.
The total volume equivalent to carbon monoxide (CO) of toxic gases produced by detonation of the explosive shall not exceed 2.5 cubic feet per pound of explosive as determined in the large chamber test. The explosive shall propagate completely.
(1) The large chamber test is conducted with a one-pound explosive charge, including wrapper and seal, primed with a test detonator. The explosive charge is loaded into the borehole of a steel cannon, then tamped and stemmed with one pound of dry-milled fire clay. The cannon is fired into the large chamber and the gaseous products resulting from detonation of the explosive are collected and analyzed for toxic gases. At least two trials are conducted.
(2) The equivalent volume of each toxic gas produced, relative to CO, is determined by multiplying the measured volume of the gas by a conversion factor. The conversion factor is equal to the threshold limit value, time weighted average (TLV-TWA) in parts-per-million for CO divided by the TLV-TWA for the toxic gas. The TLV-TWA conversion factor for each gas for which MSHA shall test is specified in Table I of this subpart. The total volume equivalent to CO of the toxic gases produced by detonation of the explosive is the sum of the equivalent volumes of the individual toxic gases.

# Subpart E—Field Approval of Electrically Operated Mining Equipment

# Source:
36 FR 7007, Apr. 13, 1971, unless otherwise noted.
§ 18.90
Purpose.
The regulations of this subpart E set forth the procedures and requirements for permissibility which must be met to obtain MSHA field approval of electrically operated machinery used or intended for use in by the last open crosscut of a coal mine which has not been otherwise approved, certified or accepted under the provisions of this part 18, chapter I, title 30, Code of Federal Regulations (Bureau of Mines Schedule 2G).
§ 18.91
Electric equipment for which field approvals will be issued.
(a) Individual field approvals will be issued by MSHA under the provisions of this subpart E for electrically operated machines commercially built, or constructed, by the owner-coal mine operator of such machines including any associated electrical equipment, electrical components, and electrical accessories.
(b) Approvals will not be issued under the provisions of this subpart E for electrically operated mining equipment manufactured or rebuilt primarily for sale or resale to any operator of a coal mine, or for small electrically operated equipment which consumes less than 2,250 watts of electricity, or for instruments and other small devices which employ electric power.
§ 18.92
Quality of material and design.
(a) Electrically operated machinery approved under the provisions of this subpart E shall be rugged in construction and shall be designed to facilitate maintenance and inspection.
(b) MSHA shall conduct field investigations and, where necessary, field test electric machinery only where such machinery is found to be constructed of suitable materials and safe for its intended use.
§ 18.93
Application for field approval; filing procedures.
(a)(1) Investigation and testing leading to field approval shall be undertaken by MSHA only pursuant to individual written applications for each machine submitted in triplicate on MSHA Form No. 6-1481, by the owner-coal mine operator of the machine.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each application shall be accompanied by appropriate photographs, drawings, specifications, and descriptions as required under the provisions of § 18.94 and each such application shall be filed with the Coal Mine Health and Safety District Manager for the District in which such machine will be employed.
(b) The Coal Mine Health and Safety District Manager may, upon receipt of any application filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, waive the requirements of § 18.94 with respect to such application if he determines that the submission of photographs, drawings, specifications, or descriptions will place an undue financial burden upon the applicant. In the event a waiver is granted in accordance with this paragraph (b), initial review of the application will be waived and the applicant shall be notified on MSHA Form 6-1481 of such waiver and the date, time, and location at which field inspection of the equipment described in the application will be conducted.
(c) Following receipt of an application filed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Coal Mine Health and Safety District Manager shall determine whether the application has been filed in accordance with § 18.91, and cause the application to be reviewed by a qualified electrical representative to determine compliance with § 18.92:
(1) If it is determined on the basis of the application or the data submitted in accordance with § 18.94 that further consideration of a field approval is warranted under this subpart E or that the machine appears suitable and safe for its intended use, the Coal Mine Health and Safety District Manager shall advise the applicant in writing that further investigation and inspection of the machine will be necessary. The notice issued by the Coal Mine Health and Safety District Manager shall set forth the time and place at which such inspection will be conducted and specify the location and size of any tapped holes required to be made by the applicant to facilitate the pressure testing of enclosures.
(2) If it is determined on the basis of data submitted in accordance with § 18.94 that the applicant is not qualified to receive an approval or that the machine does not appear to be suitable and safe for its intended use, the Coal Mine Health and Safety District Manager shall so advise the applicant in writing, setting forth the reasons for his denial of the application, and where applicable, the deficiencies in the machine which rendered it unsuitable or unsafe for use.
(3) Rejected applications, together with attached photographs, drawings, specifications and descriptions shall be forwarded by the Coal Mine Health and Safety District Manager to Approval and Certification Center which shall record all pertinent data with respect to the machine for which field approval was sought.

§ 19.5
General requirements for approval.
Electric cap lamps shall be complete units. They shall be durable in construction, practical in operation, and suitable for the conditions of underground service. They shall offer no probable explosion hazard if used in gassy or dusty mine atmospheres or bodily hazard from the spilling of the battery electrolyte. They shall exhibit, under laboratory test conditions, the various minimum performance requirements specified in this part.
§ 19.6
Specific requirements for approval.
(a)
Design.
In the determination of the adequacy of the lamp, with respect to design, the following points will be considered: (1) The materials used; (2) construction; (3) weight; (4) amount of light; (5) distribution of light; and (6) exclusion of dust from the headpiece. The suitability of the materials and the construction shall be determined by preliminary inspection, by dropping tests,
1
by durability tests of the cord
and cord armor,
2
and by the general behavior of the lamp equipment during the investigation. The amount and distribution of the light shall be judged both by observation of the illumination on a white screen and by photometric measurements.
1
Batteries are dropped 3 feet, at least 20 times onto an oak floor. Headpieces are
dropped 6 feet, at least 20 times, onto concrete.
2
Ten cords, assembled with the cord armor and outlet of the lamp with which it is to be used, are slatted at least 100,000 times through an arc of 50 degrees at approximately 90 slattings per minute.
(b)
Angle of light beam.
MSHA recommends that the angle of the light beam be at least 130 degrees horizontally to insure that the contrast edge of the beam is away from the more sensitive sector of the wearer's vision; however, to allow for manufacturing and assembly tolerances and the use of multiple filament bulbs, MSHA will approve lamps giving a minimum beam angle of 120 degrees. If the bulb has more than one major filament, the one giving the smaller angle will be used in the determination.
(c)
Light distribution, visual.
Excepting special headpieces for inspection purposes, the area illuminated by the beam shall be free from sharp gradations in light intensity and spectral shadows.
(d)
Light distribution, photometric.
(1) Excepting special headpieces for inspection purposes, the maximum candlepower of the light beam shall not be greater than 25 times the average or mean candlepower of the beam.
3
3
The minimum allowable angle of 120 degrees will be used in determining the mean candlepower of the beam.
(2) The minimum candlepower of the beam based upon readings at the design voltage of the bulb shall not be less than 1.
§ 19.7
Protection against explosion hazard.
Unless properly designed, electric cap lamps may present two sources of probable explosion hazards: Ignition of an explosive atmosphere by the heated filament of the bulb in case the bulb glass is accidentally broken, and ignition by sparks or flashes from the battery. MSHA therefore requires the following safeguards:
(a)
Safety device or design.
The headpiece shall have a safety device to prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air if the bulb glass surrounding the filament is broken. Alternatively, if the lamp is designed and constructed to prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air by protecting the bulb from breakage and preventing exposure of the hot filament, no safety device is required.
(b)
Headpiece lock or seal.
The headpiece shall be provided with a lock or seal to prevent unauthorized removal of the lens and tampering with the safety device, the bulb, or the electrical contacts.
(c)
Locks on charging terminals.
Lamps shall be equipped with a magnetic or other equally effective lock at the battery, the headpiece, or the cord assembly to prevent unauthorized access to live charging terminals.
(d)
Protection of battery terminals.
The battery covers of lamps that are recharged through the cord shall be so constructed and assembled as to prevent unauthorized access to the battery terminals.
(e)
Battery current restricted.
The amount of current flow between the conductors of the cord, if short-circuited just outside of the battery casing or cord armor, shall be limited by the design of the battery or by a fuse to such a value
4
as will not produce sparks that will ignite an explosive mixture of methane and air.
4
The following maximum short-circuit current values may be used as a guide in the design of cap lamp batteries: 100 amperes for a 4-volt battery; 75 amperes for a 6-volt battery; 50 amperes for an 8-volt battery.
(f) It shall not be possible to obtain a difference of potential between any two accessible points of the cap lamp when assembled for use.

§ 19.8
Protection against bodily hazard.
This hazard is chiefly due to the possible burning of the wearer by electrolyte spilled from the battery. MSHA therefore requires that:
(a)
Spilling of electrolyte.
The lamp shall be so designed and constructed that, when properly filled, the battery will neither leak nor spill electrolyte under actual service conditions. Lamps passing a laboratory spilling test will be considered satisfactory in this respect, contingent upon satisfactory performance in service.
(b)
Corrosion of battery container.
The material of which the container is made shall resist corrosion under conditions of use.
§ 19.9
Performance.
In addition to the general design and the safety features, MSHA considers that a lamp of permissible type should meet certain minimum requirements with respect to performance, as follows:
(a)
Time of burning and candlepower.
Permissible electric cap lamps shall burn for at least 10 consecutive hours on one charge of the battery and shall give during that period a mean candlepower of light beam of not less than 1.
(b)
Bulb life.
The average life of the bulbs shall be not less than 200 hours, and at least 92 percent of the bulbs shall have a life of 150 hours. The life of a bulb is the number of hours its main filament will burn in the cap lamp or its equivalent.
The life of a bulb having main filaments in parallel is considered ended when the first filament ceases to burn; the life of a bulb having independent main filament is considered ended when the last filament ceases to burn.
(c)
Bulb uniformity.
(1) The bulbs submitted shall meet the following minimum requirements for variation in current consumption and candlepower:
(2) The current consumption of at least 94 percent of the bulbs shall not exceed the average current by more than 6 percent. The candlepower (s. cp.) of at least 90 percent of the bulbs shall not fall short of the average candlepower by more than 30 percent.
(d)
Corrosion of contacts.
Battery terminals and leads therefrom, as well as the battery gas vents, shall be designed to minimize corrosion of the electrical contacts.
[Sched. 6D, 4 FR 4003, Sept. 21, 1939, as amended at 47 FR 11369, Mar. 16, 1982]
§ 19.10
Material required for MSHA records.
In order that MSHA may know exactly what it has tested and approved, detailed records are kept covering each investigation. These include drawings and actual equipment, as follows:
(a)
Drawings.
The original drawings submitted with the application for the tests and the final drawings, which the manufacturer must submit to MSHA before the approval is granted, to show the details of the lamp as approved. These drawings are used to identify the lamp in the approval and as a means of checking the future commercial product of the manufacturer.
(b)
Actual equipment.
(1) If MSHA so desires, parts of the lamps which are used in the tests will be retained as a permanent record of the investigation and of the lamps submitted.
(2) If the lamp is approved, MSHA will require the manufacturer, as soon as his first manufactured lamps are available, to submit one complete lamp, bearing the approval plate, as a record of his commercial product.
§ 19.11
How approvals are granted.
(a) All approvals are granted by official letter from MSHA. A lamp will be approved under this part only when the testing engineers judge that the lamp has met the requirements of the part and MSHA's records concerning the lamp are complete, including drawings from the manufacturer that show the lamp as it is to be commercially made. No verbal reports of MSHA's decisions, concerning the investigation will be given, and no informal approvals will be granted.
(b) As soon as the manufacturer has received the formal approval he shall be free to advertise his lamps as permissible.
[Sched. 6D, 4 FR 4003, Sept. 21, 1939, as amended by Supp. 1, 20 FR 2718, Apr. 23, 1955]
§ 19.12
Wording, purpose, and use of approval plate.
(a)
Approval plate.
The manufacturer shall attach, stamp, or mold an approval plate on the battery container of each permissible lamp. The plate shall bear the emblem of the Mine Safety and Health Administration and be inscribed as follows: “Permissible Electric Cap Lamp. Approval No. ________ issued to the ________ Company.” When deemed necessary, an appropriate caution statement shall be added. The size and position of the approval plate shall be satisfactory to MSHA.
(b)
Purpose of approval plate.
The approval plate is a label which identifies the lamp so that anyone can tell at a glance whether or not the lamp is of the permissible type. By it, the manufacturer can point out that his lamp complies with specifications of MSHA and that it has been judged as suitable for use in gassy mines.
(c)
Use of approval plate.
Permission to place MSHA's approval plate on his lamp obligates the manufacturer to maintain the quality of his product and to see that each lamp is constructed according to the drawings which have been accepted by MSHA for this lamp and which are in MSHA's files. Lamps exhibiting changes in design which have not been approved are not permissible lamps and must not bear MSHA's approval plate.

[Sched. 10C, May 17, 1938, as amended by Supp. 1, 20 FR 2719, Apr. 23, 1955; 43 FR 12314, Mar. 24, 1978; 60 FR 35693, July 11, 1995; 73 FR 52212, Sept. 9, 2008]
§ 20.6
General requirements.
(a) The lamps shall be durable in construction, practical in operation, and suitable for the service for which they are designed and approved.
(b) The intensity of light, distribution of light, and battery capacity shall be adequate for the use for which the lamp is intended.
(c) Battery terminals and leads therefrom, as well as the battery gas vents, shall be designed to minimize corrosion of the electrical contacts.
(d) Bulbs and other replacement parts of the lamps shall be adequately marked as a means of identification.
§ 20.7
Specific requirements.
Two general classes of electric lamps are recognized in these requirements, namely: Class 1, those that are self-contained and easily carried by hand, and class 2, those that may or may not be self-contained and not so readily portable as the first class.
(a)
Class 1.
Class 1 includes hand lamps, signal lamps, inspection lamps, flashlights, and animal lamps which are operated by small storage batteries or dry cells.
(b)
Class 2.
Class 2 includes lamps such as the pneumatic-electric types and large battery lamps.
§ 20.8
Class 1 lamps.
(a)
Protection against explosion hazards.
Unless properly designed, class 1 lamps present two sources of probable explosion hazards: Ignition of an explosive atmosphere by the heated filament of the bulb in case the bulb glass is accidentally broken, and ignition by electric sparks or arcs from the battery or connections thereto. MSHA's therefore, requires the following safeguards:
(1)
Safety device or design.
The lighting unit shall have a safety device to prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air if the bulb glass surrounding the filament is broken. Alternatively, if the lamp is designed and constructed of materials that will prevent the ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air by protecting the bulb from breakage and preventing exposure of the hot filament, no separate safety device is required. Alternative designs will be evaluated by mechanical impact tests, temperature tests and thermal shock tests to determine that the protection provided is no less effective than a safety device.
(2)
Safety device
(
protection
). The design of the safety device and the housing which protects it shall be such that the action of the safety device is positive; yet the lamp shall not be too readily extinguished during normal service by the unnecessary operation of the device.
(3)
Locks or seals.
For lamps other than flashlights, all parts, such as bulb housing and battery container, through which access may be had to live terminals or contacts shall be adequately sealed or equipped with magnetic or other equally reliable locks to prevent opening by unauthorized persons. For flashlights, provision shall be made for sealing the battery container.
(4)
Battery current restricted.
Unless all current-carrying parts including conductors, are adequately covered and protected by the sealed or locked compartments, the maximum possible current flow through that part shall be limited by battery design, or by an enclosed-type fuse inside the sealed or locked container, to values that will not produce sparks or arcs sufficient to ignite an explosive mixture of methane and air.
(b)
Protection against bodily hazard.
This hazard is chiefly due to the possible burning of the user by electrolyte spilled from the battery. MSHA, therefore, requires that:
(1)
Spilling of electrolyte.
The lamp shall be so designed and constructed that when properly filled the battery will neither leak nor spill electrolyte under conditions of normal use. Lamps passing a laboratory spilling test will be considered satisfactory in this respect, contingent upon satisfactory performance in service.
(2)
Corrosion of battery container.
The material of which the container is made shall resist corrosion under conditions of normal use.
[Sched. 10C, May 17, 1938, as amended at 5 FR 3467, Aug. 30, 1940; 54 FR 30513, July 20, 1989]
§ 20.9
Class 2 lamps.
(a)
Safety.
(1) Unless special features of the lamp prevent ignition of explosive mixtures of methane and air by the broken bulb or other igniting sources within the lamp, the bulb and all spark-producing parts must be enclosed in explosion-proof compartments.
(2) Explosion-proof compartments will be tested while filled and surrounded with explosive mixtures of Pittsburgh natural gas
1
and air. A sufficient number of tests of each compartment will be made to prove that there is no danger of ignition of the
mixture surrounding the lamp by explosions within the compartment. The lamp will not pass the above tests, even though the surrounding explosive mixtures are not ignited, if external flame is observed, if excessive pressures are developed, or if excessive distortion of any part of the compartment takes place.
1
Investigation has shown that for practical purposes Pittsburgh natural gas (containing a high percentage of methane) is a satisfactory substitute for pure methane.
(3) Glass-enclosed parts of such compartments must be guarded and be of extra-heavy glass to withstand pick blows, and be adequately protected by shrouds or by an automatic cut-out that opens the lamp circuit if the enclosure is broken.
(4) When an explosion-proof enclosure consists of two or more parts that are held together securely by bolts or some suitable means to permit assembly, the flanges comprising the joints between parts shall have surfaces with metal-to-metal contact, except enclosures requiring glass, in which case glass-to-metal joints are permitted. Gaskets, if adequate, may be used to obtain a firm seat for the glass but not elsewhere. Rubber, putty, and plaster of paris are not acceptable as material for gaskets. For enclosures having an unoccupied volume (air space) of more than 60 cubic inches the width of the joint measured along the shortest flame path from the inside to the outside of the enclosure shall not be less than 1 inch. When the unoccupied volume (air space) is less than 60 cubic inches, this path shall not be less than three-fourths inch.
(b)
Locks and seals
(
lighting attachment
). Explosion-proof compartments shall be equipped with seals or locks that prevent unauthorized and unsafe opening of the compartments in a mine.
(c)
Locks or seals
(
battery
). The battery shall be enclosed in a locked or sealed container that will prevent exposure of live terminals.
(d)
Temperature of lamp.
The temperature of the lamp under conditions of use shall not be such that a person may be burned in handling it.
(e)
Cable and connection.
(1) The cable or cord connecting the lamp to its battery shall be of high-grade design and materials, comparable to the specially recommended trailing cables as listed by MSHA, and shall be not more than 15 feet in length.
(2) The cable (or cord) shall be adequately protected at the battery end by a fuse in the locked battery box or housing. The cable (or cord) and the fuse shall be considered parts of the lamp, and specifications for them shall be submitted by the lamp manufacturer.
(3) The method of terminating the cable (or cord) at the lamp and at the battery housing shall be adequate, but in no case shall the cable or cord be detachable.
MSHA reserves the right to make minor changes in the requirements outlined in paragraphs (e) (1), (2), and (3) of this section (No. 9, class 2 lamps), as experience and service prove to be necessary in the interests of safety.
§ 20.10
Tests (class 1 and 2 lamps).
Such tests will be made as are necessary to prove the adequacy of a lamp or any of its parts in fulfilling the purposes for which it was designed. These tests include the following:
(a) Safety tests, including tests of safety devices, electrical contacts, and explosion-proof features.
(b) Photometric tests.
(c) Tests to demonstrate adequacy of mechanical strength.
(d) Tests of nonspilling features (storage-battery lamps of class 1).
(e) Temperature tests.
§ 20.11
Material required for MSHA records.
In order that MSHA may know exactly what it has tested and approved, detailed records are kept covering each investigation. These include drawings and actual equipment, as follows:
(a)
Drawings.
The original drawings submitted with the application for the tests and the final drawings which the manufacturer must submit to MSHA before approval is granted, to show the details of the lamp as approved, are retained. These drawings are used to identify the lamp and its parts in the approval and as a means of checking the future commercial product of the manufacturer.
(b)
Equipment.
(1) If MSHA so desires, parts of the lamps which are used in
the tests will be retained as a permanent record of the investigation and of the lamps submitted.
(2) If the lamp is approved, MSHA will require the manufacturer, as soon as his first manufactured lamps are available, to submit one complete lamp, with the approval plate attached, as a record of his commercial product.
§ 20.12
How approvals are granted.
(a) All approvals are granted by official letter from MSHA. A lamp will be approved under this part only when the testing engineers judge that the lamp has met the requirements of this part and after MSHA's records concerning the lamp are complete, including manufacturer's drawings that show the lamp as it is to be made commercially. No verbal reports of MSHA's decision concerning the investigation will be given, and no informal approvals will be granted.
(b) As soon as the manufacturer has received the formal approval he shall be free to advertise his lamp as permissible.
[Sched. 10C, May 17, 1938, as amended by Supp. 1, 20 FR 2719, Apr. 23, 1955]
§ 20.13
Approval plate.
The manufacturer shall attach, stamp, or mold an approval plate on the battery container or housing of each permissible lamp. The plate shall bear the emblem of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, and be inscribed as follows: “Permissible __________ Lamp. Approval No. ____________________ issued to the ____________________ Company.” When deemed necessary, an appropriate caution statement shall be added. The size, material, and position of the approval plate shall be satisfactory to MSHA.
(a)
Purpose of approval plate.
The approval plate is a label which identifies the lamp so that anyone can tell at a glance whether the lamp is of the permissible type or not. By it the manufacturer can point out that his lamp complies with specifications of MSHA and that it has been adjudged safe for use in gassy and dusty mines.
(b)
Use of approval plate.
Permission to place MSHA's approval plate on his lamp obligates the manufacturer to maintain the quality of his product and to see that each lamp is constructed according to the drawings which have been accepted by MSHA for this lamp and which are in the MSHA files. Lamps exhibiting changes in design which have not been approved are not permissible lamps and must not bear MSHA's approval plate.
(c)
Withdrawal of approval.
MSHA reserves the right to rescind for cause at any time any approval granted under this part.
[Sched. 10C, May 17, 1938, as amended at 5 FR 3467, Aug. 30, 1940; 43 FR 12314, Mar. 24, 1978]
§ 20.14
Instructions for handling future changes in lamp design.
All approvals are granted with the understanding that the manufacturer will make the lamp according to the drawings submitted to MSHA, which have been considered and included in the approval. Therefore, when the manufacturer desires to make any change in the design of the lamp, the manufacturer should first obtain an extension of the original approval to cover the change. The procedure is as follows:
(a)(1) The manufacturer shall write to the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Approval and Certification Center, 765 Technology Drive, Triadelphia, WV 26059, requesting an extension of the original approval and describing the change or changes proposed. With this letter the manufacturer should submit a revised drawing or drawings showing the changes in detail, and one of each of the changed lamp parts.
(2) Where the applicant for approval has used an independent laboratory under part 6 of this chapter to perform, in whole or in part, the necessary testing and evaluation for approval of changes to an approved product under this part, the applicant must provide to MSHA as part of the approval application:
(i) Written evidence of the laboratory's independence and current recognition by a laboratory accrediting organization;
(ii) Complete technical explanation of how the product complies with each requirement in the applicable MSHA product approval requirements;
(iii) Identification of components or features of the product that are critical to the safety of the product; and
(iv) All documentation, including drawings and specifications, as submitted to the independent laboratory by the applicant and as required by this part.
(b) MSHA will consider the application and inspect the drawings and parts to determine whether it will be necessary to make any tests.
(c) If no tests are necessary, the applicant will be advised of the acceptance or rejection of the proposed change by letter from MSHA.
(d) If tests are judged necessary, the applicant will be advised of the material that will be required.

§ 22.6
General requirements.
Methane detectors approved under this part shall be portable. They shall be durable in construction, practical in operation, and suitable for service conditions underground. They shall offer no probable explosion hazard if used in gaseous mine atmospheres nor any bodily hazard, such as spilling of battery electrolyte. They shall exhibit under laboratory test conditions various requirements of minimum performance that are specified in this part.
§ 22.7
Specific requirements.
(a)
Design.
In the determination of adequacy of design, the following points will be considered: (1) Materials used, (2) construction, (3) accuracy, (4) size and shape, (5) range of detection (or indication), (6) life of the active parts, and (7) attention required. The suitability of the materials and the construction shall be determined by preliminary inspection, by dropping tests, by laboratory and field tests in gas and air mixtures, and by the general behavior of the equipment during the investigation.
(b)
Safety against explosion hazard
—(1)
Detectors.
Detectors shall be constructed so that they will not cause external ignitions when used in gaseous mine atmospheres.
(2)
Seals or locks.
All parts through which external ignitions might result shall be covered and protected adequately. All covers shall be sealed adequately or equipped with magnetic or other equally reliable locks to prevent their being opened by unauthorized persons.
(3)
Glasses.
Glasses or glass windows shall be of good-quality glass and protected adequately against breakage. Unguarded windows may be considered adequate in this respect, provided they are of small diameter and are of reasonably thick glass.
(4)
Battery.
If the detector is equipped with a battery, it shall be of such design that it will not produce sparks that will ignite an explosive mixture of methane and air.
(5)
Detectors of the flame type.
Methane detectors of the flame type shall be subject to the requirements of the flame-lamp schedule then in force.
(c)
Safety against bodily hazard.
Bodily hazard with battery-type detectors is due chiefly to possible burning of the user by electrolyte that has spilled from the battery. MSHA, therefore, requires that:
(1)
Spilling of electrolyte.
The battery shall be so designed and constructed that when properly filled it will not spill electrolyte under actual service conditions.
(2)
Corrosion of battery container.
The material of which the container is made shall resist corrosion under conditions of use.
(d)
Performance.
In addition to the general design and safety features, MSHA considers that permissible types of methane detectors should meet certain minimum requirements with respect to their performance, as follows:
(1)
Detectors.
(i) When the detector is operated according to the manufacturer's instructions, it shall be possible to detect at least 1 percent methane in air, and increasing percentages up to 5 percent shall be shown by continuously increasing evidence.
(ii) The average number of determinations that may be made in approximately 2-percent methane mixtures without recharging a battery or replacing a chemical accessory shall not be less than 25, and the average number of such determinations that may be made without replacing any other part shall be not less than 100.
(2)
Indicating detectors.
Indicating detectors shall give indications of as low as 0.25 percent methane. Detectors having an upper scale limit of 2 percent may be approved, but it is recommended that the detector be designed to give indications of as high as 4 percent methane. The indications for these percentages shall be within the limits of error specified in the following table:

(i) Tests shall be made at several percentages within the range of the indicating detector and at temperatures between the limits of 50° and 70 °F. by increments of 5°. Ten determinations shall be made at each percentage. Neither the average of the 10 readings nor more than 2 readings for each percentage shall exceed the limits of error given in the table.
(ii) The average number of determinations that may be made with an indicating detector without replacement of any part shall be not less than 30, and the average number that may be made without recharging the battery shall be not less than 15.
(iii) The scale shall not be subdivided into smaller divisions than the general accuracy of the indicating detector warrants.
(3)
Mechanical strength.
Detectors and indicating detectors shall be subjected to the following mechanical tests: Four of each of those parts or groups of assembled parts that are not normally strapped to the user shall be dropped 20 times on a wood floor from a height of 3 feet. Parts that are strapped to the user may be subjected to a jarring or
bumping test to demonstrate adequate strength. The average number of times that any one of the detectors can be dropped before breakage or material distortion of essential parts shall be not less than 10.
(e)
Attachments for illumination.
If detectors are provided with attachments for illuminating purposes, such attachments shall be subject to the same requirements as those applying to that type of lamp under the lamp schedule then in force.
§ 22.8
Material required for MSHA records.
In order that MSHA may know exactly what it has tested and approved, it keeps detailed records covering each investigation. These records include drawings and actual equipment as follows:
(a)
Drawings.
The original drawings submitted with the application for the tests and the final drawings which the manufacturer must submit to MSHA before the approval is granted to show the details of the detector as approved, are retained. These drawings are used to identify the detector in the approval and as a means of checking the future commercial product of the manufacturer.
(b)
Actual equipment.
If MSHA so desires, parts of the detectors that are used in the tests will be retained as records of the equipment submitted. If the detector is approved, MSHA will require the manufacturer to submit one of his detectors, with the approval plate attached, as a record of his commercial product.
§ 22.9
How approvals are granted.
All approvals are granted by official letter from MSHA. A detector will be approved under this part only when the testing engineers have judged that it has met the requirements of the schedule and MSHA's records are complete, including drawings from the manufacturer that show the detector as it is to be commercially made. No verbal reports of the investigation will be given and no informal approvals will be granted. As soon as the manufacturer has received the formal approval, he shall be free to advertise his detector as permissible.
[Sched. 8C, Oct. 31, 1935, as amended by Supp. 1, 20 FR 2575, Apr. 19, 1955]
§ 22.10
Approval plate.

§ 23.6
General requirements for approval.
Telephones and signaling devices shall be durable in construction, practical in operation, and suitable for conditions of underground service. They shall offer no probable explosion hazard under normal operation if use in gassy or dusty mine atmospheres.
§ 23.7
Specific requirements for approval.
(a) The circuits external to telephones and signal devices shall be intrinsically safe; that is, the electrical design and construction of telephones and signal devices shall be such that neither contact between wires comprising the external circuits nor contact of tools or other metal objects with external terminals and circuits will result in electrical sparks capable of igniting explosive methane-air mixtures (or such mixtures with coal dust in suspension) during normal operation of the telephones or signal devices.
(b) All parts which, during normal operation, are capable of producing sparks that might ignite explosive methane-air mixtures shall be enclosed in explosion-proof compartments. All openings in the casings of such compartments shall be adequately protected. It is desirable that openings be as few as possible. All joints in the casings of an explosion-proof compartment shall be metal-to-metal so designed as to have a width of contact, measured along the shortest path from the inside to the outside of the compartment, of not less than 1 inch if the unoccupied volume (air space) in the compartment is more than 60 cubic inches. For unoccupied volume of 60 cubic inches or less, a
3/8
-inch width of contact will be acceptable.
(c) All bolts and screw holes shall be “blind” or bottomed if the omission of a bolt or screw would otherwise leave an opening into the compartment. An adequate lock or seal shall be provided to prevent tampering and exposure of spark-producing parts by unauthorized persons.
(d) Battery cells shall be placed in an explosion-proof compartment or else in one that is locked or sealed, and the terminals and the connections thereto shall be so arranged and protected as to preclude meddling, tampering, or making other electrical connections with them.
(e) Manufacturers shall furnish adequate instructions for the installation and connection of telephones and signal devices in order that the safety of these devices and other circuits shall not be diminished by improper installation. MSHA reserves the right to require the attachment of wiring diagrams to the cases of telephones and signal devices.
(f) If electric light bulbs are used in signaling devices, they shall be either
equipped with effective safety devices, such as are required for permissible electric mine lamps,
1
or enclosed in explosion-proof compartments.
1
In this case, the requirements of the current schedule for mine lamps will apply.
(g) Line powered telephones and signaling devices or systems shall be equipped with standby power sources that have the capacity to enable the devices or systems to continue functioning in the event the line power fails or is cut off. Manufacturers shall furnish instructions for the proper maintenance of standby power sources.

[Sched. 9B, 4 FR 1555, Apr. 11, 1939, as amended at 47 FR 11370, Mar. 16, 1982]
§ 23.8
Inspection and tests.
(a) A thorough inspection of the telephone or signaling device will be made to determine its adequacy and permissibility. Tests may be made to check the electrical characteristics and constants of the various parts, and determine the adequacy of the insulation and other parts of features of the device.
(b) In addition, compartments of explosion-proof design will be tested while filled and surrounded with explosive mixtures containing varying percentages of Pittsburgh natural gas
2
and air, the mixture within the compartment being ignited by a spark plug or other suitable means. For some of the tests bituminous-coal dust will be introduced into the compartment in addition to the explosive mixtures, and the effects will be noted. A sufficient number of tests will be made under the foregoing conditions to determine the ability of the compartment to retain flame without bursting. Even though the surrounding mixtures are not ignited, the compartment will not be considered as having passed the tests, if flames are discharged from any joint or opening; if excessive pressures are developed or if serious distortion of the compartment walls take place.
2
Investigation has shown that for test purposes Pittsburgh natural gas (containing a high percentage of methane) is a satisfactory substitute for pure methane.
§ 23.9
Special requirements for complete devices.
Telephones and signaling devices will be considered nonpermissible if used under any of the followings conditions:
(a) Without the approval plate, mentioned hereafter.
(b) With unprotected openings in any of the explosion-proof compartments. This condition refers to any openings in these compartments, but especially to those equipped with removable covers.
(c) If not complete with all of the parts considered in the approval.
(d) If installed or connected otherwise than in accordance with the instructions furnished by the manufacturer.
(e) If modified in any manner not authorized by MSHA.
§ 23.10
Material required for MSHA records.
In order that MSHA may know exactly what it has tested and approved, it keeps detailed records covering each investigation. These records include drawings and actual equipment as follows:
(a)
Drawings.
The original drawings submitted with the application for the tests and the final drawings which the manufacturer must submit to MSHA before the approval is granted, to show the details of the device as approved. These drawings are used to identify the device in the approval and as a means of checking the future commercial product of the manufacturer.
(b)
Actual equipment.
If MSHA so desires, parts of the devices that are used in the tests will be retained as records of the equipment submitted. If the device is approved, MSHA reserves the right to require the manufacturer to submit one, with the approval plate attached and without cost to MSHA, as a record of his commercial product.
§ 23.11
How approvals are granted.
All approvals are granted by official letter from MSHA. A device will be approved under this part only when the testing engineers have judged that it
has met the requirements of the part and MSHA's records are complete, including drawings from the manufacturer that show the device as it is to be commercially made. Individual parts of devices will not be approved. No verbal reports of the investigation will be given and no informal approvals will be granted. As soon as the manufacturer has received the formal approval, he shall be free to advertise his device as permissible.
[Sched. 9B, 4 FR 1555, Apr. 11, 1939, as amended by Supp. 1, 20 FR 2975, May 4, 1955]
§ 23.12
Wording, purpose, and use of approval plate.
(a)
Approval plate.
(1) Manufacturers shall attach, stamp, or mold an approval plate on each permissible device. The plate shall bear the emblem of the Mine Safety and Health Administration and be inscribed as follows:

§ 33.9
Certification of dust-collecting systems.
Manufacturers of dust-collecting systems that are designed for integral use
on machines with drilling equipment may apply to MSHA to issue a certificate of performance for such systems. To qualify for a certificate of performance, the dust-collecting system shall have met satisfactorily the test requirements of Subpart C under specified operating conditions, such as type of drilling equipment, drilling speed, and power requirements and the construction thereof shall be adequately covered by specifications and drawings officially recorded and filed with MSHA. Individual parts of dust-collecting systems will not be certified for performance. Certificates of performance may be cited to fabricators of combination units as evidence that further inspection and testing of the dust-collecting system will not be required, provided the dust-collecting requirements of the drilling equipment do not exceed the limits of performance for which the system was certified. Since MSHA does not sanction the use of the words “permissible” or “approved” except as applying to completely assembled equipment, dust-collecting systems, which have been certified only as to performance, shall not be advertised or labeled in a manner inferring that such systems themselves are permissible or approved by MSHA. However, a certified system may be advertised as suitable for use on combination units for which certification may be desired if the limits of its performance are cited. Certified dust-collecting systems shall bear labels or tags which shall contain the following: “Performance-tested Dust Collecting, System, MSHA File No. P/T________,” and name of manufacturer, identifying numbers of the dust-collector parts, and description of the limitations for which performance is certified. MSHA will assign a P/T file number in the certification letter.
§ 33.10
Certificates of approval or performance.
(a) Upon completion of an investigation, MSHA will issue to the applicant either a certificate or a written notice of disapproval, as they case may require. No informal notification of approval will be issued. If a certificate is issued, no test data or detailed results of tests will accompany it. If a notice of disapproval is issued, it will be accompanied by details of the defects, with a view to possible correction. MSHA will not disclose, except to the applicant, any information on a unit or system upon which a notice of disapproval has been issued.
(b) A certificate will be accompanied by a list of the drawings and specifications covering the details of design and construction of the unit or system, including the electrical parts, if applicable, upon which the certificate is based. Applicants shall keep exact duplicates of the drawings and specifications submitted and the list of drawing numbers referred to in § 33.6(d)(1) that relate to the certified unit or system, and these are to be adhered to exactly in production.
§ 33.11
Approval plates.
(a) A certificate of approval will be accompanied by a photograph of a design for an approval plate, bearing the emblem of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the name of the applicant, the name of the unit, the approval number or space for the approval number (or numbers if permissibility of electrical parts is involved), spaces for the type and the serial numbers of the unit, conditions of approval, and identifying numbers of the dust-collector parts. When deemed necessary by MSHA, an appropriate statement shall be added, giving the precautions to be observed in maintaining the unit in an approved condition.
(b) An approval plate for a unit designed for use in a nongassy coal mine shall state that any electrical parts are not certified for use in a gassy coal mine. (See § 33.38(c).)
(c) The applicant shall reproduce the design either as a separate plate or by stamping or molding it in some suitable place on each unit to which it relates. The size, type, and method of attaching and location of an approval plate are subject to the approval of MSHA. The method of affixing the plate shall not impair the dust-collection or explosion-proof features of the unit.
(d) The approval plate identifies the unit, to which it is attached, as permissible, and is the applicant's guarantee
that the unit complies with the requirements of this part. Without an approval plate, no unit has the status of “permissible” under the provisions of this part.
(e) Use of the approval plate obligates the applicant to whom the certificate of approval was granted to maintain the quality of each unit bearing it and guarantees that it is manufactured and assembled according to the drawings and specifications upon which a certificate of approval was based. Use of the approval plate is not authorized except on units that conform strictly with the drawings and specifications upon which the certificate of approval was based.

The cycling device shall be so arranged that when a 2-inch length of pipe cleaner is attached thereto the exposed end shall describe an arc with a radius of 4 inches ±
1/8
inch. The cycling device shall be so arranged that when the 2-inch length of pipe cleaner is attached thereto, its midpoint shall be in the center of the flame at one extreme end of the cycle.
(3) Each of five 2-inch lengths of pipe cleaner shall be soaked separately for a period of 2 minutes in the test sample that remained at room temperature. Each pipe cleaner shall then be removed from the test sample and permitted to drain freely until all excess fluid is expelled from it. Each soaked pipe cleaner shall be attached to the cycling device, the mechanism started, and the pipe cleaner permitted to enter and leave the burner flame, as described in paragraph (c) (2) of this section, until a self-sustaining flame shall be observed on the pipe cleaner. The number of cycles necessary to obtain a self-sustaining flame shall be noted and averaged for each of the five soaked pipe cleaners.
(4) After one test sample has remained in the oven for a period of 2 hours, the Petri dish containing it shall be removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature, after which 5 lengths of 2-inch pipe cleaner shall be soaked separately in the test sample for a period of 2 minutes. Then the test procedure stated in paragraph (c) (3) of this section shall be repeated.
(5) After one test sample has remained in the oven for a period of 4 hours, the Petri dish containing it shall be removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature, after which 5 lengths of 2-inch pipe cleaner shall be soaked separately in the test sample for a period of 2 minutes. Then the test procedure stated in paragraph (c) (3) of this section shall be repeated.
(d)
Appraisal of tests.
To be determined as fire resistant according to the test requirements of this section, the three following results shall be achieved:
(1) The average number of cycles before attaining a self-sustaining flame in the test described in paragraph (c) (3) of this section shall be 24 or more.
(2) The average number of cycles before attaining a self-sustaining flame in the test described in paragraph (c) (4) of this section shall be 18 or more.
(3) The average number of cycles before attaining a self-sustaining flame in the test described in paragraph (c) (5) of this section shall be 12 or more.

0.00125 percent, by volume, of oxides of nitrogen (calculated as equivalent nitrogen dioxide, NO
2
).
The oxygen (O
2
) content of the diluted mixture shall be not less than 20 percent, by volume. The maximum quantity of normal air to produce the above dilution shall be designated the ventilation rate.

# Note:
This ventilation rate will provide a factor of safety for exposure of persons to air mixtures containing harmful or objectionable gases and for minor variations in engine performance.
§ 36.46
Explosion tests of intake and exhaust systems.
(a) Explosion tests to determine the strength of the intake and exhaust systems to withstand internal explosions and the adequacy of the flame arresters to prevent the propagation of an explosion shall be made with the systems connected to the engine or the systems simulated as connected to the engine. The system shall be filled with and surrounded by an explosive natural gas-air
mixture. The mixture within the intake and exhaust systems shall be ignited by suitable means and the internal pressure developed by the resultant explosion shall be determined. Tests shall be conducted with the ignition source in several different locations to determine the maximum pressure developed by an internal explosion.
(b) Explosion tests shall be made with the engine at rest and with the flammable natural gas-air mixtures in the intake and exhaust systems. In other tests with the flammable mixture in motion, the engine shall be driven (externally) at speeds prescribed by MSHA but no liquid fuel shall be supplied to the injection valves.
(c) The temperature of the flame arresters in the intake or exhaust systems shall not exceed 212 °F. when an explosion test is conducted. Any water-spray cooling for the exhaust system shall not be operated and water shall not be present in the exhaust cooling boxes except when water is the cooling agent for a cooling box designed to act as a flame arrester, in which case MSHA will prescribe the test conditions.
(d) The explosion tests of the intake and exhaust systems shall not result in:
(1) Discharge of visible flame from any joint or opening.
(2) Ignition of surrounding flammable gas-air mixture.
(3) Development of dangerous afterburning.

§ 36.47
Tests of exhaust-gas cooling system.
(a) The adequacy of the exhaust-gas cooling system and its components shall be determined with the engine operating at the maximum allowable liquid fuel rate and governed speed with 0.5 ±0.1 percent, by volume, of natural gas in the intake air mixture. All parts of the engine and exhaust-gas cooling system shall be at their respective equilibrium temperatures. The cooling spray, if any, shall be operated, and all compartments designed to hold cooling water shall be filled with the quantity of water recommended by the applicant. No cooling air shall be circulated over the engine or components in the cooling system during the test.
(b) Determinations shall be made during the test to establish the cooling performance of the system, the cooling water consumption, high-water level when the system sprays excess water, and low-water level when the cooling system fails.
(c) The final exhaust-gas temperature at discharge from the cooling system, and before the exhaust gas is diluted with air, shall not exceed 170 °F. or the temperature of adiabatic saturation, if this temperature is lower.
(d) Water consumed in cooling the exhaust gas under the test conditions shall not exceed by more than 15 percent that required for adiabatic saturation of the exhaust-gas at the final temperature. Water in excess of that required for adiabatic saturation shall be considered as entrained water. Enough water shall be available in the cooling system or in reserve supply compartments for sustained satisfactory operation for at least 2
2/3
hours under the test conditions.

# Note:
This amount is enough to cool the exhaust for an 8-hour shift at one-third load factor.
(e) The adequacy of the automatic fuel shutoff actuated by the temperature of the final exhaust shall be determined with the engine operating under test conditions by withdrawing water until the cooling system fails to function. The final exhaust-gas temperature at which the liquid fuel to the engine is automatically shut off shall be noted. This temperature shall not exceed 185 °F.
(f) Following the automatic fuel shutoff test in paragraph (e) of this section, the temperature of the control point shall be allowed to fall to 170 °F. At this temperature and with the water replenished in the cooling system, it shall be possible to start the engine.

# Note:
If the cooling system includes a reserve supply water tank, the line or lines connecting it to the cooling compartment may require a suitable flame arrester.
(g) The effectiveness of the automatic engine shut-off, which will operate when the water in the cooling jacket(s) exceeds 212 °F., shall be determined by causing the jacket temperature to exceed 212 °F.
§ 36.48
Tests of surface temperature of engine and components of the cooling system.
(a) The surface temperatures of the engine, exhaust cooling system, and other components subject to heating by engine operation shall be determined with the engine operated as prescribed by MSHA. All parts of the engine, cooling system, and other components shall have reached their respective equilibrium temperatures. The exhaust cooling system shall be operated, but air shall not be circulated over the engine or components. Surface temperatures shall be measured at various places prescribed by MSHA to determine where maximum temperatures develop.
(b) The temperature of any surface shall not exceed 400 °F.

# Note to § 36.48:
The engine may be operated under test conditions prescribed by MSHA while completely surrounded by a flammable mixture. MSHA reserves the right to apply combustible materials to any surface for test. Operation under such conditions shall not ignite the flammable mixture.
[Sched. 31, 26 FR 645, Jan. 24, 1961, as amended at 61 FR 55526, Oct. 25, 1996]
§ 36.49
Tests of exhaust-gas dilution system.
The performance and adequacy of the exhaust-gas dilution system shall be determined in tests of the complete equipment. The engine, at temperature equilibrium, shall be operated in normal air as prescribed by MSHA. Samples of the undiluted exhaust gas and of the diluted exhaust gas, at location(s) prescribed by MSHA, shall be considered with the data obtained from the engine test (see § 36.43) to determine that the concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and aldehydes in the diluted exhaust shall be below the required concentrations specified in § 36.25(f)(1).
§ 36.50
Tests of fuel tank.
The fuel tank shall be inspected and tested to determine whether: (a) It is fuel-tight, (b) the vent maintains atmospheric pressure within the tank, and (c) the vent and closure restrict the outflow of liquid fuel.

General.
(a) Under section 103(g)(1) of the Act, a representative of miners, or where there is no such representative, a miner, who has reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of the act or a mandatory health or safety standard exists, or an imminent danger exists, has a right to obtain a special inspection if he or she gives notice of such violation to the Secretary or his duly authorized representative. The notice shall be reduced to writing and signed by the miners' representative or miner, and a copy that does not reveal the name of the person giving the notice must be served on the operator no later than at the time of the inspection. If the Secretary determines that a violation or danger does not exist, he must so notify the miners' representative or miner in writing.
(b) Under section 103(g)(2) of the Act, a representative of miners or, if there is no such representative, a miner, may notify in writing an authorized representative of the Secretary who is on mine premises prior to or during an inspection, of any violation or imminent danger which he or she has reason to believe exists in the mine. There shall be procedures for the informal review of any refusal by the Secretary's authorized representative to issue a citation with respect to such alleged violation or danger, including notification to the miners' representative or miner of the reasons for his disposition of the case.

(a) As soon as possible after the receipt of a notice of alleged violation or imminent danger under this subpart, the Secretary or his authorized representative shall make a special inspection to determine if a citation or withdrawal order should be issued, unless on the face of the notice, the condition complained of, even if it were found to exist, would clearly not constitute a violation or imminent danger.
(b) Where the Secretary or his authorized representative makes a special inspection under this subpart and finds a violation or imminent danger, a citation or withdrawal order, as appropriate, shall be issued.
§ 43.6
Notice of negative finding.
(a) If it is determined that a special inspection is not warranted, a written notice of negative finding shall be issued as soon as possible following such determination.
(b) If it is determined that an inspection is warranted and upon such inspection it is determined that neither a citation nor a withdrawal order should be issued for the alleged violation or imminent danger, a written notice of negative finding shall be issued by the authorized representative of the Secretary prior to leaving the mine premises.

# Subpart C—Informal Review
§ 43.7
Informal review upon written notice given to an inspector on the mine premises.
(a) A representative of miners or, where there is no such representative, a miner, who has reason to believe that a violation of the Act or a mandatory health or safety standard exists, or an imminent danger exists, may notify an authorized representative of the Secretary in writing prior to or during an inspection conducted by such representative of any violation of the Act or mandatory health or safety standard or of any imminent danger which he or she has reason to believe exists in the mine being inspected.

The allowance of an interlocutory appeal shall not stay the proceedings before the administrative law judge unless ordered by the Assistant Secretary.
§ 44.41
Summary decision.
(a)
No genuine issue of material fact.
(1) Where no genuine issue of a material fact is found to have been raised, the administrative law judge may issue an initial decision to become final 30 days after service thereof, unless, within such time, any party has filed an appeal with the Assistant Secretary.

(2) The Administrator determines that findings which originally supported the terms and conditions of the modification are no longer valid.
(b) The Administrator's amended proposed decision and order shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding and shall become final upon the 30th day after service thereof, unless a request for hearing on the proposed amendments is filed under § 44.14. If a request for hearing is filed, the amended proposed decision and order shall be subject to all procedures of subparts C through E of this part as if it were a proposed decision and order of the Administrator issued in accordance with § 44.13. The original modification shall remain in effect until superseded by a final amended modification.
(c) In cases where the original decision and order was based upon an alternative method of achieving the result of the standard, the amended decision and order shall at all times provide to miners at the mine at least the same measure of protection afforded to the miners at the mine by such standard. In cases where the original decision and order was based upon a diminution of safety to the miners resulting from application of the standard at such time, the amended decision and order
shall not reduce the protection afforded miners by the original decision and order.

# Subpart A—General
§ 50.1
Purpose and scope.
This part 50 implements sections 103(e) and 111 of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, 30 U.S.C. 801
et seq.,
and sections 4 and 13 of the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act, 30 U.S.C. 721
et seq.,
and applies to operators of coal, metal, and nonmetallic mines. It requires operators to immediately notify the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) of accidents, requires operators to investigate accidents, and restricts disturbance of accident related areas. This part also requires operators to file reports pertaining to accidents, occupational injuries and occupational illnesses, as well as employment and coal production data, with MSHA, and requires operators to maintain copies of reports at relevant mine offices. The purpose of this part is to implement MSHA's authority to investigate, and to obtain and utilize information pertaining to, accidents, injuries, and illnesses occurring or originating in mines. In utilizing information received under part 50, MSHA will develop rates of injury occurrence (incident rates or IR), on the basis of 200,000 hours of employee exposure (equivalent to 100 employees working 2,000 hours per year). The incidence rate for a particular injury category will be based on the formula:
IR = (number of cases × 200,000) divided by hours of employee exposure.
MSHA will develop data respecting injury severity using days away from work or days of restricted work activity and the 200,000 hour base as criteria. The severity measure (SM) for a particular injury category will be based on the formula:
SM = (sum of days × 200,000) divided by hours of employee exposure.
[42 FR 65535, Dec. 30, 1977; 43 FR 1617, Jan. 11, 1978, as amended at 43 FR 12318, Mar. 24, 1978; 71 FR 16666, Apr. 3, 2006]

§ 50.20-2
Criteria—“Transfer to another job.”
“Transfer to another job” means transfers, either temporary, or permanent, which are occasioned by a work-related injury or illness. Permanent or temporary transfers to remove miners from further exposure to health hazards are considered preventative in nature and are not required to be reported. Controlling the amount of exposure to radiation during some period of time is one example. Transfer of a coal miner to a less dusty area of a mine when the miner elects to exercise rights under Section 203(b) of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 is another example.
§ 50.20-3
Criteria—Differences between medical treatment and first aid.
(a) Medical treatment includes, but is not limited to, the suturing of any wound, treatment of fractures, application of a cast or other professional means of immobilizing an injured part of the body, treatment of infection arising out of an injury, treatment of bruise by the drainage of blood, surgical removal of dead or damaged skin (debridement), amputation or permanent loss of use of any part of the body, treatment of second and third degree burns. Procedures which are diagnostic in nature are not considered by themselves to constitute medical treatments. Visits to a physician, physical examinations, X-ray examinations, and hospitalization for observations, where no evidence of injury or illness is found and no medical treatment given, do not in themselves constitute medical treatment. Procedures which are preventive in nature also are not considered by themselves to constitute medical treatment. Tetanus and flu shots are considered preventative in nature. First aid includes any one-time treatment, and follow-up visit for the purpose of observation, of minor injuries such as, cuts, scratches, first degree
burns and splinters. Ointments, salves, antiseptics, and dressings to minor injuries are considered to be first aid.
(1)
Abrasion.
(i) First aid treatment is limited to cleaning a wound, soaking, applying antiseptic and nonprescription medication and bandages on the first visit and follow-up visits limited to observation including changing dressing and bandages. Additional cleaning and application of antiseptic constitutes first aid where it is required by work duties that soil the bandage.
(ii) Medical treatment includes examination for removal of imbedded foreign material, multiple soakings, whirlpool treatment, treatment of infection, or other professional treatments and any treatment involving more than a minor spot-type injury. Treatment of abrasions occurring to greater than full skin depth is considered medical treatment.
(2)
Bruises.
(i) First aid treatment is limited to a single soaking or application of cold compresses, and follow-up visits if they are limited only to observation.
(ii) Medical treatment includes multiple soakings, draining of collected blood, or other treatment beyond observation.
(3)
Burns, Thermal and Chemical (resulting in destruction of tissue by direct contact).
(i) First aid treatment is limited to cleaning or flushing the surface, soaking, applying cold compresses, antiseptics or nonprescription medications, and bandaging on the first visit, and follow-up visits restricted to observation, changing bandages, or additional cleaning. Most first degree burns are amenable to first aid treatment.
(ii) Medical treatment includes a series of treatments including soaks, whirlpool, skin grafts, and surgical debridement (cutting away dead skin). Most second and third degree burns require medical treatment.
(4)
Cuts and Lacerations.
(i) First aid treatment is the same as for abrasions except the application of butterfly closures for cosmetic purposes only can be considered first aid.
(ii) Medical treatment includes the application of butterfly closures for non-cosmetic purposes, sutures, (stitches), surgical debridement, treatment of infection, or other professional treatment.
(5)
Eye Injuries.
(i) First aid treatment is limited to irrigation, removal of foreign material not imbedded in eye, and application of nonprescription medications. A precautionary visit (special examination) to a physician is considered as first aid if treatment is limited to above items, and follow-up visits if they are limited to observation only.
(ii) Medical treatment cases involve removal of imbedded foreign objects, use of prescription medications, or other professional treatment.
(6)
Inhalation of Toxic or Corrosive Gases.
(i) First aid treatment is limited to removal of the miner to fresh air or the one-time administration of oxygen for several minutes.
(ii) Medical treatment consists of any professional treatment beyond that mentioned under first aid and all cases involving loss of consciousness.
(7)
Foreign Objects.
(i) First aid treatment is limited to cleaning the wound, removal of any foreign object by tweezers or other simple techniques, application of antiseptics and nonprescription medications, and bandaging on the first visit. Follow-up visits are limited to observation including changing of bandages. Additional cleaning and applications of antiseptic constitute first aid where it is required by work duties that soil the bandage.
(ii) Medical treatment consists of removal of any foreign object by physician due to depth of imbedment, size or shape of object, or location of wound. Treatment for infection, treatment of a reaction to tetanus booster, or other professional treatment, is considered medical treatment.
(8)
Sprains and Strains.
(i) First aid treatment is limited to soaking, application of cold compresses, and use of elastic bandages on the first visit. Follow-up visits for observation, including reapplying bandage, are first aid.
(ii) Medical treatment includes a series of hot and cold soaks, use of whirlpools, diathermy treatment, or other professional treatment.

§ 50.30-1
General instructions for completing MSHA Form 7000-2.
(a)
MSHA I.D. Number
is the 7-digit number assigned to the mine operation by MSHA. Any questions regarding the appropriate I.D. number to use should be directed to your local MSHA District Office.
(b)
Calendar Quarter:
First quarter is January, February, and March. Second quarter is April, May, and June. Third quarter is July, August, and September. Fourth quarter is October, November, and December.
(c)
County
is the name of the county, borough, or independent city in which the operation is located.
(d)
Operation Name
is the specific name of the mine or plant to which the MSHA I.D. number was assigned and for which the quarterly employment report is being submitted.
(e)
Company Name
is the name of the operating company that this report pertains to.
(f)
Mailing Address
is the address of the mine office where the quarterly employment report is to be retained. This should be as near the operation as possible.
(g)
Employment, Employee Hours, and Coal Production
—(1)
Operation Sub-Unit:
(i) Underground Mine: Report data for your underground workers on the first line. If you have personnel working at the surface of your underground mine, report data for those persons on the second line;
(ii) Surface Mine (Including Shops and Yards): Report on the appropriate line, employment and coal production for the mining operation. For surface mining sub-units 03, 04, 05 and 06, include all work associated with shops and yards;
(iii) Mill Operations, Preparation Plants, Breakers: Report data on all persons employed at your milling (crushing, sizing, grinding, concentrating, etc.) operation, preparation plant, or breaker, including those working in associated shops and yards. (Do not include personnel reported in
shops and yards associated with other sub-units.);
(iv) Office: Include in this category employees who work principally at the mine or preparation facility office.
(2)
Average number of persons working during quarter:
Show the average number of employees on the payroll during all active periods in the quarter. Include all classes of employees (supervisory, professional, technical proprietors, owners, operators, partners, and service personnel) on your payroll, full or part-time, Report Each Employee Under One Activity Only. For example: If one or more persons work both in the mine and the mill, report these employees under the activity where they spend most of their time. If necessary, estimate for the major activity. The average number may be computed by adding together the number of employees working during each pay period and then dividing by the number of pay periods. Do not include pay periods where no one worked. For example, during the quarter you had 5 pay periods where employees worked. The number of employees in each pay period was 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 respectively. To compute the average, add the number of employees working each pay period (10 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 64). Then divide by the number of pay periods (64 divided by 5 = 12.8). Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we get 13 as the average number of persons working.
(3)
Total employee-hours worked during the quarter:
Show the total hours worked by all employees during the quarter covered. Include all time where the employee was actually on duty, but exclude vacation, holiday, sick leave, and all other off-duty time, even though paid for. Make certain that each overtime hour is reported as one hour, and not as the overtime pay multiple for an hour of work. The hours reported should be obtained from payroll or other time records. If actual hours are not available, they may be estimated on the basis of scheduled hours. Make certain not to include hours paid but not worked.
(4)
Production of clean coal (short tons):
This section is to be compiled only by operators of underground or surface mines, but not by operators of central or independent coal preparation plants or operators of metal or nonmetal mines. Enter the total production of clean coal from the mine. This must include coal shipped from the mine and coal used for fuel at the mine, but exclude refuse and coal produced at another mine and purchased for use at the mine.
(h)
Other Reportable Data.
Indicate the number of reportable injuries or illnesses occurring at your operation during the quarter covered by this report. Show the name, title, and telephone number of the person to be contacted regarding this report, and show the date that this report was completed.

Dust, gas, mist, and fume surveys shall be conducted as frequently as necessary to determine the adequacy of control measures.
§ 56.5005
Control of exposure to airborne contaminants.
The following is required until April 7, 2026. Control of employee exposure to harmful airborne contaminants shall be, insofar as feasible, by prevention of contamination, removal by exhaust ventilation, or by dilution with uncontaminated air. However, where accepted, engineering control measures have not been developed or when necessary by the nature of work involved (for example, while establishing controls or occasional entry into hazardous atmospheres to perform maintenance or investigation), employees may work for reasonable periods of time in concentrations of airborne contaminants exceeding permissible levels if they are protected by appropriate respiratory protective equipment. Whenever respiratory protective equipment is used a program for selection, maintenance, training, fitting, supervision, cleaning, and use shall meet the following minimum requirements:
(a) Respirators approved by NIOSH under 42 CFR part 84 which are applicable and suitable for the purpose intended shall be furnished and miners shall use the protective equipment in accordance with training and instruction.
(b) A respirator program consistent with the requirements of ANSI Z88.2-1969, published by the American National Standards Institute and entitled “American National Standards Practices for Respiratory Protection ANSI Z88.2-1969,” approved August 11, 1969, which is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part hereof.
