Each reallocation adjustment generally results in at least two separate adjustments. One adjustment reverses the effect of the improper allocation of a partnership-related item, and the other adjustment effectuates the proper allocation of the partnership-related item. Generally, a reallocation adjustment results in one positive adjustment (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section) and one negative adjustment (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section).
(3)
Credit grouping.
Each adjustment to a partnership-related item that is reported or could be reported by a partnership as a credit on the partnership's return, including a reallocation adjustment, is placed in the credit grouping. Each adjustment to any tax, penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for the taxable year for which the partnership is liable under chapter 1 of the Code (chapter 1) and each adjustment to an imputed underpayment calculated by the partnership is placed in the credit grouping.
(4)
Creditable expenditure grouping
—(i)
In general.
Each adjustment to a creditable expenditure, including a reallocation adjustment to a creditable expenditure, is placed in the creditable expenditure grouping.
(ii)
Adjustment to a creditable expenditure
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this section, an adjustment to a partnership-related item is treated as an adjustment to a creditable expenditure if any person could take the item that is adjusted (or item as adjusted if the item was not originally reported by the partnership) as a credit. See § 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii) of this chapter. For instance, if the adjustment is a reduction of qualified research expenses, the adjustment is to a creditable expenditure for purposes of this section because any person allocated the qualified research expenses by the partnership could claim a credit with respect to their allocable portion of such expenses under section 41, rather than a deduction under section 174.
(B)
Creditable foreign tax expenditures.
The creditable expenditure grouping
includes each adjustment to a creditable foreign tax expenditure (CFTE) as defined in § 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii)(
b
) of this chapter, including any reallocation adjustment to a CFTE.
(5)
Residual grouping
—(i)
In general.
Any adjustment to a partnership-related item not described in paragraph (c)(2), (3), or (4) of this section is placed in the residual grouping.
(ii)
Adjustments to partnership-related items that are not allocated under section 704(b).
The residual grouping includes any adjustment to a partnership-related item that derives from an item that would not have been required to be allocated by the partnership to a reviewed year partner under section 704(b).
(6)
Recharacterization adjustments
—(i)
Recharacterization adjustment defined.
An adjustment that changes the character of a partnership-related item is a recharacterization adjustment. For instance, an adjustment that changes a loss from ordinary to capital or from active to passive is a recharacterization adjustment.
(ii)
Grouping recharacterization adjustments.
A recharacterization adjustment is placed in the appropriate grouping as described in paragraphs (c)(2) through (5) of this section.
(iii)
Recharacterization adjustments result in two partnership adjustments.
In general, a recharacterization adjustment results in at least two separate adjustments in the appropriate grouping under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. One adjustment reverses the improper characterization of the partnership-related item, and the other adjustment effectuates the proper characterization of the partnership-related item. A recharacterization adjustment results in two adjustments regardless of whether the amount of the partnership-related item is being adjusted. Generally, recharacterization adjustments result in one positive adjustment and one negative adjustment.
(d)
Subgroupings
—(1)
In general.
If all partnership adjustments are positive adjustments, this paragraph (d) does not apply. If any partnership adjustment within any grouping described in paragraph (c) of this section is a negative adjustment, the adjustments within that grouping are subgrouped in accordance with this paragraph (d). The IRS may, in its discretion, subgroup adjustments in a manner other than the manner described in this paragraph (d) when such subgrouping would appropriately reflect the facts and circumstances. For requests to modify the subgroupings, see § 301.6225-2(d)(6).
(2)
Definition of negative adjustments and positive adjustments
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, partnership adjustments made by the IRS are treated as follows:
(A) An increase in an item of gain is treated as an increase in an item of income;
(B) A decrease in an item of gain is treated as a decrease in an item of income;
(C) An increase in an item of loss or deduction is treated as a decrease in an item of income; and
(D) A decrease in an item of loss or deduction is treated as an increase in an item of income.
(ii)
Negative adjustment.
A
negative adjustment
is any adjustment that is a decrease in an item of income; a partnership adjustment treated under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section as a decrease in an item of income; an increase in an item of credit; a decrease in an item of tax, penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which the partnership is liable under chapter 1; or a decrease to an imputed underpayment calculated by the partnership for the taxable year.
(iii)
Positive adjustment.
A positive adjustment is any adjustment that is not a negative adjustment as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Subgrouping rules
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(3), an adjustment is subgrouped according to how the adjustment would be required to be taken into account separately under section 702(a) or any other provision of the Code, regulations, forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS applicable to the adjusted partnership-related item. A negative adjustment must be placed in the same subgrouping as another adjustment if the negative adjustment and the other adjustment would have been properly netted at the partnership level and such netted amount would have been
required to be allocated to the partners of the partnership as a single partnership-related item for purposes of section 702(a), other provision of the Code, regulations, forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS. For purposes of creating subgroupings under this section, if any adjustment could be subject to any preference, limitation, or restriction under the Code (or not allowed, in whole or in part, against ordinary income) if taken into account by any person, the adjustment is placed in a separate subgrouping from all other adjustments within the grouping.
(ii)
Subgrouping reallocation adjustments
—(A)
Reallocation adjustments in the reallocation grouping.
Each positive adjustment and each negative adjustment resulting from a reallocation adjustment as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is placed in its own separate subgrouping within the reallocation grouping. For instance, if the reallocation adjustment reallocates a deduction from one partner to another partner, the decrease in the deduction (positive adjustment) allocated to the first partner is placed in a subgrouping within the reallocation grouping separate from the increase in the deduction (negative adjustment) allocated to the second partner. Notwithstanding the requirement that reallocation adjustments be placed into separate subgroupings, if a particular partner or group of partners has two or more reallocation adjustments allocable to such partner or group, such adjustments may be subgrouped in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section and netted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(B)
Reallocation adjustments in the credit grouping.
In the case of a reallocation adjustment to a credit, which is placed in the credit grouping pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the decrease in credits allocable to one partner or group of partners is treated as a positive adjustment, and the increase in credits allocable to another partner or group of partners is treated as a negative adjustment. Each positive adjustment and each negative adjustment resulting from a reallocation adjustment to credits is placed in its own separate subgrouping within the credit grouping.
(iii)
Subgroupings within the creditable expenditure grouping
—(A)
In general.
Each adjustment in the creditable expenditure grouping described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section is subgrouped in accordance with paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (iii) of this section. For rules related to creditable expenditures other than CFTEs, see paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.
(B)
Subgroupings for adjustments to CFTEs.
Each adjustment to a CFTE is subgrouped based on the separate category of income to which the CFTE relates in accordance with section 904(d) and the regulations in part 1 of this chapter, and to account for any different allocation of the CFTE between partners. Two or more adjustments to CFTEs are included within the same subgrouping only if each adjustment relates to CFTEs in the same separate category, and each adjusted partnership-related item would be allocated to the partners in the same ratio had those items been properly reflected on the partnership return for the reviewed year.
(iv)
Subgrouping recharacterization adjustments.
Each positive adjustment and each negative adjustment resulting from a recharacterization adjustment as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section is placed in its own separate subgrouping within the residual grouping. If a particular partner or group of partners has two or more recharacterization adjustments allocable to such partner or group, such adjustments may be subgrouped in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section and netted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(e)
Netting adjustments within each grouping or subgrouping
—(1)
In general.
All adjustments within a subgrouping determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section are netted in accordance with this paragraph (e) to determine whether there is a net positive adjustment (as defined in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section) or net negative adjustment (as defined in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section) for that subgrouping. If paragraph (d) of this section does not apply because a
grouping only includes positive adjustments, all adjustments in that grouping are netted in accordance with this paragraph (e). For purposes of this paragraph (e), netting means summing all adjustments together within each grouping or subgrouping, as appropriate.
(2)
Limitations on netting adjustments.
Positive adjustments and negative adjustments may only be netted against each other if they are in the same grouping in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If a negative adjustment is in a subgrouping in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the negative adjustment may only net with a positive adjustment also in that same subgrouping in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. An adjustment in one grouping or subgrouping may not be netted against an adjustment in any other grouping or subgrouping. Adjustments from one taxable year may not be netted against adjustments from another taxable year.
(3)
Results of netting adjustments within groupings or subgroupings
—(i)
Groupings other than the credit and creditable expenditure groupings.
Except as described in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, each net positive adjustment (as defined in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section) with respect to a particular grouping or subgrouping that results after netting the adjustments in accordance with this paragraph (e) is included in the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Each net negative adjustment (as defined in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section) with respect to a grouping or subgrouping that results after netting the adjustments in accordance with this paragraph (e) is excluded from the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Adjustments underlying a net negative adjustment described in the preceding sentence are adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment (as described in paragraph (f) of this section).
(ii)
Credit grouping.
Any net positive adjustment or net negative adjustment in the credit grouping (including any such adjustment with respect to a subgrouping within the credit grouping) is excluded from the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment. A net positive adjustment described in this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) is taken into account under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section. A net negative adjustment described in this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), including a negative adjustment to a credit resulting from a reallocation adjustment that was placed in a separate subgrouping pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, is treated as an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, unless the IRS determines that such net negative adjustment should be taken into account under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section.A net negative adjustment to a tax, penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which the partnership is liable under chapter 1 or an adjustment to any imputed underpayment calculated by the partnership for the taxable year is not an adjustment described in paragraph (f) of this section (adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment).
(iii)
Treatment of creditable expenditures
—(A)
Creditable foreign tax expenditures.
A net decrease to a CFTE in any CFTE subgrouping (as described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section) is treated as a net positive adjustment described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section and is excluded from the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. A net increase to a CFTE in any CFTE subgrouping is treated as a net negative adjustment described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. For rules related to creditable expenditures other than CFTEs, see paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.
(B) [Reserved]
(4)
Net positive adjustment and net negative adjustment defined
—(i)
Net positive adjustment.
A
net positive adjustment
means an amount that is greater than zero which results from netting adjustments within a grouping or subgrouping in accordance with this paragraph (e). A net positive adjustment includes a positive adjustment that was not netted with any other adjustment. A net positive adjustment includes a net decrease in an item of credit.
(ii)
Net negative adjustment.
A
net negative adjustment
means any amount which results from netting adjustments within a grouping or subgrouping in accordance with this paragraph (e) that is not a net positive adjustment (as defined in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section). A net negative adjustment includes a negative adjustment that was not netted with any other adjustment.
(f)
Partnership adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a partnership adjustment does not result in an imputed underpayment if—
(i) After grouping, subgrouping, and netting the adjustments as described in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, the result of netting with respect to any grouping or subgrouping that includes a particular partnership adjustment is a net negative adjustment (as described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section); or
(ii) The calculation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section results in an amount that is zero or less than zero, unless paragraph (f)(3) of this section applies.
(2)
Treatment of an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment.
Any adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment (as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section) is taken into account by the partnership in the adjustment year in accordance with § 301.6225-3. If the partnership makes an election pursuant to section 6226 with respect to an imputed underpayment, the adjustments that do not result in that imputed underpayment that are associated with that imputed underpayment (as described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) are taken into account by the reviewed year partners in accordance with § 301.6226-3.
(3)
Exception to treatment as an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment
—(i)
Application of this paragraph (f)(3).
If the calculation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section results in an amount that is zero or less than zero due to the inclusion of a net negative adjustment to a tax, penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which the partnership is liable under chapter 1 or an adjustment to any imputed underpayment calculated by the partnership for the taxable year, this paragraph (f)(3) applies, and paragraph (f)(1) of this section does not apply except as provided in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.
(ii)
Recalculation if paragraph (f)(3) of this section applies
—(A)
In general.
If this paragraph (f)(3) applies, the imputed underpayment is recalculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section without regard to a net negative adjustment to a tax, penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which the partnership is liable under chapter 1 or an adjustment to any imputed underpayment calculated by the partnership for the taxable year. The net negative adjustment that was excluded from the imputed underpayment recalculation is then treated in one of two ways under paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section depending on the results of the recalculation.
(B)
Recalculation is greater than zero.
If the result of the recalculation under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section is greater than zero, the IRS may apply the portion of the net negative adjustment(s) that was excluded from the recalculation to reduce the imputed underpayment to zero, but not below zero. In this case, the imputed underpayment is zero, but the adjustments included in the recalculation and the remaining net negative adjustment(s) excluded from the recalculation under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section are not adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment subject to treatment as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. See paragraph (h)(13) of this section (
Example 13
).
(C)
Recalculation is zero or less than zero.
If the result of the recalculation under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section is zero or less than zero, the adjustments included in the recalculation are treated as adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section. The net negative adjustment(s) that was excluded from the recalculation is not an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment subject to treatment as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. See
paragraph (h)(14) of this section (
Example 14
).
(g)
Multiple imputed underpayments in a single administrative proceeding
—(1)
In general.
The IRS, in its discretion, may determine that partnership adjustments for the same partnership taxable year result in more than one imputed underpayment. The determination of whether there is more than one imputed underpayment for any partnership taxable year, and if so, which partnership adjustments are taken into account to calculate any particular imputed underpayment is based on the facts and circumstances and nature of the partnership adjustments. See § 301.6225-2(d)(6) for modification of the number and composition of imputed underpayments.
(2)
Types of imputed underpayments
—(i)
In general.
There are two types of imputed underpayments: A general imputed underpayment (described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section) and a specific imputed underpayment (described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section). Each type of imputed underpayment is separately calculated in accordance with this section.
(ii)
General imputed underpayment.
The general imputed underpayment is calculated based on all adjustments (other than adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment under paragraph (f) of this section) that are not taken into account to determine a specific imputed underpayment under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section. There is only one general imputed underpayment in any administrative proceeding. If there is one imputed underpayment in an administrative proceeding, it is a general imputed underpayment and may take into account adjustments described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, if any, and all adjustments that do not result in that general imputed underpayment (as described in paragraph (f) of this section) are associated with that general imputed underpayment.
(iii)
Specific imputed underpayment
—(A)
In general.
The IRS may, in its discretion, designate a specific imputed underpayment with respect to adjustments to a partnership-related item or items that were allocated to one partner or a group of partners that had the same or similar characteristics or that participated in the same or similar transaction or on such other basis as the IRS determines properly reflects the facts and circumstances. The IRS may designate more than one specific imputed underpayment with respect to any partnership taxable year. For instance, in a single partnership taxable year there may be a specific imputed underpayment with respect to adjustments related to a transaction affecting some, but not all, partners of the partnership (such as adjustments that are specially allocated to certain partners) and a second specific imputed underpayment with respect to adjustments resulting from a reallocation of a distributive share of income from one partner to another partner. The IRS may, in its discretion, determine that partnership adjustments that could be taken into account to calculate one or more specific imputed underpayments under this paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A) for a partnership taxable year are more appropriately taken into account in determining the general imputed underpayment for such taxable year. For instance, the IRS may determine that it is more appropriate to calculate only the general imputed underpayment if, when calculating the specific imputed underpayment requested by the partnership, there is an increase in the number of the partnership adjustments that after grouping and netting result in net negative adjustments and are disregarded in calculating the specific imputed underpayment.
(B)
Adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment associated with a specific imputed underpayment.
If the IRS designates a specific imputed underpayment, the IRS will designate which adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment, if any, are appropriate to associate with that specific imputed underpayment. If the adjustments underlying that specific imputed underpayment are reallocation adjustments or recharacterization adjustments, the net negative adjustment that resulted from the reallocation or recharacterization is associated with the specific imputed underpayment. Any adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment that are not associated with a specific
imputed underpayment under this paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B) are associated with the general imputed underpayment.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of these examples, unless otherwise stated, each partnership is subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code, each partnership and its partners are calendar year taxpayers, all partners are U.S. persons, the highest rate of income tax in effect for all taxpayers is 40 percent for all relevant periods, and no partnership requests modification under § 301.6225-2.
(1)
Example 1.
Partnership reports on its 2019 partnership return $100 of ordinary income and an ordinary deduction of −$70. The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year and determines that ordinary income was $105 instead of $100 ($5 adjustment) and that the ordinary deduction was −$80 instead of −$70 (−$10 adjustment). Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the adjustments are both in the residual grouping. The −$10 adjustment to the ordinary deduction would not have been netted at the partnership level with the $5 adjustment to ordinary income and would not have been required to be allocated to the partners of the partnership as a single partnership-related item for purposes of section 702(a), other provision of the Code, regulations, forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS. Because the −$10 adjustment to the ordinary deduction would result in a decrease in the imputed underpayment if netted with the $5 adjustment to ordinary income and because it might be limited if taken into account by any person, the −$10 adjustment must be placed in a separate subgrouping from the $5 adjustment to ordinary income. See paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. The total netted partnership adjustment is $5, which results in an imputed underpayment of $2. The −$10 adjustment to the ordinary deduction is a net negative amount and is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment which is taken into account by Partnership in the adjustment year in accordance with § 301.6225-3.
(2)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as
Example 1
in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, except that the −$10 adjustment to the ordinary deduction would have been netted at the partnership level with the $5 adjustment to ordinary income and would have been required to be allocated to the partners of the partnership as a single partnership-related item for purposes of section 702(a), other provision of the Code, regulations, forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS. Therefore, the $5 adjustment and the −$10 adjustment must be placed in the same subgrouping within the residual grouping. The $5 adjustment and the −$10 adjustments are then netted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. Such netting results in a net negative adjustment (as defined under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section) of −$5. Pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the −$5 net negative adjustment is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment. Because the only net adjustment is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment, there is no imputed underpayment.
(3)
Example 3.
Partnership reports on its 2019 partnership return ordinary income of $300, long-term capital gain of $125, long-term capital loss of −$75, a depreciation deduction of −$100, and a tax credit that can be claimed by the partnership of $5. In an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year, the IRS determines that ordinary income is $500 ($200 adjustment), long-term capital gain is $200 ($75 adjustment), long-term capital loss is −$25 ($50 adjustment), the depreciation deduction is −$70 ($30 adjustment), and the tax credit is $3 ($2 adjustment). Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the adjustment to the tax credit is in the credit grouping under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The remaining adjustments are part of the residual grouping under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, all of the adjustments in the residual grouping are positive adjustments. Because there are no negative adjustments, there are no subgroupings within the residual grouping. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the adjustments
in the residual grouping are summed for a total netted partnership adjustment of $355. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, the total netted partnership adjustment is multiplied by 40 percent (highest tax rate in effect), which results in $142. Under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, the $142 is increased by the $2 credit adjustment, resulting in an imputed underpayment of $144.
(4)
Example 4.
Partnership reported on its 2019 partnership return long-term capital gain of $125. In an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year, the IRS determines the long-term capital gain should have been reported as ordinary income of $125. There are no other adjustments for the 2019 taxable year. This recharacterization adjustment results in two adjustments in the residual grouping pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section: an increase in ordinary income of $125 ($125 adjustment) as well as a decrease of long-term capital gain of $125 (−$125 adjustment). The decrease in long-term capital gain is a negative adjustment under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section and the increase in ordinary income is a positive adjustment under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the adjustment to long-term capital gain is placed in a subgrouping separate from the adjustment to ordinary income because the reduction of long-term capital gain is required to be taken into account separately pursuant to section 702(a). The $125 decrease in long-term capital gain is a net negative adjustment in the long-term capital subgrouping and, as a result, is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment under paragraph (f) of this section and is taken into account in accordance with § 301.6225-3. The $125 increase in ordinary income results in a net positive adjustment under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section. Because the ordinary subgrouping is the only subgrouping resulting in a net positive adjustment, $125 is the total netted partnership adjustment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, $125 is multiplied by 40 percent resulting in an imputed underpayment of $50.
(5)
Example 5.
Partnership reported a $100 deduction for certain expenses on its 2019 partnership return and an additional $100 deduction with respect to the same type of expenses on its 2020 partnership return. The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 and 2020 taxable years and determines that Partnership reported a portion of the expenses as a deduction in 2019 that should have been taken into account in 2020. Therefore, for taxable year 2019, the IRS determines that Partnership should have reported a deduction of $75 with respect to the expenses ($25 adjustment in the 2019 residual grouping). For 2020, the IRS determines that Partnership should have reported a deduction of $125 with respect to these expenses (−$25 adjustment in the 2020 residual grouping). There are no other adjustments for the 2019 and 2020 partnership taxable years. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the adjustments for 2019 and 2020 are not netted with each other. The 2019 adjustment of $25 is the only adjustment for that year and a net positive adjustment under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, and therefore the total netted partnership adjustment for 2019 is $25 pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The $25 total netted partnership adjustment is multiplied by 40 percent resulting in an imputed underpayment of $10 for Partnership's 2019 taxable year. The $25 increase in the deduction for 2020, a net negative adjustment under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment for that year. Therefore, there is no imputed underpayment for 2020.
(6)
Example 6.
On its partnership return for the 2020 taxable year, Partnership reported ordinary income of $100 and a capital gain of $50. Partnership had four equal partners during the 2020 tax year, all of whom were individuals. On its partnership return for the 2020 tax year, the capital gain was allocated to partner E and the ordinary income was allocated to all partners based on their interests in Partnership. In an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year, the
IRS determines that for 2020 the capital gain allocated to E should have been $75 instead of $50 and that Partnership should have recognized an additional $10 in ordinary income. In the NOPPA mailed by the IRS, the IRS may determine pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section that there is a general imputed underpayment with respect to the increase in ordinary income and a specific imputed underpayment with respect to the increase in capital gain specially allocated to E.
(7)
Example 7.
On its partnership return for the 2020 taxable year, Partnership reported a recourse liability of $100. During an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year, the IRS determines that the $100 recourse liability should have been reported as a $100 nonrecourse liability. Under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the adjustment to the character of the liability is an adjustment to an item that cannot be allocated under section 704(b). The adjustment therefore is treated as a $100 increase in income because such recharacterization of a liability could result in up to $100 in taxable income if taken into account by any person. The $100 increase in income is a positive adjustment in the residual grouping under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section. There are no other adjustments for the 2020 partnership taxable year. The $100 positive adjustment is treated as a net positive adjustment under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, and the total netted partnership adjustment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is $100. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the total netted partnership adjustment is multiplied by 40 percent for an imputed underpayment of $40.
(8)
Example 8.
Partnership reports on its 2019 partnership return $400 of CFTEs in the general category under section 904(d). The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year and determines that the amount of CFTEs was $300 instead of $400 (−$100 adjustment to CFTEs). No other adjustments are made for the 2019 taxable year. The −$100 adjustment to CFTEs is placed in the creditable expenditure grouping described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the decrease to CFTEs in the creditable expenditure grouping is treated as a positive adjustment to (decrease in) credits in the credit grouping under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Because no other adjustments have been made, the $100 decrease in credits produces an imputed underpayment of $100 under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(9)
Example 9.
Partnership reports on its 2019 partnership return $400 of CFTEs in the passive category under section 904(d). The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year and determines that the CFTEs reported by Partnership were general category instead of passive category CFTEs. No other adjustments are made. Under the rules in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, an adjustment to the category of a CFTE is treated as two separate adjustments: An increase to general category CFTEs of $400 and a decrease to passive category CFTEs of $400. Both adjustments are included in the creditable expenditure grouping under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, but they are included in separate subgroupings. Therefore, the two amounts do not net. Instead, the $400 increase to CFTEs in the general category subgrouping is treated as a net negative adjustment under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section and is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment under paragraph (f) of this section. The decrease to CFTEs in the passive category subgrouping of the creditable expenditure grouping results in a decrease in CFTEs. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, it is treated as a positive adjustment to (decrease in) credits in the credit grouping under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, which results in an imputed underpayment of $400 under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(10)
Example 10.
Partnership has two partners, A and B. Under the partnership agreement, $100 of the CFTE is specially allocated to A for the 2019 taxable year. The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year and determines that $100 of CFTE should be
reallocated from A to B. Because the adjustment reallocates a creditable expenditure, paragraph (c)(4) of this section provides that it is included in the creditable expenditure grouping rather than the reallocation grouping. The partnership adjustment is a −$100 adjustment to general category CFTE allocable to A and an increase of $100 to general category CFTE allocable to B. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, the −$100 adjustment to general category CFTE and the increase of $100 to general category CFTE are included in separate subgroupings in the creditable expenditure grouping. The $100 increase in general category CFTEs, B-allocation subgrouping, is a net negative adjustment, which does not result in an imputed underpayment and is therefore taken into account by the partnership in the adjustment year in accordance with § 301.6225-3. The net decrease to CFTEs in the general-category, A-allocation subgrouping, is treated as a positive adjustment to (decrease in) credits in the credit grouping under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, resulting in an imputed underpayment of $100 under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(11)
Example 11.
Partnership has two partners, A and B. Partnership owns two entities, DE1 and DE2, that are disregarded as separate from their owner for Federal income tax purposes and are operating in and paying taxes to foreign jurisdictions. The partnership agreement provides that all items from DE1 and DE2 are allocable to A and B in the following manner. Items related to DE1: To A 75 percent and to B 25 percent. Items related to DE2: To A 25 percent and to B 75 percent. On Partnership's 2018 return, Partnership reports CFTEs in the general category of $300, $100 with respect to DE1 and $200 with respect to DE2. Partnership allocates the $300 of CFTEs $125 and $175 to A and B respectively. During an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2018 taxable year, the IRS determines that Partnership understated the amount of creditable foreign tax paid by DE2 by $40 and overstated the amount of creditable foreign tax paid by DE1 by $80. No other adjustments are made. Because the two adjustments each relate to CFTEs that are subject to different allocations, the two adjustments are in different subgroupings under paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. The adjustment reducing the CFTEs related to DE1 results in a decrease in CFTEs within that subgrouping and under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is treated as a decrease in credits in the credit grouping under paragraph (c)(3) of this section and results in an imputed underpayment of $80 under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The increase of $40 of general category CFTE related to the DE2 subgrouping results in an increase in CFTEs within that subgrouping and is treated as a net negative adjustment, which does not result in an imputed underpayment and is taken into account in the adjustment year in accordance with § 301.6225-3.
(12)
Example 12.
Partnership has two partners, A and B. For the 2019 taxable year, Partnership allocated $70 of long term capital loss to B as well as $30 of ordinary income. In an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year, the IRS determines that the $30 of ordinary income and the $70 of long term capital loss should be reallocated from B to A. The partnership adjustments are a decrease of $30 of ordinary income (−$30 adjustment) allocated to B and a corresponding increase of $30 of ordinary income ($30 adjustment) allocated to A, as well as a decrease of $70 of long term capital loss ($70 adjustment) allocated to B and a corresponding increase of $70 of long term capital loss (−$70 adjustment) allocated to A. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, for purposes of determining the imputed underpayment, each positive adjustment and each negative adjustment allocated to A and B is placed in its own separate subgrouping. However, notwithstanding the general requirement that reallocation adjustments be subgrouped separately, the reallocation adjustments allocated to A and B may be subgrouped in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section because there are two reallocation adjustments allocated to each of A and B, respectively. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, because the partnership
adjustment allocated to A would not have been netted at the partnership level and would not have been allocated to A as a single partnership-related item for purposes of section 702(a), other provisions of the Code, regulations, forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS, the positive adjustment and the negative adjustment allocated to A remain in separate subgroupings. For the same reasons with respect to the adjustments allocated to B, the positive adjustment and the negative adjustment allocated to B also remain in separate subgroupings. As a result, the reallocation grouping would have four subgroupings, one for each adjustment: The decrease in ordinary income allocated to B (−$30 adjustment), the increase in ordinary income allocated to A ($30 adjustment), the decrease in long term capital loss allocated to B ($70 adjustment), and the increase long term capital loss allocated to A (−$70 adjustment). Pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, no netting may occur between subgroupings. Accordingly, the ordinary income allocated to A ($30 adjustment) and the long term capital loss allocated to B ($70 adjustment) are both net positive adjustments. These net positive adjustments are added together to determine the total netted partnership adjustment of $100. The total netted partnership adjustment is multiplied by 40 percent, which results in an imputed underpayment of $40. The ordinary income allocated to B (−$30 adjustment) and the long term capital loss allocated to A (−$70 adjustment) are net negative adjustments treated as adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment taken into account by the partnership pursuant to § 301.6225-3.
(13)
Example 13.
The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 partnership return and makes adjustments as follows: net positive adjustment of $100 ordinary income, net negative adjustment of $20 in credits, and a net negative adjustment of $25 to a chapter 1 tax liability of the partnership. The IRS determines that the net negative adjustment in credits should be taken into account in the calculation of the imputed underpayment in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $100 net positive adjustment to ordinary income is multiplied by 40 percent (highest tax rate in effect), which results in a $40 imputed underpayment. The adjustments in the credits grouping are then applied, which include the adjustment to credits and the adjustment to the chapter 1 tax liability. Applying the credits results in an amount less than zero as described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section ($40−$20−$25 = −$5). Pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the imputed underpayment is recalculated without regard to the adjustment to the chapter 1 tax liability, resulting in a recalculation amount greater than zero as described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section ($40−$20 = $20). Pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the IRS may apply a portion of the adjustment to chapter 1 tax liability to reduce the recalculation to zero but not below zero. In this case, the recalculation amount would be reduced to zero using $20 of the $25 adjustment to chapter 1 tax liability. Because the imputed underpayment was reduced to zero, pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the adjustments that went into the recalculation are not adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment. These adjustments are the $100 adjustment to ordinary income and the $20 adjustment to credits. The remaining $5 adjustment to the chapter 1 tax liability of the partnership is an adjustment that is treated as described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section and is therefore not taken into account on the partnership's adjustment year return.
(14)
Example 14.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(13) of this section (
Example 13
), but the negative adjustment to credits is $50 instead of $20. Applying the credits results in an amount less than zero as described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section ($40−$50−$25 = −$35). Pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the imputed underpayment is recalculated without regard to the adjustment to the chapter 1 tax liability, resulting in a recalculation amount less than zero as described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of
this section ($40−$50 = −$10). Pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, the partnership adjustments resulting in the −$10 recalculation amount are adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment treated in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, and the $25 adjustment to chapter 1 tax liability is not treated as such an adjustment and is therefore not taken into account on the partnership's adjustment year return.
(15)
Example 15.
On its timely filed return for the 2022 taxable year, Partnership reports that it self-certified as a qualified opportunity fund, as defined in section 1400Z-2(d). Partnership also reports that it has not satisfied the 90-percent investment standard, as defined in § 1.1400Z2(a)-1(b)(4) of this chapter, and reports an amount due under section 1400Z-2(f) of $100. The IRS does not utilize § 301.6241-7(g) to determine adjustments to these partnership-related items without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63. In an administrative proceeding involving Partnership's 2022 taxable year, the IRS, in examining the amount due under section 1400Z-2(f), determines that Partnership incorrectly reported its qualified opportunity zone property for one month and that there should be one $40 adjustment to reduce the assets Partnership reported as qualified opportunity zone property. The IRS also determines that the basis of one of Partnership's qualified opportunity zone properties should be reduced by $30. Under paragraph (d) of this section, the adjustments to the basis and character of an asset are not adjustments to an item of income. Therefore, the $30 adjustment to the basis of the asset and the $40 recharacterization of an asset are treated as positive adjustments. As a result of the determinations, the IRS determines that the amount due for Partnership failing the section 1400Z-2(d)(1) investment standard should be increased. This results in a $4 adjustment to Partnership's liability under section 1400Z-2(f) which, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is a positive adjustment because it is an increase in an amount Partnership is liable for under chapter 1. The total netted partnership adjustment for the 2022 taxable year is $70 ($30 basis adjustment + $40 recharacterization adjustment). Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the $4 adjustment to Partnership's liability under chapter 1 is treated as an adjustment to a credit. Assuming the highest rate under section 1 or 11 is 40% this results in an imputed underpayment of $32 (($70 × 40%) + $4 section 1400Z-2(f) adjustment). The IRS issues a notice of final partnership adjustment to Partnership for its 2022 taxable year and Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 with regard to the $32 imputed underpayment. Under § 301.6226-2(g)(4) , when Partnership furnishes statements to its reviewed year partners, Partnership must pay the $4 section 1400Z-2(f) amount because it is the liability of Partnership and may not include that adjustment in the statements.
(i)

Election under § 301.9100-22 in effect.
This section applies to any partnership taxable year beginning after November 2, 2015 and before January 1, 2018, for which a valid election under § 301.9100-22T is in effect.
[T.D. 9844, 84 FR 6534, Feb. 27, 2019, as amended by T.D. 9969, 87 FR 75490, Dec. 9, 2022; 88 FR 756, Jan. 5, 2023]
§ 301.6225-2
Modification of imputed underpayment.
(a)
Partnership may request modification of an imputed underpayment.
A partnership that has received a notice of proposed partnership adjustment (NOPPA) under section 6231(a)(2) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may request modification of a proposed imputed underpayment set forth in the NOPPA in accordance with this section and any forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS. The effect of modification on a proposed imputed underpayment is described in paragraph (b) of this section. Unless otherwise described in paragraph (d) of
this section, a partnership may request any type of modification of an imputed underpayment described in paragraph (d) of this section in the time and manner described in paragraph (c) of this section. A partnership may request modification with respect to a partnership adjustment (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)) that does not result in an imputed underpayment (as described in § 301.6225-1(f)(1)(ii)) as described in paragraph (e) of this section. Only the partnership representative may request modification under this section. See section 6223 and § 301.6223-2 for rules regarding the binding authority of the partnership representative. For purposes of this section, the term
relevant partner
means any person for whom modification is requested by the partnership that is—
(1) A reviewed year partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)), including any pass-through partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(5)), except for any reviewed year partner that is a wholly-owned entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes; or
(2) An indirect partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(4)) except for any indirect partner that is a wholly-owned entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes.
(b)
Effect of modification
-(1)
In general.
A modification of an imputed underpayment under this section that is approved by the IRS may result in an increase or decrease in the amount of an imputed underpayment set forth in the NOPPA. A modification under this section has no effect on the amount of any partnership adjustment determined under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter C of chapter 63). See paragraph (e) of this section for the effect of modification on adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment. A modification may increase or decrease an imputed underpayment by affecting the extent to which adjustments factor into the determination of the imputed underpayment (as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), the tax rate that is applied in calculating the imputed underpayment (as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section), and the number and composition of imputed underpayments, including the placement of adjustments in groupings and subgroupings (if applicable) (as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section), as well as to the extent of other modifications allowed under rules provided in forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS (as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section). If a partnership requests more than one modification under this section, modifications are taken into account in the following order:
(i) Modifications that affect the extent to which an adjustment factors into the determination of the imputed underpayment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
(ii) Modification of the number and composition of imputed underpayments under paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and
(iii) Modifications that affect the tax rate under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(2)
Modifications that affect partnership adjustments for purposes of determining the imputed underpayment.
If the IRS approves modification with respect to a partnership adjustment, such partnership adjustment is excluded from the determination of the imputed underpayment as determined under § 301.6225-1(b). This paragraph (b)(2) applies to modifications under—
(i) Paragraph (d)(2) of this section (amended returns and the alternative procedure to filing amended returns);
(ii) Paragraph (d)(3) of this section (tax-exempt status);
(iii) Paragraph (d)(5) of this section (specified passive activity losses);
(iv) Paragraph (d)(7) of this section (qualified investment entities);
(v) Paragraph (d)(8) of this section (closing agreements), if applicable;
(vi) Paragraph (d)(9) of this section (tax treaty modifications), if applicable; and
(vii) Paragraph (d)(10) of this section (other modifications), if applicable.
(3)
Modifications that affect the tax rate
—(i)
In general.
If the IRS approves a modification with respect to the tax rate applied to a partnership adjustment, such modification results in a reduction in tax rate applied to the total netted partnership adjustment with respect to the partnership adjustments in
accordance with this paragraph (b)(3). A modification of the tax rate does not affect how the partnership adjustment factors into the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment. This paragraph (b)(3) applies to modifications under—
(A) Paragraph (d)(4) of this section (rate modification);
(B) Paragraph (d)(8) of this section (closing agreements), if applicable;
(C) Paragraph (d)(9) of this section (tax treaty modifications), if applicable; and
(D) Paragraph (d)(10) of this section (other modifications), if applicable.
(ii)
Determination of the imputed underpayment in the case of rate modification.
Except as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, in the case of an approved modification described under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the imputed underpayment is the sum of the total netted partnership adjustment consisting of the net positive adjustments not subject to rate reduction under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section (taking into account any approved modifications under paragraph (b)(2) of the section), plus the
rate-modified netted partnership adjustment
determined under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, reduced or increased by any adjustments to credits (taking into account any modifications under paragraph (b)(4) of this section). The total netted partnership adjustment not subject to rate reduction under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section (taking into account any approved modifications under paragraph (b)(2) of the section) is determined by multiplying the partnership adjustments included in the total netted partnership adjustment that are not subject to rate modification under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section (including any partnership adjustment that remains after applying paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) by the highest tax rate (as described in § 301.6225-1(b)(1)(iv)).
(iii)
Calculation of rate-modified netted partnership adjustment in the case of a rate modification.
The
rate-modified netted partnership adjustment
is determined as follows—
(A) Determine each relevant partner's distributive share of the partnership adjustments subject to an approved modification under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section based on how each adjustment subject to rate modification was allocated in the NOPPA, or if the appropriate allocation was not addressed in the NOPPA, how the adjustment would be properly allocated under subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter K) to such relevant partner in the reviewed year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(8)).
(B) Multiply each partnership adjustment determined under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section by the tax rate applicable to such adjustment based on the approved modification described under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(C) Add all of the amounts calculated under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section with respect to each partnership adjustment subject to an approved modification described under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(iv)
Rate modification in the case of special allocations.
If an imputed underpayment results from adjustments to more than one partnership-related item and any relevant partner for whom modification described under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is approved has a distributive share of such items that is not the same with respect to all such items, the imputed underpayment as modified based on the modification types described under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is determined as described in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section except that each relevant partner's distributive share is determined based on the amount of net gain or loss to the partner that would have resulted if the partnership had sold all of its assets at their fair market value as of the close of the reviewed year appropriately adjusted to reflect any approved modification under paragraphs (d)(2), (3), and (5) through (10) of this section with respect to any relevant partner. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the partnership may request that the IRS apply the rule in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section when determining each relevant partner's distributive share for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iv). Upon request by
the IRS, the partnership may be required to provide the relevant partners' capital account calculation through the end of the reviewed year, a calculation of asset liquidation gain or loss, and any other information necessary to determine whether rate modification is appropriate, consistent with the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Any calculation by the partnership that is necessary to comply with the rules in this paragraph (b)(3)(iv) is not considered a revaluation for purposes of section 704.
(4)
Modification of the number and composition of imputed underpayments.
Once approved by the IRS, a modification under paragraph (d)(6) of this section affects the manner in which adjustments are placed into groupings and subgroupings (as described in § 301.6225-1(c) and (d)) or whether the IRS designates one or more specific imputed underpayments (as described in § 301.6225-1(g)). If the IRS approves a request for modification under this paragraph (b)(4), the imputed underpayment and any specific imputed underpayment affected by or resulting from the modification is determined according to the rules of § 301.6225-1 subject to any other modifications approved by the IRS under this section.
(5)
Other modifications.
The effect of other modifications described in paragraph (d)(10) of this section, including the order that such modification will be taken into account for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may be set forth in forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS.
(c)
Time, form, and manner for requesting modification
—(1)
In general.
In addition to the requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section, a request for modification under this section must be submitted in accordance with, and include the information required by, the forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS. The partnership representative must submit any request for modification and all relevant information (including information required under paragraphs (c)(2) and (d) of this section) to the IRS within the time described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The IRS will notify the partnership representative in writing of the approval or denial, in whole or in part, of any request for modification. A request for modification, including a request by the IRS for information related to a request for modification, and the determination by the IRS to approve or not approve all or a portion of a request for modification, is part of the administrative proceeding with respect to the partnership under subchapter C of chapter 63 and does not constitute an examination, inspection, or other administrative proceeding with respect to any other person for purposes of section 7605(b).
(2)
Partnership must substantiate facts supporting a request for modification
—(i)
In general.
A partnership requesting modification under this section must substantiate the facts supporting such a request to the satisfaction of the IRS. The documents and other information necessary to substantiate a particular request for modification are based on the facts and circumstances of each request, as well as the type of modification requested under paragraph (d) of this section, and may include tax returns, partnership operating documents, certifications in the form and manner required with respect to the particular modification, and any other information necessary to support the requested modification. The IRS may, in forms, instructions, or other guidance, set forth procedures with respect to information and documents supporting the modification, including procedures to require particular documents or other information to substantiate a particular type of modification, the manner for submitting documents and other information to the IRS, and recordkeeping requirements. Pursuant to section 6241(10), the IRS may require the partnership to file or submit anything required to be filed or submitted under this section to be filed or submitted electronically. The IRS will deny a request for modification if a partnership fails to provide information the IRS determines is necessary to substantiate a request for modification, or if the IRS determines there is a failure by any person to make any required payment, within the time restrictions described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii)
Information to be furnished for any modification request.
In the case of any
modification request, the partnership representative must furnish to the IRS such information as is required by forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS or that is otherwise requested by the IRS related to the requested modification. Such information may include a detailed description of the partnership's structure, allocations, ownership, and ownership changes, its relevant partners for each taxable year relevant to the request for modification, as well as the partnership agreement as defined in § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(
h
) of this chapter for each taxable year relevant to the modification request. In the case of any modification request with respect to a relevant partner that is an indirect partner, the partnership representative must provide to the IRS any information that the IRS may require relevant to any pass-through partner or wholly-owned entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes through which the relevant partner holds its interest in the partnership. For instance, if the partnership requests modification with respect to an amended return filed by a relevant partner pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the partnership representative may be required to provide to the IRS information that would have been required to have been filed by pass-through partners through which the relevant partner holds its interest in the partnership as if those pass-through partners had also filed their own amended returns.
(3)
Time for submitting modification request and information
—(i)
Modification request.
Unless the IRS grants an extension of time, all information required under this section with respect to a request for modification must be submitted to the IRS in the form and manner prescribed by the IRS on or before 270 days after the date the NOPPA is mailed.
(ii)
Extension of the 270-day period.
The IRS may, in its discretion, grant a request for extension of the 270-day period described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section provided the partnership submits such request to the IRS, in the form and manner prescribed by forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS before expiration of such period, as extended by any prior extension granted under this paragraph (c)(3)(ii).
(iii)
Expiration of the 270-day period by agreement.
The 270-day period described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section (including any extensions under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section) expires as of the date the partnership and the IRS agree, in the form and manner prescribed by form, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS to waive the 270-day period after the mailing of the NOPPA and before the IRS may issue a notice of final partnership adjustment. See section 6231(b)(2)(A); § 301.6231-1(b)(2).
(4)
Approval of modification by the IRS.
Notification of approval will be provided to the partnership only after receipt of all relevant information (including any supplemental information required by the IRS) and all necessary payments with respect to the particular modification requested before expiration of the 270-day period in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section plus any extension granted by the IRS under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(d)
Types of modification
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise described in this section, a partnership may request one type of modification or more than one type of modification described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Amended returns by partners
—(i)
In general.
A partnership may request a modification of an imputed underpayment based on an amended return filed by a relevant partner provided all of the partnership adjustments properly allocable to such relevant partner are taken into account and any amount due is paid in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Only adjustments to partnership-related items or adjustments to a relevant partner's tax attributes affected by adjustments to partnership-related items may be taken into account on an amended return under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. A partnership may request a modification for purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section by submitting a modification request based on the alternative procedure to filing
amended returns as described in paragraph (d)(2)(x) of this section. The partnership may not request an additional modification of any imputed underpayment for a partnership taxable year under this section with respect to any relevant partner that files an amended return (or utilizes the alternative procedure to filing amended returns) under paragraph (d)(2) of this section or with respect to any partnership adjustment allocated to such relevant partner.
(ii)
Requirements for approval of a modification request based on amended return.
Except as otherwise provided under the alternative procedure described in paragraph (d)(2)(x) of this section, an amended return modification request under paragraph (d)(2) of this section will not be approved unless the provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) are satisfied. The partnership may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section by demonstrating in accordance with forms, instructions, and other guidance provided by the IRS that a relevant partner has previously taken into account the partnership adjustments described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, made any required adjustments to tax attributes resulting from the partnership adjustments for the years described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, and made all required payments under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.
(A)
Full payment required.
An amended return modification request under paragraph (d)(2) of this section will not be approved unless the relevant partner filing the amended return has paid all tax, penalties, additions to tax, additional amounts, and interest due as a result of taking into account all partnership adjustments in the first affected year (as defined in § 301.6226-3(b)(2)) and all modification years (as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) at the time such return is filed with the IRS. Except for a pass-through partner calculating its payment amount pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section, for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A), the term
tax
means tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (chapter 1).
(B)
Amended returns for all relevant taxable years must be filed.
Modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section will not be approved by the IRS unless a relevant partner files an amended return for the first affected year and any modification year. A
modification year
is any taxable year with respect to which any tax attribute (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(10)) of the relevant partner is affected by reason of taking into account the relevant partner's distributive share of all partnership adjustments in the first affected year. A modification year may be a taxable year before or after the first affected year, depending on the effect on the relevant partner's tax attributes of taking into account the relevant partner's distributive share of the partnership adjustments in the first affected year.
(C)
Amended returns for partnership adjustments that reallocate distributive shares.
Except as described in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C), in the case of partnership adjustments that reallocate the distributive shares of any partnership-related item from one partner to another, a modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section will be approved only if all partners affected by such adjustments file amended returns in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The IRS may determine that the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) are satisfied even if not all relevant partners affected by such adjustments file amended returns provided any relevant partners affected by the reallocation not filing amended returns take into account their distributive share of the adjustments through other modifications approved by the IRS (including the alternative procedure to filing amended returns under paragraph (d)(2)(x) of this section) or if a pass-through partner takes into account the relevant adjustments in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section. For instance, in the case of adjustments that reallocate a loss from one partner to another, the IRS may determine that the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) have been satisfied if one affected relevant partner files an amended return taking into account the adjustments and the other affected relevant partner
signs a closing agreement with the IRS taking into account the adjustments. Similarly, in the case of adjustment that reallocate income from one partner to another, the IRS may determine that the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) have been satisfied to the extent an affected relevant partner meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section (regarding tax-exempt partners) and through such modification fully takes into account all adjustments reallocated to the affected relevant partner.
(iii)
Form and manner for filing amended returns.
A relevant partner must file all amended returns required for modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section with the IRS in accordance with forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS. Except as otherwise provided under the alternative procedure described in paragraph (d)(2)(x) of this section, the IRS will not approve modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section unless prior to the expiration of the 270-day period described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the partnership representative provides to the IRS, in the form and manner prescribed by the IRS, an affidavit from each relevant partner signed under penalties of perjury by such partner stating that all of the amended returns required to be filed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section has been filed (including the date on which such amended returns were filed) and that the full amount of tax, penalties, additions to tax, additional amounts, and interest was paid (including the date on which such amounts were paid).
(iv)
Period of limitations.
Generally, the period of limitations under sections 6501 and 6511 do not apply to an amended return filed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section provided the amended return otherwise meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(v)
Amended returns in the case of adjustments allocated through certain pass-through partners.
A request for modification related to an amended return of a relevant partner that is an indirect partner holding its interest in the partnership (directly or indirectly) through a pass-through partner that could be subject to tax imposed by chapter 1 (chapter 1 tax) on the partnership adjustments that are properly allocated to such pass-through partner will not be approved unless the partnership—
(A) Establishes that the pass-through partner is not subject to chapter 1 tax on the adjustments that are properly allocated to such pass-through partner; or
(B) Requests modification with respect to the adjustments resulting in chapter 1 tax for the pass-through partner, including full payment of such chapter 1 tax for the first affected year and all modification years under paragraph (d)(2) of this section or in accordance with forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS.
(vi)
Amended returns in the case of pass-through partners
—(A)
Pass-through partners may file amended returns.
A relevant partner that is a pass-through partner, including a partnership-partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(7)) that has a valid election under section 6221(b) in effect for a partnership taxable year, may, in accordance with forms, instructions, and other guidance provided by the IRS and solely for purposes of modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, take into account its share of the partnership adjustments and determine and pay an amount calculated in the same manner as the amount computed under § 301.6226-3(e)(4)(iii) subject to paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(B) of this section, by treating any approved modifications and partnership adjustments allocable to the pass-through partner as items reflected on the statement furnished to the pass-through partner.
(B)
Adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment.
If a pass-through partner takes into account its share of the adjustments by paying an amount described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(A) of this section and there are any adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment (as defined in § 301.6225-1(f)), those adjustments are taken into account by the pass-through partner in accordance with § 301.6225-3 in the taxable year of the pass-through partner that includes the date the payment described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(A) of this section is paid. This paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(B) does
not apply if, after making the calculation described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(A) of this section, no amount exists and therefore no payment is required under paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(A).
(vii)
Limitations on amended returns
—(A)
In general.
A relevant partner may not file an amended return or claim for refund that takes into account partnership adjustments except as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(B)
Further amended returns restricted.
Except as described in paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(C) of this section, if a relevant partner files an amended return under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, or satisfies paragraph (d)(2) of this section by following the alternative procedure under paragraph (d)(2)(x) of this section (the alternative procedure), such partner may not file a subsequent amended return or claim for refund to change the treatment of partnership adjustments taken into account through amended return or the alternative procedure.
(C)
Subsequent returns in the case of changes to partnership adjustments or denial of modification.
Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(B) of this section, a relevant partner that has previously filed an amended return under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, or satisfied the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section through the alternative procedure, to take partnership adjustments into account may, in accordance with forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS, file a subsequent return or claim for refund if a determination is made by a court or by the IRS that results in a change to the partnership adjustments taken into account in modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section or a denial of modification by the IRS under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section with respect to a modification request under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Such determinations include a court decision that changes the partnership adjustments for which modification was requested or a settlement between the IRS and the partnership pursuant to which the partnership is not liable for all or a portion of the imputed underpayment for which modification was requested. Any amended return or claim for refund filed under this paragraph (d)(2)(vii) is subject to the period of limitations under section 6511.
(viii)
Penalties.
The applicability of any penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts that relate to an adjustment to a partnership-related item is determined at the partnership level in accordance with section 6221(a). However, the amount of penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts a relevant partner must pay under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section for the first affected year and for any modification year is based on the underpayment or understatement of tax, if any, reflected on the amended return filed by the relevant partner under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. For instance, if after taking into account the adjustments, the return of the relevant partner for the first affected year or any modification year reflects an underpayment or an understatement that falls below the applicable threshold for the imposition of a penalty under section 6662(d), no penalty would be due from that relevant partner for such year. Unless forms, instructions or other guidance provided by the IRS allow for an alternative procedure for raising a partner-level defense (as described in § 301.6226-3(d)(3)), a relevant partner may raise a partner-level defense by first paying the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount with the amended return filed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and then filing a claim for refund in accordance with forms, instructions, and other guidance.
(ix)
Effect on tax attributes binding.
Any adjustments to the tax attributes of any relevant partner which are affected by modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section are binding on the relevant partner with respect to the first affected year and all modification years (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section). A failure to adjust any tax attribute in accordance with this paragraph (d)(2)(ix) is a failure to treat a partnership-related item in a manner which is consistent with the treatment of such item on the partnership return within the meaning of section 6222. The provisions of section 6222(c) and § 301.6222-1(c) (regarding notification of inconsistent treatment) do
not apply with respect to tax attributes under this paragraph (d)(2)(ix).
(x)
Alternative procedure to filing amended returns
—(A)
In general.
A partnership may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section by submitting on behalf of a relevant partner, in accordance with forms, instructions, and other guidance provided by the IRS, all information and payment of any tax, penalties, additions to tax, additional amounts, and interest that would be required to be provided if the relevant partner were filing an amended return under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided in relevant forms, instructions, and other guidance provided by the IRS. A relevant partner for which the partnership seeks modification under paragraph (d)(2)(x) of this section must agree to take into account, in accordance with forms, instructions, and other guidance provided by the IRS, adjustments to any tax attributes of such relevant partner. A modification request submitted in accordance with the alternative procedure under paragraph (d)(2)(x) of this section is not a claim for refund with respect to any person.
(B)
Modifications with respect to reallocation adjustments.
A submission made in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(x) of this section with respect to any relevant partner is treated as if such relevant partner filed an amended return for purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section (regarding the requirement that all relevant partners affected by a reallocation must file an amended return to be eligible to for the modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) provided the submission is with respect to the first affected year and all modification years of such relevant partner as required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(3)
Tax-exempt partners
—(i)
In general.
A partnership may request modification of an imputed underpayment with respect to partnership adjustments that the partnership demonstrates to the satisfaction of the IRS are allocable to a relevant partner that would not owe tax by reason of its status as a tax-exempt entity (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) in the reviewed year (tax-exempt partner).
(ii)
Definition of tax-exempt entity.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the term
tax-exempt entity
means a person or entity defined in section 168(h)(2)(A), (C), or (D).
(iii)
Modification limited to portion of partnership adjustments for which tax-exempt partner not subject to tax.
Only the portion of the partnership adjustments properly allocated to a tax-exempt partner with respect to which the partner would not be subject to tax for the reviewed year (tax-exempt portion) may form the basis of a modification of the imputed underpayment under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. A modification under paragraph (d)(3) of this section will not be approved by the IRS unless the partnership provides documentation in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section to support the tax-exempt partner's status and the tax-exempt portion of the partnership adjustment allocable to the tax-exempt partner.
(4)
Modification based on a rate of tax lower than the highest applicable tax rate.
A partnership may request modification based on a lower rate of tax for the reviewed year with respect to adjustments that are attributable to a relevant partner that is a C corporation and adjustments with respect to capital gains or qualified dividends that are attributable to a relevant partner who is an individual. In no event may the lower rate determined under the preceding sentence be less than the highest rate in effect for the reviewed year with respect to the type of income and taxpayer. For instance, with respect to adjustments that are attributable to a C corporation, the highest rate in effect for the reviewed year with respect to all C corporations would apply to that adjustment, regardless of the rate that would apply to the C corporation based on the amount of that C corporation's taxable income. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), an S corporation is treated as an individual.
(5)
Certain passive losses of publicly traded partnerships
—(i)
In general.
In
the case of a publicly traded partnership (as defined in section 469(k)(2)) requesting modification under this section, an imputed underpayment is determined without regard to any adjustment that the partnership demonstrates would be reduced by a specified passive activity loss (as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section) which is allocable to a specified partner (as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section) or qualified relevant partner (as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section).
(ii)
Specified passive activity loss.
A specified passive activity loss carryover amount for any specified partner or qualified relevant partner of a publicly traded partnership is the lesser of the section 469(k) passive activity loss of that partner which is separately determined with respect to such partnership—
(A) At the end of the first affected year (affected year loss); or
(B) At the end of—
(
1
) The specified partner's taxable year in which or with which the adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)) of the partnership ends, reduced to the extent any such partner has utilized any portion of its affected year loss to offset income or gain relating to the ownership or disposition of its interest in such publicly traded partnership during either the adjustment year or any other year; or
(
2
) If the adjustment year has not yet been determined, the most recent year for which the publicly traded partnership has filed a return under section 6031, reduced to the extent any such partner has utilized any portion of its affected year loss to offset income or gain relating to the ownership or disposition of its interest in such publicly traded partnership during any year.
(iii)
Specified partner.
A specified partner is a person that for each taxable year beginning with the first affected year through the person's taxable year in which or with which the partnership adjustment year ends satisfies the following three requirements-
(A) The person is a partner of the publicly traded partnership requesting modification under this section;
(B) The person is an individual, estate, trust, closely held C corporation, or personal service corporation; and
(C) The person has a specified passive activity loss with respect to the publicly traded partnership.
(iv)
Qualified relevant partner.
A
qualified relevant partner
is a relevant partner that meets the three requirements to be a specified partner (as described in paragraphs (d)(5)(iii)(A), (B), and (C) of this section) for each year beginning with the first affected year through the year described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an indirect partner of the publicly traded partnership requesting modification under this section may also be a qualified relevant partner under this paragraph (d)(5)(iv) if that indirect partner meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section for each year beginning with the first affected year through the year described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section.
(v)
Partner notification requirement to reduce passive losses.
If the IRS approves a modification request under paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the partnership must report, in accordance with forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS, to each specified partner the amount of that specified partner's reduction of its suspended passive activity loss carryovers at the end of the adjustment year to take into account the amount of any passive activity losses applied in connection with such modification request. In the case of a qualified relevant partner, the partnership must report, in accordance with forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS, to each qualified relevant partner the amount of that qualified relevant partner's reduction of its suspended passive activity loss carryovers at the end of the taxable year for which the partnership's next return is due to be filed under section 6031 to be taken into account by the qualified relevant partner on the partner's return for the year that includes the end of the partnership's taxable year for which the partnership's next return is due to be filed under section 6031. In the case of an indirect partner
that is a qualified relevant partner, the IRS may prescribe additional guidance through forms, instructions, or other guidance to require reporting under this paragraph (d)(5)(v). The reduction in suspended passive activity loss carryovers as reported to a specified partner or qualified relevant partner under this paragraph (d)(5)(v) is a determination of the partnership under subchapter C of chapter 63 and is binding on the specified partners and qualified relevant partners under section 6223.
(6)
Modification of the number and composition of imputed underpayments
—(i)
In general.
A partnership may request modification of the number or composition of any imputed underpayment included in the NOPPA by requesting that the IRS include one or more partnership adjustments in a particular grouping or subgrouping (as described in § 301.6225-1(c) and (d)) or specific imputed underpayments (as described in § 301.6225-1(g)) different from the grouping, subgrouping, or imputed underpayment set forth in the NOPPA. For example, a partnership may request under paragraph (d)(6) of this section that one or more partnership adjustments taken into account to determine a general imputed underpayment set forth in the NOPPA be taken into account to determine a specific imputed underpayment.
(ii)
Request for particular treatment regarding limitations or restrictions.
A modification request under paragraph (d)(6) of this section includes a request that one or more partnership adjustments be treated as if no limitations or restrictions under § 301.6225-1(d) apply and as a result such adjustments may be subgrouped with other adjustments.
(7)
Partnerships with partners that are “qualified investment entities” described in section 860
—(i)
In general.
A partnership may request a modification of an imputed underpayment based on the partnership adjustments allocated to a relevant partner where the modification is based on deficiency dividends distributed as described in section 860(f) by a relevant partner that is a qualified investment entity (QIE) under section 860(b) (which includes both a regulated investment company (RIC) and a real estate investment trust (REIT)). Modification under paragraph (d)(7) of this section is available only to the extent that the deficiency dividends take into account adjustments described in § 301.6225-1 that are also adjustments within the meaning of section 860(d)(1) or (d)(2) (whichever applies).
(ii)
Documentation of deficiency dividend.
The partnership must provide documentation in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section of the “determination” described in section 860(e). Under section 860(e)(2), § 1.860-2(b)(1)(i) of this chapter, and paragraph (d)(8) of this section, a closing agreement entered into by the QIE partner pursuant to section 7121 and paragraph (d)(8) of this section is a determination described in section 860(e), and the date of the determination is the date in which the closing agreement is approved by the IRS. In addition, under section 860(e)(4), a determination also includes a Form 8927,
Determination Under Section 860(e)(4) by a Qualified Investment Entity,
properly completed and filed by the RIC or REIT pursuant to section 860(e)(4). To establish the date of the determination under section 860(e)(4) and the amount of deficiency dividends actually paid, the partnership must provide a copy of Form 976,
Claim for Deficiency Dividends Deductions by a Personal Holding Company, Regulated Investment Company, or Real Estate Investment Trust,
properly completed by or on behalf of the QIE pursuant to section 860(g), together with a copy of each of the required attachments for Form 976.
(8)
Closing agreements.
A partnership may request modification based on a closing agreement entered into by the IRS and the partnership or any relevant partner, or both if appropriate, pursuant to section 7121. If modification under this paragraph (d)(8) is approved by the IRS, any partnership adjustment that is taken into account under such closing agreement and for which any required payment under the closing agreement is made will not be taken into account in determining the imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-1. Any required payment under the closing agreement may include amounts of tax, including tax under chapters other than chapter 1, interest,
penalties, additions to tax and additional amounts. Generally, the IRS will not approve any additional modification under this section with respect to a relevant partner to which a modification under this paragraph (d)(8) has been approved.
(9)
Tax treaty modifications.
A partnership may request a modification under this paragraph (d)(9) with respect to a relevant partner's distributive share of an adjustment to a partnership-related item if, in the reviewed year, the relevant partner was a foreign person who qualified under an income tax treaty with the United States for a reduction or exemption from tax with respect to such partnership-related item. A partnership requesting modification under this section may also request a treaty modification under this paragraph (d)(9) regardless of the treaty status of its partners if, in the reviewed year, the partnership itself was an entity eligible for such treaty benefits.
(10)
Other modifications.
A partnership may request a modification not otherwise described in paragraph (d) of this section, and the IRS will determine whether such modification is accurate and appropriate in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Additional types of modifications and the documentation necessary to substantiate such modifications may be set forth in forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS.
(e)
Modification of adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment.
A partnership may request modification of adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment (as described in § 301.6225-1(f)(1)(ii)) using modifications described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section (amended returns and the alternative procedure to filing amended returns), paragraph (d)(6) of this section (number and composition of the imputed underpayment), paragraph (d)(8) of this section (closing agreements), or, if applicable, paragraph (d)(10) of this section (other modifications).
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of these examples, each partnership is subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63, each partnership and its relevant partners are calendar year taxpayers, all relevant partners are U.S. persons (unless otherwise stated), the highest rate of income tax in effect for all taxpayers is 40 percent for all relevant periods, and no partnership requests modification under this section except as provided in the example.
(1)
Example 1.
Partnership has two partners during its 2019 partnership taxable year: P and S. P is a partnership, and S is an S corporation. P has four partners during its 2019 partnership taxable year: A, C, T and DE. A is an individual, C is a C corporation, T is a trust, and DE is a wholly-owned entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes. The owner of DE is B, an individual. T has two beneficiaries during its 2019 taxable year: F and G, both individuals. S has 3 shareholders during its 2019 taxable year: H, J, and K, all individuals. For purposes of this section, if Partnership requests modification with respect to A, B, C, F, G, H, J, and K, those persons are all relevant partners (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section). P, S, and DE are not relevant partners (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) because DE is a wholly-owned entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes and modification was not requested with respect to P and S.
(2)
Example 2.
The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year. The IRS mails a NOPPA to Partnership for the 2019 partnership taxable year proposing a single partnership adjustment increasing ordinary income by $100, resulting in a $40 imputed underpayment ($100 multiplied by the 40 percent tax rate). Partner A, an individual, held a 20 percent interest in Partnership during 2019. Partnership timely requests modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section based on A's filing an amended return for the 2019 taxable year taking into account $20 of the partnership adjustment and paying the tax and interest due attributable to A's share of the increased income and the tax rate applicable to A for the 2019 tax year. No tax attribute in any other taxable year of A is affected by A's taking into account A's share of the partnership adjustment for 2019. In accordance
with paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, Partnership's partnership representative provides the IRS with documentation demonstrating that A filed the 2019 return and paid all tax and interest due. The IRS approves the modification and, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $20 increase in ordinary income allocable to A is not included in the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment (determined in accordance with § 301.6225-1). Partnership's total netted partnership adjustment is reduced to $80 ($100 adjustment less $20 taken into account by A), and the imputed underpayment is reduced to $32 (total netted partnership adjustment of $80 after modification multiplied by 40 percent).
(3)
Example 3.
The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year. Partnership has two equal partners during its entire 2019 taxable year: an individual, A, and a partnership-partner, B. During all of 2019, B has two equal partners: a tax-exempt entity, C, and an individual, D. The IRS mails a NOPPA to Partnership for its 2019 taxable year proposing a single partnership adjustment increasing Partnership's ordinary income by $100, resulting in a $40 imputed underpayment ($100 total netted partnership adjustment multiplied by 40 percent). Partnership timely requests modification under paragraph (d)(3) of this section with respect to B's partner, C, a tax-exempt entity. In accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, Partnership's partnership representative provides the IRS with documentation substantiating to the IRS's satisfaction that C held a 25 percent indirect interest in Partnership through its interest in B during the 2019 taxable year, that C was a tax-exempt entity defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section during the 2019 taxable year, and that C was not subject to tax with respect to its entire allocable share of the partnership adjustment allocated to B (which is $25 (50 percent × 50 percent × $100)). The IRS approves the modification and, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $25 increase in ordinary income allocated to C, through B, is not included in the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment (determined in accordance with § 301.6225-1). Partnership's total netted partnership adjustment is reduced to $75 ($100 adjustment less C's share of the adjustment, $25), and the imputed underpayment is reduced to $30 (total netted partnership adjustment of $75, after modification, multiplied by 40 percent).
(4)
Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, except $10 of the $25 of the adjustment allocated to C is unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) as defined in section 512 because it is debt-financed income within the meaning of section 514 (no section 512 UBTI modifications apply) with respect to which C would be subject to tax if taken into account by C. As a result, the modification under paragraph (d)(3) of this section with respect to C relates only to $15 of the $25 of ordinary income allocated to C that is not UBTI. Therefore, only a modification of $15 ($25 less $10) of the total $100 partnership adjustment may be approved by the IRS under paragraph (d)(3) of this section and, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, excluded when determining the imputed underpayment for Partnership's 2019 taxable year. The total netted partnership adjustment (determined in accordance with § 301.6225-1) is reduced to $85 ($100 less $15), and the imputed underpayment is reduced to $34 (total netted partnership adjustment of $85, after modification, multiplied by 40 percent).
(5)
Example 5.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, except that Partnership also timely requests modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to an amended return filed by B, and, in accordance with (d)(2)(iii) of this section, Partnership's partnership representative provides the IRS with documentation demonstrating that B filed the 2019 return and paid all tax and interest due. B reports 50 percent of the partnership adjustments ($50) on its amended return, and B calculates an amount under paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(A) of this section and § 301.6226-3(e)(4)(iii) that, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(B) of this section, takes into account the modification under paragraph (d)(3) of this section
approved by the IRS with respect to B's partner C, a tax-exempt entity. B makes a payment pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, and the IRS approves the requested modification. Partnership's total netted partnership adjustment is reduced by $50 (the amount taken into account by B). Partnership's total netted partnership adjustment (determined in accordance with § 301.6225-1) is $50, and the imputed underpayment, after modification, is $20.
(6)
Example 6.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, except that in addition to the modification with respect to tax-exempt entity C, which reduced the imputed underpayment by excluding from the determination of the imputed underpayment $25 of the $100 partnership adjustment reflected in the NOPPA, Partnership timely requests modification under paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to an amended return filed by individual D, and, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, Partnership's partnership representative provides the IRS with documentation demonstrating that D filed the 2019 return and paid all tax and interest due. D's amended return for D's 2019 taxable year takes into account D's share of the partnership adjustment (50 percent of B's 50 percent interest in Partnership, or $25) and D paid the tax and interest due as a result of taking into account D's share of the partnership adjustment in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. No tax attribute in any other taxable year of D is affected by D taking into account D's share of the partnership adjustment for 2019. The IRS approves the modification and the $25 increase in ordinary income allocable to D is not included in the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment (determined in accordance with § 301.6225-1). As a result, Partnership's total netted partnership adjustment is $50 ($100, less $25 allocable to C, less $25 taken into account by D), and the imputed underpayment, after modification, is $20.
(7)
Example 7.
The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year. All of Partnership's partners during its 2019 taxable year are individuals. The IRS mails a NOPPA to Partnership for the 2019 taxable year proposing three partnership adjustments. The first partnership adjustment is an increase to ordinary income of $75 for 2019. The second partnership adjustment is an increase in the depreciation deduction allowed for 2019 of $25, which under § 301.6225-1(d)(2)(i) is treated as a $25 decrease in income. The third adjustment is an increase in long-term capital gain of $10 for 2019. Under the partnership agreement in effect for Partnership's 2019 taxable year, the long-term capital gain and the increase in depreciation would be specially allocated to B and the increase in ordinary income would be specially allocated to A. In accordance with § 301.6225-1(c) and (d), the three adjustments are placed into three separate subgroupings within the residual grouping because the partnership adjustments would not have been netted at the partnership level and would not have been required to be allocated to the partners of the partnership as a single, net partnership-related item for purposes of section 702(a), other provisions of the Code, regulations, forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS. Accordingly, the total netted partnership adjustment is $85 ($75 net positive adjustment to ordinary income plus $10 net positive adjustment to long term capital gain), and the imputed under payment is $34 ($85 multiplied by 40 percent). The net negative adjustment to depreciation is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment subject to treatment under § 301.6225-3. Partnership requests a modification under paragraph (d)(6) of this section to determine a specific imputed underpayment with respect to the $75 adjustment to ordinary income allocated to A. The specific imputed underpayment is with respect to $75 of the increase in income specially allocated to A and the general imputed underpayment is with respect to $10 of the increase in capital gain and the $25 increase in depreciation deduction specially allocated to B. If the modification is approved by the IRS, the specific imputed underpayment would consist of the $75 increase in ordinary income, and thus
the total netted partnership adjustment for the specific imputed underpayment would be $75. The specific imputed underpayment is thus $30 ($75 multiplied by 40 percent). The general imputed underpayment would consist of two adjustments: The long term capital gain adjustment and the depreciation adjustment. The long term capital gain adjustment and the depreciation adjustment would be placed in different subgroupings under § 301.6225-1(d) because they are treated separately under section 702. Accordingly, the long term capital gain adjustment and the depreciation adjustment are not netted, and the long term capital gain adjustment would be a net positive adjustment while the depreciation adjustment would be a net negative adjustment. The long term capital gain net positive adjustment would be the only net positive adjustment, resulting in a total netted partnership adjustment of $10. The general imputed underpayment is $4 ($10 multiplied by 40 percent), and the net negative adjustment to depreciation of $25 would be an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-1(f) associated with the general imputed underpayment.

Example 8.
Partnership has two reviewed year partners, C1 and C2, both of which are C corporations. The IRS mails to Partnership a NOPPA with two adjustments, both based on rental real estate activity. The first adjustment is an increase of rental real estate income of $100 attributable to Property A. The second adjustment is an increase of rental real estate loss of $30 attributable to Property B. The Partnership did not treat the leasing arrangement with respect to Property A and Property B as an appropriate economic unit for purposes of section 469. If the $100 increase in income attributable to Property A and the $30 increase in loss attributable to Property B were included in the same subgrouping and netted, then taking the $30 increase in loss into account would result in a decrease in the amount of the imputed underpayment. Also, the $30 increased loss might be limited or restricted if taken into account by any person under the passive activity rules under section 469. For instance, under section 469, rental activities of the two properties could be treated as two activities, which could limit a partner's ability to claim the loss. In addition to the potential limitations under section 469, there are other potential limitations that might apply if the $30 loss were taken into account by any person. Therefore, in accordance with § 301.6225-1(d), the two adjustments are placed in separate subgroupings within the residual grouping, the total netted partnership adjustment is $100, the imputed underpayment is $40 ($100 × 40 percent), and the $30 increase in loss is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-1(f). Partnership requests modification under paragraph (d)(6) of this section, substantiating to the satisfaction of the IRS that C1 and C2 are publicly traded C corporations, and therefore, the passive activity loss limitations under section 469 of the Code do not apply. Partnership also substantiates to the satisfaction of the IRS that no other limitation or restriction applies that would prevent the grouping of the $100 with the $30 loss. The IRS approves Partnership's modification request and places the $100 of income and the $30 loss into the subgrouping in the residual grouping under the rules described in § 301.6225-1(c)(5). Under § 301.6225-1(e), because the two adjustments are in one subgrouping, they are netted together, resulting in a total netted partnership adjustment of $70 ($100 plus −$30) and an imputed underpayment of $28 ($70 × 40 percent). After modification, none of the adjustments is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-1(f) because the $30 loss is now netted with the $100 of income in a net positive adjustment for the residual grouping.

§ 301.6225-3
Treatment of partnership adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment.
(a)
In general.
Partnership adjustments (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)) that do not result in an imputed underpayment (as described in § 301.6225-1(f)) are taken into account by a partnership in the adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)) in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Treatment of adjustments by the partnership
—(1)
In general.
Except as described in paragraphs (b)(2) through (7) of this section, a partnership adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment is taken into account as part of non-separately stated income or loss for the adjustment year depending on whether the adjustment is to a partnership-related item that is an item of income or loss.
(2)
Separately stated items.
In the case of a partnership adjustment to partnership-related item that is required to be separately stated under section 702, the adjustment is taken into account by the partnership in the adjustment year as a reduction in such separately stated item or as an increase in such separately stated item depending on whether the adjustment is a reduction or an increase to the separately stated item.
(3)
Credits.
In the case of an adjustment to a partnership-related item that is reported or could be reported by a partnership as a credit on the partnership's return for the reviewed year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(8)), the adjustment is taken into account by the partnership in the adjustment year as a separately stated item.
(4)
Reallocation adjustments.
A partnership adjustment that reallocates a partnership-related item to or from a particular partner or partners that also does not result in an imputed underpayment pursuant to § 301.6225-1(f) is taken into account by the partnership in the adjustment year as a separately stated item or a non-separately stated item, as required by section 702. Except as provided in forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the portion of an adjustment allocated under this paragraph (b)(4) is allocated to adjustment year partners (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(2)) who are also reviewed year partners (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)) with respect to whom the amount was reallocated.
(5)
Adjustments taken into account by partners as part of the modification process.
If, as part of modification under § 301.6225-2, a relevant partner (as defined in § 301.6225-2(a)) takes into account a partnership adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment, and the IRS approves the modification, such partnership adjustment is not taken into account by the partnership in the adjustment year in accordance with § 301.6225-1(a).
(6)
Effect of election under section 6226.
If a partnership makes a valid election under § 301.6226-1 with respect to an imputed underpayment, a partnership adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment and that is associated with such imputed underpayment as described in § 301.6225-1(g) is taken into account by the reviewed year partners in accordance with § 301.6226-3 and is not taken into account under this section.
(7)
Adjustments taken into account previously by partners.
If, prior to the mailing of a notice of administrative proceeding by the IRS or the filing of an administrative adjustment request by the partnership, a partner has previously taken into account an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment that would have been taken into account under this section, such partnership adjustment is not taken into account by such partner.
(8)
Adjustments to items that are not items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit.
The partnership takes into account an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment that resulted from an adjustment to an item that is not an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit by adjusting the item on its adjustment year return but only to the extent the item would appear on the adjustment year return without regard to the adjustment. If
the item is already reflected on the partnership's adjustment year return as an item that is not an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit, or in any year between the reviewed year and the adjustment year, a partnership should not create a new item in the amount of the adjustment on the partnership's adjustment year return.
(c)
Treatment of adjustment year partners.
The rules under subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the treatment of partners apply in the case of adjustments taken into account by the partnership under this section.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of these examples, unless otherwise provided, each partnership is subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code, each partnership and its relevant partners are calendar year taxpayers, all relevant partners are U.S. persons (unless otherwise stated), the highest rate of income tax in effect for all taxpayers is 40 percent for all relevant periods, and no partnership requests modification.
(1)
Example 1.
For all of Partnership's 2019, 2020, and 2021 partnership taxable years, Partnership has two equal partners, A and B. The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 partnership taxable year. The IRS mails a notice of proposed partnership adjustment (NOPPA) to Partnership for the 2019 partnership taxable year proposing a recharacterization adjustment, changing a $100 ordinary loss to a $100 long term capital loss. Under § 301.6225-1, this recharacterization adjustment results in two adjustments: A $100 increase to ordinary income (positive adjustment) and a −$100 decrease in long term capital gain (negative adjustment). Under § 301.6225-1(b), the $100 positive adjustment is the total netted partnership adjustment, which is multiplied by the highest rate of 40 percent, resulting in a $40 imputed underpayment. Under § 301.6225-1(f), the −$100 negative adjustment is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment and is taken into account in accordance with this section. On March 1, 2021, the IRS mails a notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA), and because Partnership does not file a petition for readjustment with respect to the FPA, the adjustments are finally determined in 2021, and the adjustment year is determined to be 2021 pursuant to § 301.6241-1(a)(1). Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, Partnership takes into account the −$100 adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment on its 2021 partnership return. In addition to the −$100 adjustment to partnership's 2019 taxable year taken into account under this section, Partnership has an additional $300 in long term capital gain reportable in its 2021 taxable year. The −$100 negative adjustment and the $300 long term capital gain are Partnership's only long term capital gains and losses for its 2021 taxable year. Because the −$100 net negative adjustment is an adjustment to long term capital gain, which is a separately stated item under section 702(a)(2), the −$100 negative adjustment must be taken into account in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Partnership includes both the −$100 negative adjustment and the $300 in long term capital gain as separately stated items on its 2021 tax return.
(2)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except that the IRS proposes a reallocation adjustment instead of a recharacterization adjustment. The IRS determines that the −$100 ordinary loss that the Partnership allocated equally to A and B should instead all be allocated all to A. The IRS mails a NOPPA for the 2019 partnership taxable year proposing a reallocation adjustment resulting in a $50 increase in ordinary loss allocated to A (negative adjustment) and a $50 decrease in ordinary loss allocated to B (positive adjustment). Because the adjustments are the result of a reallocation, they are placed in separate subgroupings pursuant to § 301.6225-1(d). Because the adjustments are in different subgroupings, the adjustments are not netted under § 301.6225-1(e), resulting in a net negative adjustment of −$50 allocated to A and a net positive adjustment of $50 to B. Pursuant to § 301.6225-1(b), the total netted partnership adjustment includes the $50 net
positive adjustment, and the imputed underpayment is $20 ($50 total netted partnership adjustment × 40 percent). Pursuant to § 301.6225-1(f), the −$50 net negative adjustment is an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment and is taken into account in accordance with this section. On March 1, 2021, the IRS mails an FPA, and because Partnership does not file a petition for readjustment with respect to the FPA, the adjustments are finally determined in 2021, and the adjustment year is determined to be 2021 pursuant to § 301.6241-1(a)(1). Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, Partnership takes into account the −$50 adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment on its 2021 partnership return. In addition to the −$50 net negative adjustment to partnership's 2019 taxable year taken into account under this section, Partnership also has an additional $300 in ordinary income reportable in its 2021 taxable year unrelated to the administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 partnership taxable year. Because the −$50 net negative adjustment is due to a reallocation, the adjustment must be taken into account under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Because the net negative adjustment was determined to have been entirely allocable to A, and because A was a reviewed year partner and is also an adjustment year partner, the net negative adjustment is taken into account by Partnership by allocating the entire adjustment to A on its 2021 tax return. The −$50 negative adjustment does not reduce the $300 in ordinary income.
(3)
Example 3.
On its partnership return for the 2020 taxable year, Partnership placed Asset into service, reporting that Asset, a non-depreciable asset, had a basis of $100. During an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year, the IRS determines that Asset has a basis of $90 instead of $100. The IRS also determines that Partnership has a negative adjustment to credits of $4. There are no other adjustments for Partnership's 2020 taxable year. Under § 301.6225-1(d)(2)(iii), the adjustment to the basis of an asset is not an adjustment that is a decrease in an item of income, a partnership adjustment treated under paragraph § 301.6225-1(d)(2)(i) as a decrease in an item of income, or an increase in an item of credit. Therefore, the $10 adjustment to the basis of Asset is treated as a $10 positive adjustment. The IRS determines that the net negative adjustment to credits should be taken into account as part of the calculation of the imputed underpayment. The total netted partnership adjustment is $10, which, after applying the highest rate and decreasing the product by the $4 adjustment to credits results in an imputed underpayment of $0. Accordingly, both adjustments are adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-1(f). The adjustment year is 2022 and Partnership still owns Asset. Under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, Partnership takes into account the $10 adjustment to Asset on its 2022 return by reducing its basis in Asset by $10. The reduction in the basis of Asset does not require Partnership to recognize income or gain in situations where income or gain is not otherwise recognized.
(4)
Example 4.
On its partnership return for the 2020 taxable year, Partnership reports a recourse liability of $1,000. During an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year, the IRS determines that the liability is a nonrecourse liability instead of a recourse liability. The IRS also determines that Partnership has a negative adjustment to credits of $400. There are no other adjustments for Partnership's 2020 taxable year. Under § 301.6225-1(d), the adjustment to the liability is not an adjustment to an item of income. Therefore, the $1,000 change to the liability is treated as two $1,000 positive adjustments (a $1,000 decrease to nonrecourse liabilities and a $1,000 increase to recourse liabilities). The IRS determines that the adjustment to nonrecourse liabilities should be treated as zero for purposes of calculating the imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-1(b)(4). The IRS also determines that the net negative adjustment to credits should be taken into account as part of the calculation of the imputed underpayment. The total netted partnership adjustment is $1,000, which, after applying the highest rate and decreasing
the product by the $400 adjustment to credits results in an imputed underpayment of $0. Accordingly, both adjustments are adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-1(f). Partnership pays off the entire liability in 2021. The adjustment year is 2022. Under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the liability no longer appears on the return due to the satisfaction of the liability in the 2021 taxable year. Accordingly, no adjustment is made to Partnership's 2022 return as a result of the adjustment to the liability. If, instead of satisfying the entire $1,000 liability in 2021, Partnership made a payment of $500 towards the liability, on its 2022 return, Partnership would change the character of the $500 liability on its 2022 return to be a nonrecourse liability.
(5)
Example 5.
The facts are the same facts as the facts in paragraph (d)(3) (
Example 3
) except that Partnership has two equal partners—A and B—both of whom are individuals. After Partnership receives a notice of proposed partnership adjustment containing the $4 negative adjustment to credits and the $10 adjustment to Asset, Partnership requests modification under § 301.6225-2(d)(2) and (e) based on A filing an amended return. On her amended return, A takes into account her share of the adjustments which is a $2 negative adjustment to credits and a $5 adjustment to Asset. Based on A's facts and circumstances, A does not have any tax impact as a result of the adjustment to Asset so her amended return only reflects a tax impact from the additional $2 in credits. Because A filed an amended return, the imputed underpayment is recalculated without the portion of the adjustments allocable to A. In this case, the total netted partnership adjustment is $5, which, after applying the highest rate and decreasing the product by the $2 adjustment to credits results in an imputed underpayment of $0. Accordingly, both adjustments (the $10 adjustment to Asset and the $4 adjustment to credits) are adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment under paragraph (f) of this section. The adjustment year is 2022 and Partnership still owns Asset. Under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, Partnership takes into account the $10 adjustment to Asset on its 2022 return by reducing its basis in Asset by $10. The reduction in the basis of Asset does not require Partnership to recognize income or gain in situations where income or gain is not otherwise recognized.

§ 301.6226-1
Election for an alternative to the payment of the imputed underpayment.
(a)
In general.
A partnership may elect under this section an alternative to the payment by the partnership of an imputed underpayment determined under section 6225. In addition, a partnership making a valid election under paragraph (c) of this section is no longer liable for the imputed underpayment (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(3)) to which the election applies. If a notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA) mailed under section 6231 includes more than one imputed underpayment (as described in § 301.6225-1(g)), a partnership may make an election under this section with respect to one or more imputed underpayments included in the FPA.
(b)
Effect of election
—(1)
Reviewed year partners.
If a partnership makes a valid election under this section with respect to any imputed underpayment, the reviewed year partners (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)) must take into account their share of the partnership adjustments (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)) that are associated with that imputed underpayment and are liable for any tax, penalties, additions to tax,
additional amounts, and interest as described in § 301.6226-3. See § 301.6226-2(f) regarding the determination of each reviewed year partner's share of the partnership adjustments, including the effect of any modification approved by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under § 301.6225-2.
(2)
Partnership.
A partnership making a valid election under this section is not liable for the imputed underpayment to which the election applies (and no assessment of tax, levy, or proceeding in any court for the collection of such imputed underpayment may be made against such partnership). Any adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment described in § 301.6225-1(f) that are associated with an imputed underpayment (as described in § 301.6225-1(g)) for which an election under this section is made are not taken into account by the partnership in the adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)) and instead each reviewed year partners' share of the adjustments determined in accordance with § 301.6226-2(f) must be included on the statement described in § 301.6226-2.
(c)
Time, form, and manner for making the election
—(1)
In general.
An election under this section is valid only if all of the provisions of this section and § 301.6226-2 (regarding statements filed with the IRS and furnished to reviewed year partners) are satisfied. An election under this section is valid until the IRS determines that the election is invalid. An election under this section may only be revoked with the consent of the IRS.
(2)
Time for making the election.
An election under this section must be filed within 45 days of the date the FPA is mailed by the IRS. The time for filing such an election may not be extended.
(3)
Form and manner of the election
—(i)
In general.
An election under this section must be signed by the partnership representative and filed in accordance with forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS and include the information specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Contents of the election.
An election under this section must include the following correct information—
(A) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the partnership;
(B) The taxable year to which the election relates;
(C) A copy of the FPA to which the election relates;
(D) In the case of an FPA that includes more than one imputed underpayment, identification of the imputed underpayment to which the election applies;
(E) The name and TIN (or alternative form of identification as prescribed by forms, instructions, or other guidance) of each reviewed year partner of the partnership;
(F) The current or last address of each reviewed year partner that is known to the partnership; and
(G) Any other information prescribed by the IRS in forms, instructions, and other guidance.
(d)
Determining an election is invalid.
The IRS may determine an election to be invalid without first notifying the partnership or providing the partnership an opportunity to correct any failure to satisfy all of the provisions of this section and § 301.6226-2. If an election under this section is determined by the IRS to be invalid, the IRS will notify the partnership and the partnership representative within 30 days of the determination that the election is invalid and the reason for the determination that the election is invalid. If the IRS makes a determination that an election under this section is invalid, section 6225 applies with respect to the imputed underpayment as if the election was never made, the IRS may assess the imputed underpayment against the partnership (without regard to the limitations under section 6232(b)), and the partnership must pay the imputed underpayment under section 6225 and any penalties and interest under section 6233. The IRS may not determine that an election is invalid based on errors timely corrected by the partnership in accordance with § 301.6226-2(d).
(e)
Binding nature of statements.
The election under this section, which includes filing and furnishing statements described in § 301.6226-2, are actions of the partnership under section 6223 and, unless determined otherwise by the
IRS, the partner's share of the adjustments and the applicability of any penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts as set forth in the statement are binding on the partner pursuant to section 6223. Accordingly, a partner may not treat any partnership-related items (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)(ii)) reflected on a statement described in § 301.6226-2 on the partner's return inconsistently with how those items are treated on the statement that is filed with the IRS. See § 301.6222-1(c)(2) (regarding partnership-related items the treatment of which a partner is bound to under section 6223).
(f)
Coordination with section 6234 regarding judicial review.
Nothing in this section affects the rules regarding judicial review of a partnership adjustment. Accordingly, a partnership that makes an election under this section is not precluded from filing a petition under section 6234(a). See § 301.6226-2(b)(3)(iii).

§ 301.6226-2
Statements furnished to partners and filed with the IRS.
(a)
In general.
A partnership that makes an election under § 301.6226-1 must furnish to each reviewed year partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)) and file with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) a statement that includes the items required by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section with respect to each reviewed year partner's share of partnership adjustments (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)) associated with the imputed underpayment for which an election under § 301.6226-1 is made. The statements furnished to the reviewed year partners under this section are in addition to, and must be filed and furnished separate from, any other statements required to be filed with the IRS and furnished to partners, including any statements under section 6031(b). A separate statement under this section must be furnished to each reviewed year partner with respect to each reviewed year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(8)) subject to an election under § 301.6226-1. A failure to furnish a correct statement in accordance with this section is subject to penalty under section 6722. See section 6724(d)(2).
(b)
Time and manner for furnishing the statements to partners
—(1)
In general.
The statements described in paragraph (a) of this section must be furnished to the reviewed year partners no later than 60 days after the date all of the partnership adjustments to which the statement relates are finally determined. The partnership adjustments are finally determined upon the later of:
(i) The expiration of the time to file a petition under section 6234; or
(ii) If a petition under section 6234 is filed, the date when the court's decision becomes final.
(2)
Address used for reviewed year partners.
The partnership must furnish the statements described in paragraph (a) of this section to each reviewed year partner in accordance with the forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS. If the partnership mails the statement, it must mail the statement to the current or last address of the reviewed year partner that is known to the partnership. If a statement is returned to the partnership as undeliverable, the partnership must undertake reasonable diligence to identify a correct address for the reviewed year partner to which the statement relates and, if a correct address is identified, mail the statement to the reviewed year partner at the correct address.

During Partnership's 2020 taxable year, A, an individual, was a partner in Partnership and had an address at 123 Main St. On February 1, 2021, A sells his interest in Partnership and informs Partnership that A moved to 456 Broad St. On March 15, 2021, Partnership mails A's statement under section 6031(b) for the 2020 taxable year
to 456 Broad St. On June 1, 2023, A moves again but does not inform Partnership of A's new address. In 2023, the IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year and mails a notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA) to Partnership for that year that includes a single imputed underpayment. Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with § 301.6226-1 with respect to the imputed underpayment and on May 31, 2024, timely mails a statement described in paragraph (a) of this section to A at 456 Broad St. Although the statement was mailed to the last address for A that was known to Partnership, it is returned to Partnership as undeliverable because unknown to Partnership, A had moved. After undertaking reasonable diligence to obtain the correct address of A, Partnership is unable to ascertain the correct address. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, Partnership properly furnished the statement to A when it mailed the statement to 456 Broad St.
(ii)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, except that A lives at 789 Forest Ave during all of 2024 and reasonable diligence would have revealed that 789 Forest Ave is the correct address for A, but Partnership did not undertake such diligence. Because the statement was returned as undeliverable and Partnership did not undertake reasonable diligence to obtain the correct address for A, Partnership failed to properly furnish the statement with respect to A pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(iii)
Example 3.
Partnership is a calendar year taxpayer. The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year. On January 1, 2024, the IRS mails an FPA with respect to the 2020 taxable year to Partnership that includes a single imputed underpayment. Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with § 301.6226-1 with respect to the imputed underpayment. Partnership timely files a petition for readjustment under section 6234 with the Tax Court. The IRS prevails, and the Tax Court sustains all of the adjustments in the FPA with respect to the 2020 taxable year. The time to appeal the Tax Court decision expires, and the Tax Court decision becomes final on April 10, 2025. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the adjustments in the FPA are finally determined on April 10, 2025, and Partnership must furnish the statements described in paragraph (a) of this section to its reviewed year partners and electronically file the statements with the IRS no later than June 9, 2025. See paragraph (c) of this section for the rules regarding filing the statements with the IRS.
(c)
Time and manner for filing the statements with the IRS.
No later than 60 days after the date the partnership adjustments are finally determined (as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), the partnership must electronically file with the IRS the statements that the partnership furnishes to each reviewed year partner under this section, along with a transmittal that includes a summary of the statements filed and such other information required in forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS.
(d)
Correction of statements
—(1)
In general.
A partnership corrects an error in a statement furnished under paragraph (b) of this section or filed under paragraph (c) of this section by filing the corrected statement with the IRS in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section and furnishing a copy of the corrected statement to the reviewed year partner to whom the statement relates in accordance with the forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS.
(2)
Error discovered by partnership
—(i)
Discovery within 60 days of statement due date.
If a partnership discovers an error in a statement within 60 days of the due date for furnishing the statements to partners and filing the statements with the IRS (as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(ii)), the partnership must correct the error in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section and does not have to seek consent of the IRS prior to doing so.
(ii)
Error discovered more than 60 days after statement due date.
If a partnership discovers an error more than 60 days after the due date for furnishing the
statements to partners and filing the statements with the IRS (as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(ii)), the partnership may only correct the error after receiving consent of the IRS in accordance with the forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS. The partnership may not furnish corrected statements unless it receives consent of the IRS to make the correction.
(3)
Error discovered by the IRS.
If the IRS discovers an error in the statements furnished or filed under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and § 301.6226-3(e)(3) or the IRS cannot determine whether the statements furnished or filed by the partnership are correct because of a failure by the partnership to comply with any requirement under this section or § 301.6226-3(e), the IRS may require the partnership to correct such errors in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section or to provide additional information as necessary. Failure by the partnership to correct an error or to provide information when required by the IRS may be treated by the IRS as a failure to properly furnish correct statements to partners and file the correct statements with the IRS as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section or in § 301.6226-3(e)(3). Whether the IRS requires the partnership to correct any errors discovered by the IRS or provide additional information is discretionary on the part of the IRS and the IRS is under no obligation to require the partnership to provide additional information or to correct any errors discovered or brought to the IRS's attention at any time.
(4)
Adjustments in the corrected statements taken into account by the reviewed year partners.
The adjustments included on a corrected statement are taken into account by a reviewed year partner in accordance with § 301.6226-3 for the reporting year (as defined in § 301.6226-3(a)).
(e)
Content of the statements.
Each statement described in paragraph (a) of this section must include the following correct information:

(7) The date the statement is furnished to the reviewed year partner;
(8) The partnership taxable year to which the adjustments relate; and
(9) Any other information required by forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS.

Adjustments and other amounts
—(i)
In general.
Except as described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) or (iii) or (f)(2) of this section, the adjustments set forth in the statement described in paragraph (a) of this section are reported to the reviewed year partner in the same manner as each adjusted partnership-related item was originally allocated to the reviewed year partner on the partnership return for the reviewed year.
(ii)
Adjusted partnership-related item not reported on the partnership's return for the reviewed year.
Except as described in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this
section, if the adjusted partnership-related item was not reported on the partnership return for the reviewed year, each reviewed year partner's share of the adjustments must be determined in accordance with how such partnership-related items would have been allocated under rules that apply with respect to partnership allocations, including under the partnership agreement.
(iii)
Adjustments that specifically allocate items.
If an adjustment involves an allocation of a partnership-related item to a specific partner or in a specific manner, including a reallocation of such an item, the reviewed year partner's share of the adjustment set forth in the statement is determined in accordance with the adjustment as finally determined (as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section).
(2)
Treatment of modifications disregarded.
Any modifications approved by the IRS with respect to the reviewed year partner (or with respect to any indirect partner that holds its interest in the partnership through its interest in the reviewed year partner) under § 301.6225-2 are disregarded for purposes of determining each partner's share of the adjustments under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(g)
Coordination with other provisions under subtitle A of the Code
—(1)
Statements furnished to qualified investment entities described in section 860.
If a reviewed year partner is a qualified investment entity within the meaning of section 860(b) and the partner receives a statement described in paragraph (a) of this section, the partner may be able to avail itself of the deficiency dividend procedure described in § 301.6226-3(b)(4).
(2)
Liability for tax under section 7704(g)(3).
An election under this section has no effect on a partnership's liability for any tax under section 7704(g)(3) (regarding the exception for electing 1987 partnerships from the general rule that certain publicly traded partnerships are treated as corporations).
(3)
Adjustments subject to chapters 3 and 4 of the Code.
A partnership that makes an election under § 301.6226-1 with respect to an imputed underpayment must pay the amount of tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 or chapter 4, if any, in accordance with § 301.6241-6(b)(4).
(4)
Liability for chapter 1 taxes and penalties.
A partnership that makes an election under § 301.6226-1 with respect to an imputed underpayment must pay any taxes, penalties, additions to tax, additional amounts, or the amount of any adjustments to any imputed underpayment calculated by the partnership that is determined under subchapter C of chapter 63 for which the partnership is liable under chapter 1 of the Code or subchapter C of chapter 63 at the time the partnership furnishes statements to its partners in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Any adjustments to such items are not included in the statements the partnership furnishes to its partners or files with the IRS under this section.
(h)
Applicability date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, this section applies to partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending after August 12, 2018. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, paragraph (g)(4) of this section applies to taxable years ending on or after November 20, 2020.
(2)
Election under § 301.9100-22 in effect.
This section applies to any partnership taxable year beginning after November 2, 2015, and before January 1, 2018, for which a valid election under § 301.9100-22 is in effect.
[T.D. 9844, 84 FR 6549, Feb. 27, 2019, as amended by T.D. 9969, 87 FR 75493, Dec. 9, 2022]
§ 301.6226-3
Adjustments taken into account by partners.
(a)
Effect of taking adjustments into account on tax imposed by chapter 1.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (chapter 1 tax) for each reviewed year partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)) for the taxable year that includes the date a statement was furnished in accordance with § 301.6226-2 (the reporting year) is increased by the additional reporting year tax, or if the additional reporting year tax is less than zero, decreased by such amount. The additional reporting
year tax is the aggregate of the correction amounts (determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section). In addition to being liable for the additional reporting year tax, a reviewed year partner must also calculate and pay for the reporting year any penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section). Finally, a reviewed year partner must also calculate and pay for the reporting year any interest (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section).
(b)
Determining the aggregate of the correction amounts
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the aggregate of the correction amounts is the sum of the correction amounts described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section. A correction amount under paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section may be less than zero, and any correction amount that is less than zero may reduce any other correction amount with the result that the aggregate of the correction amounts under this paragraph (b)(1) may also be less than zero. However, nothing in this section entitles any partner to a refund of chapter 1 tax to which such partner is not entitled. See paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section requiring a separate determination of interest and penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts on the correction amount for each applicable taxable year (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) without regard to the correction amount for any other applicable taxable year.
(2)
Correction amount for the first affected year
—(i)
In general.
The correction amount for the taxable year of the partner that includes the end of the reviewed year (the first affected year) is the amount by which the reviewed year partner's chapter 1 tax would increase or decrease for the first affected year if the partner's taxable income for such year was recomputed by taking into account the reviewed year partner's share of the partnership adjustments (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)) reflected on the statement described in § 301.6226-2 with respect to the partner.
(ii)
Calculation of the correction amount for the first affected year.
The correction amount is the amount of chapter 1 tax that would have been imposed for the first affected year if the items as adjusted in the statement described in § 301.6226-2 had been reported as such on the return for the first affected year less the sum of:
(A) The amount of chapter 1 tax shown by the partner on the return for the first affected year (which includes amounts shown on an amended return for such year, including an amended return filed under section 6225(c)(2) by the reviewed year partner); plus
(B) Amounts not included in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section but previously assessed or collected (including the amounts defined in § 1.6664-2(d) of this chapter and any amounts paid by the partner in accordance with § 301.6225-2); less
(C) The amount of rebates made (as defined in § 1.6664-2(e) of this chapter).
(iii)
Formulaic expression of the correction amount for the first affected year.
The correction amount also may be expressed as—
Correction amount = A−(B + C−D)
Where:
A = the amount of chapter 1 tax that would have been imposed had the items as adjusted been properly reported on the return for the first affected year;
B = the amount shown as chapter 1 tax on the return for the first affected year (taking into account amended returns);
C = amounts previously assessed or collected; and
D = the amount of rebates made.
(3)
Correction amount for the intervening years
—(i)
In general.
The correction amount for all taxable years after the first affected year and before the reporting year (the intervening years) is the aggregate of the correction amounts determined for each intervening year. Determining the correction amount for each intervening year is a year-by-year determination. The correction amount for each intervening year is the amount by which the reviewed year partner's chapter 1 tax for such year would increase or decrease if the partner's taxable income for such year was recomputed by taking into account any adjustments to tax attributes (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(10)) of the partner under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Calculation of the correction amount for the intervening years.
The correction amount for each intervening year is the amount of chapter 1 tax that would have been imposed for the intervening year if any tax attribute of the partner for the intervening year had been adjusted after taking into account the reviewed year partner's share of the adjustments for the first affected year as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section (and if any tax attribute of the partner for the intervening year had been adjusted, after taking into account any adjustments to tax attributes of the partner in any prior intervening year(s)) exceeds less the sum of—
(A) The amount of chapter 1 tax shown by the partner on the return for the intervening year (which includes amounts shown on an amended return for such year, including an amended return filed under section 6225(c)(2) by a reviewed year partner); plus
(B) Amounts not included in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section but previously or collected (including the amounts defined in § 1.6664-2(d) of this chapter and any amounts paid by the partner in accordance with § 301.6225-2); less
(C) The amount of rebates made (as defined in § 1.6664-2(e) of this chapter).
(iii)
Formulaic expression of the correction amount for the intervening years.
The correction amount also may be expressed as—
Correction amount = A−(B + C−D)
Where:
A = the amount of chapter 1 tax that would have been imposed for the intervening year;
B = the amount shown as chapter 1 tax on the return for the intervening year (taking into account amended returns);
C = amounts previously assessed or collected; and
D = the amount of rebates made.
(4)
Coordination of sections 860 and 6226.
If a qualified investment entity (QIE) within the meaning of section 860(b) receives a statement described in § 301.6226-2(a) and correctly makes a determination within the meaning of section 860(e)(4) that one or more of the adjustments reflected in the statement is an adjustment within the meaning of section 860(d) with respect to that QIE for a taxable year, the QIE may distribute deficiency dividends within the meaning of section 860(f) for that taxable year and avail itself of the deficiency dividend procedures set forth in section 860. If the QIE utilizes the deficiency dividend procedures with respect to adjustments in a statement described in § 301.6226-2(a), the QIE may claim a deduction for deficiency dividends against the adjustments furnished to the QIE in the statement in calculating any correction amounts under paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, and interest on such correction amounts under paragraph (c) of this section, to the extent that the QIE makes deficiency dividend distributions under section 860(f) and complies with all requirements of section 860 and the regulations under part 1 of this chapter.
(c)
Interest
—(1)
Interest on the correction amounts.
Interest on the correction amounts determined under paragraph (b) of this section is the aggregate of all interest calculated for each applicable taxable year in which there was a correction amount greater than zero at the rate set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. For each applicable taxable year, interest on the correction amount is calculated from the due date (without extension) of the reviewed year partner's return for such applicable taxable year until the amount is paid. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the term
applicable taxable year
means the reviewed year partner's taxable year affected by taking into account adjustments as described in paragraph (b) of this section (for instance, the first affected year and any intervening year in which there is a correction amount greater than zero). For purposes of calculating interest under this paragraph (c), a correction amount under paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section for an applicable taxable year that is less than zero does not reduce the correction amount for any other applicable taxable year.
(2)
Interest on penalties.
Interest on any penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts determined under paragraph (d) of this section is calculated at the rate set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section from the due date (including any extension) of the reviewed
year partner's return for the applicable taxable year until the amount is paid.
(3)
Rate of interest.
For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, interest is calculated using the underpayment rate under section 6621(a)(2) by substituting “5 percentage points” for “3 percentage points” in section 6621(a)(2)(B).
(d)
Penalties
—(1)
Applicability determined at the partnership level.
In the case of a partnership that makes an election under section 6226, the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, and additional amount that relates to an adjustment to any partnership-related item is determined at the partnership level in accordance with section 6221(a). The partnership's reviewed year partners are liable for such penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts as determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Amount calculated at partner level.
A reviewed year partner calculates the amount of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount relating to the partnership adjustments taken into account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as if the correction amount were an underpayment or understatement of the reviewed year partner for the first affected year or intervening year, as applicable. The calculation of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount is based on the characteristics of, and facts and circumstances applicable to, the reviewed year partner for the first affected year or intervening year, as applicable after taking into account the partnership adjustments reflected on the statement. If after taking into account the partnership adjustments in accordance with this section, the reviewed year partner does not have an underpayment, or has an understatement that falls below the applicable threshold for the imposition of a penalty, no penalty is due from that reviewed year partner under this paragraph (d)(2). For penalties in the case of a pass-through partner that makes a payment under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, see paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section.
(3)
Partner-level defenses to penalties.
A reviewed year partner (including a pass-through partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(5))) claiming that a penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to a partnership adjustment reflected on a statement described in § 301.6226-2 (or paragraph (e)(3) of this section) is not due because of a partner-level defense must first pay the penalty and file a claim for refund for the reporting year. Partner-level defenses are limited to those that are personal to the reviewed year partner (for example, a reasonable cause and good faith defense under section 6664(c) that is based on the facts and circumstances applicable to the partner).
(e)
Pass-through partners
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, if a pass-through partner is furnished a statement described in § 301.6226-2 (including a statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section) with respect to adjustments of a partnership that made an election under § 301.6226-1 (audited partnership), the pass-through partner must file with the IRS a partnership adjustment tracking report in accordance with forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS on or before the due date described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, and file and furnish statements in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The pass-through partner must comply with paragraph (e) of this section with respect to each statement furnished to the pass-through partner.
(2)
Failure to file and furnish required documents
—(i)
Failure to timely file and furnish statements.
If any pass-through partner fails to timely file and furnish correct statements in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the pass-through partner must compute and pay an imputed underpayment, as well as any penalties, additions to tax, additional amounts, and interest with respect to the adjustments reflected on the statement furnished to the pass-through partner in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of this section. The IRS may assess such imputed underpayment against such pass-through partner without regard to the limitations under section 6232(b). See § 301.6232-1(c)(2). A failure to furnish statements in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section is treated as
a failure to timely pay an imputed underpayment required under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, unless the pass-through partner computes and pays an imputed underpayment in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of this section. See section 6651(i).
(ii)
Failures relating to partnership adjustment tracking report.
Failure to timely file the partnership adjustment tracking report as required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or filing such report without showing the information required under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is subject to the penalty imposed by section 6698.
(3)
Furnishing statements to partners
—(i)
In general.
A pass-through partner described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must furnish a statement that includes the items required by paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section to each partner that held an interest in the pass-through partner at any time during the taxable year of the pass-through partner to which the adjustments in the statement furnished to the pass-through partner relate (affected partner). The statements described in this paragraph (e)(3) must be filed with the IRS by the due date prescribed in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii), (iii), and (v) of this section, the rules applicable to statements described in § 301.6226-2 are applicable to statements described in this paragraph (e)(3).
(ii)
Time for filing and furnishing the statements.
In accordance with forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS, the pass-through partner must file with the IRS and furnish to its affected partners the statements described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section no later than the extended due date for the return for the adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)) of the audited partnership. For purposes of this section, the extended due date is the extended due date under section 6081 regardless of whether the audited partnership is required to file a return for the adjustment year or timely files a request for an extension under section 6081.
(iii)
Contents of statements.
Each statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section must include the following correct information—
(A) The name and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the audited partnership;

(I) The current or last address of the affected partner that is known to the pass-through partner;
(J) The affected partner's share of items as originally reported to such partner under section 6031(b) and, if applicable, section 6227, for the taxable year to which the adjustments reflected on the statement furnished to the pass-through partner relate;
(K) The affected partner's share of partnership adjustments determined under § 301.6226-2(f)(1) as if the affected partner were the reviewed year partner and the pass-through partner were the partnership;
(L) Modifications approved by the IRS with respect to the affected partner that holds its interest in the audited partnership through the pass-through partner;
(M) The applicability of any penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts determined at the audited partnership level that relate to any adjustments allocable to the affected partner and the adjustments allocated to the affected partner to which such penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts relate, the section of
the Internal Revenue Code under which each penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount is imposed, and the applicable rate of each penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount; and
(N) Any other information required by forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS.
(iv)
Affected partner must take into account the adjustments.
A statement furnished to an affected partner in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section is treated as if it were a statement described in § 301.6226-2. An affected partner that is a pass-through partner must take into account the adjustments reflected on such a statement in accordance with this paragraph (e). An affected partner that is not a pass-through partner must take into account the adjustments reflected on such a statement in accordance with this section by treating references to “reviewed year partner” as “affected partner”. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(iv), an affected partner that is not a pass-through partner takes into account the adjustments in accordance with this section by determining its reporting year based on the date upon which the audited partnership furnished its statements to its reviewed year partners (as described in paragraph (a) of this section). No addition to tax under section 6651 related to any additional reporting year tax will be imposed if an affected partner that is not a pass-through partner reports and pays the additional reporting year tax within 30 days of the extended due date for the return for the adjustment year of the audited partnership (as described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section).
(v)
Adjustments subject to chapters 3 and 4 of the Internal Revenue Code.
If a pass-through partner furnishes statements to its affected partners in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the pass-through partner must comply with the requirements of § 301.6241-6(b)(4), and an affected partner must comply with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. For purposes of applying both § 301.6241-6(b)(4) and paragraph (f) of this section, as appropriate, references to the “partnership” should be replaced with references to the “pass-through partner”; references to the “reviewed year partner” should be replaced with references to the “affected partner”; references to the statement required under paragraph (a) of this section and its due date should be replaced with references to the statement required under paragraph (e)(3) of this section and its due date described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section; references to the “reporting year” should be read in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section; and references to the partnership return should be read as references to the return for the adjustment year of the audited partnership as described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Pass-through partner pays an imputed underpayment
—(i)
In general.
If a pass-through partner described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not furnish statements in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the pass-through partner must compute and pay an imputed underpayment determined under paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section. The pass-through partner must also pay any penalties, additions to tax, additional amounts, and interest as determined under paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section. A failure to timely pay an imputed underpayment required under this paragraph (e)(4) is subject to penalty under section 6651(i).
(ii)

A pass-through partner must file a partnership adjustment tracking report and compute and pay the imputed underpayment and any penalties, additions to tax, additional amounts, and interest, as described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, in accordance with forms, instructions, and other guidance no later than the extended due date for the return for the adjustment year of the audited partnership.
(iii)
Computation of the imputed underpayment.
The imputed underpayment under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section is computed in the same manner as an imputed underpayment under section 6225 and § 301.6225-1, except that adjustments reflected on the statement furnished to the pass-through partner under § 301.6226-2 are treated as partnership adjustments (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)) for the first affected year. Any modification approved by
the IRS under § 301.6225-2 with respect to the pass-through partner (including any modifications with respect to a relevant partner (as defined in § 301.6225-2(a)) that holds its interest in the audited partnership through its interest in the pass-through partner) reflected on the statement furnished to the pass-through partner under § 301.6226-2 (or paragraph (e)(3) of this section) is taken into account in calculating the imputed underpayment under this paragraph (e)(4)(iii). Any modification that was not approved by the IRS under § 301.6225-2 may not be taken into account in calculating the imputed underpayment under this paragraph (e)(4)(iii).
(iv)
Penalties and interest
—(A)
Penalties.
A pass-through partner must compute and pay any applicable penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts on the imputed underpayment calculated under paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section as if such amount were an imputed underpayment for the pass-through partner's first affected year. See § 301.6233(a)-1(c).
(B)
Interest.
A pass-through partner must pay interest on the imputed underpayment calculated under paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section as if such imputed underpayment were a correction amount for the first affected year.
(v)
Adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment.
Adjustments taken into account under paragraph (e)(4) of this section that do not result in an imputed underpayment (as defined in § 301.6225-1(f)) are taken into account by the pass-through partner in accordance with § 301.6225-3 in the taxable year of the pass-through partner that includes the date the imputed underpayment required under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section is paid. If, after making the computation described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section, no imputed underpayment exists and therefore no payment is required under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, the adjustments that did not result in an imputed underpayment are taken into account by the pass-through partner in accordance with § 301.6225-3 in the taxable year of the pass-through partner that includes the date the statement described in § 301.6226-2 (or paragraph (e)(3) of this section) is furnished to the pass-through partner.
(vi)
Coordination with chapters 3 and 4.
If a pass-through partner pays an imputed underpayment described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, § 301.6241-6(b)(3) applies to the pass-through partner by substituting “pass-through partner” for “partnership” where § 301.6241-6(b)(3) refers to the partnership that pays the imputed underpayment.
(5)
Treatment of pass-through partners that are not partnerships
—(i)
S corporations.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), an S corporation is treated as a partnership and its shareholders are treated as partners.
(ii)
Trusts and estates.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, for purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, a trust and its beneficiaries, and an estate and its beneficiaries are treated in the same manner as a partnership and its partners.
(6)
Pass-through partners subject to chapter 1 tax.
A pass-through partner that is subject to tax under chapter 1 of the Code on the adjustments (or a portion of the adjustments) reflected on the statement furnished to such partner under § 301.6226-2 (or paragraph (e)(3) of this section) takes the adjustments into account under this paragraph (e)(6) when the pass-through partner calculates and pays the additional reporting year tax as determined under paragraph (b) of this section and furnishes statements to its partners in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, a pass-through partner is only required to include on a statement under paragraph (e)(3) of this section the adjustments that would be required to be included on statements furnished to owners or beneficiaries under sections 6037 and 6034A, as applicable, if the pass-through partner had correctly reported the items for the year to which the adjustments relate. If the pass-through partner fails to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (e)(6), the pass-through partner must compute and pay an imputed underpayment, as well as any penalties, additions to tax, additional amounts,
and interest with respect to the adjustments reflected on the statement furnished to such partner in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(f)
Partners subject to withholding under chapters 3 and 4.
A reviewed year partner that is subject to withholding under § 301.6241-6(b)(4) must file an income tax return for the reporting year to report its additional reporting year tax and its share of any penalties, additions to tax, additional amounts, and interest (notwithstanding any filing exception in § 1.6012-1(b)(2)(i) or § 1.6012-2(g)(2)(i) of this chapter). The amount of tax paid by a partnership under § 301.6241-6(b)(4) is allowed as a credit under section 33 to the reviewed year partner to the extent that the tax is allocable to the reviewed year partner (within the meaning of § 1.1446-3(d)(2) of this chapter) or is actually withheld from the reviewed year partner (within the meaning of § 1.1464-1(a) or § 1.1474-3 of this chapter). The credit is allowed against the reviewed year partner's income tax liability for its reporting year. The reviewed year partner must substantiate the credit by attaching the applicable Form 1042-S,
Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,
or Form 8805,
Foreign Partner's Information Statement of Section 1446 Withholding Tax,
to its income tax return for the reporting year, as well as satisfying any other requirements prescribed by the IRS in forms and instructions.
(g)
Treatment of disregarded entities and wholly-owned grantor trusts.
In the case of a reviewed year partner that is a wholly-owned entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes in the reviewed year or a trust that is wholly owned by only one person in the reviewed year, whether the grantor or another person, and where the trust reports the owner's information to payors under § 1.671-4(b)(2)(i)(A) of this chapter and that is furnished a statement described in § 301.6226-2 (or paragraph (e)(3) of this section), the owner of the disregarded entity or wholly-owned grantor trust must take into account the adjustments reflected on that statement in accordance with this section as if the owner were the reviewed year partner.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of these examples, unless otherwise stated, each partnership is subject to subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code, each partnership and partner has a calendar year taxable year, no modifications are requested by any partnership under § 301.6225-2, no penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts are determined at the partnership level, all persons are U.S. persons, the highest rate of income tax in effect for is 40 percent for all relevant periods, the highest rate of income tax in effect for corporations is 20 percent for all relevant periods, and the highest rate of tax for individuals for capital gains is 15 percent for all relevant periods.

Example 1.
On its partnership return for the 2020 tax year, Partnership reported ordinary income of $1,000 and charitable contributions of $400. On June 1, 2023, the IRS mails a notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA) to Partnership for Partnership's 2020 year disallowing the charitable contribution in its entirety and determining that a 20 percent accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(b) applies to the disallowance of the charitable contribution, and setting forth a single imputed underpayment with respect to such adjustments. Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with § 301.6226-1 with respect to the imputed underpayment in the FPA for Partnership's 2020 year and files a timely petition in the Tax Court challenging the partnership adjustments. The Tax Court determines that Partnership is not entitled to any of the claimed $400 in charitable contributions and upholds the applicability of the penalty. The decision regarding Partnership's 2020 tax year becomes final on December 15, 2025. Pursuant to § 301.6226-2(b), the partnership adjustments are finally determined on December 15, 2025. On February 2, 2026, Partnership files the statements described under § 301.6226-2 with the IRS and furnishes to partner A, an individual who was a partner in Partnership during 2020, a statement described in § 301.6226-2. A had a 25 percent interest in Partnership during all of 2020 and was allocated 25 percent of all
items from Partnership for that year. The statement shows A's share of ordinary income reported on Partnership's return for the reviewed year of $250 and A's share of the charitable contribution reported on Partnership's return for the reviewed year of $100. The statement also shows an adjustment to A's share of the charitable contribution, a reduction of $100 resulting in $0 charitable contribution allocated to A from Partnership for 2020. In addition, the statement reports that a 20 percent accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(b) applies. A must pay the additional reporting year tax as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, in addition to A's penalties and interest. A computes his additional reporting year tax as follows. First, A determines the correction amount for the first affected year (the 2020 taxable year) by taking into account A's share of the partnership adjustment (−$100 reduction in charitable contribution) for the 2020 taxable year. A determines the amount by which his chapter 1 tax for 2020 would have increased or decreased if the $100 adjustment to the charitable contribution from Partnership were taken into account for that year. There is no adjustment to tax attributes in A's intervening years as a result of the adjustment to the charitable contribution for 2020. Therefore, A's aggregate of the correction amounts is the correction amount for 2020, A's first affected year. In addition to the aggregate of the correction amounts being added to the chapter 1 tax that A owes for 2026, the reporting year, A must calculate a 20 percent accuracy-related penalty on A's underpayment attributable to the $100 adjustment to the charitable contribution, as well as interest on the correction amount for the first affected year and the penalty determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Interest on the correction amount for the first affected tax year runs from April 15, 2021, the due date of A's 2020 return (the first affected tax year) until A pays this amount. In addition, interest runs on the penalty from April 15, 2021, the due date of A's 2020 return for the first affected year until A pays this amount. On his 2026 income tax return, A must report the additional reporting year tax determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, which is the correction amount for 2020, plus the accuracy-related penalty determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and interest determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section on the correction amount for 2020 and the penalty.
(2)
Example 2.
On its partnership return for the 2020 tax year, Partnership reported an ordinary loss of $500. On June 1, 2023, the IRS mails an FPA to Partnership for the 2020 taxable year determining that $300 of the $500 in ordinary loss should be recharacterized as a long-term capital loss. Partnership has no long-term capital gain for its 2020 tax year. The FPA for Partnership's 2020 tax year reflects an adjustment of an increase in ordinary income of $300 (as a result of the disallowance of the recharacterization of $300 from ordinary loss to long-term capital loss) and an imputed underpayment related to that adjustment, as well as an adjustment of an additional $300 in long-term capital loss for 2020 which does not result in an imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-1(f). Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with § 301.6226-1 with respect to the imputed underpayment in the FPA and does not file a petition for readjustment under section 6234. Accordingly, under § 301.6226-1(b)(2) and § 301.6225-3(b)(6), the adjustment year partners (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(2)) do not take into account the $300 long-term capital loss that does not result in an imputed underpayment. Rather, the $300 long-term capital loss is taken into account by the reviewed year partners. The time to file a petition expires on August 30, 2023. Pursuant to § 301.6226-2(b), the partnership adjustments become finally determined on August 31, 2023. On September 30, 2023, Partnership files with the IRS statements described in § 301.6226-2 and furnishes statements to all of its reviewed year partners in accordance with § 301.6226-2. One partner of Partnership in 2020, B (an individual), had a 25 percent interest in Partnership during all of 2020 and was allocated 25 percent of all items from Partnership for that year. The statement filed with the IRS and furnished to B shows B's allocable
share of the ordinary loss reported on Partnership's return for the 2020 taxable year as $125. The statement also shows an adjustment to B's allocable share of the ordinary loss in the amount of −$75, resulting in a corrected ordinary loss allocated to B of $50 for taxable year 2020 ($125 originally allocated to B less $75 which is B's share of the adjustment to the ordinary loss). In addition, the statement shows an increase to B's share of long-term capital loss in the amount of $75 (B's share of the adjustment that did not result in the imputed underpayment with respect to Partnership). B must pay the additional reporting year tax as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. B computes his additional reporting year tax as follows. First, B determines the correction amount for the first affected year (the 2020 taxable year) by taking into account B's share of the partnership adjustments (a $75 reduction in ordinary loss and an increase of $75 in long-term capital loss) for the 2020 taxable year. B determines the amount by which his chapter 1 tax for 2020 would have increased or decreased if the $75 adjustment to ordinary loss and the $75 adjustment to long-term capital loss from Partnership were taken into account for that year. Second, B determines if there is any increase or decrease in chapter 1 tax for any intervening year as a result of the adjustment to the ordinary and capital losses for 2020. B's aggregate of the correction amounts is the correction amount for 2020, B's first affected year plus any correction amounts for any intervening years. B is also liable for any interest on the correction amount for the first affected year and for any intervening year as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

Example 3.
On its partnership return for the 2020 tax year, Partnership, a domestic partnership, reported U.S. source dividend income of $2,000. On June 1, 2023, the IRS mails an FPA to Partnership for Partnership's 2020 year increasing the amount of U.S. source dividend income to $4,000 and determining that a 20 percent accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(b) applies to the increase in U.S. source dividend income. Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with § 301.6226-1 with respect to the imputed underpayment in the FPA for Partnership's 2020 year and does not file a petition for readjustment under section 6234. The time to file a petition expires on August 30, 2023. Pursuant to § 301.6226-2(b), the partnership adjustments become finally determined on August 31, 2023. On September 30, 2023, Partnership files the statements described under § 301.6226-2 with the IRS and furnishes to partner C, a nonresident alien individual who was a partner in Partnership during 2020 (and remains a partner in Partnership in 2023), a statement described in § 301.6226-2. C had a 50 percent interest in Partnership during all of 2020 and was allocated 50 percent of all items from Partnership for that year. The statement shows C's share of U.S. source dividend income reported on Partnership's return for the reviewed year of $1,000 and an adjustment to U.S. source dividend income of $1,000. In addition, the statement reports that a 20 percent accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(b) applies. Under § 301.6241-6(b)(4)(i), because the additional $1,000 in U.S. source dividend income allocated to C is an amount subject to withholding (as defined in § 301.6241-6(b)(2)), Partnership must pay the amount of tax required to be withheld on the adjustment. See §§ 1.1441-1(b)(1) and 1.1441-5(b)(2)(i)(A) of this chapter. Under § 301.6241-6(b)(4)(ii), Partnership may reduce the amount of withholding tax it must pay because it has valid documentation from 2020 that establishes that C was entitled to a reduced rate of withholding in 2020 on U.S. source dividend income of 10 percent pursuant to a treaty. Partnership withholds $100 of tax from C's distributive share, remits the tax to the IRS, and files the necessary return and information returns required by § 1.1461-1 of this chapter. On his 2023 return, C must report the additional reporting year tax determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the accuracy-related penalty determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and interest determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section on the correction amount for the first affected year, the correction
amount for any intervening year, and the penalty. Under paragraph (f) of this section, C may claim the $100 withholding tax paid by Partnership pursuant to § 301.6241-6(b)(4)(i) as a credit under section 33 against C's income tax liability on his 2023 return.

Example 4.
On its partnership return for the 2020 tax year, Partnership reported ordinary income of $100 and a long-term capital gain of $40. Partnership had four equal partners during the 2020 tax year: E, F, G, and H, all of whom were individuals. On its partnership return for the 2020 tax year, the entire long-term capital gain was allocated to partner E and the ordinary income was allocated to all partners based on their equal (25 percent) interest in Partnership. The IRS initiates an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year and determines that the long-term capital gain should have been allocated equally to all four partners and that Partnership should have recognized an additional $10 in ordinary income. On June 1, 2023, the IRS mails an FPA to Partnership reflecting the reallocation of the $40 long-term capital gain so that F, G, and H each have $10 increase in long-term capital gain and E has a $30 reduction in long-term capital gain for 2020. In addition, the FPA reflects the partnership adjustment increasing ordinary income by $10. The FPA reflects a general imputed underpayment with respect to the increase in ordinary income and a specific imputed underpayment with respect to the increase in long-term capital gain allocated to F, G, and H. In addition, the FPA reflects a $30 partnership adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment, that is, the reduction of $30 in long-term capital gain with respect to E that is associated with the specific imputed underpayment in accordance with § 301.6225-1(g)(2)(iii)(B). Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with § 301.6226-1 with respect to the specific imputed underpayment relating to the reallocation of long-term capital gain. Partnership does not file a petition for readjustment under section 6234. The time to file a petition expires on August 30, 2023. Pursuant to § 301.6226-2(b), the partnership adjustments become finally determined on August 31, 2023. Partnership timely pays the general imputed underpayment that resulted from the partnership adjustment to ordinary income. On September 30, 2023, Partnership files with the IRS statements described in § 301.6226-2 and furnishes statements to its partners reflecting their share of the partnership adjustments as finally determined in the FPA that relate to the specific imputed underpayment, that is, the reallocation of long-term capital gain. The statements for F, G, and H each reflect a partnership adjustment of an additional $10 of long-term capital gain for 2020. The statement for E reflects a partnership adjustment of a reduction of $30 of long-term capital gain for 2020. Because E, F, G, and H are all individuals, all partners must report the additional reporting year tax as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section in the partners' reporting year, which is 2023. They compute their additional reporting year tax as follows. First, they determine the correction amount for the first affected year (the 2020 taxable year) by taking into account their share of the partnership adjustments for the 2020 taxable year. They each determine the amount by which their chapter 1 tax for 2020 would have increased or decreased if the adjustment to long-term capital gain from Partnership were taken into account for that year. Second, they determine if there is any increase or decrease in chapter 1 tax for any intervening year as a result of the adjustment to the long-term capital gain for 2020. Their aggregate of the correction amounts is the sum of the correction amount for 2020, their first affected year and any correction amounts for any intervening years. They are also liable for any interest on the correction amount for the first affected year and for any intervening year as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

Example 5.
On its partnership return for the 2020 taxable year, Partnership reported a long-term capital loss of $500. During an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's
2020 taxable year, the IRS mails a notice of proposed partnership adjustment (NOPPA) in which it proposes to disallow $200 of the reported $500 long-term capital loss, the only adjustment. Accordingly, the imputed underpayment reflected in the NOPPA is $80 ($200 × 40 percent). F, a C corporation partner with a 50 percent interest in Partnership, received 50 percent of all long-term capital losses for 2020. As part of the modification process described in § 301.6225-2(d)(2), F files an amended return for 2020 taking into account F's share of the partnership adjustment ($100 reduction in long-term capital loss) and pays the tax owed for 2020, including interest. Also as part of the modification process, F also files amended returns for 2021 and 2022 and pays additional tax (and interest) for these years because the reduction in long-term capital loss for 2020 affected the tax due from F for 2021 and 2022. See § 301.6225-2(d)(2). The reduction of the long-term capital loss in 2020 did not affect any other taxable year of F. This is the only modification requested. The IRS approves the modification with respect to F and on June 1, 2023, mails an FPA to Partnership for Partnership's 2020 year reflecting the partnership adjustment reducing the long-term capital loss in the amount of $200. The FPA also reflects the modification to the imputed underpayment based on the amended returns filed by F taking into account F's share of the reduction in the long-term capital loss. Therefore, the imputed underpayment in the FPA is $40 ($100 × 40 percent). Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with § 301.6226-1 with respect to the imputed underpayment in the FPA for Partnership's 2020 year and files a timely petition in the Tax Court challenging the partnership adjustments. The Tax Court upholds the determinations in the FPA and the decision regarding Partnership's 2020 tax year becomes final on December 15, 2025. Pursuant to § 301.6226-2(b), the partnership adjustments are finally determined on December 15, 2025. On February 1, 2026, Partnership files the statements described under § 301.6226-2 with the IRS and furnishes to its partners statements reflecting their shares of the partnership adjustment. The statement issued to F reflects F's share of the partnership adjustment for Partnership's 2020 taxable year as finally determined by the Tax Court. The statement shows F's share of the long-term capital loss adjustment for the reviewed year of $100, as well as the $100 long-term capital loss taken into account by F as part of the amended return modification. Accordingly, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, when F computes its correction amounts for the first affected year (the 2020 taxable year) and the intervening years (the 2021 through 2026 taxable years), F computes any increase or decrease in chapter 1 tax for those years using the returns for the 2020, 2021, and 2022 taxable years as amended during the modification process and taking into account any chapter 1 tax paid with those amended returns. F also takes into account the interest paid with F's amended returns when determining the interest under paragraph (c) of this section that must be paid in the reporting year.

Example 6.
Partnership has two equal partners for the 2020 tax year: M (an individual) and J (a partnership). For the 2020 tax year, J has two equal partners—K and L—both individuals. On June 1, 2023, the IRS mails an FPA to Partnership for Partnership's 2020 year increasing Partnership's ordinary income by $500,000 and asserting an imputed underpayment of $200,000. Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with § 301.6226-1 with respect to the imputed underpayment in the FPA for Partnership's 2020 year and does not file a petition for readjustment under section 6234. The time to file a petition expires on August 30, 2023. Pursuant to § 301.6226-2(b), the partnership adjustments become finally determined on August 31, 2023. Therefore, Partnership's adjustment year is 2023, the due date of the adjustment year return is March 15, 2024 and the extended due date for the adjustment year return is September 16, 2024. On October 12, 2023, Partnership timely files with the IRS statements described in § 301.6226-2 and timely furnishes statements to its partners reflecting their share of the
partnership adjustments as finally determined in the FPA. The statements to M and J each reflect a partnership adjustment of $250,000 of ordinary income. M takes her share of the adjustments reflected on the statements furnished by Partnership into account on M's return for the 2023 tax year in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. On April 1, 2024, J files the adjustment tracking report and files and furnishes statements to K and L reflecting each partner's share of the adjustments reflected on the statements Partnership furnished to J. K and L must take their share of adjustments reflected on the statements furnished by J into account on their returns for the 2023 tax year in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section by treating themselves as reviewed year partners for purposes of paragraph (b).

Example 7.
On its partnership return for the 2020 tax year, Partnership reported that it placed Asset, which had a depreciable basis of $210,000, into service in 2020 and depreciated Asset over 5 years, using the straight-line method. Accordingly, Partnership claimed depreciation of $42,000 in each year related to Asset. Partnership has two equal partners for the 2020 tax year: M (a partnership) and N (an S corporation). For the 2020 tax year, N has one shareholder, O, who is an individual. On June 1, 2023, the IRS mails an FPA to Partnership for Partnership's 2020 year. In the FPA, the IRS determines that Asset should have been depreciated over 7 years instead of 5 years and adjusts the depreciation for the 2020 tax year to $30,000 instead of $42,000 resulting in a $12,000 adjustment. This adjustment results in an imputed underpayment of $4,800 ($12,000 × 40 percent). Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with § 301.6226-1 with respect to the imputed underpayment in the FPA for Partnership's 2020 year and does not file a petition for readjustment under section 6234. The time to file a petition expires on August 30, 2023. Pursuant to § 301.6226-2(b), the partnership adjustments become finally determined on August 31, 2023. On October 12, 2023, Partnership timely files with the IRS statements described in § 301.6226-2 and furnishes statements to its partners reflecting their share of the partnership adjustments as finally determined in the FPA. The statements to M and N reflect a partnership adjustment of $6,000 of ordinary income for the 2020 tax year. On February 1, 2024, N takes the adjustments into account under paragraph (e)(3) of this section by filing a partnership adjustment tracking report and furnishing a statement to O reflecting her share of the adjustments reported to N on the statement it received from Partnership. M does not furnish statements and instead chooses to calculate and pay an imputed underpayment under paragraph (e)(4) of this section equal to $1,200 ($6,000 × 40 percent) on the adjustments reflected on the statement it received from Partnership plus interest on the amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B) of this section. On her 2023 return, O properly takes the adjustments into account under this section. Therefore, O reports and pays the additional reporting year tax determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, which is the correction amount for 2020 plus any correction amounts for 2021 and 2022 (if the adjustments in 2020 resulted in any changes to the tax attributes of O in those years), and pays interest determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section on the correction amounts for each of those years.

Example 8.
On its partnership return for the 2020 tax year, Partnership reported $1,000 of ordinary loss. Partnership has two equal partners for the 2020 tax year: P and Q, both S corporations. For the 2020 tax year, P had one shareholder, R, an individual. For the 2020 tax year, Q had two shareholders, S and T, both individuals. On June 1, 2023, the IRS mails an FPA to Partnership for Partnership's 2020 year determining $500 of the $1,000 of ordinary loss should be recharacterized as $500 of long-term capital loss and $500 of the ordinary loss should be disallowed. The FPA asserts an imputed underpayment of $400 ($1,000 × 40 percent) with respect to the $1,000 reduction to ordinary loss and reflecting an adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment of a $500 capital loss. Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with § 301.6226-1 with
respect to the imputed underpayment in the FPA for Partnership's 2020 year and does not file a petition for readjustment under section 6234. The time to file a petition expires on August 30, 2023. Pursuant to § 301.6226-2(b), the partnership adjustments become finally determined on August 31, 2023. On October 12, 2023, Partnership timely files with the IRS statements described in § 301.6226-2 and furnishes statements to its partners reflecting their share of the partnership adjustments as finally determined in the FPA. The statements to P and Q each reflect a partnership adjustment of $500 increase in ordinary income and a $250 increase in capital loss in accordance with § 301.6225-3(b)(6). P takes the adjustments into account under paragraph (e)(3) of this section by timely filing a partnership adjustment tracking report and furnishing a statement to R. Q timely filed a partnership adjustment tracking report, but chooses not to furnish statements and instead must calculate and pay an imputed underpayment under paragraph (e)(4) of this section as well as interest on the imputed underpayment determined under paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B) of this section. After applying the rules set forth in § 301.6225-1, Q calculates the imputed underpayment that it is required to pay of $200 ($500 adjustment to ordinary income × 40 percent). Q also has one adjustment that does not result in an imputed underpayment—the $250 increase to capital loss. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, Q files the partnership adjustment tracking report and pay the amounts due under paragraph (e)(4) of this section by September 15, 2024, the extended due date of Partnership's return for the adjustment year, 2023. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section, on its 2024 return, the year in which Q made its payment of the imputed underpayment, Q reports and allocates the $250 capital loss to its shareholders for its 2024 taxable year as a capital loss as provided in § 301.6225-3.

Example 9.
On its partnership return for the 2020 tax year, Partnership reported a $1,000 long-term capital gain on the sale of Stock. Partnership has two equal partners for the 2020 tax year: U (an individual) and V (a partnership). For the 2020 tax year, V has two equal partners: W (an individual) and X (a partnership). For the 2020 tax year, X has two equal partners: Y and Z, both of which are C corporations. On June 1, 2023, the IRS mails a NOPPA to Partnership for Partnership's 2020 year proposing a $500 increase in the long-term capital gain from the sale of Stock and an imputed underpayment of $200 ($500 × 40 percent). On July 17, 2023, Partnership timely submits a request to modify the rate used in calculating the imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-2(d)(4). Partnership submits sufficient information demonstrating that $375 of the $500 adjustment is allocable to individuals (50 percent of the $500 adjustment allocable to U and 25 percent of the $500 adjustment allocable to W) and the remaining $125 is allocable to C corporations (the indirect partners Y and Z). The IRS approves the modification and the imputed underpayment is reduced to $81.25 (($375 × 15 percent) + ($125 × 20 percent)). See § 301.6225-2(b)(3). No other modifications are requested. On February 28, 2024, the IRS mails an FPA to Partnership for Partnership's 2020 year determining a $500 increase in the long-term capital gain on the sale of Stock and asserting an imputed underpayment of $81.25 after taking into account the approved modifications. Partnership makes a timely election under section 6226 in accordance with § 301.6226-1 with respect to the imputed underpayment in the FPA for Partnership's 2020 year and does not file a petition for readjustment under section 6234. The time to file a petition expires on May 28, 2024. Pursuant to § 301.6226-2(b), the partnership adjustments become finally determined on May 29, 2024. On July 26, 2024, Partnership timely files with the IRS statements described in § 301.6226-2 and furnishes statements to its partners reflecting their share of the partnership adjustments as finally determined in the FPA. The statements to U and V each reflect a partnership adjustment of a $250 increase in long-term capital gain. V timely files the adjustment tracking report but fails to furnish statements and therefore must calculate and pay an imputed underpayment under paragraph (e)(4) of this section as well as
interest on the imputed underpayment determined under paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B) of this section. On February 3, 2025, V pays an imputed underpayment of $43.75 (($125 × 20 percent for the adjustments allocable to X) + ($125 × 15 percent for the adjustments allocable to W)) which takes into account the rate modifications approved by the IRS with respect to Y and Z. V must also pay any interest on the amount as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B) of this section. V must file the adjustment tracking report and pay the amounts due under paragraph (e)(4) of this section no later than September 15, 2025, the extended due date of Partnership's return for the 2024 year, which is the adjustment year.

(a)
Amount to be deposited
—(1)
In general.
The jurisdictional amount that the filing partner (or, in the case of a petition filed by a 5-percent group, each member of the group, or, for civil actions beginning on or after April 2, 2002, in the case of a petition filed by a pass-thru partner, each indirect partner holding an interest through the pass-thru partner) shall deposit is the amount by which the tax liability of the partner would be increased if the treatment of the partnership items on the partner's return were made consistent with the treatment of partnership items on the partnership return, as adjusted by the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment. The partner is not required to pay other outstanding liabilities in order to deposit a jurisdictional amount.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A files a petition for readjustment of partnership items in the United States Court of Federal Claims. A's tax liability would be increased by $4,000 if partnership items on A's return were conformed to the partnership return, as adjusted by the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment.

(d)
Amount deposited may be applied against assessment.
If the restriction on assessment provided under section 6225(a) lapses with respect to a deficiency attributable to partnership items for a partnership taxable year while an amount is on deposit under section 6226(e) in connection with a petition relating to those items, the Internal Revenue Service may apply the amount deposited against any such deficiency that is assessed.

§ 301.6226(f)-1
Scope of judicial review.
(a)
In general.
A court reviewing a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment has jurisdiction to determine all partnership items for the taxable year to which the notice relates and the proper allocation of such items among the partners. Thus, the review is not limited to the items adjusted in the notice. In addition, the court has jurisdiction in the partnership-level proceeding to determine any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. However, the court does not have jurisdiction in the partnership-level proceeding to consider any partner-level defenses to any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.

§ 301.6227-1
Administrative adjustment request by partnership.
(a)
In general.
A partnership may file a request for an administrative adjustment with respect to any partnership-related item (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)(ii)) for any partnership taxable year. When filing an administrative adjustment request (AAR), the partnership must determine whether the adjustments requested in the AAR result in an imputed underpayment in accordance with § 301.6227-2(a) for the reviewed year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(8)). If the adjustments requested in the AAR result in an imputed underpayment, the partnership must take the adjustments into account under the rules described in § 301.6227-2(b) unless the partnership makes an election under § 301.6227-2(c), in which case each reviewed year partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)) must take the adjustments into account in accordance with § 301.6227-3. If the adjustments requested in the AAR are adjustments described in § 301.6225-1(f)(1) that do not result in an imputed underpayment (as determined under § 301.6227-2(a)), such adjustments must be taken into account by the reviewed year partners in accordance with § 301.6227-3. A partner
may not make a request for an administrative adjustment of a partnership-related item except in accordance with § 301.6222-1 or if the partner is doing so on behalf of the partnership in the partner's capacity as the partnership representative designated under section 6223. In addition, a partnership may not file an AAR solely for the purpose of changing the designation of a partnership representative or changing the appointment of a designated individual. See § 301.6223-1 (regarding designation of the partnership representative). When the partnership changes the designation of the partnership representative (or appointment of the designated individual) in conjunction with the filing of an AAR in accordance with § 301.6223-1(e), the change in designation (or appointment) is treated as occurring prior to the filing of the AAR. For rules regarding a notice of change to the amount of creditable foreign tax expenditures see paragraph (g) of this section.
(b)
Time for filing an AAR.
An AAR may only be filed by a partnership with respect to a partnership taxable year after a partnership return for that taxable year has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A partnership may not file an AAR with respect to a partnership taxable year more than three years after the later of the date the partnership return for such partnership taxable year was filed or the last day for filing such partnership return (determined without regard to extensions). Except as provided in § 301.6231-1(f), an AAR (including a request filed by a partner in accordance with § 301.6222-1) may not be filed for a partnership taxable year after a notice of administrative proceeding with respect to such taxable year has been mailed by the IRS under section 6231.
(c)
Form and manner for filing an AAR
—(1)
In general.
An AAR by a partnership, including any required statements, forms, and schedules as described in this section, must be filed with the IRS in accordance with the forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS, and must be signed under penalties of perjury by the partnership representative (as described in §§ 301.6223-1 and 301.6223-2).

A partnership must include the information described in this paragraph (c)(2) when filing an AAR with the IRS. In the case of a failure by the partnership to provide the information described in this paragraph (c)(2), the IRS may, but is not required to, invalidate an AAR or readjust any items that were adjusted on the AAR. An AAR filed with the IRS must include—
(i) The adjustments requested;
(ii) If a reviewed year partner is required to take into account the adjustments requested under § 301.6227-3, statements described in paragraph (e) of this section, including any transmittal with respect to such statements required by forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS; and
(iii) Other information prescribed by the IRS in forms, instructions, or other guidance.
(d)
Copy of statement furnished to reviewed year partners in certain cases.
If a reviewed year partner is required to take into account adjustments requested in an AAR under § 301.6227-3, the partnership must furnish a copy of the statement described in paragraph (e) of this section to the reviewed year partner to whom the statement relates in accordance with the forms, instructions and other guidance prescribed by the IRS. If the partnership mails the statement, it must mail the statement to the current or last address of the reviewed year partner that is known to the partnership. The statement must be furnished to the reviewed year partner on the date the AAR is filed with the IRS.
(e)
Statements

(2)
Determination of each partner's share of adjustments
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, each reviewed year partner's share of the adjustments requested in the AAR is determined in the same manner as each adjusted partnership-related item was originally allocated to the reviewed year partner on the partnership return for the reviewed year. If the partnership pays an imputed underpayment under § 301.6227-2(b) with respect to the adjustments requested in the AAR, the reviewed year partner's share of the adjustments requested in the AAR only includes any adjustments that did not result in the imputed underpayment, as determined under § 301.6227-2(a).
(ii)
Adjusted partnership-related item not reported on the partnership's return for the reviewed year.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, if the adjusted partnership-related item was not reported on the partnership return for the reviewed year, each reviewed year partner's share of the adjustments must be determined in accordance with how such items would have been allocated under rules that apply with respect to partnership allocations, including under the partnership agreement.
(iii)
Allocation adjustments.
If an adjustment involves allocation of a partnership-related item to a specific partner or in a specific manner, including a reallocation of an item, the reviewed year partner's share of the adjustment requested in the AAR is determined in accordance with the AAR.
(f)
Administrative proceeding for a taxable year for which an AAR is filed.
Within the period described in section 6235, the IRS may initiate an administrative proceeding with respect to the partnership for any partnership taxable year regardless of whether the partnership filed an AAR with respect to such taxable year and may adjust any partnership-related item, including any partnership-related item adjusted in an AAR filed by the partnership. The amount of an imputed underpayment determined by the partnership under § 301.6227-2(a)(1), including any modifications determined by the partnership under § 301.6227-2(a)(2), may be re-determined by the IRS.
(g)
Notice requirement and partnership adjustments required as a result of a foreign tax redetermination.
For special rules applicable when an adjustment to a partnership related item (as defined in section 6241(2)) is required as part of a redetermination of U.S. tax liability under section 905(c) and § 1.905-3(b) of this chapter as a result of a foreign tax redetermination (as defined in § 1.905-3(a) of this chapter), see § 1.905-4(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter.

§ 301.6227-2
Determining and accounting for adjustments requested in an administrative adjustment request by the partnership.
(a)
Determining whether adjustments result in an imputed underpayment
—(1)
Determination of an imputed underpayment.
The determination of whether adjustments requested in an administrative adjustment request (AAR) result in an imputed underpayment in the reviewed year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(8)) and the determination of the amount of any imputed underpayment is made in accordance with the rules under § 301.6225-1.
(2)
Modification of imputed underpayment for purposes of this section.
A partnership may apply modifications to the amount of an imputed underpayment determined under paragraph
(a)(1) of this section using only the provisions under § 301.6225-2(d)(3) (regarding tax-exempt partners), § 301.6225-2(d)(4) (regarding modification of applicable tax rate), § 301.6225-2(d)(5) (regarding specified passive activity losses), § 301.6225-2(d)(6)(ii) (regarding limitations or restrictions in the grouping of adjustments), § 301.6225-2(d)(7) (regarding certain qualified investment entities), § 301.6225-2(d)(9) (regarding tax treaty modifications), or as provided in forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS with respect to AARs. The partnership may not modify an imputed underpayment resulting from adjustments requested in an AAR except as described in this paragraph (a)(2). When applying modifications to the amount of an imputed underpayment under this paragraph (a)(2):
(i) The partnership is not required to seek the approval from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) prior to applying modifications to the amount of any imputed underpayment under paragraph (a)(1) of this section reported on the AAR; and
(ii) As part of the AAR filed with the IRS in accordance with forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS, the partnership must—
(A) Notify the IRS of any modification;
(B) Describe the effect of the modification on the imputed underpayment;
(C) Provide an explanation of the basis for such modification; and
(D) Provide documentation to support the partnership's eligibility for the modification.
(b)
Adjustments resulting in an imputed underpayment taken into account by the partnership
—(1)
In general.
Except in the case of a valid election under paragraph (c) of this section, a partnership must pay any imputed underpayment (as determined under paragraph (a) of this section) resulting from the adjustments requested in an AAR on the date the partnership files the AAR. For the rules applicable to the partnership's expenditure for an imputed underpayment, as well as any penalties and interest paid by the partnership with respect to an imputed underpayment, see § 301.6241-4.
(2)
Penalties and interest.
The IRS may impose a penalty, addition to tax, and additional amount with respect to any imputed underpayment determined under this section in accordance with section 6233(a)(3) (penalties determined from the reviewed year). In addition, the IRS may impose a penalty, addition to tax, and additional amount with respect to a failure to pay any imputed underpayment on the date an AAR is filed in accordance with section 6233(b)(3) (penalties with respect to the adjustment year return). Interest on an imputed underpayment is determined under chapter 67 of the Internal Revenue Code for the period beginning on the date after the due date of the partnership return for the reviewed year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(8)) (determined without regard to extension) and ending on the date the AAR is filed. See § 301.6233(a)-1(b). In the case of any failure to pay an imputed underpayment on the date the AAR is filed, interest is determined in accordance with section 6233(b)(2) and § 301.6233(b)-1(c).

Coordination with chapters 3 and 4 of the Internal Revenue Code
—(i)
Coordination when partnership pays an imputed underpayment.
If a partnership pays an imputed underpayment resulting from adjustments requested in an AAR under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the rules in § 301.6241-6(b)(3) apply to treat the partnership as having paid the amount required to be withheld under chapter 3 or chapter 4 (as defined in § 301.6241-6(b)(2)).
(ii)
Coordination when partnership elects to have adjustments taken into account by reviewed year partners.
If a partnership elects under paragraph (c) of this section to have its reviewed year partners take into account adjustments requested in an AAR, the rules in § 301.6226-2(g)(3) apply to the partnership, and the rules in § 301.6226-3(f) apply to the reviewed year partners that take into account the adjustments pursuant to § 301.6227-3.
(c)
Election to have adjustments resulting in an imputed underpayment taken into account by reviewed year partners.
In lieu of paying an imputed underpayment under paragraph (b) of this section, the partnership may elect to
have each reviewed year partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)) take into account the adjustments requested in the AAR that are associated with such imputed underpayment in accordance with § 301.6227-3. A partnership makes an election under this paragraph (c) at the time the AAR is filed in accordance with the forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS. If the partnership makes a valid election in accordance with this paragraph (c), the partnership is not liable for, nor required to pay, the imputed underpayment to which the election relates. Rather, each reviewed year partner must take into account their share of the adjustments requested in the AAR that are associated with such imputed underpayment in accordance with § 301.6227-3. If an election is made under this paragraph (c) with respect to an imputed underpayment, modifications applied under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to such imputed underpayment are disregarded and all adjustments requested in the AAR that are associated with such imputed underpayment must be taken into account by each reviewed year partner in accordance with § 301.6227-3.
(d)
Adjustments not resulting in an imputed underpayment.
If any adjustments requested in an AAR are adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment (as determined under paragraph (a) of this section), the partnership must furnish statements to each reviewed year partner and file such statements with the IRS in accordance with § 301.6227-1. Each reviewed year partner must take into account its share of the adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment requested in the AAR in accordance with § 301.6227-3.

—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a reviewed year partner that is furnished a statement described in paragraph (a) of this section must treat the statement as if it were issued under section 6226(a)(2) and, on or before the due date for the reporting year must report and pay the additional reporting year tax (as defined in § 301.6226-3(a)), if any, determined after taking into account that partner's share of the adjustments requested in the AAR in accordance with § 301.6226-3. A reviewed year partner may, in accordance with § 301.6226-3(a), reduce chapter 1 tax for the reporting year where the additional reporting year tax is less than zero. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the rule under § 301.6226-3(c)(3) (regarding the increased rate of interest) does not apply. Nothing in this section entitles any partner to a refund of tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (chapter 1 tax) to which such partner is not entitled. For instance, a partnership-partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(7)) may not claim a refund with respect to its share of any adjustment.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b) of this section.
(i)
Example 1.
In 2022, partner A, an individual, received a statement described in paragraph (a) of this section from Partnership with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year. Both A and Partnership are calendar year taxpayers and A is not claiming any refundable tax credit in 2020. The only adjustment shown on the statement is an increase in ordinary loss. Taking into account the adjustment, A determines that his additional reporting year tax for 2022 (the reporting year) is -$100 (that is, a reduction of $100.) A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 (without regard to any additional reporting year tax) is $150. Applying the rules in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 is reduced to $50 ($150 chapter 1 tax without regard to the additional reporting year tax plus -$100 additional reporting year tax).
(ii)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, except A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 (without regard to any additional reporting year tax) is $75. Applying the rules in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 is reduced by the -$100 of additional reporting year tax. Accordingly, A's chapter 1 tax for 2022 is -$25 ($75 chapter 1 tax without regard to any additional reporting year tax plus -$100 of additional reporting year tax), A owes no chapter 1 tax for 2022, and A may make a claim for refund with respect to any overpayment.
(c)
Reviewed year partners that are pass-through partners
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if a statement described in paragraph (a) of this section (including a statement described in this paragraph (c)(1)) is furnished to a reviewed year partner that is a pass-through partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(5)), the pass-through partner must take into account the adjustments reflected on that statement in accordance with § 301.6226-3(e) by treating the partnership that filed the AAR as the partnership that made an election under § 301.6226-1. A pass-through partner that furnishes statements in accordance with § 301.6226-3(e)(3) must provide the information described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section in lieu of the information described in § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(iii) on the statements the pass-through partner furnishes to its partners. A pass-through partner that computes and pays an imputed underpayment in accordance with § 301.6226-3(e)(4)(iii) may not apply any modifications to the amount of imputed underpayment. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the statement furnished to the pass-through partner by the partnership filing the AAR is treated as if it were a statement issued under section 6226(a)(2) and described in § 301.6226-2.
(2)
Adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment.
If adjustments on a statement received by the pass-through partner under paragraph (a) or (c)(1) of this section do not result in an imputed underpayment for the pass-through partner (as described in § 301.6225-1(f)(1)), the pass-through partner must take the adjustments that do not result in an imputed underpayment into account in accordance with § 301.6226-3(e)(3). The pass-through partner must take such adjustments into account under this paragraph (c)(2) even in situations where the pass-through partner pays an imputed underpayment in accordance with § 301.6226-3(e)(4)(iii). The pass-through partner must provide the information described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section in lieu of the information described in § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(iii) on the statements the pass-through partner furnishes to its affected partners (as defined in § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(i)).
(3)
Contents of statements.
Each statement described in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section must include the following correct information—
(i) The name and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the partnership that filed the AAR with respect to the adjustments reflected on the statements described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;
(ii) The adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)) of the partnership described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section;
(iii) The extended due date for the return for the adjustment year of the partnership described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section (as described in § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(ii));
(iv) The date on which the partnership described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of
this section furnished its statements required under § 301.6227-1(d);
(v) The name and TIN of the partnership that furnished the statement to the pass-through partner if different from the partnership described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section;
(vi) The name and TIN of the pass-through partner;
(vii) The pass-through partner's taxable year to which the adjustments set forth in the statement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section relate;
(viii) The name and TIN of the affected partner to whom the statement is being furnished;
(ix) The current or last address of the affected partner that is known to the pass-through partner;
(x) The affected partner's share of items as originally reported to such partner under section 6031(b) and, if applicable, section 6227, for the taxable year to which the adjustments reflected on the statement furnished to the pass-through partner relate;
(xi) The affected partner's share of partnership adjustments determined under § 301.6227-1(e)(2) as if the affected partner were the reviewed year partner and the partnership were the pass-through partner;
(xii) Any other information required by forms, instructions, and other guidance prescribed by the IRS.
(4)
Affected partners must take into account the adjustments.
A statement furnished to an affected partner in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section is to be treated by the affected partner as if it were a statement described in paragraph (a) of this section. The affected partner must take into account its share of the adjustments reflected on such a statement in accordance with this section by treating references to “reviewed year partner” as “affected partner.” When taking into account the adjustments as described in § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(iv), the rules under § 301.6226-3(c)(3) (regarding the increased rate of interest) do not apply.
(d)
Applicability date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, this section applies to partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending after August 12, 2018.
(2)
Election under § 301.9100-22 in effect.

§ 301.6227(c)-1
Administrative adjustment request by the tax matters partner on behalf of the partnership.
(a)
In general.
A request for an administrative adjustment filed by the tax matters partner on behalf of the partnership shall be filed on the form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for that purpose in accordance with that form's instructions. Except as otherwise provided in that form's instructions, the request shall be—
(1) Filed with the service center where the original partnership return was filed (but, if the notice described in section 6223(a)(1) (beginning of an administrative proceeding) has already been mailed to the tax matters partner, the statement should be filed with the Internal Revenue Service office that mailed such notice);
(2) Signed by the tax matters partner; and
(3) Accompanied by revised schedules showing the effects of the proposed changes on each partner and an explanation of the changes.
(b)
Denied request for treatment as a substituted return remains administrative adjustment request.
An administrative adjustment request filed by the tax matters partner on behalf of the partnership for which substituted return treatment is requested but not granted remains an administrative adjustment request. Thus, for example, the tax matters partner may file suit under section 6228(a) if the Internal Revenue Service fails to take timely action on the request.
(c)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6227(b)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

(1) Be filed in duplicate, the original copy filed with the partner's amended income tax return (on which the partner computes the amount by which the partner's tax liability should be adjusted if the request is granted) and the other copy filed with the service center where the partnership return is filed (but, if the notice described in section 6223(a)(1) (beginning of an administrative proceeding) has already been mailed to the tax matters partner, the statement should be filed with the Internal Revenue Service office that mailed such notice);
(2) Identify the partner and the partnership by name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(3) Specify the partnership taxable year to which the administrative adjustment request applies;
(4) Relate only to partnership items; and
(5) Relate only to one partnership and one partnership taxable year.

§ 301.6229(b)-1
Extension by agreement.
(a)
In general.
Any partnership may authorize any person to extend the period described in section 6229(a) with respect to all partners by filing a statement to that effect with the service center where the partnership return is filed (but, if the notice described in section 6223(a)(1) (beginning of an administrative proceeding) has already been mailed to the tax matters partner, the statement should be filed with the Internal Revenue Service office that mailed such notice). The statement shall—
(1) Provide that it is an authorization for a person other than the tax matters partner to extend the assessment period with respect to all partners;
(2) Identify the partnership and the person being authorized by name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(3) Specify the partnership taxable year or years for which the authorization is effective; and

§ 301.6229(b)-2
Special rule with respect to debtors in title 11 cases.
(a)
In general.
Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, if an agreement is entered into under section 6229(b)(1)(B), and the agreement is signed by a person who would be the tax matters partner but for the fact that, at the time that the agreement is executed, the person is a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding under title 11 of the United States Code, such agreement shall be binding on all partners in the partnership unless the Internal Revenue Service has been notified of the bankruptcy proceeding in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)

(1) The Internal Revenue Service shall be notified of the bankruptcy proceeding of the tax matters partner in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 301.6223(c)-1.

§ 301.6229(c)(2)-1
Substantial omission of income.
(a)
Partnership return
—(1)
General rule.
(i) If any partnership omits from the gross income stated in its return an amount properly includible therein and that amount is described in clause (i) of section 6501(e)(1)(A), subsection (a) of section 6229 shall be applied by substituting “6 years” for “3 years.”
(ii) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the term
gross income,
as it relates to a trade or business, means the total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services, to the extent required to be shown on the return, without reduction for the cost of those goods or services.
(iii) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the term
gross income,
as it relates to any income other than from the sale of goods or services in a trade or business, has the same meaning as provided under section 61(a), and includes the total of the amounts received or accrued, to the extent required to be shown on the return. In the case of amounts received or accrued that relate to the disposition of property, and except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, gross income means the excess of the amount realized from the disposition of the property over the unrecovered cost or other basis of the property. Consequently, except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, an understated amount of gross income resulting from an overstatement of unrecovered cost or other basis constitutes an omission from gross income for purposes of section 6229(c)(2).
(iv) An amount shall not be considered as omitted from gross income if information sufficient to apprise the Commissioner of the nature and amount of the item is disclosed in the return, including any schedule or statement attached to the return.
(b)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years with respect to which the period for assessing tax was open on or after September 24, 2009.
[T.D. 9511, 75 FR 78898, Dec. 17, 2010]
§ 301.6229(e)-1
Information with respect to unidentified partner.
(a)
In general.
A partner who is not properly identified on the partnership return (including an indirect partner) remains an unidentified partner for purposes of section 6229(e) until identifying information is furnished as provided in § 301.6223(c)-1.
(b)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6229(e)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
[T.D. 8965, 66 FR 50555, Oct. 4, 2001]
§ 301.6229(f)-1
Special rule for partial settlement agreements.
(a)
In general.
If a partner enters into a settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the treatment of some of the partnership items or partnership-level determinations of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount in dispute for a partnership taxable year, but one or more other partnership items or determinations remain in dispute, the period of limitations for assessing any tax attributable to the settled items shall be determined as if such agreement had not been entered into.
(b)
Other items remaining in dispute.
Pursuant to section 6226(c), a partner is a party to a partnership-level judicial proceeding with respect to partnership items and partnership-level determinations of penalties, additions to tax or additional amounts. When a partner settles partnership items, the settled partnership items convert to nonpartnership items under section 6231(b)(1)(C) and will not be subject to
any future or pending partnership-level proceeding pursuant to section 6226(d)(1). The remaining unsettled partnership items, as well as any unsettled penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item (regardless of whether the partnership item to which it relates has been settled), however, will remain subject to determination under partnership-level administrative and judicial procedures. Consequently, any remaining unsettled items, including any unsettled penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item, will be deemed to remain in dispute. Thus, the period for assessing any tax attributable to the settled items will be governed by the period for assessing any tax attributable to the remaining unsettled items.
(c)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6229(f)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

(1) State that it is a request that a correction not be made under section 6230(b);
(2) Identify the partnership and the partner filing the request by name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(3) Be signed by the partner filing the request; and

Tax matters partner required to furnish names.
(a)
In general.
If a notice of the beginning of an administrative proceeding is mailed to the tax matters partner with respect to any partnership taxable year, the tax matters partner shall furnish to the Internal Revenue Service office that issued the notice the name, address, profits interest, and taxpayer identification number of each person who was a partner in the partnership at any time during that taxable year if that information was not provided on the partnership return filed for that year.
(b)
Revised or additional information.
If the tax matters partner discovers that any information furnished to the Internal Revenue Service on the partnership return or under paragraph (a) of this section was incorrect or incomplete, the tax matters partner shall furnish revised or additional information to the Internal Revenue Service within 15 days of discovering that the information furnished to the Internal Revenue Service was incorrect or incomplete.
(c)
Information required with respect to indirect partners.
The requirements of this section for identifying information apply with respect to indirect partners to the extent that the tax matters partner has such information.

§ 301.6231-1
Notice of proceedings and adjustments.
(a)
Notices to which this section applies.
In the case of any administrative proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter C of chapter 63), including an administrative proceeding with respect to an administrative adjustment request (AAR) filed by a partnership under section 6227, the following notices must be mailed to the partnership and the partnership representative (as described in section 6223 and § 301.6223-1)—
(1) Notice of any administrative proceeding initiated at the partnership level with respect to an adjustment of any partnership-related item (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)(ii)) for any partnership taxable year under subchapter C of chapter 63 (notice of administrative proceeding (NAP));
(2) Notice of any proposed partnership adjustment resulting from an administrative proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 (notice of proposed partnership adjustment (NOPPA)); and
(3) Notice of any final partnership adjustment resulting from an administrative proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 (notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA)).
(b)
Time for mailing notices
—(1)
Notice of proposed partnership adjustment.
A NOPPA is timely if it is mailed before the expiration of the period for making adjustments under section 6235(a)(1) (including any extensions under section 6235(b) and any special rules under section 6235(c)).
(2)
Notice of final partnership adjustment.
An FPA may not be mailed earlier than 270 days after the date on which the NOPPA is mailed unless the partnership agrees, in writing, with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to waive the 270-day period. See § 301.6225-2(c)(3)(iii) for the effect of a waiver under this paragraph (b)(2) on the 270-period for requesting a modification under section 6225(c). See § 301.6232-1(d)(2) for the rules regarding a waiver of the limitations on assessment under § 301.6232-1(c).
(c)
Last known address.
A notice described in paragraph (a) of this section is sufficient if mailed to the last known address of the partnership representative and the partnership (even if the partnership or partnership representative has terminated its existence).
(d)
Notice mailed to partnership representative
—(1)
In general.
A notice described in paragraph (a) of this section will be treated as mailed to the partnership representative if the notice is mailed to the partnership representative that is reflected in the IRS records as of the date the letter is mailed.
(2)
No partnership representative in effect.
In any case in which no partnership representative designation is in effect in accordance with § 301.6223-1(f), a notice described in paragraph (a) of this section mailed to “PARTNERSHIP REPRESENTATIVE” at the last known address of the partnership satisfies the requirements of this section.
(e)
Restrictions on additional FPAs after petition filed.
The IRS may mail more than one FPA to any partnership for any partnership taxable year. However, except in the case of fraud, malfeasance, or misrepresentation of a material fact, the IRS may not mail an FPA to a partnership with respect to a partnership taxable year after the partnership has filed a timely petition for readjustment under section 6234 with respect to an FPA issued with respect to such partnership taxable year.
(f)
Withdrawal of NAP or NOPPA.
The IRS may, without consent of the partnership, withdraw any NAP or NOPPA. Except as described in § 301.6223-1(d)(2) and (e)(2), if the IRS withdraws a NAP or NOPPA under this paragraph (f), the NAP or NOPPA is treated as if it were never issued, and the withdrawn NAP or NOPPA has no effect for purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63. For instance, if the IRS withdraws a NAP with respect to a partnership taxable year, the limitation under § 301.6222-1(c)(5) regarding inconsistent treatment, and the prohibition under section 6227(c) on filing an AAR, after the mailing of a NAP no longer applies with respect to such taxable year.
(g)
Rescission of FPA.
The IRS may, with the consent of the partnership, rescind any FPA. An FPA that is rescinded is not an FPA for purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63, and the partnership cannot bring a proceeding
under section 6234 with respect to such FPA.
(h)
Applicability date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, this section applies to partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending after August 12, 2018.
(2)
Election under § 301.9100-22 in effect.
This section applies to any partnership taxable year beginning after November 2, 2015, and before January 1, 2018, for which a valid election under § 301.9100-22 is in effect.

§ 301.6231(a)(1)-1
Exception for small partnerships.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of the exception for small partnerships under section 6231(a)(1)(B), the rules contained in this section shall apply.
(1)
10 or fewer.
The 10 or fewer limitation described in section 6231(a)(1)(B)(i) is applied to the number of natural persons, C corporations, and estates of deceased partners that were partners at any one time during the partnership taxable year. Thus, for example, a partnership that at no time during the taxable year had more than 10 partners may be treated as a small partnership even if, because of transfers of interests in the partnership, 11 or more natural persons, C corporations, or estates of deceased partners owned interests in the partnership for some portion of the taxable year. See section 1361(a)(2) for the definition of a
C corporation.
For purposes of section 6231(a)(1)(B) and this section, a husband and wife (and their estates) are treated as one person.
(2)
Pass-thru partner.
The exception provided in section 6231(a)(1)(B) does not apply to a partnership for a taxable year if any partner in the partnership during that taxable year is a pass-thru partner as defined in section 6231(a)(9). For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2), an estate shall not be treated as a pass-thru partner.
(3)
Determination made annually.
The determination of whether a partnership meets the requirements for the exception for small partnerships under section 6231(a)(1)(B) and this paragraph (a) shall be made with respect to each partnership taxable year. Thus, a partnership that does not qualify as a small partnership in one taxable year may qualify as a small partnership in another taxable year if the requirements for the exception under section 6231(a)(1)(B) and this paragraph (a) are met with respect to that other taxable year.
(b)
Election to have subchapter C of chapter 63 apply
—(1)
In general.
Any partnership that meets the requirements set forth in section 6231(a)(1)(B) and paragraph (a) of this section (relating to the exception for small partnerships) may elect under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to have the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code apply with respect to that partnership.
(2)
Method of election.
A partnership shall make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section by attaching a statement to the partnership return for the first taxable year for which the election is to be effective. The statement shall be identified as an election under section 6231(a)(1)(B)(ii), shall be signed by all persons who were partners of that partnership at any time during the partnership taxable year to which the return relates, and shall be filed at the time (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing) and place prescribed for filing the partnership return. However, for any partnership taxable year for which the due date of the return (determined without regard to extensions) is before January 2, 2002, the partnership may file the statement described in the preceding sentence on or before the date which is one year before the date specified in section 6229(a) for the expiration of the period of limitations with respect to that partnership (determined with regard to extensions of that period under section 6229(b)).
(3)
Years covered by election.
The election shall be effective for the partnership taxable year to which the return relates and all subsequent partnership taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Commissioner.
(c)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4,

[T.D. 8965, 66 FR 50556, Oct. 4, 2001]
§ 301.6231(a)(2)-1
Persons whose tax liability is determined indirectly by partnership items.
(a)
Spouse filing joint return with individual holding a separate interest
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a), a spouse who files a joint return with an individual holding a separate interest in the partnership shall be treated as a partner for purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, the spouse who files a joint return with a partner will be permitted to participate in administrative and judicial proceedings.
(2)
Counting rules.
A spouse who files a joint return with an individual holding a separate interest in the partnership shall not be counted as a partner for purposes of applying section 6223(b) (relating to special rules for partnerships with more than 100 partners) and section 6231(a)(1)(B) (relating to the exception for small partnerships).
(3)
Notice rules
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, for purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code, a spouse who files a joint return with an individual holding a separate interest in the partnership shall be treated as receiving any notice received by the individual holding the separate interest.
(ii)
Spouse identified on partnership return or by statement.
Paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section shall not apply to a spouse who files a joint return with an individual holding a separate interest in the partnership if that spouse—
(A) Is identified on the partnership return; or
(B) Is identified as a partner entitled to notice as provided in § 301.6223(c)-1(b).
(4)
Conversion of partnership items
—(i)
Individual holding a separate interest.
A spouse who files a joint return with an individual holding a separate interest in the partnership shall cease to be treated as a partner in the partnership under paragraph (a)(1) of this section upon the conversion of the partnership items of the individual holding the separate interest in the partnership to nonpartnership items pursuant to section 6231(b). If each spouse holds a separate interest in the partnership, the previous sentence shall be applied separately with respect to each partnership interest.
(ii)
Spouse who files a joint return with an individual holding a separate interest in the partnership.
A spouse who files a joint return with an individual holding a separate interest in the partnership shall cease to be treated as a partner in the partnership under paragraph (a)(1) of this section upon the occurrence of an event that would convert the partnership items of the spouse to nonpartnership items if the spouse were the owner of a separate interest.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (a)(4) of this section:

# Example 1.
Husband owns a separate interest in ABC partnership and files a joint return with Wife. Husband files for bankruptcy. Pursuant to § 301.6231(c)-7, upon filing for bankruptcy, the partnership items of the debtor convert to nonpartnership items. Thus, Husband's partnership items converted to nonpartnership items upon the filing of Husband's bankruptcy petition. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, Wife is no longer treated as a partner of ABC partnership as of the date the partnership items of Husband converted to nonpartnership items.

# Example 2.
Wife owns a separate interest in XYZ partnership and files a joint return with Husband. Husband files for bankruptcy. Because the filing of the bankruptcy petition by Husband is an event that would convert Husband's partnership items to nonpartnership items if Husband were the owner of a separate interest, Husband shall no longer be treated as a partner as of the filing of the bankruptcy petition. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, the partnership items of Wife are not affected by Husband's bankruptcy.
(5)
Cross-reference.
See § 301.6231(a)(12)-1 for special rules relating to spouses holding a joint interest in a partnership.
(b)
Shareholder of C corporation.
A shareholder of a C corporation (as defined in section 1361(a)(2)) is not a partner in a partnership merely because the C corporation is a partner in that partnership.
(c)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001.
For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(a)(2)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

§ 301.6231(a)(3)-1
Partnership items.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the following items which are required to be taken into account for the taxable year of a partnership under subtitle A of the Code are more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level and, therefore, are partnership items:
(1) The partnership aggregate and each partner's share of each of the following:
(i) Items of income, gain loss, deduction, or credit of the partnership;
(ii) Expenditures by the partnership not deductible in computing its taxable income (for example, charitable contributions);
(iii) Items of the partnership which may be tax preference items under section 57(a) for any partner;
(iv) Income of the partnership exempt from tax;
(v) Partnership liabilities (including determinations with respect to the amount of the liabilities, whether the liabilities are nonrecourse, and changes from the preceding taxable year); and
(vi) Other amounts determinable at the partnership level with respect to partnership assets, investments, transactions and operations necessary to enable the partnership or the partners to determine—
(A) The investment credit determined under section 46(a);
(B) Recapture under section 47 of the investment credit;
(C) Amounts at risk in any activity to which section 465 applies;
(D) The depletion allowance under section 613A with respect to oil and gas wells; and
(E) The application of section 751 (a) and (b);
(2) Guaranteed payments;
(3) Optional adjustments to the basis of partnership property pursuant to an election under section 754 (including necessary preliminary determinations, such as the determination of a transferee partner's basis in a partnership interest); and
(4) Items relating to the following transactions, to the extent that a determination of such items can be made from determinations that the partnership is required to make with respect to an amount, the character of an amount, or the percentage interest of a partner in the partnership, for purposes of the partnership books and records or for purposes of furnishing information to a partner:
(i) Contributions to the partnership;
(ii) Distributions from the partnership; and
(iii) Transactions to which section 707(a) applies (including the application of section 707(b)).
(b)
Factors that affect the determination of partnership items.
The term “partnership item” includes the accounting practices and the legal and factual determinations that underlie the determination of the amount, timing, and characterization of items of income, credit, gain, loss, deduction, etc. Examples of these determinations are: The partnership's method of accounting, taxable year, and inventory method; whether an election was made by the partnership; whether partnership property is a capital asset, section 1231 property, or inventory; whether an item is currently deductible or must be capitalized; whether partnership activities have been engaged in with the intent to make a profit for purposes of section 183; and whether the partnership qualifies for the research and development credit under section 30.
(c)
Illustrations
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (c) illustrates the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The determinations illustrated in this paragraph (c) that the partnership is required to make are not exhaustive; there may be additional determinations that the partnership is required to make which relate to a transaction listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The critical element is that the partnership needs to make a determination with respect to a matter for the purposes stated; failure by the partnership actually to make a determination (for example, because it does not maintain proper books and records)
does not prevent an item from being a partnership item.
(2)
Contributions.
For purposes of its books and records, or for purposes of furnishing information to a partner, the partnership needs to determine:
(i) The character of the amount received from a partner (for example, whether it is a contribution, a loan, or a repayment of a loan);
(ii) The amount of money contributed by a partner;
(iii) The applicability of the investment company rules of section 721(b) with respect to a contribution; and
(iv) The basis to the partnership of contributed property (including necessary preliminary determinations, such as the partner's basis in the contributed property).
To the extent that a determination of an item relating to a contribution can be made from these and similar determinations that the partnership is required to make, therefore, that item is a partnership item. To the extent that that determination requires other information, however, that item is not a partnership item. For example, it may be necessary to determine whether contribution of the property causes recapture by the contributing partner of the investment credit under section 47 in certain circumstances in which that determination is irrelevant to the partnership.
(3)
Distributions.
For purposes of its books and records, or for purposes of furnishing information to a partner, the partnership needs to determine:
(i) The character of the amount transferred to a partner (for example, whether it is a distribution, a loan, or a repayment of a loan);
(ii) The amount of money distributed to a partner;
(iii) The adjusted basis to the partnership of distributed property; and
(iv) The character of partnership property (for example, whether an item is inventory or a capital asset).
To the extent that a determination of an item relating to a distribution can be made from these and similar determinations that the partnership is required to make, therefore, that item is a partnership item. To the extent that that determination requires other information, however, that item is not a partnership item. Such other information would include those factors used in determining the partner's basis for the partnership interest that are not themselves partnership items, such as the amount that the partner paid to acquire the partnership interest from a transferor partner if that transfer was not covered by an election under section 754.
(4)
Transactions to which section 707 (a) applies.
For purposes of its books and records, the partnership needs to determine:
(i) The amount transferred from the partnership to a partner or from a partner to the partnership in any transaction to which section 707(a) applies;
(ii) The character of such an amount (for example, whether or not it is a loan; in the case of amounts paid over time for the purchase of an asset, what portion is interest); and
(iii) The percentage of the capital interests and profits interests in the partnership owned by each partner.
To the extent that a determination of an item relating to a transaction to which section 707(a) applies can be made from these and similar determinations that the partnership is required to make, therefore, that item is a partnership item. To the extent that that determination requires other information, however, that item is not a partnership item. An example of such other information is the cost to the partner of goods sold to the partnership.
(d)
Effective date.
This section shall apply with respect to partnership taxable years beginning after September 3, 1982. This section shall also apply with respect to any partnership taxable year ending after September 3, 1982, if with respect to that year there is an agreement entered into pursuant to section 407(a)(3) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.
[T.D. 8082, 51 FR 13214, Apr. 18, 1986; 51 FR 19062, May 27, 1986]
§ 301.6231(a)(5)-1
Definition of affected item.
(a)
In general.
The term
affected item
means any item to the extent such item is affected by a partnership item. It includes items unrelated to the
items reflected on the partnership return (for example, an item, such as the threshold for the medical expense deduction under section 213, that varies if there is a change in an individual partner's adjusted gross income).
(b)
Basis in a partner's partnership interest.
The basis of a partner's partnership interest is an affected item to the extent it is not a partnership item.
(c)
At-risk limitation.
The application of the at-risk limitation under section 465 to a partner with respect to a loss incurred by a partnership is an affected item to the extent it is not a partnership item.
(d)
Passive losses.
The application of the passive loss rules under section 469 to a partner with respect to a loss incurred by a partnership is an affected item to the extent it is not a partnership item.
(e)
Penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount
—(1)
In general.
The term
affected item
includes any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount provided by subchapter A of chapter 68 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to the extent provided in this paragraph (e).
(2)
Penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount without floor.
If a penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that does not contain a floor (that is, a threshold amount of underpayment or understatement necessary before the imposition of the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount) is imposed on a partner as the result of an adjustment to a partnership item, the term
affected item
shall include the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount computed with reference to the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the partnership item adjustment(s) to which the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount applies.
(3)
Penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount containing floor
—(i)
Floor exceeded prior to adjustment.
If a partner would have been subject to a penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that contains a floor in the absence of an adjustment to a partnership item (that is, the partner's understatement or underpayment exceeded the floor even without an adjustment to a partnership item) the term
affected item
shall include only the portion of the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount computed with reference to the partnership item (or affected item) adjustments.
(ii)
Floor not exceeded prior to adjustment.
In the case of a penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that contains a floor, if the taxpayer's understatement or underpayment does not exceed the floor prior to an adjustment to a partnership item but does so after such adjustment, the term
affected item
shall include the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount computed with reference to the entire underpayment or understatement to which the penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount applies.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a partner of P, had an aggregate underpayment of $1,000 of which $100 is attributable to an adjustment to partnership items. A is negligent in reporting the partnership items. The accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 for negligence computed with reference to the $100 underpayment attributable to the partnership item adjustments is an affected item.

# Example 2.
B, a partner of P, understated B's income tax liability attributable to nonpartnership items by $6,000. An adjustment to a partnership item resulting from a partnership proceeding increased B's income tax by an additional $2,000. Prior to the adjustment, B would have been subject to the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 for a substantial understatement of income tax with respect to the $6,000 understatement attributable to nonpartnership items. The portion of the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 computed with reference to the $2,000 understatement attributable to partnership items to which the accuracy-related penalty applies is an affected item. The portion of the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 computed with reference to the $6,000 pre-existing understatement is not an affected item.

# Example 3.
C, a partner in partnership P, understated C's income tax liability attributable to nonpartnership items by $4,000. As a result of an adjustment to partnership items, that understatement is increased to $10,000. Prior to the adjustment, C would not have been subject to the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 for a substantial understatement of income tax. The accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 computed with reference to the entire $10,000 understatement to which the accuracy-related penalty applies is an affected item.
(f)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(a)(5)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
[T.D. 8965, 66 FR 50557, Oct. 4, 2001]
§ 301.6231(a)(6)-1
Computational adjustments.
(a)
Changes in a partner's tax liability
—(1)
In general.
A change in the tax liability of a partner to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code is made through a computational adjustment. A computational adjustment includes a change in tax liability that reflects a change in an affected item where that change is necessary to properly reflect the treatment of a partnership item, or any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. However, if a change in a partner's tax liability cannot be made without making one or more partner-level determinations, that portion of the change in tax liability attributable to the partner-level determinations shall be made under the deficiency procedures (as described in subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code), except for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.
(2)
Affected items that do not require partner-level determinations.
Changes in a partner's tax liability with respect to affected items that do not require partner-level determinations (such as the threshold amount of medical deductions under section 213 that changes as the result of determinations made at the partnership level) are computational adjustments that are directly assessed. When making computational adjustments, the Internal Revenue Service may assume that amounts the partner reported on the partner's individual return include all amounts reported to the partner by the partnership (on the Schedule K-1s attached to the partnership's original return), absent contrary notice to the Internal Revenue Service (for example, a “Notice of Inconsistent Treatment” pursuant to § 301.6222(a)-2(c)). Such an assumption by the Internal Revenue Service does not constitute a partner-level determination. Moreover, substituting redetermined partnership items for the partner's previously reported partnership items (including partnership items included in carryover amounts) does not constitute a partner-level determination where the Internal Revenue Service otherwise accepts, for the sole purpose of determining the computational adjustment, all nonpartnership items (including, for example, nonpartnership item components of carryover amounts) as reported.
(3)
Affected items that require partner-level determinations.
Changes in a partner's tax liability with respect to affected items that require partner-level determinations (such as a partner's at-risk amount to the extent it depends upon the source from which the partner obtained the funds that the partner contributed to the partnership) are computational adjustments that are subject to the deficiency procedures. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item is not subject to the deficiency procedures, but rather may be directly assessed as part of the computational adjustment that is made following the partnership proceeding, based on determinations in that proceeding, regardless of whether any partner-level determinations may be required.
(b)
Interest.
A computational adjustment includes any interest due with respect to any underpayment or overpayment of tax attributable to adjustments to reflect properly the treatment of partnership items.
(c)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(a)(6)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

§ 301.6231(a)(7)-1
Designation or selection of tax matters partner.
(a)
In general.
A partnership may designate a partner as its tax matters partner for a specific taxable year only as provided in this section. Similarly,
the designation of a partner as the tax matters partner for a specific taxable year may be terminated only as provided in this section. If a partnership does not designate a general partner as the tax matters partner for a specific taxable year, or if the designation is terminated without the partnership designating another general partner as the tax matters partner, the tax matters partner is the partner determined under this section.
(b)
Person who may be designated tax matters partner
—(1)
General requirement.
A person may be designated as the tax matters partner of a partnership for a taxable year only if that person—
(i) Was a general partner in the partnership at some time during the taxable year for which the designation is made; or
(ii) Is a general partner in the partnership as of the time the designation is made.
(2)
Limitation on designation of tax matters partner who is not a United States person.
If any United States person would be eligible under paragraph (a) of this section to be designated as the tax matters partner of a partnership for a taxable year, no person who is not a United States person may be designated as the tax matters partner of the partnership for that year without the consent of the Commissioner. For the definition of
United States person,

The partnership may designate a tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year on the partnership return for that taxable year in accordance with the instructions for that form.
(d)
Certification by current tax matters partner of selection of successor.
If a partner properly designated as the tax matters partner of a partnership for a partnership taxable year under this section certifies that another partner has been selected as the tax matters partner of the partnership for that taxable year, that other partner is thereby designated as the tax matters partner for that year. The current tax matters partner shall make the certification by filing with the service center with which the partnership return is filed a statement that—
(1) Identifies the partnership, the partner filing the statement, and the successor tax matters partner by name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(2) Specifies the partnership taxable year to which the designation relates;
(3) Declares that the partner filing the statement has been properly designated as the tax matters partner of the partnership for the partnership taxable year and that that designation is in effect immediately before the filing of the statement;
(4) Certifies that the other named partner has been selected as the tax matters partner of the partnership for that taxable year in accordance with the partnership's procedure for making that selection; and
(5) Is signed by the partner filing the statement.

(2) Specify the partnership taxable year to which the designation relates;
(3) Declare that it is a designation of a tax matters partner for the taxable year specified; and
(4) Be signed by persons who were general partners at the close of the year and were shown on the return for that year to hold more than 50 percent of the aggregate interest in partnership profits held by all general partners as of the close of that taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), all limited partnership interests held by general partners shall be included in determining the aggregate interest in partnership profits held by such general partners.
(f)
Designation by partners with majority interest under certain circumstances
—(1)
In general.
A tax matters partner may be designated for a partnership taxable year under this paragraph (f) only if, at the time the designation is made, each partner who was a general
partner at the close of such partnership taxable year is described in one or more of paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section as follows:
(i) The general partner is dead, or, if the general partner is an entity, has been liquidated or dissolved;
(ii) The general partner has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be no longer capable of managing his or her person or estate;

(g)
Designation of alternate tax matters partner.
If an individual is designated as the tax matters partner of a partnership under paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the document by which that individual is designated may also designate an alternate tax matters partner who will become tax matters partner upon the occurrence of one or more of the events described in paragraph (l)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section. The person designated as the alternate tax matters partner becomes the tax matters partner as of the time the designation of the tax matters partner is terminated under paragraph (l)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section. The designation of a person as the alternate tax matters partner shall have no effect in any other case.
(h)
Prior designations superseded.
A designation of a tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section shall supersede all prior designations of a tax matters partner for that year, including a prior designation of an alternate tax matters partner under paragraph (g) of this section.
(i)
Resignation of designated tax matters partner.
A person designated as the tax matters partner of a partnership under this section may resign at any time by a written statement to that effect. The statement shall specify the partnership taxable year to which the resignation relates and shall identify the partnership and the tax matters partner by name, address, and taxpayer identification number. The statement shall also be signed by the resigning tax matters partner and shall be filed with the service center with which the partnership return was filed.
(j)
Revocation of designation.
The partnership may revoke the designation of the tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year at any time after the filing of a partnership return for that taxable year by filing a statement with the service center with which the partnership return was filed. The statement shall—
(1) Identify by name, address, and taxpayer identification number the partnership and the general partner whose designation as tax matters partner is being revoked;
(2) Specify the partnership taxable year to which the revocation relates;
(3) Declare that it is a revocation of a designation of the tax matters partner for the taxable year specified; and
(4) Be signed by the persons described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, or, if at the time that the revocation is made, each partner who was a general partner at the close of the partnership taxable year to which the revocation relates is described in one or more of paragraphs (f)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section, by the persons described in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section.
(k)
When designation, etc., becomes effective
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, a designation, resignation,
or revocation provided for in this section becomes effective on the day that the statement required by the applicable paragraph of this section is filed.
(2)
Notice of proceeding mailed.
If a notice of beginning of an administrative proceeding with respect to a partnership taxable year is mailed before the date on which a statement of designation, resignation, or revocation provided for in this section with respect to that taxable year is filed, the Service is not required to give effect to such designation, resignation, or revocation until 30 days after the statement is filed.
(l)
Termination of designation
—(1)
In general.
A designation of a tax matters partner for a taxable year under this section shall remain in effect until—
(i) The death of the designated tax matters partner;
(ii) An adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction that the individual designated as the tax matters partner is no longer capable of managing the individual's person or estate;
(iii) The liquidation or dissolution of the tax matters partner, if the tax matters partner is an entity;
(iv) The partnership items of the tax matters partner become nonpartnership items under section 6231(c) (relating to special enforcement areas); or
(v) The day on which—
(A) The resignation of the tax matters partner under paragraph (i) of this section;
(B) A subsequent designation under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section; or
(C) A revocation of the designation under paragraph (j) of this section becomes effective.
(2)
Actions by the tax matters partner before termination of designation.
The termination of the designation of a partner as the tax matters partner under paragraph (l)(1) of this section does not affect the validity of any action taken by that partner as tax matters partner before the designation is terminated. For example, if that tax matters partner had previously consented to an extension of the period for assessments under section 6229(b)(1)(B), that extension remains valid even after termination of the designation.
(m)
Tax matters partner where no partnership designation made
—(1)
In general.
The tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year shall be determined under this paragraph (m) if—
(i) The partnership has not designated a tax matters partner under this section for that taxable year; or
(ii) The partnership has designated a tax matters partner under this section for that taxable year, that designation has been terminated under paragraph (l)(1) of this section, and the partnership has not made a subsequent designation under this section for that taxable year.
(2)
General partner having the largest profits interest is the tax matters partner.
The tax matters partner for any partnership taxable year to which this paragraph (m) applies is the general partner having the largest profits interest in the partnership at the close of that taxable year (or where there is more than one such partner, the one of such partners whose name would appear first in an alphabetical listing). For purposes of this paragraph (m)(2), all limited partnership interests held by a general partner shall be included in determining that general partner's profits interest in the partnership. For purposes of this paragraph (m)(2), the general partner with the largest profits interest is determined based on the year-end profits interests reported on the Schedules K-1 filed with the partnership income tax return for the taxable year for which the determination is being made.
(3)
Termination of designation.
A designation of a tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year under this paragraph (m) shall remain in effect until the earlier of the occurrence of one or more of the events described in paragraphs (l)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section or the day on which a designation under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section becomes effective. If a designation of a tax matters partner for a partnership taxable year is terminated under this paragraph (m)(3) and the partnership has not subsequently designated a tax matters partner for that taxable year under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the tax matters partner for that taxable year shall be determined under paragraph (m)(2) of
this section, and, for purposes of applying paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the general partner whose designation was so terminated shall be treated as having no profits interest in the partnership for that taxable year.
(n)
Selection of tax matters partner by Commissioner when impracticable to apply the largest-profits-interest rule.
If the partnership has not designated a tax matters partner under this section for the taxable year and it is impracticable (as determined under paragraph (o) of this section) to apply the largest-profits-interest rule of paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the Commissioner will select a tax matters partner as described in paragraph (p) of this section.
(o)
Impracticability of largest-profits-interest rule.
It is impracticable to apply the largest-profits-interest rule of paragraph (m)(2) of this section if, on the date the rule is applied, any one of the following three conditions is met:
(1)
General partner with the largest profits interest is not apparent.

When the general partner with the largest profits interest is not apparent.
If it is impracticable under paragraph (o)(1) of this section to apply the largest-profits-interest rule of paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the Commissioner will select (in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in paragraph (r) of this section) as the tax matters partner any person who was a general partner at any time during the taxable year under examination.

The Commissioner will notify, within 30 days of the selection, the partner selected, the partnership, and all partners required to receive notice under section 6223(a) of the selection of the tax matters partner, effective as of the date specified in the notice.
(3)
When the general partner with the largest profits interest is disqualified
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (p)(3)(ii) of this section, if it is impracticable under paragraph (o)(3) of this section to apply the largest-profits-interest rule of paragraph (m)(2) of this section, the Commissioner will treat each general partner who fits the criteria contained in paragraph (o)(3) of this section as having no profits interest in the partnership for the taxable year and will select (in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in paragraph (r) of this section) a tax matters partner from the remaining persons who were general partners at any time during the taxable year.
(ii)
Partner selected if no general partner may be selected.
If all general partners during the taxable year either are treated as having no profits interest in the partnership for the taxable year under paragraph (m)(3) of this section (concerning termination of a designation under the largest-profits-interest rule) or are described in paragraph (o)(3) of this section (general partner with the largest profits interest is disqualified), the Commissioner will select a partner (including a general or limited partner) as the tax matters partner in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraph (q) of this section. The Commissioner will notify both the partner selected and the partnership of the selection, effective as of the date specified in the notice.
(q)
Criteria for selecting a partner as tax matters partner
—(1)
In general.
The Commissioner will select a partner as the tax matters partner under paragraph (p) (2) or (3)(ii) of this section only if the partner was a partner in the partnership at the close of the taxable year under examination.
(2)
Criteria to be considered.
The Commissioner may consider the following criteria in selecting a partner as the tax matters partner:
(i) The general knowledge of the partner in tax matters and the administrative operation of the partnership.
(ii) The partner's access to the books and records of the partnership.
(iii) The profits interest held by the partner.
(iv) The views of the partners having a majority interest in the partnership regarding the selection.
(v) Whether the partner is a partner of the partnership at the time the tax-matters-partner selection is made.
(vi) Whether the partner is a United States person (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30)).
(3)
Limited restriction on subsequent designation of a tax matters partner by the partnership.
For purposes of paragraphs (p) (2) and (3)(ii) of this section, the partnership cannot designate a partner who is not a general partner to serve as tax matters partner in lieu of a partner selected by the Commissioner.
(r)
Notification of partnership
—(1)
In general.
If the Commissioner selects a tax matters partner under the provisions of paragraph (p)(1) or (p)(3)(i) of this section, the Commissioner will notify, within 30 days of the selection, the partner selected, the partnership, and all partners required to receive notice under section 6223(a) of the selection of the tax matters partner, effective as of the date specified in the notice.
(2)
Limited opportunity for partnership to designate the tax matters partner.
(i) Before the Commissioner selects a tax matters partner under paragraphs (p) (1) and (3)(i) of this section, the Commissioner will notify the partnership by mail that, after 30 days from the date of the notice, the Commissioner will make a determination that it is impracticable to apply the largest-profits-interest rule of paragraph (m)(2) of this section and will select the tax matters partner unless a prior designation is made by the partnership. This delay in making the determination will permit the partnership to designate a tax matters partner under paragraph (e) of this section (designation by general partners with a majority interest) or paragraph (f) of this section (designation by partners with a majority interest under certain circumstances), thereby avoiding a selection made by the Commissioner.
(ii) During the 30-day period and prior to a tax-matters-partner designation by the partnership, the Commissioner will communicate with the partnership by sending all correspondence
or notices to “The Tax Matters Partner” in care of the partnership at the partnership's address.
(iii) Any subsequent designation of a tax matters partner by the partnership after the 30-day period will become effective as provided under paragraph (k)(2) of this section (concerning designations made after a notice of beginning of administrative proceeding is mailed).
(s)
Effective date.
This section applies to all designations, selections, and terminations of a tax matters partner occurring on or after December 23, 1996, except for paragraphs (p)(2) and (r)(1), that are applicable on or after October 4, 2001.

§ 301.6231(a)(12)-1
Special rules relating to spouses.
(a)
Spouses holding a joint interest
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, spouses holding a joint interest in a partnership shall be treated as separate partners for purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, both spouses may participate in administrative and judicial proceedings. The term
joint interest
includes tenancies in common, joint tenancies, tenancies by the entirety, and community property.
(2)
Identification of joint interest.
For purposes of this section, an interest shall be treated as a joint interest in a partnership only if both spouses are identified on the partnership return or are identified as partners entitled to notice as provided in § 301.6223(c)-1(b).
(3)
Failure to identify both spouses as partners.
If both spouses are not identified as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, then the partnership interest shall be treated as separately owned by the identified spouse.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (a)(3) of this section:

# Example.
Wife owns an interest in ABC Partnership and is identified on the Schedule K-1 of the partnership return. Wife and Husband live in a community property state. The partnership return of ABC partnership does not identify Husband, and Husband is not identified as a partner entitled to notice as provided in § 301.6223(c)-1(b). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the partnership interest of Wife shall be treated as separately owned by Wife.
(b)
Notice and counting rules
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for purposes
of applying section 6223 (relating to notice to partners of proceedings) and section 6231(a)(1)(B) (relating to the exception for small partnerships), spouses holding a joint interest in a partnership shall be treated as one partner. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service or the tax matters partner may send any required notice to either spouse.
(2)
Identified spouse entitled to notice.
For purposes of applying section 6223 (relating to notice to partners of proceeding) for a partnership taxable year, an individual who holds a joint interest in a partnership with a spouse who is entitled to notice under section 6223 shall be entitled to receive separate notice under section 6223 if such individual—
(i) Is identified as a partner on the partnership return for that taxable year; or
(ii) Is identified as a partner entitled to notice as provided in § 301.6223(c)-1(b).
(c)
Conversion of partnership items
—(1)
In general.
If spouses holding a joint interest in a partnership are treated as separate partners under this section, then section 6231(b) (relating to the conversion of partnership items) shall be applied separately to each spouse.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (c) of this section:

# Example.
Husband and Wife own a joint interest in XYZ Partnership. The partnership return identifies both spouses on the Schedule K-1. Under this section, each spouse is treated as a separate partner. If Wife enters into a settlement agreement, Wife's partnership items convert to nonpartnership items pursuant to section 6231(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, Wife no longer has the right to participate in the partnership proceeding subsequent to entering into the settlement agreement. Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, however, the partnership items of Husband are not affected by the conversion of the partnership items of Wife, and Husband continues to have the right to participate in the partnership proceeding. This result is the same regardless of whether the partnership items are reported on a joint return or on separate returns.
(d)
Cross-reference.
See § 301.6231(a)(2)-1(a) for special rules relating to spouses who file joint returns with individuals holding a separate interest in a partnership.
(e)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(a)(12)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

§ 301.6231(c)-1
Special rules for certain applications for tentative carryback and refund adjustments based on partnership losses, deductions, or credits.
(a)
Application subject to this section.
This section applies in the case of an application under section 6411 (relating to tentative carryback and refund adjustments) based on losses, deductions, or credits of a partnership if the Commissioner, or the Commissioner's delegate, determines, after review of the available relevant information, that it is highly likely that a person described in section 6700(a)(1) made, with respect to the partnership—
(1) A gross valuation overstatement; or
(2) A false or fraudulent statement with respect to the tax benefits to be secured by reason of holding an interest in the partnership that would be subject to a penalty under section 6700 (relating to penalty for promoting abusive tax shelters, etc.). This section applies only with respect to an application based upon the original reporting on the partner's income tax return of partnership losses, deductions, or credits. Thus, this section does not apply to a request for administrative adjustment under section 6227 through which a partner seeks to change the partner's reporting of partnership items on the partner's income tax return (or on an earlier request for administrative adjustment).
(b)
Determination of special enforcement area.
In the case of an application under section 6411 described in paragraph (a) of this section, precluding an assessment under section 6225 that would be permitted under section 6213(b)(3) (relating to assessments arising out of tentative carryback or refund adjustments) with respect to any amount applied, credited, or refunded
as a result of the application may encourage the proliferation of abusive tax shelter partnerships and make the eventual collection of taxes due more difficult. Consequently, the Secretary hereby determines that such applications present special enforcement considerations within the meaning of section 6231(c)(1)(E).
(c)
Assessment permitted under section 6213(b)(3).
Notwithstanding section 6225 (relating to restrictions on assessment with respect to partnership items), an assessment that would be permitted under section 6213(b)(3) with respect to any amount applied, credited, or refunded as a result of an application described in paragraph (a) of this section may be made before there is a final partnership-level determination with respect to the losses, deductions, or credits on which the application is based. As provided in section 6213(b)(1), the Internal Revenue Service shall mail notice of any such assessment to the partner filing the application. The notice shall also inform the partner of the partner's limited right to elect to treat items as nonpartnership items as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Limited right to elect to treat items as nonpartnership items
—(1)
In general.
A partner to whom the Internal Revenue Service mails a notice of suspension of action on a refund claim under paragraph (c) of this section may elect in accordance with this paragraph (d) to have all partnership items for the partnership taxable year in which the losses, deductions, or credits at issue arose treated as nonpartnership items.
(2)
Time and place of making election.
The election shall be made by filing a statement with the Internal Revenue Service office that mailed the notice of suspension. The statement may be filed at any time—
(i) After the date which is one year after the date on which the partnership return was filed for the partnership taxable year in which the items at issue arose; and
(ii) Before the date on which the Internal Revenue Service mails to the tax matters partner the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment for the partnership taxable year in which the items at issue arose. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), a partnership return filed before the last day prescribed by law for its filing (determined without regard to extensions) shall be treated as filed on the last day.
(3)
Contents of the statement.
The statement shall—
(i) Be clearly identified as an election to have partnership items treated as nonpartnership items because of notification of an assessment under section 6213(b)(3);
(ii) Identify the partnership by name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(iii) Identify the partner making the election by name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(iv) Specify the partnership taxable year to which the election applies; and
(v) Be signed by the partner making the election.
(e)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(c)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

§ 301.6231(c)-2
Special rules for certain refund claims based on losses, deductions, or credits from abusive tax shelter partnerships.
(a)
Claims subject to this section.
This section applies in the case of a claim for credit or refund based on losses, deductions or credits of a partnership if the Commissioner, or the Commissioner's delegate, determines, after review of available relevant information, that it is highly likely that a person described in section 6700(a)(1) made, with respect to the partnership—
(1) A gross valuation overstatement; or
(2) A false or fraudulent statement with respect to the tax benefits to be secured by reason of holding an interest in the partnership that would be subject to a penalty under section 6700 (relating to penalty for promoting abusive tax shelters, etc.). This section applies only with respect to a claim that is based upon the partner's original reporting on the partner's income tax return of partnership losses, deductions, or credits. Thus, this section does not apply to a request for administrative
adjustment under section 6227 through which a partner seeks to change the partner's reporting of partnership items on the partner's income tax return (or on an earlier request for administrative adjustment). For purposes of this section, any income tax return requesting a credit or refund shall be treated as a claim for a credit or refund.
(b)
Determination of special enforcement area.
Granting a claim for credit or refund described in paragraph (a) of this section may encourage the proliferation of abusive tax shelter partnerships and make the eventual collection of taxes more difficult. Consequently, the Secretary hereby determines that such claims present special enforcement considerations within the meaning of section 6231(c)(1)(E).
(c)
Action on refund claims suspended.
In the case of a claim described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service may mail to the partner filing the claim a notice stating that no action will be taken on the partner's claim until the completion of the partnership-level proceedings. The notice shall also inform the partner of the partner's limited right to elect to treat items as nonpartnership items as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Limited right to elect to treat items as nonpartnership items
—(1)
In general.
A partner to whom the Internal Revenue Service mails a notice of suspension under paragraph (c) of this section may elect in accordance with this paragraph (d) to have all partnership items for the partnership taxable year in which the losses, deductions, or credits at issue arose treated as nonpartnership items.
(2)
Time and place of making election.
The election shall be made by filing a statement with the Internal Revenue Service office that mailed the notice of suspension. The statement may be filed at any time—
(i) After the date which is one year after the date on which the partnership return was filed for the partnership taxable year in which the items at issue arose; and
(ii) Before the date on which the Internal Revenue Service mails to the tax matters partner the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment for the partnership taxable year in which the items at issue arose. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), a partnership return filed before the last day prescribed by law for its filing (determined without regard to extensions) shall be treated as filed on the last day.
(3)
Contents of the statement.
The statement shall—
(i) Be clearly identified as an election to have partnership items treated as nonpartnership items because of notification of suspension of action on a refund claim;
(ii) Identify the partnership by name, address, and taxpayer identification number;

(a)
In general.
A provision of §§ 301.6231(c)-4 through 301.6231(c)-8 shall not apply with respect to partnership items arising in a partnership taxable year if, as of the date on which those items would otherwise begin to be treated as nonpartnership items under that provision—
(1) A notice of final partnership administrative adjustment with respect to those items has been mailed to the tax matters partner; and
(2) Either—
(i) The period during which an action with respect to that final partnership administrative adjustment may be brought under section 6226 has expired and no such action has been brought; or

Termination and jeopardy assessment.
(a)
In general.
The treatment of items as partnership items with respect to a partner against whom an assessment of income tax under section 6851 (termination assessment) or section 6861 (jeopardy assessment) is made will interfere with the effective and efficient enforcement of the internal revenue laws. Accordingly, partnership items of such a partner arising in any partnership taxable year ending with or within the partner's taxable year for which an assessment of income tax under section 6851 or 6861 is made shall be treated as nonpartnership items as of the moment before such assessment is made.

Accordingly, partnership items of such a partner arising in any partnership taxable year ending on or before the last day of the latest taxable year of the partner to which the criminal investigation relates shall be treated as nonpartnership items as of the date on which the partner is notified that the partner is the subject of a criminal investigation and written notification is sent by the Internal Revenue Service that the partner's partnership items shall be treated as nonpartnership items. The partnership items of a partner who is notified that the partner is the subject of a criminal investigation shall not be treated as nonpartnership items under this section unless and until such partner is sent written notification from the Internal Revenue Service of such treatment.

Accordingly, partnership items of such a partner arising in any partnership taxable year ending on or before the last day of the taxable year of the partner for which a deficiency notice based upon an indirect method of proof of income is mailed to the partner shall be treated as nonpartnership items as of the date on which that deficiency notice is mailed to the partner.

Bankruptcy and receivership.
(a)
Bankruptcy.
The treatment of items as partnership items with respect to a partner named as a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding will interfere with the effective and efficient enforcement of the internal revenue laws. Accordingly, partnership items of such a partner arising in any partnership taxable year ending on or before the last day of the latest taxable year of the partner with respect to which the
United States could file a claim for income tax due in the bankruptcy proceeding shall be treated as nonpartnership items as of the date the petition naming the partner as debtor is filed in bankruptcy.
(b)
Receivership.
The treatment of items as partnership items with respect to a partner for whom a receiver has been appointed in any receivership proceeding before any court of the United States or of any State or the District of Columbia will interfere with the effective and efficient enforcement of the internal revenue laws. Accordingly, partnership items of such a partner arising in any partnership taxable year ending on or before the last day of the latest taxable year of the partner with respect to which the United States could file a claim for income tax due in the receivership proceeding shall be treated as nonpartnership items as of the date a receiver is appointed in any receivership proceeding before any court of the United States or of any State or the District of Columbia.

§ 301.6231(d)-1
Time for determining profits interest of partners for purposes of sections 6223(b) and 6231(a)(11).
(a)
Partner owns interest at close of year.
For purposes of section 6223(b) (relating to special rules for partnerships with more than 100 partners) and section 6231(a)(11) (relating to 5-percent groups), except as otherwise provided in this section, the profits interest held by a partner, directly or indirectly through one or more pass-thru partners, in a partnership (the source partnership) to which subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code applies shall be determined at the close of the source partnership's taxable year.
(b)
Partner does not own interest at close of year.
If the entire direct and indirect interest of a partner in a source partnership is terminated by virtue of a disposition by such partner of such interest (or by virtue of the disposition of an interest held by one or more pass-thru partners through which the partner holds an interest), then the profits interest of such partner in the source partnership shall be measured as of the moment before the disposition causing such termination. The preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to a termination if subsequent to such termination and before the close of the source partnership's taxable year the partner acquires a direct or indirect interest in the source partnership.
(c)
Disposition of last remaining portion of interest is disposition of entire interest.
If a partner (or a pass-thru partner through which a partner holds an interest) makes several partial dispositions of an interest in a source partnership during a taxable year of the source partnership, paragraph (b) of this section will apply with respect to the disposition which causes a termination of the partner's entire direct and indirect interest in the source partnership.
(d)
No profits interest in certain cases.
If—
(1) The interest of a partner in a partnership is entirely disposed of before the close of the taxable year of the partnership; and
(2) No items of the partnership for that taxable year are required to be taken into account by the partner, then that partner has no profits interest in the partnership for that taxable year.
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. Assume in all examples that there have been no reacquisitions prior to the close of the source partnership's taxable year. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
B holds an interest in partnership P through T, a pass-thru partner. P uses a fiscal year ending June 30 as P's taxable year; B and T use the calendar year as the taxable year. As of the close of P's taxable year ending June 30, 2002, T holds an interest in P and B holds an interest in P through T. The profits interest held by B in P through T for that year is determined as of June 30, 2002.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that B sold the entire interest that B held in P through T on November 5, 2001. The profits interest held by B in P through T for P's taxable year ending June 30, 2002, is determined as of the moment before the sale on November 5, 2001.

# Example 3.
C holds an interest in partnership P through T, a pass-thru partner. C, P, and T all use the calendar year as the taxable year. T disposes of T's interest in P on June 5, 2002. The profits interest held by C in P through T for 2002 is determined as of the moment before the disposition on June 5, 2002.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3,
except that C sold C's entire interest in T (and, therefore, C's entire interest that C held in P through T) on March 15, 2002. The profits interest held by C in P through T for 2002 is determined as of the moment before the sale on March 15, 2002.

# Example 5.
On January 1, 2002, D held a 2 percent profits interest in partnership P. Both D and P use the calendar year as the taxable year. On August 1, 2002, D transfers three-fourths of D's profits interest in P to E. On September 1, 2002, D sells D's remaining .5 percent profits interest in P to F. For purposes of sections 6223(b) and 6231(a)(11), D had a .5 percent profits interest in P for 2002.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 5,
except that on January 1, 2002, D also held a 1 percent profits interest in partnership P through T, a pass-thru partner which also uses the calendar year as the taxable year. In addition to the sale to E on August 1, 2002, D sold a portion of D's interest in T on December 1, 2002, such that after the sale, D held a .2 percent profits interest in P through T. D made no other transfers of interests in either P or T. For purposes of sections 6223(b) and 6231(a)(11), D had a .7 percent profits interest in P for 2002.
(f)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(d)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.

§ 301.6231(e)-1
Effect of a determination with respect to a nonpartnership item on the determination of a partnership item.
(a)
In general.
The determination of an item after it has become a nonpartnership item with respect to a partner is not controlling in the determination of that item with respect to other partners. Thus, for example, the determination by a court in a separate proceeding relating to a partner that a certain partnership expenditure was deductible does not bind either the Internal Revenue Service or the other partners in a later partnership or other proceeding.
(b)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(e)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
[T.D. 8965, 66 FR 50562, Oct. 4, 2001]
§ 301.6231(e)-2
Judicial decision not a bar to certain adjustments.
(a)
In general.
A court decision with respect to a partner's income tax liability attributable to nonpartnership items shall not be a bar to further proceedings with respect to that partner's income tax liability if that partner's partnership items become nonpartnership items after the appropriate time to include such nonpartnership items in the earlier court proceeding has passed. Thus, the Internal Revenue Service could issue a later deficiency notice for the same taxable year with respect to that partner or that partner could bring a refund suit with respect to those items that have become nonpartnership items.
(b)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(e)-2T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
[T.D. 8965, 66 FR 50562, Oct. 4, 2001]
§ 301.6231(f)-1
Disallowance of losses and credits in certain cases.
(a)
Application of section.
This section applies if—
(1) A partnership, whether domestic or foreign, that is required to file a return under section 6031 for a taxable year fails to file the return within the time prescribed; and
(2) At any time after the close of that taxable year, either—
(i) The tax matters partner of that partnership resides outside the United States; or
(ii) The books and records of that partnership are maintained outside the United States.
(b)
Computational adjustment permitted if return is not filed after mailing of notice.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if—
(1) This section applies with respect to a partnership for a partnership taxable year;
(2) The Internal Revenue Service mails notice to a partner that the losses and credits arising from that partnership for that year will be disallowed to that partner unless the partnership files a return for that year within 60 days after the date on which the notice is mailed; and
(3) The partnership fails to file a return for that year within that 60-day period, the Internal Revenue Service may, without conducting a partnership-level proceeding, mail a notice of computational adjustment to that partner to reflect the disallowance of any loss (including a capital loss) or credit arising from that partnership for that year.
(c)
Restriction on notices under paragraph (b) of this section.
Neither the notice referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section nor the notice of computational adjustment referred to in paragraph (b) of this section may be mailed on a day on which—
(1) The tax matters partner of the partnership resides within the United States; and
(2) The books and records of the partnership are maintained within the United States. Thus, if this section applies with respect to a partnership for a taxable year solely because the tax matters partner of that partnership resided outside the United States for a period after the close of that taxable year and the tax matters partner later takes up residence within the United States, no notice may be mailed under paragraph (b) of this section while the tax matters partner resides within the United States.
(d)
No disallowance in certain circumstances.
If the person to whom the notice referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is mailed establishes to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service—
(1) That the losses and credits arising from the partnership for the year are proper; and
(2) That the partner has made a good faith effort to have the partnership file the required return; the Internal Revenue Service may allow the losses and credits in whole or in part.
(e)
Effective date.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6231(f)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
[T.D. 8965, 66 FR 50563, Oct. 4, 2001]
§ 301.6232-1
Assessment, collection, and payment of imputed underpayment.
(a)
In general.
An imputed underpayment determined under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) is assessed and collected in the same manner as if the imputed underpayment were a tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code for the adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)) except that the deficiency procedures under subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Code do not apply to an assessment of an imputed underpayment. Accordingly, no notice under section 6212 is required for, and the restrictions under section 6213 do not apply to, the assessment of any imputed underpayment. See paragraph (c) of this section for
limitations on assessment and paragraph (d) of this section for exceptions to restrictions on adjustments.
(b)
Payment of the imputed underpayment.
Upon receipt of notice and demand from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), an imputed underpayment must be paid by the partnership at the place and time stated in the notice. In the case of an adjustment requested in an administrative adjustment request (AAR) under section 6227(b)(1) that is taken into account by the partnership under § 301.6227-2(b), payment of the imputed underpayment is due on the date the AAR is filed. The IRS may assess the amount of the imputed underpayment reflected on the AAR on the date the AAR is filed. For interest with respect to an imputed underpayment, see § 301.6233(a)-1(b).
(c)
Limitation on assessment
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided by this section or subtitle F of the Code (except for subchapter B of chapter 63), no assessment of an imputed underpayment may be made (and no levy or proceeding in any court for the collection of an imputed underpayment may be made, begun, or prosecuted) before—
(i) The close of the 90th day after the day on which a notice of a final partnership adjustment (FPA) under section 6231(a)(3) was mailed; and
(ii) If a petition for readjustment is filed under section 6234 with respect to such FPA, the decision of the court has become final.
(2)
Specified similar amount.
The limitations under paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply in the case of a specified similar amount as defined in section 6232(f)(2).
(d)
Exceptions to restrictions on adjustments and assessments
—(1)
Adjustments treated as mathematical or clerical errors
—(i)
In general.
A notice to a partnership that, on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on the partnership return or as a result of a failure by a partnership-partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(7)) to comply with section 6222(a), the IRS has adjusted or will adjust partnership-related items (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)(ii)) to correct the error or to make the items consistent under section 6222(a) and has assessed or will assess any imputed underpayment (determined in accordance with § 301.6225-1) resulting from the adjustment is not considered an FPA under section 6231(a)(3). A petition for readjustment under section 6234 may not be filed with respect to such notice. The limitations under section 6232(b) and paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to an assessment under this paragraph (d)(1)(i). For the definition of mathematical or clerical error generally, see section 6213(g)(2). For application of mathematical or clerical error in the case of inconsistent treatment by a partner that fails to give notice, see § 301.6222-1(b).
(ii)
Request for abatement
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, a partnership that is mailed a notice described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section may file with the IRS, within 60 days after the date of such notice, a request for abatement of any assessment of an imputed underpayment specified in such notice. Upon receipt of the request, the IRS must abate the assessment. Any subsequent assessment of an imputed underpayment with respect to which abatement was made is subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code, including the limitations under paragraph (c) of this section.
(B)
Adjustments with respect to inconsistent treatment by a partnership-partner.
If an adjustment that is the subject of a notice described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section is due to the failure of a partnership-partner to comply with section 6222(a), paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply, and abatement of any assessment specified in such notice is not available. However, prior to assessment, a partnership-partner that has failed to comply with section 6222(a) may correct the inconsistency by filing an administrative adjustment request in accordance with section 6227 or filing an amended partnership return and furnishing amended statements, as appropriate.
(iii)
Partnerships that have an election under section 6221(b) in effect.
In the case of a partnership-partner that has an election under section 6221(b) in effect for the reviewed year (as defined in
§ 301.6241-1(a)(8)), any tax resulting from an adjustment due to the partnership-partner's failure to comply with section 6222(a) may be assessed with respect to the reviewed year partners (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)) of the partnership-partner (or indirect partners of the partnership-partner, as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(4)). Such tax may be assessed in the same manner as if the tax were on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on the reviewed year partner's or indirect partner's return, except that the procedures under section 6213(b)(2) for requesting an abatement of such assessment do not apply.
(2)
Partnership may waive limitations.
A partnership may at any time by a signed notice in writing filed with the IRS waive the limitations under paragraph (c) of this section (whether or not an FPA under section 6231(a)(3) has been mailed by the IRS at the time of the waiver).
(e)
Limit on amount of imputed underpayment where no proceeding is begun.
If no proceeding under section 6234 is begun with respect to an FPA under section 6231(a)(3) before the close of the 90th day after the day on which such FPA was mailed, the amount for which the partnership is liable under section 6225 with respect to such FPA cannot exceed the amount determined in such FPA.
(f)
Applicability date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, this section applies to partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending after August 12, 2018.
(2)
Election under § 301.9100-22 in effect.
This section applies to any partnership taxable year beginning after November 2, 2015, and before January 1, 2018, for which a valid election under § 301.9100-22 is in effect.
[T.D. 9844, 84 FR 6562, Feb. 27, 2019]
§ 301.6233-1
Extension to entities filing partnership returns.
(a)
Entities filing a partnership return.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter C) and the regulations thereunder shall apply with respect to any taxable year of an entity for which such entity files a partnership return as well as to such entity's items for that taxable year and to any person holding an interest in such entity at any time during that taxable year. Any final partnership administrative adjustment or judicial determination resulting from a proceeding under subchapter C with respect to such taxable year may include a determination that the entity is not a partnership for such taxable year as well as determinations with respect to all items of the entity that would be partnership items, as defined in section 6231(a)(3) and the regulations thereunder, if such entity had been a partnership in such taxable year (including, for example, any amounts taxable to an entity determined to be an association taxable as a corporation). For example, a final determination under subchapter C that an entity that filed a partnership return is an association taxable as a corporation will serve as a basis for a computational adjustment reflecting the disallowance of any loss or credit claimed by a purported partner with respect to that entity.
(b)
Partnership return filed but no entity found to exist.
Paragraph (a) of this section shall apply where a partnership return is filed for a taxable year but it is determined that there is no entity for such taxable year. For purposes of applying paragraph (a) of this section, the partnership return shall be treated as if it were filed by an entity. However, any final partnership administrative adjustment or judicial determination resulting from a proceeding under subchapter C with respect to such taxable year may also include a determination that there is no entity for such taxable year.
(c)
Exceptions.
Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to—
(1) Entities for any taxable year in which such entity would be excepted from the provisions of subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code under section 6231(a)(1)(B) and the regulations thereunder (relating to the exception for small partnerships) if such entity were a partnership for such taxable year; and
(2) Entities for any taxable year for which a partnership return was filed
for the sole purpose of making the election described in section 761(a).
(d)
Effective dates.
This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6233-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
[T.D. 8965, 66 FR 50563, Oct. 4, 2001]
§ 301.6233(a)-1
Interest and penalties determined from reviewed year.
(a)
Interest and penalties with respect to the reviewed year.
Except to the extent provided in section 6226(c), in the case of a partnership adjustment (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)) for a reviewed year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(8)), a partnership is liable for—
(1) Interest computed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; and
(2) Any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount as provided under paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Computation of interest with respect to partnership adjustments for the reviewed year
—(1)
Interest on an imputed underpayment.
The interest imposed on an imputed underpayment resulting from partnership adjustments for the reviewed year is the interest that would be imposed under chapter 67 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) if the imputed underpayment were treated as an underpayment of tax for the reviewed year. The interest imposed on an imputed underpayment under paragraph (b) of this section begins on the day after the due date of the partnership return (without regard to extension) for the reviewed year and ends on the earlier of—
(i) The date prescribed for payment (as described in § 301.6232-1(b));
(ii) The due date of the partnership return (without regard to extension) for the adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)); or
(iii) The date the imputed underpayment is fully paid.
(2)
Interest on penalties with respect to the reviewed year.
The interest imposed on any penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts determined under paragraph (c) of this section is the interest that would be imposed under chapter 67 of the Code treating the partnership return for the reviewed year as the return of tax with respect to which such penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount is imposed.
(c)
Penalties with respect to partnership adjustments for the reviewed year
—(1)
In general.
In accordance with section 6221(a), the applicability of any penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts that relate to an adjustment to any partnership-related item for the reviewed year is determined at the partnership level as if the partnership had been an individual subject to tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for the reviewed year, and the imputed underpayment were an actual underpayment of tax or understatement for such year. Nothing in this paragraph (c)(1) affects the application of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that may apply to the partnership or to any reviewed year partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)) or to any indirect partner (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(4)) that is unrelated to an adjustment to a partnership-related item under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code. Except as provided in § 301.6225-2(d), a partner-level defense (as described in § 301.6226-3(d)(3)) may not be raised in a proceeding of the partnership.
(2)
Determination of the amount of accuracy-related penalty and fraud penalty
—(i)
In general.
The amount of any penalty under part II of subchapter A of chapter 68 of the Code (accuracy-related or fraud penalties) that relates to any partnership adjustment for the reviewed year is determined in accordance with this paragraph (c)(2). If in determining the imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-1 (or § 301.6225-2 in the case of modification), any grouping or subgrouping contains a negative adjustment (as defined in § 301.6225-1(d)(2)(ii)) and at least one positive adjustment (as defined in § 301.6225-1(d)(2)(iii)) that is subject to penalty, first apply the rules for allocating negative adjustments in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. Then, apply the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section to calculate penalty amounts. If there are no negative adjustments, do not apply the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section and instead apply only the rules in paragraph
(c)(2)(ii) of this section. For all purposes under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, adjustments that do not result in the imputed underpayment (as described in § 301.6225-1(f)) and adjustments excluded from the determination of the imputed underpayment under § 301.6225-2(b)(2) are disregarded.
(ii)
Calculating the portion of an imputed underpayment subject to penalty and penalty amounts.
To determine the portion of an imputed underpayment subject to a penalty and the amount of a particular penalty, apply the following steps to all adjustments subject to penalty remaining after application of negative adjustments (as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and to all adjustments subject to penalty contained in groupings or subgroupings that do not contain a negative adjustment.
(A) For purposes of applying this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A), disregard adjustments to credits or adjustments treated as adjustments to credits. Total all adjustments to which a particular penalty was imposed and to which the highest rate of tax in effect for the reviewed year under section 1 or 11 was applied when calculating the imputed underpayment. See § 301.6225-1(b)(1)(iv).
(B) Multiply the total in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section by the highest rate of tax in effect for the reviewed year under section 1 or 11.
(C) If the imputed underpayment was modified in accordance with § 301.6225-2(b)(3), repeat the steps in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section for every tax rate applied in calculating the imputed underpayment by substituting the applicable tax rate determined under § 301.6225-2(b)(3) for the highest rate of tax in effect for the reviewed year under section 1 or 11.
(D) Total all amounts determined after completing the steps in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.
(E) Adjust the amount calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section by:
(
1
) Increasing by the net adjustments subject to the penalty in the credit grouping (as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section) after application of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section; or
(
2
) Decreasing in accordance with the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section by the amount of negative adjustments in the credit grouping if, after application of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, only negative adjustments in the credit grouping remain.
(
3
) The result after completing the calculation in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(E)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section is the portion of the imputed underpayment to which the particular penalty was imposed.
(F) Multiply the total calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section by the penalty rate applicable to the particular penalty. This is the total penalty amount for adjustments to which the particular penalty was imposed.
(iii)
Allocating negative adjustments
—(A)
In general.
Negative adjustments offset positive adjustments within the same grouping or, if the negative adjustment is in a subgrouping, within that same subgrouping. For purposes of applying this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), all adjustments to credits and adjustments treated as adjustments to credits are treated as grouped in the credit grouping without regard to whether the adjustments were subgrouped for purposes of § 301.6225-1 (or § 301.6225-2 in the case of modification). Adjustments that do not result in the imputed underpayment are disregarded as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Negative adjustments are allocated in accordance with the following rules:
(
1
) Negative adjustments are first applied to offset positive adjustments to which no penalties have been imposed.
(
2
) Any amount of negative adjustments remaining after application of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section are applied to offset adjustments to which a penalty has been imposed at the lowest penalty rate.
(
3
) Any amount of negative adjustments remaining after application of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section are applied to offset adjustments to which a penalty has been imposed at the next highest rate in ascending order of rate until no amount of negative adjustments remain or no positive
adjustments to which a penalty has been imposed remain.
(B)
Allocation of negative adjustment within a penalty rate.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may provide additional guidance regarding the ordering or allocation of negative adjustments for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section where more than one penalty is imposed at the same penalty rate.
(C)
Adjustments remaining after allocation of negative adjustments
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, any positive adjustment to which a penalty has been imposed that has not been fully offset by a negative adjustment after application of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is a
net adjustment subject to penalty
remaining after allocation of negative adjustments.
(
2
)
Additional rules regarding allocation of negative credit amounts.
If, after application of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, an amount of negative adjustments remain in the credit grouping, the amount of remaining negative adjustments may reduce the portion of the imputed underpayment that is subject to a penalty, but not below zero, in accordance with the following rules:
(
i
) The amount of remaining negative adjustments in the credit grouping are first applied to the portion of the imputed underpayment to which no penalty has been imposed, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C)(
3
) of this section.
(
ii
) Any amount of negative adjustment in the credit grouping remaining after application of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
)(
i
) of this section is applied to the portion of the imputed underpayment to which a penalty has been imposed at the lowest penalty rate as calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(
iii
) Any amount of negative adjustments in the credit grouping remaining after application of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section is applied to the portion of the imputed underpayment to which a penalty has been imposed at the next highest rate in ascending order of rate in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section until no negative amount remains.
(
3
)
Calculating the portion of the imputed underpayment to which no penalty was imposed before the application of negative adjustments to credits.
To determine the portion of the imputed underpayment that is not subject to penalty for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C)(
2
)(
i
) of this section, apply the rules in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) through (E) of this section of this section but substitute adjustment to which no penalty was imposed for adjustments to which a particular penalty was imposed.
(iv)
Special rules
—(A)
Fraud penalties under section 6663.
If any portion of an imputed underpayment is determined by the IRS to be attributable to fraud, the entire imputed underpayment is treated as attributable to fraud. This paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) does not apply to any portion of the imputed underpayment the partnership establishes by a preponderance of the evidence is not attributable to fraud.
(B)
Substantial understatement penalty under section 6662(d)
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of application of the penalty under section 6662(d) (substantial understatement of income tax), the imputed underpayment is treated as an understatement under section 6662(d)(2). To determine whether an imputed underpayment treated as an understatement under this paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B)(
1
) is a substantial understatement under section 6662(d)(1), the rules of section 6662(d)(1)(A) apply by treating the amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section as the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year under section 6662(d)(1)(A)(i).
(
2
)
Amount of tax required to be shown on the return.
The amount described in this paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B)(
2
) is the tax that would result by treating the net income or loss of the partnership for the reviewed year, reflecting any partnership adjustments as finally determined, as taxable income described in section 1(c) (determined without regard to section 1(h)).
(C)
Reportable transaction understatement under section 6662A.
For purposes of application of the penalty under section 6662A (reportable transaction understatement penalty), the portion of an imputed underpayment attributable
to an item described under section 6662A(b)(2) is treated as a reportable transaction understatement under section 6662A(b).
(D)
Reasonable cause and good faith.
For purposes of determining whether a partnership satisfies the reasonable cause and good faith exception under section 6664(c) or (d) with respect to a penalty under section 6662, section 6662A, or section 6663, the partnership is treated as the taxpayer. See § 1.6664-4 of this chapter. Accordingly, the facts and circumstances taken into account to determine whether the partnership has established reasonable cause and good faith are the facts and circumstances applicable to the partnership.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of these examples, each partnership has a calendar taxable year, and the highest tax rate in effect for all taxpayers is 40 percent for all relevant periods.
(A)
Example 1.
In an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2018 partnership return, the IRS makes a positive adjustment to ordinary income of $100. The $100 adjustment is due to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations under section 6662(c), and a 20-percent accuracy-related penalty applies under section 6662(a). The IRS also makes a positive adjustment to long-term capital gain of $300, but no penalty applies with respect to that adjustment. These are the only adjustments. The portion of the imputed underpayment to which the 20-percent penalty applies is $40 ($100 × 40 percent), and the penalty is $8 ($40 × 20 percent).
(B)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section, except that the IRS makes a positive adjustment to credits of $10. The adjustment to credits is due to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations under section 6662(c), and a 20-percent accuracy-related penalty applies under section 6662(a). The portion of the imputed underpayment to which the 20-percent accuracy-related penalty applies is $50 (($100 × 40 percent) + $10), and the penalty is $10 ($50 × 20 percent).
(C)
Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B) of this section, except that there is also a negative adjustment to ordinary income of $50 that was subgrouped under § 301.6225-1 with the $100 positive adjustment to ordinary. Because the $50 negative adjustment to ordinary income was subgrouped under § 301.6225-1 with the $100 positive adjustment to ordinary income, in determining the portion of the imputed underpayment subject to penalty, the $50 negative adjustment is applied to offset part of the $100 positive adjustment to ordinary income ($100−$50 = $50). Accordingly, the portion of the imputed underpayment to which the 20-percent accuracy-related penalty applies is $30 (($50 × 40 percent) + $10), and the penalty is $6 ($30 × 20 percent).
(D)
Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(C) of this section, except that the $300 adjustment to long-term capital gain is due to a gross valuation misstatement. A 40-percent accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(a) and (h) applies to the portion of the imputed underpayment attributable to the gross valuation misstatement. The portion of the imputed underpayment to which the 20 percent accuracy-related penalty applies remains $30, and the 20-percent accuracy-related penalty remains $6. The portion of the imputed underpayment to which the 40-percent gross valuation misstatement penalty applies is $120 ($300 × 40 percent), and the gross valuation misstatement penalty is $48 ($120 × 40 percent). The total accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(a) is $54.
(E)
Example 5.
Partnership has four equal partners during its 2019 taxable year: Two partners are partnerships, A and B; one partner is a tax-exempt entity, C; and the fourth partner is an individual, D. In an administrative proceeding with respect to Partnership's 2019 taxable year, the IRS timely mails a notice of proposed partnership adjustment (NOPPA) to Partnership for its 2019 taxable year proposing a single partnership positive adjustment to Partnership's ordinary income by $400,000. The $400,000 positive adjustment is due to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations under section
6662(c). A 20-percent accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(a) and (c) applies to the portion of the imputed underpayment attributable to the negligence or disregard of the rules or regulations. In the NOPPA, the IRS determines an imputed underpayment of $160,000 ($400,000 × 40 percent) and that the 20-percent penalty applies to the entire imputed underpayment. The penalty is $32,000 ($160,000 × 20 percent). Partnership requests modification under § 301.6225-2(d)(3) (regarding tax-exempt partners) with respect to the amount of additional income allocated to C, and the IRS approves the modification request. As a result, Partnership's total netted partnership adjustment under § 301.6225-1(b)(2) is $300,000 ($400,000 less $100,000 allocable to C). The imputed underpayment is $120,000 (($300,000) × 40 percent), and the penalty is $24,000 ($120,000 × 20 percent).
(F)
Example 6.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5
in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(E) of this section, except in addition to the modification with respect to C's tax-exempt status, Partnership requests a modification under § 301.6225-2(d)(2) (regarding amended returns) with respect to the $100,000 of additional income allocated to D. In accordance with the rules under § 301.6225-2(d)(2), D files an amended return for D's 2019 taxable year taking into account $100,000 of additional ordinary income. In addition, in accordance with § 301.6225-2(d)(2)(viii), D takes into account on D's return the 20-percent accuracy-related penalty for negligence or disregard of rules or regulations that relates to the ordinary income adjustment. D's tax attributes for other taxable years are not affected. The IRS approves the modification request. As a result, Partnership's total netted partnership adjustment under § 301.6225-1(b)(2) is $200,000 ($400,000 less $100,000 allocable to C and $100,000 taken into account by D). The imputed underpayment, after modification, is $80,000 ($200,000 × 40 percent), and the penalty is $16,000 ($80,000 × 20 percent).

§ 301.6233(b)-1
Interest and penalties with respect to the adjustment year return.
(a)
Interest and penalties with respect to failure to pay imputed underpayment on the date prescribed.
In the case of any failure to pay an imputed underpayment on the date prescribed for such payment (as described in § 301.6232-1(b)), a partnership is liable for—
(1) Interest as determined under paragraph (c) of this section; and
(2) Any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount as determined under paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Imputed underpayments to which this section applies.
This section applies to the portion of an imputed underpayment determined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under section 6225(a)(1), or an imputed underpayment resulting from adjustments requested by a partnership in an administrative adjustment request under section 6227, that is not paid by the date prescribed for payment under § 301.6232-1(b).
(c)
Interest.
Interest determined under this paragraph (c) is the interest that would be imposed under chapter 67 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) by treating any unpaid amount of the imputed underpayment as an underpayment of tax imposed for the adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)).

§ 301.6234-1
Judicial review of partnership adjustment.
(a)
In general.
Within 90 days after the date on which a notice of a final partnership adjustment (FPA) under section 6231(a)(3) with respect to any partnership taxable year is mailed, a partnership may file a petition for a readjustment of any partnership adjustment (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)) reflected in the FPA for such taxable year (without regard to whether an election under section 6226 has been made with respect to any imputed underpayment (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(3)) reflected in such FPA) with—
(1) The Tax Court;
(2) The district court of the United States for the district in which the partnership's principal place of business is located; or
(3) The Court of Federal Claims.
(b)
Jurisdictional requirement for bringing action in district court or Court of Federal Claims.
A petition for readjustment under this section with respect to any partnership adjustment may be filed in a district court of the United States or the Court of Federal Claims only if the partnership filing the petition deposits with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), on or before the date the petition is filed, the amount of (as of the date of the filing of the petition) any imputed underpayment (as shown on the FPA) and any penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts with respect to such imputed underpayment. If there is more than one imputed underpayment reflected in the FPA, the partnership must deposit the amount of each imputed underpayment to which the petition for readjustment relates and the amount of any penalties, additions to tax, and additional amounts with respect to each such imputed underpayment.
(c)
Treatment of deposit as payment of tax.
Any amount deposited in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, while deposited, will not be treated as a payment of tax for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an amount deposited in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section will be treated as a payment of tax for purposes of chapter 67 of the Code (relating to interest). Interest will be allowed and paid in accordance with section 6611.
(d)
Effect of decision dismissing action.
If an action brought under this section is dismissed other than by reason of a rescission of the FPA under section 6231(d) and § 301.6231-1(g), the decision of the court dismissing the action is considered as its decision that the FPA is correct.
(e)
Amount deposited may be applied against assessment.
If the limitations on assessment under section 6232(b) and § 301.6232-1(c) no longer apply with respect to an imputed underpayment for which a deposit under paragraph (b) of this section was made, the IRS may apply the amount deposited against any such imputed underpayment that is assessed. In the case of a deposit made under this section that is in an amount in excess of the amount assessed against the partnership (excess deposit), a partnership may obtain a return of the excess deposit by making a request in writing in accordance with forms, instructions, or other guidance prescribed by the IRS.

Modification requested under section 6225(c)
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, in the case of any request for modification of any imputed underpayment under section 6225(c), the date by which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may make a partnership adjustment is the date that is 270 days (plus the number of days of an extension of the period for requesting modification (as described in § 301.6225-2(c)(3)(i)) agreed to by the IRS under section 6225(c)(7) and § 301.6225-2(c)(3)(ii)) after the date on which everything required to be submitted to the IRS pursuant to section 6225(c) is so submitted.
(2)
Date on which everything is required to be submitted
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the date on which everything required to be submitted to the IRS pursuant to section 6225(c) is so submitted is the earlier of—
(A) The date the period for requesting modification ends (including extensions) as described in § 301.6225-2(c)(3)(i) and (ii); or
(B) The date the period for requesting modification expires as a result of a waiver of the prohibition on mailing a notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA) under § 301.6231-1(b)(2). See § 301.6225-2(c)(3)(iii).
(ii)
Incomplete submission has no effect.
A determination by the IRS that the information submitted as part of a request for modification is incomplete has no effect on the applicability of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(c)
Notice of proposed partnership adjustment.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the date by which the IRS may make a partnership adjustment is the date that is 330 days (plus the number of days of an extension of the modification period (as described in § 301.6225-2(c)(3)(i)) agreed to by the IRS under section 6225(c)(7) and § 301.6225-2(c)(3)(ii)) after the date the last notice of proposed partnership adjustment (NOPPA) under section 6231(a)(2) is mailed, regardless of whether modification is requested by the partnership under section 6225(c).
(d)
Extension by agreement.
The periods described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section (including any extension of those periods pursuant to this paragraph (d)) may be extended by an agreement, in writing, entered into by the partnership and the IRS before the expiration of such period.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of these examples, each partnership has a calendar taxable year.
(1)
Example 1.
Partnership timely files its partnership return for the 2020 taxable year on March 1, 2021. On September 1, 2023, Partnership files an administrative adjustment request (AAR) under section 6227 with respect to its 2020 taxable year. As of September 1, 2023, the IRS has not initiated an administrative proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year. Therefore, as of September 1, 2023, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the period for making partnership adjustments with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year expires on September 1, 2026.
(2)
Example 2.
Partnership timely files its partnership return for the 2020 taxable year on the due date, March 15, 2021. On February 1, 2023, the IRS mails
to Partnership and the partnership representative of Partnership (PR) a notice of administrative proceeding under section 6231(a)(1) with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year. Assuming no AAR has been filed with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year and the IRS has not yet mailed a NOPPA under section 6231(a)(2) with respect to Partnership's 2020 taxable year, the period for making partnership adjustments for Partnership's 2020 taxable year expires on the date determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, March 15, 2024.
(3)
Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, except that on June 1, 2023, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, PR signs an agreement extending the period for making partnership adjustments under section 6235(a) for Partnership's 2020 taxable year to December 31, 2025. In addition, on June 2, 2025, the IRS mails to Partnership and PR a timely NOPPA under section 6231(a)(2). Pursuant to § 301.6225-2(c)(3)(i), the period for requesting modification expires on February 27, 2026 (270 days after June 2, 2025, the date the NOPPA is mailed), but PR does not submit a request for modification on or before this date. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the date for purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section is April 28, 2026, the date that is 330 days from the mailing of the NOPPA. Because April 28, 2026 is later than the date under paragraph (a)(1) of this section (December 31, 2025, as extended under paragraph (d) of this section), and because no modification was requested, paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not applicable, April 28, 2026 is the date on which the period for making partnership adjustments expires under section 6235.
(4)
Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, except that PR notifies the IRS that Partnership will be requesting modification. On January 5, 2026, PR and the IRS agree to extend the period for requesting modification pursuant to section 6225(c)(7) and § 301.6225-2(c)(3)(ii) for 45 days—from February 27, 2026 to April 13, 2026. PR submits the request for modification to the IRS on April 13, 2026. Therefore, the date determined under paragraph (b) of this section is February 22, 2027, which is 270 days after the date everything required to be submitted was so submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section plus the additional 45-day extension of the period for requesting modification agreed to by PR and the IRS. Because February 22, 2027 is later than the date under paragraph (a)(1) of this section (December 31, 2025, as extended under paragraph (d) of this section) and the date under paragraph (a)(3) of this section (June 12, 2026, which is 330 days from the date the NOPPA was mailed plus the 45-day extension under section 6225(c)(7)), February 22, 2027 is the date on which the period for making partnership adjustments expires under section 6235.
(5)
Example 5.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4
in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, except that PR does not request an extension of the period for requesting modification. On February 1, 2026, PR submits a request for modification and PR, and the IRS agree in writing to waive the prohibition on mailing an FPA pursuant to § 301.6231-1(b)(2). Pursuant to § 301.6225-2(c)(3)(iii), the period for requesting modification expires as of February 1, 2026, rather than February 27, 2026. Accordingly, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the date on which everything required to be submitted pursuant to section 6225(c) is so submitted is February 1, 2026, and the 270-day period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section begins to run on that date. Therefore, the date for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section is October 29, 2026, which is 270 days after February 1, 2026, the date on which everything required to be submitted under section 6225(c) is so submitted. Because October 29, 2026 is later than the date under paragraph (a)(1) of this section (December 31, 2025, as extended under paragraph (d) of this section) and the date under paragraph (a)(3) of this section (April 28, 2026), October 29, 2026 is the date on which the period for making partnership adjustments expires under section 6235.
(6)
Example 6.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5
in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, except PR completes its submission of information to support a request for modification on July 1,
2025, but does not execute a waiver pursuant to § 301.6231-1(b)(2). Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, February 27, 2026, the date the period requesting modification expires, is the date on which everything required to be submitted pursuant to section 6225(c) is so submitted. As a result, the 270-day period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section expires on November 24, 2026. Because November 24, 2026 is later than the date under paragraph (a)(1) of this section (December 31, 2025, as extended under paragraph (d) of this section) and the date under paragraph (a)(3) of this section (April 28, 2026), November 24, 2026 is the date on which the period for making partnership adjustments expires under section 6235.

§ 301.6241-1
Definitions.
(a)
Definitions.
For purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and the regulations in this part under sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code—
(1)
Adjustment year.
The term
adjustment year
means the partnership taxable year in which—
(i) In the case of an adjustment pursuant to the decision of a court in a proceeding brought under section 6234, such decision becomes final;
(ii) In the case of an administrative adjustment request (AAR) under section 6227, such AAR is filed; or
(iii) In any other case, a notice of final partnership adjustment is mailed under section 6231 or, if the partnership waives the restrictions under section 6232(b) (regarding limitations on assessment), the waiver is executed by the IRS.
(2)
Adjustment year partner.
The term
adjustment year partner
means any person who held an interest in a partnership at any time during the adjustment year.
(3)
Imputed underpayment.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3), the term
imputed underpayment
means the amount determined in accordance with section 6225 of the Code, § 301.6225-1, and, if applicable, § 301.6225-2. In the case of an election under section 6226, the term
imputed underpayment
means the amount determined in accordance with § 301.6226-3(e)(4). In the case of an administrative adjustment request, the term
imputed underpayment
means the amount determined in accordance with § 301.6227-2 or § 301.6227-3(c).
(4)
Indirect partner.
The term
indirect partner
means any person who has an interest in a partnership through their interest in one or more pass-through partners (as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section) or through a wholly-owned entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes.
(5)
Pass-through partner.
The term
pass-through partner
means a pass-through entity that holds an interest in a partnership. A pass-through entity is a partnership required to file a return under section 6031(a), an S corporation, a trust (other than a wholly-owned trust disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes), and a decedent's estate. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(5), a pass-through entity is not a wholly-owned entity disregarded as separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes.
(6)
Partnership adjustment
—(i)
In general.
The term
partnership adjustment
means any adjustment to a partnership-related item and includes any portion of an adjustment to a partnership-related item.
(ii)
Partnership-related item.
The term
partnership-related item
means—
(A) Any item or amount with respect to the partnership (as defined in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section) which is relevant in determining the tax liability of any person under chapter 1 of the Code (chapter 1) (as defined in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section);
(B) Any partner's distributive share of any such item or amount; and
(C) Any imputed underpayment determined under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code (subchapter C of chapter 63).
(iii)
Item or amount with respect to the partnership.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, an item or amount is with respect to the partnership if the item or amount is shown or reflected, or required to be shown or reflected, on a return of the partnership under section 6031 or the forms and instructions prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the partnership's taxable year or is required to be maintained in the partnership's books or records. Items or amounts relating to any transaction with, liability of, or basis in the partnership are with respect to the partnership only if those items or amounts are described in the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the previous two sentences, any tax, penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount imposed on the partnership under chapter 1 is an item or amount with respect to the partnership. An item or amount shown or required to be shown on a return of a person other than the partnership (or in that person's books and records) that results after application of the Code to a partnership-related item based upon the person's specific facts and circumstances, including an incorrect application of the Code or taking into account erroneous facts and circumstances of the partner, is not an item or amount with respect to the partnership. For instance, a deduction shown on the return of a partner that results after applying a limitation under the Code (such as section 170(b)) at the partner level to a partnership-related item based on the partner's facts and circumstances is not an item or amount with respect to the partnership, even though the corresponding expense on the return of the partnership is an item or amount with respect to the partnership. Likewise, an amount on the return of a partner that is after either an incorrect application of a limitation under the Code or based on facts and circumstances of the partner that are erroneous, or both (such as an incorrect application of section 170(b)) at the partner level to a partnership-related item is not an item or amount with respect to the partnership. Similarly, a partner's adjusted basis is not with respect to the partnership because it is an item or amount shown in the partner's books or records that results after application of the Code to partnership-related items taking into account the facts and circumstances specific to that partner.
(iv)
Relevant in determining the tax liability of any person under chapter 1.
For purposes of this section, an item or amount with respect to the partnership is relevant in determining the tax liability of any person under chapter 1 without regard to the application of subchapter C of chapter 63 and without regard to whether such item or amount, or an adjustment to such item or amount, has an effect on the tax liability of any particular person under chapter 1.
(v)
Examples of partnership-related items.
The term partnership-related item includes—
(A) The character, timing, source, and amount of the partnership's income, gain, loss, deductions, and credits;
(B) The character, timing, and source of the partnership's activities;
(C) The character, timing, source, value, and amount of any contributions to, and distributions from, the partnership;
(D) The partnership's basis in its assets, the character and type of the assets, and the value (or revaluation such as under § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(
f
) or (
s
) of this chapter) of the assets;
(E) The amount and character of partnership liabilities and any changes to those liabilities from the preceding tax year;
(F) The category, timing, and amount of the partnership's creditable expenditures;
(G) Any item or amount resulting from a partnership termination;
(H) Any item or amount of the partnership resulting from an election under section 754;
(I) Partnership allocations and any special allocations; and
(J) The identity of a person as a partner in the partnership.
(vi)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. For purposes of these examples, Partnership is subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 and all taxpayers are calendar year taxpayers.
(A)
Example 1.
Partnership enters into a transaction with A to purchase widgets for $100 in taxable year 2020. Partnership pays A $100 for the widgets. Any deduction or expense of the Partnership for the purchase of the widgets is an item or amount with respect to Partnership because it is shown on Partnership's return and is relevant to determining the liability of any person under chapter 1 pursuant to paragraphs (a)(6)(iii) and (iv) of this section. Therefore, the deduction or expense is a partnership-related item. However, the income to A resulting from the transaction with Partnership is not an item or amount with respect to Partnership under paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section because although the amount of income relates to a transaction with Partnership and Partnership is required to show a deduction or expense related to the payment to A, the amount of income to A is not shown or required to be shown on Partnership's return. It is only required to be shown of the return of A, a person other than Partnership and requires determinations about A's reporting of the item. Accordingly, the amount of income shown, or required to be shown, by A on his return is not a partnership-related item.
(B)
Example 2.
B loans Partnership $100 in Partnership's 2020 taxable year. Partnership makes an interest payment to B in 2020 of $5. Partnership's liability relating to the loan by B to Partnership and the $5 of interest expense paid by the Partnership are items or amounts that are with respect to Partnership because they were shown on Partnership's return and are relevant in determining the liability of any person under chapter 1 pursuant to paragraphs (a)(6)(iii) and (iv) of this section. However, the treatment of the loan by B and the amount of interest income received by B are not items or amounts with respect to Partnership under paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section because although they relate to a transaction with or liability of Partnership and Partnership's treatment of the loan is shown on Partnership's return, B's treatment of the loan and the amount of interest income to B are shown, or required to be shown, on the return of B, a person other than Partnership and require determinations about B's reporting of the items. Accordingly, the loan as treated by B and the amount of interest income to B is not a partnership-related item.
(C)
Example 3.
On its partnership return for the 2020 tax year, Partnership reported $200 of non-cash charitable contributions related to its contribution of merchandise. Partnership has two equal partners for the 2020 tax year: C and D, both individuals. Partnership correctly reports $100 in non-cash charitable contributions to both C and D for the 2020 taxable year. On her return for the 2020 taxable year, C erroneously deducts the entire $100 of non-cash charitable contributions, even though C's deduction for charitable contributions would be limited by section 170(b)(1)(A) to $50 because of C's income. The $100 of non-cash charitable contribution reported by Partnership to C is a partnership-related item. However, the amount of the deduction taken by C on her return for 2020 and the amount of that deduction allowed after application of the limitation contained in section 170(b)(1)(A) to the $100 in non-cash charitable contributions reported by Partnership to C is not a partnership-related item under paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section because it is not with respect to the partnership.
(D)
Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
in paragraph (a)(6)(vi)(C) of this section. On his return for the 2020 taxable year, D also deducts the entire $100 in charitable contributions but treats the charitable contributions as if they were cash contributions, instead of non-cash contributions. D does not file a notice of inconsistent treatment under section 6222. If D had treated the $100 in charitable contributions as non-cash contributions, D's deduction for the charitable contributions from Partnership would have be limited by section 170(b)(1)(A) due to D's income. D's deduction of the $100 in charitable contributions is an item or amount shown
on D's return, derives from the charitable contributions reported by the partnership, and is subject to the application of the limitation under section 170(b)(1)(A). Therefore, D's deduction is not an item or amount with respect to the partnership. The charitable contribution reported by the partnership and its character are items or amounts with respect to the partnership pursuant to paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section. An adjustment to the character of the contributions is a partnership adjustment. Because D's treatment of the charitable contributions is inconsistent with the treatment of that item by Partnership on its partnership return, the IRS may make that partnership adjustment in a proceeding with respect to D and determine and assess any underpayment that results from conforming D's treatment to the treatment of the contributions by Partnership and applying the limit in section 170(b)(1)(A). See § 301.6222-1(b).
(7)

(a)
Coordination between Title 11 and proceedings under subchapter C of chapter 63
—(1)
In general.
If a partnership is a debtor in a case under Title 11 of the United States Code (Title 11 case), the running of any period of limitations under section 6235 with respect to the time for making a partnership adjustment (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)) and under sections 6501 and 6502 with respect to the assessment or collection of any imputed underpayment (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(3)) determined under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter C of chapter 63) is suspended during the period the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is prohibited by reason of the Title 11 case from making the adjustment, assessment, or collection until—
(i) 60 days after the suspension ends, for adjustments or assessments; and
(ii) 6 months after the suspension ends, for collection.
(2)
Interaction with section 6232(b).
The filing of a proof of claim or request for payment (or the taking of any other action) in a Title 11 case is not be treated as an action prohibited by section 6232(b) (regarding limitations on assessment).
(3)
Suspension of the time for judicial review.
In a Title 11 case, the running of the period specified in section 6234 (regarding judicial review of partnership adjustments) is suspended during the period during which the partnership is prohibited by reason of the Title 11 case from filing a petition under section 6234, and for 60 days thereafter.

§ 301.6241-3
Treatment where a partnership ceases to exist.
(a)
Former partners take adjustments into account
—(1)
In general.
If the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determines that any partnership (including a partnership-partner as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(7)) ceases to exist (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) before any partnership adjustment (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)) under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter C of chapter 63) takes effect (as described in paragraph (c) of this section), the partnership adjustment is taken into account by the former partners (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) of the partnership in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. A determination under this section that a partnership has ceased to exist does not prohibit the partnership from requesting modification of the imputed underpayment under section 6225(c).
(2)
Partnership no longer liable for any unpaid amounts resulting from a partnership adjustment.
A partnership that ceases to exist is no longer liable for any unpaid amounts resulting from a partnership adjustment required to be taken into account by a former partner under this section.
(3)
Application of this section to partnership-partners.
This section applies to a partnership-partner and its former partners, regardless of whether the partnership-partner has an election under section 6221(b) in effect for any relevant partnership taxable year.
(b)
Cease to exist defined
—(1)
In general.
If a partnership ceases to exist, the IRS will notify the partnership and the former partners (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), in writing, within 30 days of such determination using the last known address of the partnership and the former partners. A failure by the IRS to send a notification under this paragraph (b)(1) to a former partner of the partnership does not invalidate the determination by the IRS that the partnership ceases to exist. If an audited partnership (as defined in § 301.6226-3(e)(1)) ceases to exist, the IRS will also notify the partnership representative for the reviewed year. For purposes of this section, a partnership ceases to exist if the IRS makes a determination that a partnership ceases to exist because:
(i) The partnership terminates within the meaning of section 708(b)(1); or
(ii) The partnership does not have the ability to pay, in full, any amount that may be due under the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 for which the partnership is or may become liable. For purposes of this section, a partnership does not have the ability to pay if the IRS determines that the partnership's account is currently not collectible based on the information the IRS has at the time of such determination.
(2)
Year in which a partnership ceases to exist.
If a partnership terminates under section 708(b)(1), the partnership ceases to exist on the last day of the partnership's final taxable year. If a partnership does not have the ability to pay, the partnership ceases to exist on the date that the IRS makes a determination under paragraph (b)(1) of
this section that the partnership ceases to exist.
(3)
Limitation on IRS determination that partnership ceases to exist.
In no event may the IRS determine that a partnership ceases to exist with respect to a partnership adjustment after the expiration of the period of limitations on collection applicable to the assessment made against the partnership for the amount due resulting from such adjustment. A determination under this section that a partnership has ceased to exist is not effective if the partnership has made a valid election under § 301.6226-1 in response to a notice of final partnership adjustment or has paid all amounts due by the partnership under subchapter C of chapter 63 within 10 days of notice and demand for payment.
(c)
Partnership adjustment takes effect.
For purposes of this section, a partnership adjustment under subchapter C of chapter 63 takes effect when the adjustment becomes finally determined as described in § 301.6226-2(b)(1); when the partnership and the IRS enter into a settlement agreement regarding the adjustment; or, for adjustments appearing on an administrative adjustment request (AAR), when the request is filed.
(d)
Former partners
—(1)
Adjustment year partners
—(i)
In general.
Except as described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) of this section, the term
former partners
means, for a partnership that has ceased to exist, the partners of the partnership during the adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)) that corresponds to the reviewed year for which the adjustments were made.
(ii)
Partnership-partner ceases to exist.
If the adjustment year partner is a partnership-partner that the IRS has determined ceased to exist, the partners of such partnership-partner during the partnership-partner's taxable year that includes the end of the adjustment year of the partnership that is subject to a proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 are the former partners for purposes of this section. If the partnership-partner ceased to exist before the partnership-partner's taxable year that includes the end of the adjustment year of the partnership that is subject to a proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63, the former partners for purposes of this section are the partners of such partnership-partner during the last partnership taxable year for which the a partnership return of the partnership-partner under section 6031 is filed.
(2)
No adjustment year partners.
If there are no adjustment year partners of a partnership that ceases to exist, the term
former partners
means the partners of the partnership during the last taxable year for which a partnership return under section 6031 was filed with respect to such partnership. For instance, if a partnership terminates under section 708(b)(1) before the adjustment year and files a final partnership return for the partnership taxable year of such partnership, the former partners for purposes of this section are the partners of the partnership during the partnership taxable year for which a final partnership return is filed.
(e)
Taking adjustments into account
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a former partner of a partnership that ceases to exist takes a partnership adjustment into account as if the partnership had made an election under section 6226 (regarding the alternative to payment of the imputed underpayment). A former partner must take into account the former partner's share of a partnership adjustment as set forth in the statement described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section in accordance with § 301.6226-3.
(2)
Statements furnished to former partners.
If a partnership is notified by the IRS that the partnership has ceased to exist as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the partnership must furnish to each former partner a statement reflecting such former partner's share of the partnership adjustment required to be taken into account under this section and file a copy of such statement with the IRS in accordance with the rules under § 301.6226-2, except that—
(i) The adjustments are taken into account by the applicable former partner (as described in paragraph (d) of this section), rather than the reviewed year partners (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(9)); and
(ii) The partnership must furnish statements to the former partners and file the statements with the IRS no later than 60 days after the later of the date of the notification to the partnership that the IRS has determined that the partnership has ceased to exist or the date the adjustment takes effect, as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(3)
Authority to issue statements.
If any statements required by paragraph (e) of this section are not timely furnished to a former partner and filed with the IRS in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the IRS may notify the former partner in writing of such partner's share of the partnership adjustments based on the information reasonably available to the IRS at the time such notification is provided. For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, a notification to a former partner under this paragraph (e)(3) is treated the same as a statement required to be furnished and filed under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. For purposes of the examples, all partnerships and partners are calendar year taxpayers and each partnership is subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code (unless otherwise stated).
(1)
Example 1.
The IRS initiates a proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 with respect to the 2020 partnership taxable year of Partnership. During 2023, in accordance with section 6235(b), Partnership extends the period of limitations on adjustments under section 6235(a) until December 31, 2025. However, on July 31, 2024, Partnership terminates within the meaning of section 708(b)(1). Based on the prior termination under section 708(b)(1), the IRS determines that Partnership ceased to exist, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, on September 16, 2024. On February 1, 2025, the IRS mails Partnership a notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA) that determines partnership adjustments that result in a single imputed underpayment. Partnership does not timely file a petition under section 6234 and does not make a valid election under section 6226. Partnership files its final return of partnership income on October 15, 2024, listing A and B, both individuals, as the partners for its final taxable year ending July 31, 2024. Accordingly, under paragraph (d) of this section, A and B are former partners. Therefore, A and B are required to take their share of the partnership adjustments determined in the FPA into account under paragraph (e) of this section.
(2)
Example 2.
The IRS initiates a proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 with respect to the 2020 partnership taxable year of P, a partnership. G, a partnership that has an election under section 6221(b) in effect for the 2020 taxable year, is a partner of P during 2020 and for every year thereafter. On February 3, 2025, the IRS mails P an FPA that determines partnership adjustments that result in a single imputed underpayment. P does not timely file a petition under section 6234 and does not make a timely election under section 6226. On March 21, 2025, the IRS determines that P has ceased to exist because P did not make an election under section 6226, P's account is currently not collectible, and the IRS does not expect P will be able to pay the imputed underpayment. G terminated under section 708(b)(1) on December 31, 2024. On March 3, 2025, the IRS determines that G ceased to exist in 2024 for purposes of this section in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. J and K, individuals, were the only partners of G during 2024. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, J and K, the partners of G during G's 2024 partnership taxable year, are the former partners of G for purposes of this section. Therefore, J and K are required to take into account their share of the adjustments contained in the statement furnished by P to G in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(g)
Applicability date.
This section applies to any determinations made with respect to taxable years ending on or after November 20, 2020.
[T.D. 9844, 84 FR 6569, Feb. 27, 2019, as amended by T.D. 9969, 87 FR 75493, Dec. 9, 2022]
§ 301.6241-4
Payments nondeductible.
(a)
Payments nondeductible.
No deduction is allowed under subtitle A of the
Internal Revenue Code (Code) for any payment required to be made by a partnership under subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code (subchapter C of chapter 63). Payment by a partnership of any amount required to be paid under subchapter C of chapter 63, including any imputed underpayment (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(3)), or interest, penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts with respect to an imputed underpayment, is treated as an expenditure described in section 705(a)(2)(B).
(b)
Applicability date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, this section applies to partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending after August 12, 2018.
(2)
Election under § 301.9100-22 in effect.
This section applies to any partnership taxable year beginning after November 2, 2015, and before January 1, 2018, for which a valid election under § 301.9100-22 is in effect.
[T.D. 9844, 84 FR 6571, Feb. 27, 2019]
§ 301.6241-5
Extension to entities filing partnership returns.
(a)
Entities filing a partnership return.
Except as described in paragraph (c) of this section, an entity that files a partnership return for any taxable year is subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter C of chapter 63) with respect to such taxable year even if it is determined that the entity filing the partnership return was not a partnership for such taxable year. Accordingly, any partnership-related item (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)(ii)) and any person holding an interest in the entity, either directly or indirectly, at any time during that taxable year are subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 for such taxable year.
(b)
Partnership return filed but no entity found to exist.
Paragraph (a) of this section also applies where a partnership return is filed for a taxable year, but the IRS determines that no entity existed at all for such taxable year. For purposes of applying paragraph (a) of this section, the partnership return is treated as if it were filed by an entity.
(c)
Exceptions.
Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to—
(1) Any taxable year for which an election under section 6221(b) is in effect, treating the return as if it were filed by a partnership for the taxable year to which the election relates; and
(2) Any taxable year for which a valid section 761(a) election is made (regarding election out of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code for certain unincorporated organizations).
(d)
Applicability date
—(1)

§ 301.6241-6
Coordination with other chapters of the Internal Revenue Code.
(a)
Coordination with other chapters
—(1)
In general.
Subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter C of chapter 63) only applies to tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and not to any tax imposed (including any amount required to be deducted or withheld) under any chapter of the Code other than chapter 1 of the Code (chapter 1), including chapter 2, 2A, 3, or 4 of the Code. Accordingly, for purposes of determining taxes imposed under chapters of the Code other than chapter 1, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may make an adjustment to any partnership-related item (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)(ii)) in a proceeding that is not under subchapter C of chapter 63. To the extent an adjustment or determination is made under subchapter C of chapter 63 for purposes of chapter 1 and is relevant in determining tax imposed under a chapter of the Code other than chapter 1, such adjustment or determination must be taken into account for purposes of determining such tax.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (a) of this section as applied to cases in
which a partnership has a withholding obligation under chapter 3 or chapter 4 with respect to income that the partnership earns. For purposes of these examples, each partnership is subject to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code, and the partnership and its partners are calendar year taxpayers.
(i)
Example 1.
Partnership, a partnership created or organized in the United States, has two equal partners, A and B. A is a nonresident alien who is a resident of Country A, and B is a U.S. citizen. In 2018, Partnership earned $200 of U.S. source royalty income. Partnership was required to withhold 30 percent of the gross amount of the royalty income allocable to A unless Partnership had documentation that it could rely on to establish that A was entitled to a reduced rate of withholding. See §§ 1.1441-1(b)(1) and 1.1441-5(b)(2)(i)(A) of this chapter. Partnership withheld $15 from the $100 of royalty income allocable to A based on its incorrect belief that A is entitled to a reduced rate of withholding under the U.S.-Country A Income Tax Treaty. In 2020, the IRS determines in an examination of Partnership's Form 1042, Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons, that Partnership should have withheld $30 instead of $15 on the $100 of royalty income allocable to A because Partnership failed to obtain documentation from A establishing a valid treaty claim for a reduced rate of withholding. The tax imposed on Partnership for its failure to withhold on that income, however, is not a tax imposed by chapter 1. Rather, it is a tax imposed by chapter 3, which is not a partnership-related item under § 301.6241-1(a)(6)(ii). Therefore, in accordance with section 6221(a), the adjustment to increase Partnership's withholding tax liability by $15 is not determined under subchapter C of chapter 63, and instead must be determined as part of the Form 1042 examination.
(ii)
Example 2.
Partnership, a partnership created or organized in the United States, has two equal partners, A and B. A is a nonresident alien who is a resident of Country A, and B is a U.S. citizen. In 2018, Partnership earned $100 of U.S. source dividend income. Partnership was required to report the dividend income on its 2018 Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, and withhold 30 percent of the gross amount of the dividend income allocable to A unless Partnership had documentation that it could rely on to establish that A was entitled to a reduced rate of withholding. See §§ 1.1441-1(b)(1) and 1.1441-5(b)(2)(i)(A) of this chapter. In 2020, in an examination of Partnership's Form 1042, the IRS determines that Partnership earned but failed to report the $100 of U.S. source dividend income in 2018. The adjustment to increase Partnership's dividend income by $100 is an adjustment to a partnership-related item. The tax imposed on Partnership for its failure to withhold on that income, however, is not a tax imposed by chapter 1; rather, it is a tax imposed by chapter 3. Pursuant to § 301.6221(a)-1(a), only chapter 1 tax attributable to adjustments to partnership-related items is assessed under subchapter C of chapter 63. Therefore, because the tax imposed with respect to the adjustment is a chapter 3 tax, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the IRS may determine, assess, and collect chapter 3 tax attributable to an adjustment to a partnership-related item without conducting a proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63. Accordingly, the IRS may determine the chapter 3 tax in the examination of Partnership's Form 1042 by adjusting Partnership's withholding tax liability by an additional $15 for failing to withhold on the $50 of dividend income allocable to A. However, the IRS must initiate an administrative proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 to make any adjustments for purposes of chapter 1 attributable to the income. If the IRS subsequently initiates an administrative proceeding under subchapter C of chapter 63 and makes an adjustment to the same item of income, the portion of the dividend income allocable to A will be disregarded in the calculation of the total netted partnership adjustment to the extent that the chapter 3 tax has been collected with respect to such income. See § 301.6225-1(b)(3).
(b)
Coordination with chapters 3 and 4
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any tax imposed under chapter 3 or chapter 4
that is determined with respect to a partnership adjustment determined under subchapter C of chapter 63 for purposes of chapter 1, such tax is determined with respect to the reviewed year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(8)) and is imposed (or required to be deducted and withheld) with respect to the adjustment year (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(1)).
(2)

The following definitions apply for purposes of this paragraph (b) and the regulations under subchapter C of chapter 63.
(i)

Partnership pays an imputed underpayment.
If a partnership pays an imputed underpayment (as determined under § 301.6225-1(b)) and the total netted partnership adjustment (as calculated under § 301.6225-1(b)(2)) includes a partnership adjustment to an amount subject to withholding, the partnership is treated as having paid (at the time that the imputed underpayment is paid) the amount required to be withheld with respect to that partnership adjustment under chapter 3 or chapter 4 for purposes of applying §§ 1.1463-1 and 1.1474-4 of this chapter. See § 301.6225-1(b)(3) for the coordination rule that applies for calculating an imputed underpayment when an adjustment is made to an amount subject to withholding for which tax has been collected under chapter 3 or chapter 4.
(4)
Partnership makes an election under section 6226 with respect to an imputed underpayment
—(i)
In general.
A partnership that makes an election under § 301.6226-1 with respect to an imputed underpayment must pay the amount of tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 or chapter 4 on the amount of any adjustment set forth in the statement described in § 301.6226-2(a) to the extent that it is an adjustment to an amount subject to withholding, and the IRS has not already collected tax attributable to the adjustment under chapter 3 or chapter 4. The partnership must pay the amount due under this paragraph (b)(4)(i) on or before the due date of the partnership return for the adjustment year (without regard to extension), and must make the payment in the manner prescribed by the IRS in forms, instructions, and other guidance. For the rules governing partners subject to the taxes imposed by chapters 3 and 4 when the partner receives a statement under § 301.6226-2, see § 301.6226-3(f). See § 301.6226-3(e)(3)(v) for the application of the rules of this paragraph (b)(4) to pass-through partners (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(5)).
(ii)
Reduced rate of tax.
A partnership may reduce the amount of tax it is required to pay under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section to the extent that it can associate valid documentation from a reviewed year partner pursuant to the regulations under chapter 3 or chapter 4 (other than pursuant to § 1.1446-6 of this chapter) with the portion of the adjustment that would have been subject to a reduced rate of tax in the reviewed year. For this purpose, the partnership may rely on documentation that the partnership possesses that is valid with respect to the reviewed year (determined without regard to the expiration after the reviewed year of any validity period prescribed in § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii), § 1.1446-1(c)(2)(iv)(A), or § 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii) of this chapter), or new documentation that the partnership obtains from the reviewed year partner that includes a signed affidavit stating that the information and representations associated with the documentation are accurate with respect to the reviewed year.
(iii)
Reporting requirements.
A partnership required to pay tax under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section must file the appropriate return and issue information returns as required by regulations under chapter 3 or chapter 4. For return and information return requirements, see §§ 1.1446-3(d)(1)(iii); 1.1461-
1(b), (c); and 1.1474-1(c), (d) of this chapter. The partnership must file the return and issue information returns for the year that includes the date on which the partnership pays the tax required to be withheld under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. The partnership must report the information on the return and information returns in the manner prescribed by the IRS in forms, instructions, and other guidance.
(iv)
Partners subject to withholding.
A reviewed year partner that is subject to withholding under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section must follow the rules under § 301.6226-3(f).
(c)

This section applies to any partnership taxable year beginning after November 2, 2015, and before January 1, 2018, for which a valid election under § 301.9100-22 is in effect.
[T.D. 9844, 84 FR 6572, Feb. 27, 2019]
§ 301.6241-7
Treatment of special enforcement matters.
(a)
Items that involve special enforcement matters.
In accordance with section 6241(11)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the partnership-related items (as defined in § 301.6241-1(a)(6)(ii)) described in this section have been determined to involve special enforcement matters. If the rules in this section apply, only the portion of the partnership-related item to which the special enforcement matter applies may be adjusted without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63. Nothing in this section prohibits the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from adjusting the entire partnership-related item under subchapter C of chapter 63. See paragraph (i) of this section for rules coordinating adjustments made under subchapter C of chapter 63 with adjustments made without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63.
(b)
Partnership-related items underlying items that are not partnership-related items
—(1)
In general.
The IRS may determine that the rules of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code (subchapter C of chapter 63) do not apply to an adjustment to a partnership-related item of a partnership if—
(i) An examination is being conducted of a person other than the partnership;
(ii) A determination regarding a partnership-related item is made, as part of, or underlying, an adjustment to an item that is not a partnership-related item of the person described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; and
(iii) The treatment of the partnership-related item on the return of the partnership under section 6031(a) or in the partnership's books and records is based in whole or in part on information provided by the person described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section from that person's books and records.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For purposes of this example, the partnership has no liabilities, is subject to subchapter C of chapter 63, and the partnership and partner each has a calendar taxable year. On June 1, 2018, A acquires an interest in Partnership by contributing Asset to Partnership in a section 721 contribution (Contribution). Under section 722, A claims a basis in its interest in Partnership of $50 equal to A's purported adjusted basis in Asset at the time of the Contribution. Partnership claims a basis in Asset of $50 under section 723 equal to A's purported adjusted basis in Asset as of June 1, 2018, based on information A provided to Partnership as part of the Contribution. There is no activity in Partnership that gives rise to any other partnership-related items between June 1, 2018, and June 2, 2019. On June 2, 2019, A sells A's interest in Partnership to B for $100 in cash and reports a gain of $50 based on A's purported adjusted basis in its interest in Partnership of $50. The IRS opens an examination of A and determines that A's adjusted basis in its interest in Partnership should be $30 instead of the $50 claimed by A because A's Contribution to Partnership should have been $30 instead of $50. Under paragraph (b) of this section, the IRS may determine that the rules of subchapter C of chapter 63 do not apply to the Contribution and make a determination about the Contribution (which is a
partnership-related item under § 301.6241-1(a)(6)(v)(C)) as part of an adjustment to A's adjusted basis in its interest in Partnership (which is not a partnership-related item). The IRS may make this determination because Partnership's reported basis in Asset was based on the information provided by A. Because A's adjusted basis in A's interest in Partnership is reduced to $30, the total gain from the sale of A's interest in Partnership is increased to $70 ($50 as originally reported plus $20 as adjusted by the IRS). In accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section, if A's basis in its interest in Partnership is adjusted based on a determination about the Contribution, Partnership and the other partners of Partnership are not bound by any determination regarding the Contribution resulting from the examination of A and no adjustment is required to be made to their returns under this section.
(c)
Termination and jeopardy assessment.
For any taxable year of a partner or indirect partner for which an assessment of income tax under section 6851 or section 6861 is made, the IRS may adjust any partnership-related item with respect to such partner or indirect partner as part of making an assessment of income tax under section 6851 or section 6861 without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63.
(d)
Criminal investigations.
For any taxable year of a partner or indirect partner for which the partner or indirect partner is under criminal investigation, the IRS may adjust any partnership-related item with respect to such partner or indirect partner without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63.
(e)
Indirect methods of proof of income.
The IRS may adjust any partnership-related item as part of a determination of any deficiency (or portion thereof) of the partner or indirect partner that is based on an indirect method of proof of income without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63.
(f)
Special relationships and extensions of the partner's period of limitations.
If the period of limitations under section 6235 on making partnership adjustments has expired for a taxable year, the IRS may adjust any partnership-related item that relates to any item or amount for which the partner's period of limitations on assessment of tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code (chapter 1) has not expired for the taxable year of the partner or indirect partner, without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63 if—
(1) The direct or indirect partner is related to the partnership under section 267(b) or 707(b); or
(2) Under section 6501(c)(4), the direct or indirect partner agrees, in writing, to extend the partner's section 6501 period of limitations on assessment for the taxable year but only if the agreement expressly provides that the partner is extending the time to adjust and assess any tax attributable to partnership-related items for the taxable year.
(g)
Penalties and taxes imposed on the partnership under chapter 1.
The IRS may adjust any tax, penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts imposed on, and which are the liability of the partnership under chapter 1 without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63. The IRS may also make determinations about any partnership-related item, without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63, as part of any adjustment made to the amount and applicability of the tax, penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount imposed on the partnership being determined without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63. Any determinations under this paragraph (g) will be treated as a determination under a chapter of the Code other than chapter 1 for purposes of § 301.6241-6.
(h)
Determination that subchapter C of chapter 63 does not apply
—(1)
Notification.
If the IRS determines, in accordance with paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section, that some or all of the rules under subchapter C of chapter 63 do not apply to any partnership-related item (or portion thereof), then the IRS will notify, in writing, the taxpayer to whom the adjustments are being made.
(2)
Effect of adjustments not made under subchapter C of chapter 63.
Any final decision with respect to any partnership-related item adjusted in a proceeding not under subchapter C of chapter 63 is not binding on any person that is not a party to the proceeding. For example, if the partnership or any
other partner does not become a party to a partner-level proceeding conducted as a result of the application of this section, the partnership and those other partners are not bound to the adjustments determined in the partner-level proceeding.
(i)
Coordination with adjustments made at the partnership level.
This section will not apply to the extent the partner can demonstrate adjustments to partnership-related items included in the deficiency or an adjustment by the IRS were—
(1) Previously taken into account under subchapter C of chapter 63 by the person being examined; or
(2) Included in an imputed underpayment paid by a partnership (or pass-through partner) for any taxable year in which the partner was a reviewed year partner or indirect partner but only if the amount included in the deficiency or adjustment exceeds the amount reported by the partnership to the partner that was either reported by the partner or indirect partner or is otherwise included in the deficiency or adjustment determined by the IRS.
(j)
Elections resulting in payments to a partnership.
The IRS may adjust any election that results or could result in a payment to the partnership in lieu of a Federal tax credit or deduction without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63. The IRS may also make determinations, without regard to subchapter C of chapter 63, about the payment itself as well as any partnership-related item relevant to adjusting the election or the payment.
(k)
Applicability date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (k)(2) (relating to paragraph (b) of this section) and (k)(3) of this section (relating to paragraph (j) of this section), this section applies to partnership taxable years ending on or after November 20, 2020. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, upon agreement between the partner under examination and the IRS, any provision of this section except for paragraph (b) of this section may apply to any taxable year of a partner that relates to a partnership taxable year subject to subchapter C of chapter 63 (as amended) that ended before November 20, 2020. In addition, a partnership and the IRS may agree to apply paragraph (g) to any partnership taxable year ended before November 20, 2020, that is subject to subchapter C of chapter 63, as amended.
(2)
Partnership-related items underlying items that are not partnership-related items.
Paragraph (b) of this section applies to partnership taxable years beginning after December 20, 2018. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, upon agreement between the partner under examination and the IRS, paragraph (b) of this section may apply to any taxable year of a partner that relates to a partnership taxable year subject to subchapter C of chapter 63, as amended, that ended on or before December 20, 2018.
(3)
Elections resulting in payments to a partnership.
Paragraph (j) of this section applies to taxable years ending on or after June 21, 2023.

[75 FR 75904, Dec. 7, 2010]
§ 301.6303-1
Notice and demand for tax.
(a)
General rule.
Where it is not otherwise provided by the Code, the district director or the director of the regional service center shall, after the making of an assessment of a tax pursuant to section 6203, give notice to each person liable for the unpaid tax, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof. Such notice shall be given as soon as possible and within 60 days. However, the failure to give notice within 60 days does not invalidate the notice. Such notice shall be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such person, or shall be sent by mail to such person's last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see § 301.6212-2.
(b)
Assessment prior to last date for payment.

[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 8939, 66 FR 2820, Jan. 12, 2001]
§ 301.6305-1
Assessment and collection of certain liability.
(a)
Scope.
Section 6305(a) requires the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate to assess and collect amounts which have been certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as the amount of a delinquency determined under a court order, or an order of an administrative process established under State law, for support and maintenance of a child or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living. These amounts, referred to as “child and spousal support”, are to be collected in the same manner and with the same powers exercised by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate in the collection of an employment tax which would be jeopardized by delay. However, where the assessment is the first assessment against an individual for a delinquency described in this paragraph for a particular individual or individuals, the collection is to be stayed for a period of 60 days following notice and demand. In addition, no interest or penalties (with the exception of the penalties imposed by sections 6332(c)(2) and 6657) shall be assessed or collected on the amounts, paragraphs (4), (6) and (8) of section 6334(a) (relating to property exempt from levy) shall not apply; and, there shall be exempt from levy so much of the salary, wages, or other income of the individual which is subject to garnishment pursuant to a judgment entered by a court for the support of his or her minor children. Section 6305(b) provides that sole jurisdiction for any action brought to restrain or review assessment and collection of the certified amounts shall be in a State court or a State administrative agency.
(b)
Assessment and collection
—(1)
General rule.
Upon receipt of a certification or recertification from the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his delegate under section 452(b) of title IV of the Social Security Act as amended (relating to collection of child and spousal support obligations with respect to an individual), the district director or his delegate shall assess and collect the certified amount (or recertified amount). Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the amount so certified shall be assessed and collected in the same manner, with the same powers, and subject to the same limitations as if the amount were an employment tax the collection of which would be jeopardized by delay. However, the provisions of subtitle F with respect to assessment and collection of taxes shall not apply with respect to assessment and collection of a certified amount where such provisions are clearly inappropriate to, and incompatible with, the collection of certified amounts generally. For example, section 6861(g) which allows the Secretary or his delegate to abate a jeopardy assessment if he finds a jeopardy does not exist will not apply.
(2)
Method of assessment.
An assessment officer appointed by the district director pursuant to § 301.6203-1 to make assessments of tax shall also make assessments of certified amounts. The assessment of a certified
amount shall be made by the assessment officer signing the summary record of assessment. The date of assessment is the date the summary record is signed by the assessment officer. The summary record, through supporting records as necessary, shall provide—
(i) The assessed amount;
(ii) The name, social security number, and last known address of the individual owing the assessed amount. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see § 301.6212-2;
(iii) A designation of the assessed amount as a certified amount, together with the date on which the amount was certified and the name, position, and governmental address of the officer of the Department of Health and Human Services who certified the amount;
(iv) The period to which the child and spousal support obligation represented by the certified amount relates;
(v) The State in which was entered the court or administrative order giving rise to the child and spousal support obligation represented by the certified amount;
(vi) The name of the person or persons to whom the child and spousal support obligation represented by the certified amount is owed; and
(vii) The name of the child or children or the parent of the child or children for whose benefit the child and spousal support obligation exists.
Upon request, the individual assessed shall be furnished a copy of pertinent parts of this assessment which set forth the information listed in subdivision (i) through (vii) of this paragraph (b)(2).
(3)
Supplemental assessments and abatements.
If any assessment is incomplete or incorrect in any material respect, the district director or his delegate may make a supplemental assessment or abatement but only for the purpose of completing or correcting the original assessment. A supplemental assessment will not be used as a substitute for an additional assessment against an individual.
(4)
Method of collection.
(i) The district director or his delegate shall make notice and demand for immediate payment of certified amounts. Upon failure or refusal to pay such amounts, collection by levy shall be lawful without regard to the 10-day waiting period provided in section 6331(a). However, in the case of certain first assessments, paragraph (c)(4) of this section provides a rule for a stay of collection for 60 days. For purposes of collection, refunds of any internal revenue tax owed to the individual may be offset against a certified amount.
(ii) The district director or his delegate shall make diligent and reasonable efforts to collect certified amounts as if such amounts were taxes. He shall have no authority to compromise a proceeding by collection of only part of a certified amount in satisfaction of the full certified amount owing. However, he may arrange for payment of a certified amount by installments where advisable.
(iii) The district director or his delegate may offset the amount of any overpayment of any internal revenue tax (as described in section 301.6401-1) to be refunded to the person making the overpayment by the amount of any past-due support (as defined in the regulations under section 6402) owed by the person making the overpayment. The amounts offset under section 6402(c) may be amounts of child and spousal support certified (or recertified) for collection under section 6305 and this section or they may be amounts of past-due support of which the Secretary of the Treasury has been notified under section 6402(c) and the regulations under that section.
(5)
Credits or refunds.
In the case of any overpayment of a certified amount, the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, within the period of limitations for credit or refund of employment taxes, may credit the amount of the overpayment against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the part of the individual who made the overpayment and shall refund any balance to the individual. However, the full amount of any overpayment collected by levy upon property described in paragraph (c)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section shall be refunded to the individual. For
purposes of applying this subparagraph, the rules of § 301.6402-2 apply where appropriate.
(6)
Disposition of certified amounts collected.
Any certified amount collected shall be deposited in the general fund of the United States, and the officer of the Department of Health and Human Services who certified the amount shall be promptly notified of its collection. There shall be established in the Treasury, pursuant to section 452 of title IV of the Social Security Act as amended, a revolving fund which shall be available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his delegate, without fiscal year limitation, for distribution to the States in accordance with the provisions of section 457 of the Act. Section 452(c)(2) of the Act appropriates to this revolving fund out of any monies not otherwise appropriated, amounts equal to the certified amounts collected under this paragraph reduced by the amounts credited or refunded as overpayments of the certified amounts so collected. The certified amounts deposited shall be transferred at least quarterly from the general fund of the Treasury to the revolving fund on the basis of estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. Proper adjustments shall be made in the amounts subsequently transferred to the extent prior estimates were in excess of or less than the amounts required to be transferred. See, however, paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the special rule requiring retention in the general fund of certain penalties which may be collected.
(c)
Additional limitations and conditions
—(1)
Interest and penalties.
No interest, penalties or additional amounts, other than normal and reasonable collection costs, may be assessed or collected in addition to the certified amount, other than the penalty imposed by section 6332(c)(2) for failure to surrender property subject to levy and the penalty imposed by section 6657 for the tender of bad checks. Any such penalties and collection costs, if collected, will not be treated as part of the certified amount and will be retained by the United States as a part of its general fund. No interest shall be allowed or paid on any overpayment of a certified amount.
(2)
Property not exempt from levy.
In addition to property not exempt from levy under section 6334(c) and the regulations thereunder, the following property shall not be exempt from a levy to collect a certified amount:
(i) Unemployment benefits described in section 6334(a)(4);
(ii) Certain annuities and pension payments described in section 6334(a)(6); or
(iii) Salary, wages, or other income described in section 6334(a)(8).
(3)
Property exempt from levy.
In addition to property exempt from levy under section 6334(a) and the regulations thereunder, other than property described in paragraph (c)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, there shall be exempt from levy to collect a certified amount so much of the salary, wages, or other income of an individual as is withheld therefrom in garnishment pursuant to judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction for the support of minor children of the individual.
(4)
First assessment.
In the case of a first assessment against an individual for a certified amount in whole or part for the benefit of a particular child or children or the child or children and their parent, the collection of the certified amount shall be stayed for the period of 60 days immediately following notice and demand as described in section 6303. However, no other stay of the collection of a certified amount may be granted. Thus, the provisions of section 6863(a), relating to bonds to stay collection of jeopardy assessments, shall not apply to the collection of certified amounts.
(5)
Priority of liens.
A lien for a certified amount shall be valid as against a lien for taxes imposed by section 6321 only if the date of assessment of the certified amount precedes the date of assessment of the taxes. However, no amount collected by levy upon property described in paragraph (c)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section may be applied other than in whole or partial satisfaction of certified amounts. In the case of two liens for certified amounts, the lien for the certified amount which is first assessed shall be valid as against the lien for the certified amount which is later assessed.
(6)
Statute of limitations on collections.
The periods of limitation on collection of taxes after assessment prescribed by section 6502 shall apply to the collection of certified (or recertified) amounts. Such periods of limitation with respect to a certified amount shall terminate upon recertification of the amount, and the period of limitation prescribed by section 6502 shall then apply and commence to run with respect to the recertified amount.
(d)
Review of assessments and collections
—(1)
Federal courts.
No court of the United States established under article I or article III of the Constitution has jurisdiction of any legal or equitable action to restrain or review the assessment or collection of certified amounts by the district director or his delegate. See, however, paragraph (d)(3) of this section for the rule that the prohibition of this paragraph (d)(1) does not preclude courts established for the District of Columbia from exercising jurisdiction over certain actions.
(2)
Secretary of the Treasury.
Neither the Secretary of the Treasury nor his delegate may subject to review the assessment or collection of certified amounts in any legal, equitable, or administrative proceeding.
(3)
State courts.
This paragraph (d) does not preclude a State court or appropriate State agency, as the case may be, from exercising jurisdiction over a legal, equitable, or administrative action against the State by an individual to determine his liability for any certified amount assessed against him and collected, or to recover any such certified amount collected, under section 6305 and this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “State” includes the District of Columbia.
(e)
Internal Revenue regional service centers.
For purposes of this section, the terms “district director or his delegate” and “district director” include the director of the Internal Revenue service center or his delegate, as the case may be.

—(1)
In general.
(i) District directors, Service Center directors, and Compliance Center directors (director) may accept checks or drafts drawn on any financial institution incorporated under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, or any possession of the United States, or money orders in payment for internal revenue taxes, provided the checks, drafts, or money orders are collectible in United States currency at par, and subject to the further provisions contained in this section. The director may accept the checks, drafts, or money orders in payment for internal revenue stamps to the extent and under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. A check or money order in payment for internal revenue taxes or internal revenue stamps should be made payable to the United States Treasury.

(a) Treasury certificates of indebtedness, Treasury notes, or Treasury bills of any series (not including interim receipts issued by Federal reserve banks in lieu of definitive certificates, notes, or bills) may be tendered at or before maturity in payment of internal revenue taxes due on the date (or in payment for stamps purchased on the date), on which the certificates, notes, or bills mature, or in payment of internal revenue taxes due on a specified prior date, but only if such certificates, notes, or bills, according to the express terms of their issue, are made acceptable in payment of such taxes or for the purchase of stamps. If the taxes for which the certificates, notes, or bills are tendered in payment become due, or the stamps are purchased, on the same date as that on which such certificates, notes, or bills mature, they will be accepted at par plus accrued interest, if any, payable with the principal (not represented by coupons attached) in payment of such taxes or stamps. If the taxes for which the certificates, notes, or bills are tendered in payment become due, or the stamps are purchased, on a date prior to that on which the certificates, notes, or bills mature, they will be accepted at the value specified in the terms under which such certificates, notes, or bills were issued. All interest coupons attached to Treasury certificates of indebtedness or Treasury notes shall be detached by the taxpayer before such certificates or notes are tendered in payment of taxes or stamps.
(b) Receipts given by a district director for Treasury certificates of indebtedness, Treasury notes, or Treasury bills received in payment of internal revenue taxes or for stamps as provided in this section shall contain an adequate description of such certificates, notes, or bills, and a statement of the value, including accrued interest, if any, payable with the principal (not represented by coupons attached), at which accepted, and shall show that the certificates, notes, or bills are tendered by the taxpayer and received by the district director, subject to no conditions, qualification, or reservation whatsoever, in payment of an amount of taxes or for stamps no greater than such value. Any certificate, note, or bill offered in payment of internal revenue taxes or for stamps subject to any condition, qualification, or reservation, or for any greater amount than the value at which acceptable in payment of taxes or stamps, as specified in the terms under which such certificate, note, or bill was issued, shall not be
deemed to be duly tendered and shall be returned to the taxpayer.
(c) For the purpose of saving taxpayers the expense of transmitting Treasury certificates of indebtedness, Treasury notes, or Treasury bills to the office of the district director in whose district the taxes are payable, or stamps are to be purchased, taxpayers desiring to pay taxes, or purchase stamps, with such certificates, notes, or bills acceptable in payment of taxes or for the purchase of stamps may deposit such certificates, notes, or bills with a Federal reserve bank or branch, or with the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, Treasury Building, Washington, D.C. In such cases, the Federal reserve bank or branch, or the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, shall issue a receipt in the name of the district director, describing the certificates, notes, or bills by par or dollar face amount and stating on the face of the receipt that the certificates, notes, or bills represented thereby are held by the bank or branch, or the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, for redemption at the value specified in the terms under which the certificates, notes, or bills were issued, and for application of the proceeds in payment of taxes due or for the purchase of stamps on a specified date by the taxpayer named therein.
(d) In the case of payments of tax required to be deposited with Government depositaries by regulations under section 6302 of the Code, certificates, notes, or bills referred to in paragraph (a) of this section may be deposited with a Federal Reserve bank or branch, or with the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, in part or full satisfaction of such tax liability.

§ 301.6314-1
Receipt for taxes.

See paragraph (c) of § 301.6316-5.
§ 301.6316-5
Manner of paying tax by foreign currency.
(a)
Time and place to pay.
The unpaid tax required to be shown on a return filed in accordance with § 301.6316-4, whether payable in whole or in part in foreign currency, is due and payable to the Director of International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. 20225, at the time the return is filed. However, see paragraph (d) of this section with respect to the depositing of the foreign currency with the disbursing officer of the Department of State.
(b)
Certified statement.
Every taxpayer who desires to pay tax in foreign currency under the provisions of § 301.6316-1 shall first obtain the certified statement referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of § 301.6316-4.
(c)
Determination of the tax.
In determining the tax payable for the taxable year in U.S. dollars, the taxpayer, with respect to amounts described in paragraph (a) of § 301.6316-1, or amounts described in paragraph (b) of § 301.6316-1 received before November 1, 1965, shall use the rates of exchange which most clearly reflect the correct tax liability in dollars, whether it be the official rate, the open market rate, or any other appropriate rate. With respect to amounts described in paragraph (b) of § 301.6316-1 received on or after November 1, 1965, the taxpayer shall use the official rate of exchange in determining the tax payable for the taxable year in U.S. dollars. After determining the correct tax liability in U.S. dollars the taxpayer shall then ascertain, in accordance with the principles of § 301.6316-3, the portion of the tax which is attributable to amounts received in nonconvertible foreign currency.
(d)
Deposit of foreign currency with disbursing officer.
(1) After the portion of the tax which is attributable to amounts received in nonconvertible foreign currency is determined in U.S. dollars, the amount so determined shall be deposited in the same nonconvertible foreign currency with the disbursing officer of the Department of State for the foreign country where the fund is located from which the payments in nonconvertible foreign currency are made to the taxpayer. The amount of foreign currency to be deposited shall be that amount which, when converted at the rate of exchange used on the date of deposit by that disbursing officer for the acquisition of such currency for his official disbursements, equals the portion of the tax so determined in U.S. dollars.
(2) The disbursing officer may rely upon the taxpayer for the determination of the amount of tax payable in foreign currency but may not accept any such currency for deposit until the taxpayer has presented for inspection the certified statement referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of § 301.6316-4. Upon acceptance of foreign currency for deposit the disbursing officer shall give the taxpayer a receipt in duplicate showing the name and address of the depositor, the date of the deposit, the amount of foreign currency deposited, and its equivalent in U.S. dollars on the date of deposit.
(3) Every taxpayer making a deposit of foreign currency in accordance with this paragraph shall attach to the return required to be filed in accordance with § 301.6316-4, in part or full payment of the taxes shown thereon, the
original of the receipt given by the disbursing officer and shall pay to the Director of International Operations in U.S. dollars the balance, if any, of the tax shown to be due. Tender of such receipt to the Director of International Operations shall be considered as payment of tax in an amount equal to the U.S. dollars represented by the receipt.
(4) A taxpayer shall make the deposit required by this paragraph in ample time to permit him to attach the receipt to his return for filing within the time prescribed by section 6072 or 6081 and §§ 1.6072-1, 1.6081-1, and 1.6081-2 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations).
§ 301.6316-6
Declarations of estimated tax.
(a)
Filing of declaration.
A declaration of estimated tax in respect of amounts on which the tax is to be paid in foreign currency under the provisions of § 301.6316-1 shall be filed with the Director of International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. 20225, and shall have attached thereto the statements required by paragraph (b) (1) and (2)(i) of § 301.6316-4 in respect of the tax return except that the statement certified by the foundation, commission, or other person having control of the payments to the taxpayer in nonconvertible foreign currency may be based upon amounts expected to be received by the taxpayer during the taxable year if they are not in fact known at the time of certification. A copy of this certified statement shall be retained by the taxpayer for the purpose of exhibiting it to the disbursing officer when making installment deposits of foreign currency under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. For the time for filing declarations of estimated tax, see sections 6073 and 6081 and §§ 1.6073-1 to 1.6073-4, inclusive, and §§ 1.6081-1 and 1.6081-2 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations).

Cross references.
For the place for filing returns of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes, see § 31.6091-

(c)
Payment of tax
—(1)
Determination of the tax.
In determining in U.S. dollars the wages required to be reported on the return and the taxes due with respect thereto, the taxpayer shall use the rate of exchange which most clearly reflects the correct equivalent in dollars, whether it be the official rate, the open market rate, or any other appropriate rate.
(2)
Deposit of foreign currency with disbursing officer.
(i) After determination is made in U.S. dollars of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes with respect to wages paid in nonconvertible foreign currency, the amount so determined shall be deposited in the same nonconvertible foreign currency with the disbursing officer of the Department of State for the foreign country where the fund is located from which such wages were paid. The amount of the foreign currency to be deposited shall be that amount which, when converted at the rate of exchange used on the date of deposit by the disbursing officer for the acquisition of such currency for his official disbursements, equals the taxes determined in U.S. dollars.
(ii) The disbursing officer may rely upon the taxpayer for the determination of the amount of tax payable in foreign currency but may not accept any such currency for deposit until the taxpayer has presented for inspection the certified statement referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Upon acceptance of foreign currency for deposit the disbursing officer shall give the taxpayer a receipt in duplicate showing the name and address of the depositor, the date of the deposit, the amount of foreign currency deposited and its equivalent in U.S. dollars on the date of deposit, and the kind of tax for which the deposit is made.
(iii) Every taxpayer making a deposit of foreign currency in accordance with this paragraph shall attach to the return required to be filed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section the original of the receipt given by the disbursing officer. Tender of such receipt to the Director of International Operations shall be considered as payment of tax in an amount equal to the U.S. dollars represented by the receipt.
(iv) A taxpayer shall make the deposit required by this paragraph in ample time to permit it to attach the receipt to its return for filing within the time prescribed by § 31.6071(a)-1 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).
§ 301.6316-8
Refunds and credits in foreign currency.
(a)
Refunds.
The refund of any overpayment of tax which has been paid under section 6316 in foreign currency may, in the discretion of the Commissioner, be made in the same foreign currency by which the tax was paid. The amount of any such refund made in foreign currency shall be the amount of the overpayment in U.S. dollars converted, on the date of the refund check, at the rate of exchange then used for his official disbursements by the disbursing officer of the Department of State in the country where the foreign currency was originally deposited.
(b)
Credits.
Unless otherwise in the best interest of the Internal Revenue Service, no credit of any overpayment of tax which has been paid under section 6316 in foreign currency shall be allowed against any outstanding liability of the person making the overpayment except in respect of that portion or the liability which, in accordance with § 301.6316-1 or § 301.6316-7, would otherwise be permitted to be paid in the same foreign currency.
§ 301.6316-9
Interest, additions to tax, etc.
Any reference in §§ 301.6316-1 to 301.6316-8, inclusive, to “tax” shall be deemed also to refer to the interest, additions to the tax, additional amounts, and penalties attributable to the tax.

# Lien for Taxes
§ 301.6320-1
Notice and opportunity for hearing upon filing of notice of Federal tax lien.
(a)
Notification
—(1)
In general.
For a notice of Federal tax lien (NFTL) filed
on or after January 19, 1999, the Commissioner, or his or her delegate (the Commissioner), will prescribe procedures to notify the person described in section 6321 of the filing of a NFTL not more than five business days after the date of any such filing. The Collection Due Process Hearing Notice (CDP Notice) and other notices given under section 6320 must be given in person, left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such person, or sent by certified or registered mail to such person's last known address, not more than five business days after the day the NFTL was filed. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see Sec. 301.6212-2.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (a) as follows:
Q-A1. Who is the person entitled to notice under section 6320?
A-A1. Under section 6320(a)(1), notification of the filing of a NFTL on or after January 19, 1999, is required to be given only to the person described in section 6321 who is named on the NFTL that is filed. The person described in section 6321 is the person liable to pay the tax due after notice and demand who refuses or neglects to pay the tax due (hereinafter, referred to as the taxpayer).
Q-A2. When will the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provide the notice required under section 6320?
A-A2. The IRS will provide this notice within five business days after the filing of the NFTL.
Q-A3. Will the IRS give notification to the taxpayer for each tax period listed in a NFTL filed on or after January 19, 1999?
A-A3. Yes. A NFTL can be filed for more than one tax period. The notification of the filing of a NFTL will specify each unpaid tax and tax period listed in the NFTL.
Q-A4. Will the IRS give notification to the taxpayer of any filing of a NFTL for the same tax period or periods at another place of filing?
A-A4. Yes. The IRS will notify a taxpayer when a NFTL is filed on or after January 19, 1999, for a tax period or periods at any recording office.
Q-A5. Will the IRS give notification to the taxpayer if a NFTL is filed on or after January 19, 1999, for a tax period or periods for which a NFTL was filed in another recording office prior to that date?
A-A5. Yes. The IRS will notify a taxpayer when each NFTL is filed on or after January 19, 1999, for a tax period or periods at any recording office.
Q-A6. Will the IRS give notification to the taxpayer when a NFTL is refiled on or after January 19, 1999?
A-A6. No. Section 6320(a)(1) does not require the IRS to notify the taxpayer of the refiling of a NFTL. A taxpayer may, however, seek reconsideration by the IRS office that is collecting the tax or refiling the NFTL, an administrative hearing before the IRS Office of Appeals (Appeals), or assistance from the National Taxpayer Advocate.
Q-A7. Will the IRS give notification to a known nominee of, or a person holding property of, the taxpayer of the filing of the NFTL?
A-A7. No. Such person is not the person described in section 6321 and, therefore, is not entitled to notice, but such persons have other remedies. See A-B5 of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
Q-A8. Will the IRS give notification to the taxpayer when a subsequent NFTL is filed for the same period or periods?
A-A8. Yes. If the IRS files an additional NFTL with respect to the same tax period or periods for which an original NFTL was filed, the IRS will notify the taxpayer when the subsequent NFTL is filed. Not all such notices will, however, give rise to a right to a CDP hearing (see paragraph (b) of this section).
Q-A9. How will notification under section 6320 be accomplished?
A-A9. The IRS will notify the taxpayer by letter. Included with this letter will be the additional information the IRS is required to provide taxpayers as well as, when appropriate, a Form 12153, Request for a Due Process Hearing. The IRS may effect delivery of the letter (and accompanying materials) in one of three ways: by delivering the notice personally to the taxpayer; by leaving the notice at the taxpayer's dwelling or usual place of business; or by mailing the notice to the taxpayer at his last known address by certified or registered mail.
Q-A10. What must a CDP Notice given under section 6320 include?
A-A10. These notices must include, in simple and nontechnical terms:
(i) The amount of the unpaid tax.
(ii) A statement concerning the taxpayer's right to request a CDP hearing during the 30-day period that commences the day after the end of the five business day period within which the IRS is required to provide the taxpayer with notice of the filing of the NFTL.
(iii) The administrative appeals available to the taxpayer with respect to the NFTL and the procedures relating to such appeals.
(iv) The statutory provisions and the procedures relating to the release of liens on property.
Q-A11. What are the consequences if the taxpayer does not receive or accept a CDP Notice that is properly left at the taxpayer's dwelling or usual place of business, or sent by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer's last known address?
A-A11. A CDP Notice properly sent by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer's last known address or left at the taxpayer's dwelling or usual place of business is sufficient to start the 30-day period, commencing the day after the end of the five business day notification period, within which the taxpayer may request a CDP hearing. Actual receipt is not a prerequisite to the validity of the CDP Notice.
Q-A12. What if the taxpayer does not receive the CDP Notice because the IRS did not send that notice by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer's last known address, or failed to leave it at the dwelling or usual place of business of the taxpayer, and the taxpayer fails to request a CDP hearing with Appeals within the 30-day period commencing the day after the end of the five business day notification period?
A-A12. A NFTL becomes effective upon filing. The validity and priority of a NFTL is not conditioned on notification to the taxpayer pursuant to section 6320. Therefore, the failure to notify the taxpayer concerning the filing of a NFTL does not affect the validity or priority of the NFTL. When the IRS determines that it failed properly to provide a taxpayer with a CDP Notice, it will promptly provide the taxpayer with a substitute CDP Notice and provide the taxpayer with an opportunity to request a CDP hearing. Substitute CDP Notices are discussed in Q
A-B3 of paragraph (b)(2) and Q
A-C8 of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (a):

# Example 1.
H and W are jointly and severally liable with respect to a jointly filed income tax return for 1996. IRS files a NFTL with respect to H and W in County X on January 26, 1999. This is the first NFTL filed on or after January 19, 1999, for their 1996 liability. H and W will each be notified of the filing of the NFTL.

# Example 2.
Employment taxes for 1997 are assessed against ABC Corporation. A NFTL is filed against ABC Corporation for the 1997 liability in County X on June 5, 1998. A NFTL is filed against ABC Corporation for the 1997 liability in County Y on June 17, 1999. The IRS will notify the ABC Corporation with respect to the filing of the NFTL in County Y.

# Example 3.
Federal income tax liability for 1997 is assessed against individual D. D buys an asset and puts it in individual E's name. A NFTL is filed against D in County X on June 5, 1999, for D's federal income tax liability for 1997. On June 17, 1999, a NFTL for the same tax liability is filed in County Y against E, as nominee of D. The IRS will notify D of the filing of the NFTL in both County X and County Y. The IRS will not notify E of the NFTL filed in County X. The IRS is not required to notify E of the NFTL filed in County Y. Although E is named on the NFTL filed in County Y, E is not the person described in section 6321 (the taxpayer) who is named on the NFTL.
(b)
Entitlement to a CDP hearing
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer is entitled to one CDP hearing with respect to the first filing of a NFTL (on or after January 19, 1999) for a given tax period or periods with respect to the unpaid tax shown on the NFTL if the taxpayer timely requests such a hearing. The taxpayer must request such a hearing during the 30-day period that commences the day after the end of the five business day period within which the IRS is required to provide the taxpayer with notice of the filing of the NFTL.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b) as follows:
Q-B1. Is a taxpayer entitled to a CDP hearing with respect to the filing of a
NFTL for a type of tax and tax periods previously subject to a CDP Notice with respect to a NFTL filed in a different location on or after January 19, 1999?
A-B1. No. Although the taxpayer will receive notice of each filing of a NFTL, under section 6320(b)(2), the taxpayer is entitled to only one CDP hearing under section 6320 for the type of tax and tax periods with respect to the first filing of a NFTL that occurs on or after January 19, 1999, with respect to that unpaid tax. Accordingly, if the taxpayer does not timely request a CDP hearing with respect to the first filing of a NFTL on or after January 19, 1999, for a given tax period or periods with respect to an unpaid tax, the taxpayer forgoes the right to a CDP hearing with Appeals and judicial review of the Appeals determination with respect to the NFTL. Under such circumstances, the taxpayer may request an equivalent hearing as described in paragraph (i) of this section.
Q-B2. Is the taxpayer entitled to a CDP hearing when a NFTL for an unpaid tax is filed on or after January 19, 1999, in one recording office and a NFTL was previously filed for the same unpaid tax in another recording office prior to that date?
A-B2. Yes. Under section 6320(b)(2), the taxpayer is entitled to a CDP hearing under section 6320 for each tax period with respect to the first filing of a NFTL on or after January 19, 1999, with respect to an unpaid tax, whether or not a NFTL was filed prior to January 19, 1999, for the same unpaid tax and tax period or periods.
Q-B3. When the IRS provides the taxpayer with a substitute CDP Notice and the taxpayer timely requests a CDP hearing, is the taxpayer entitled to a CDP hearing before Appeals?
A-B3. Yes. Unless the taxpayer provides the IRS a written withdrawal of the request that Appeals conduct a CDP hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to a CDP hearing before Appeals. Following the hearing, Appeals will issue a Notice of Determination, and the taxpayer is entitled to seek judicial review of that Notice of Determination.
Q-B4. If the IRS sends a second CDP Notice under section 6320 (other than a substitute CDP Notice) for a tax period and with respect to an unpaid tax for which a section 6320 CDP Notice was previously sent, is the taxpayer entitled to a section 6320 CDP hearing based on the second CDP Notice?
A-B4. No. The taxpayer is entitled to a CDP hearing under section 6320 for each tax period only with respect to the first filing of a NFTL on or after January 19, 1999, with respect to an unpaid tax.
Q-B5. Is a nominee of, or a person holding property of, the taxpayer entitled to a CDP hearing or an equivalent hearing?
A-B5. No. Such person is not the person described in section 6321 and is, therefore, not entitled to a CDP hearing or an equivalent hearing (as discussed in paragraph (i) of this section). Such person, however, may seek reconsideration by the IRS office collecting the tax or filing the NFTL, an administrative hearing before Appeals under its Collection Appeals Program, or assistance from the National Taxpayer Advocate. However, any such administrative hearing would not be a CDP hearing under section 6320 and any determination or decision resulting from the hearing would not be subject to judicial review under section 6320. Such person also may avail himself of the administrative procedure included in section 6325(b)(4) or of any other procedures to which he is entitled.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1.
H and W are jointly and severally liable with respect to a jointly filed income tax return for 1996. The IRS files a NFTL with respect to H and W in County X on January 26, 1999. This is the first NFTL filed on or after January 19, 1999, for their 1996 liability. H and W are each entitled to a CDP hearing with respect to the NFTL filed in County X. On June 17, 1999, a NFTL for the same tax liability is filed against H and W in County Y. The IRS will give H and W notification of the NFTL filed in County Y. H and W, however, are not entitled to a CDP hearing or an equivalent hearing with respect to the NFTL filed in County Y.

# Example 2.
Federal income tax liability for 1997 is assessed against individual D. D buys an asset and puts it in individual E's name. A NFTL is filed against E, as nominee of D in County X on June 5, 1999, for D's federal income tax liability for 1997. The IRS will give D a CDP Notice with respect to the
NFTL filed in County X. The IRS will not notify E of the NFTL filed in County X. The IRS is not required to notify E of the filing of the NFTL in County X. Although E is named on the NFTL filed in County X, E is not the person described in section 6321 (the taxpayer) who is named on the NFTL.
(c)
Requesting a CDP hearing
—(1)
In general.
When a taxpayer is entitled to a CDP hearing under section 6320, the CDP hearing must be requested during the 30-day period that commences the day after the end of the five business day period within which the IRS is required to provide the taxpayer with a CDP Notice with respect to the filing of the NFTL.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (c) as follows:
Q-C1. What must a taxpayer do to obtain a CDP hearing?
A-C1. (i) The taxpayer must make a request in writing for a CDP hearing. The request for a CDP hearing shall include the information and signature specified in A-C1(ii) of this paragraph (c)(2). See A-D7 and A-D8 of paragraph (d)(2).
(ii) The written request for a CDP hearing must be dated and must include the following:
(A) The taxpayer's name, address, daytime telephone number (if any), and taxpayer identification number (e.g., SSN, ITIN or EIN).
(B) The type of tax involved.
(C) The tax period at issue.
(D) A statement that the taxpayer requests a hearing with Appeals concerning the filing of the NFTL.
(E) The reason or reasons why the taxpayer disagrees with the filing of the NFTL.
(F) The signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative.
(iii) If the IRS receives a timely written request for CDP hearing that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in A-C1(ii) of this paragraph (c)(2), the IRS will make a reasonable attempt to contact the taxpayer and request that the taxpayer comply with the unsatisfied requirements. The taxpayer must perfect any timely written request for a CDP hearing that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in A-C1(ii) of this paragraph (c)(2) within a reasonable period of time after a request from the IRS.
(iv) Taxpayers are encouraged to use Form 12153, “Request for a Collection Due Process Hearing,” in requesting a CDP hearing so that the request can be readily identified and forwarded to Appeals. Taxpayers may obtain a copy of Form 12153 by contacting the IRS office that issued the CDP Notice, by downloading a copy from the IRS Internet site,
http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f12153.pdf,
or by calling, toll-free, 1-800-829-3676.
(v) The taxpayer must affirm any timely written request for a CDP hearing which is signed or alleged to have been signed on the taxpayer's behalf by the taxpayer's spouse or other unauthorized representative by filing, within a reasonable period of time after a request from the IRS, a signed, written affirmation that the request was originally submitted on the taxpayer's behalf. If the affirmation is filed within a reasonable period of time after a request, the timely CDP hearing request will be considered timely with respect to the non-signing taxpayer. If the affirmation is not filed within a reasonable period of time after a request, the CDP hearing request will be denied with respect to the non-signing taxpayer.
Q-C2. Must the request for the CDP hearing be in writing?
A-C2. Yes. There are several reasons why the request for a CDP hearing must be in writing. The filing of a timely request for a CDP hearing is the first step in what may result in a court proceeding. A written request will provide proof that the CDP hearing was requested and thus permit the court to verify that it has jurisdiction over any subsequent appeal of the Notice of Determination issued by Appeals. In addition, the receipt of the written request will establish the date on which the periods of limitation under section 6502 (relating to collection after assessment), section 6531 (relating to criminal prosecutions), and section 6532 (relating to suits) are suspended as a result of the CDP hearing and any judicial appeal. Moreover, because the IRS anticipates that taxpayers will contact
the IRS office that issued the CDP Notice for further information or assistance in filling out Form 12153, or to attempt to resolve their liabilities prior to going through the CDP hearing process, the requirement of a written request should help prevent any misunderstanding as to whether a CDP hearing has been requested. If the information requested on Form 12153 is furnished by the taxpayer, the written request also will help to establish the issues for which the taxpayer seeks a determination by Appeals.
Q-C3. When must a taxpayer request a CDP hearing with respect to a CDP Notice issued under section 6320?
A-C3. A taxpayer must submit a written request for a CDP hearing within the 30-day period that commences the day after the end of the five business day period following the filing of the NFTL. Any request filed during the five business day period (before the beginning of the 30-day period) will be deemed to be filed on the first day of the 30-day period. The period for submitting a written request for a CDP hearing with respect to a CDP Notice issued under section 6320 is slightly different from the period for submitting a written request for a CDP hearing with respect to a CDP Notice issued under section 6330. For a CDP Notice issued under section 6330, the taxpayer must submit a written request for a CDP hearing within the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the CDP Notice.
Q-C4. How will the timeliness of a taxpayer's written request for a CDP hearing be determined?
A-C4. The rules and regulations under section 7502 and section 7503 will apply to determine the timeliness of the taxpayer's request for a CDP hearing, if properly transmitted and addressed as provided in A-C6 of this paragraph (c)(2).
Q-C5. Is the 30-day period within which a taxpayer must make a request for a CDP hearing extended because the taxpayer resides outside the United States?
A-C5. No. Section 6320 does not make provision for such a circumstance. Accordingly, all taxpayers who want a CDP hearing under section 6320 must request such a hearing within the 30-day period that commences the day after the end of the five business day notification period.
Q-C6. Where must the written request for a CDP hearing be sent?
A-C6. The written request for a CDP hearing must be sent, or hand delivered (if permitted), to the IRS office and address as directed on the CDP Notice. If the address of that office does not appear on the CDP Notice, the taxpayer should obtain the address of the office to which the written request should be sent or hand delivered by calling, toll-free, 1-800-829-1040 and providing the taxpayer's identification number (e.g., SSN, ITIN or EIN).
Q-C7. What will happen if the taxpayer does not request a CDP hearing in writing within the 30-day period that commences the day after the end of the five business day notification period?
A-C7. If the taxpayer does not request a CDP hearing in writing within the 30-day period that commences on the day after the end of the five-business-day notification period, the taxpayer foregoes the right to a CDP hearing under section 6320 with respect to the unpaid tax and tax periods shown on the CDP Notice. A written request submitted within the 30-day period that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in A-C1(ii)(A), (B), (C), (D) or (F) of this paragraph (c)(2) is considered timely if the request is perfected within a reasonable period of time pursuant to A-C1(iii) of this paragraph (c)(2). If the request for CDP hearing is untimely, either because the request was not submitted within the 30-day period or not perfected within the reasonable period provided, the taxpayer will be notified of the untimeliness of the request and offered an equivalent hearing. In such cases, the taxpayer may obtain an equivalent hearing without submitting an additional request. See paragraph (i) of this section.
Q-C8. When must a taxpayer request a CDP hearing with respect to a substitute CDP Notice?
A-C8. A CDP hearing with respect to a substitute CDP Notice must be requested in writing by the taxpayer prior to the end of the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the substitute CDP Notice.
Q-C9. Can taxpayers attempt to resolve the matter of the NFTL with an officer or employee of the IRS office collecting the tax or filing the NFTL either before or after requesting a CDP hearing?
A-C9. Yes. Taxpayers are encouraged to discuss their concerns with the IRS office collecting the tax or filing the NFTL, either before or after they request a CDP hearing. If such a discussion occurs before a request is made for a CDP hearing, the matter may be resolved without the need for Appeals consideration. However, these discussions do not suspend the running of the 30-day period, commencing the day after the end of the five business day notification period, within which the taxpayer is required to request a CDP hearing, nor do they extend that 30-day period. If discussions occur after the request for a CDP hearing is filed and the taxpayer resolves the matter with the IRS office collecting the tax or filing the NFTL, the taxpayer may withdraw in writing the request that a CDP hearing be conducted by Appeals. The taxpayer can also waive in writing some or all of the requirements regarding the contents of the Notice of Determination.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1.
A NFTL for a 1997 income tax liability assessed against individual A is filed in County X on June 17, 1999. The IRS mails a CDP Notice to individual A's last known address on June 18, 1999. Individual A has until July 26, 1999, a Monday, to request a CDP hearing. The five business day period within which the IRS is required to notify individual A of the filing of the NFTL in County X expires on June 24, 1999. The 30-day period within which individual A may request a CDP hearing begins on June 25, 1999. Because the 30-day period expires on July 24, 1999, a Saturday, individual A's written request for a CDP hearing will be considered timely if it is properly transmitted and addressed to the IRS in accordance with section 7502 and the regulations thereunder no later than July 26, 1999.

# Example 2.
Same facts as in
Example 1,
except that individual A is on vacation, outside the United States, or otherwise does not receive or read the CDP Notice until July 19, 1999. As in
Example 1,
individual A has until July 26, 1999, to request a CDP hearing. If individual A does not request a CDP hearing, individual A may request an equivalent hearing as to the NFTL at a later time. The taxpayer should make a request for an equivalent hearing at the earliest possible time.

# Example 3.
Same facts as in
Example 2,
except that individual A does not receive or read the CDP Notice until after July 26, 1999, and does not request a hearing by July 26, 1999. Individual A is not entitled to a CDP hearing. Individual A may request an equivalent hearing as to the NFTL at a later time. The taxpayer should make a request for an equivalent hearing at the earliest possible time.

# Example 4.
Same facts as in
Example 1,
except the IRS determines that the CDP Notice mailed on June 18, 1999, was not mailed to individual A's last known address. As soon as practicable after making this determination, the IRS will mail a substitute CDP Notice to individual A at individual A's last known address, hand deliver the substitute CDP Notice to individual A, or leave the substitute CDP Notice at individual A's dwelling or usual place of business. Individual A will have 30 days commencing on the day after the date of the substitute CDP Notice within which to request a CDP hearing.
(d)
Conduct of CDP hearing
—(1)
In general.
If a taxpayer requests a CDP hearing under section 6320(a)(3)(B) (and does not withdraw that request), the CDP hearing will be held with Appeals. The taxpayer is entitled under section 6320 to a CDP hearing for the unpaid tax and tax periods set forth in a NFTL only with respect to the first filing of a NFTL on or after January 19, 1999. To the extent practicable, the CDP hearing requested under section 6320 will be held in conjunction with any CDP hearing the taxpayer requests under section 6330. A CDP hearing will be conducted by an employee or officer of Appeals who, prior to the first CDP hearing under section 6320 or section 6330, has had no involvement with respect to the unpaid tax for the tax periods to be covered by the hearing, unless the taxpayer waives this requirement.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (d) as follows:
Q-D1. Under what circumstances can a taxpayer receive more than one CDP hearing under section 6320 with respect to a tax period?
A-D1. The taxpayer may receive more than one CDP hearing under section 6320 with respect to a tax period where the tax involved is a different type of tax (for example, an employment tax
liability, where the original CDP hearing for the tax period involved an income tax liability), or where the same type of tax for the same period is involved, but where the amount of the unpaid tax has changed as a result of an additional assessment of tax (not including interest or penalties) for that period or an additional accuracy-related or filing-delinquency penalty has been assessed. The taxpayer is not entitled to another CDP hearing under section 6320 if the additional assessment represents accruals of interest, accruals of penalties, or both.
Q-D2. Will a CDP hearing with respect to one tax period be combined with a CDP hearing with respect to another tax period?
A-D2. To the extent practicable, a CDP hearing with respect to one tax period shown on the NFTL will be combined with any and all other CDP hearings which the taxpayer has requested.
Q-D3. Will a CDP hearing under section 6320 be combined with a CDP hearing under section 6330?
A-D3. To the extent practicable, a CDP hearing under section 6320 will be held in conjunction with a CDP hearing under section 6330.
Q-D4. What is considered to be prior involvement by an employee or officer of Appeals with respect to the unpaid tax and tax period involved in the hearing?
A-D4. Prior involvement by an Appeals officer or employee includes participation or involvement in a matter (other than a CDP hearing held under either section 6320 or section 6330) that the taxpayer may have had with respect to the tax and tax period shown on the CDP Notice. Prior involvement exists only when the taxpayer, the tax and the tax period at issue in the CDP hearing also were at issue in the prior non-CDP matter, and the Appeals officer or employee actually participated in the prior matter.
Q-D5. How can a taxpayer waive the requirement that the officer or employee of Appeals have no prior involvement with respect to the tax and tax periods involved in the CDP hearing?
A-D5. The taxpayer must sign a written waiver.
Q-D6. How are CDP hearings conducted?
A-D6. The formal hearing procedures required under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551
et seq.,
do not apply to CDP hearings. CDP hearings are much like Collection Appeal Program (CAP) hearings in that they are informal in nature and do not require the Appeals officer or employee and the taxpayer, or the taxpayer's representative, to hold a face-to-face meeting. A CDP hearing may, but is not required to, consist of a face-to-face meeting, one or more written or oral communications between an Appeals officer or employee and the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative, or some combination thereof. A transcript or recording of any face-to-face meeting or conversation between an Appeals officer or employee and the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative is not required. The taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative does not have the right to subpoena and examine witnesses at a CDP hearing.
Q-D7. If a taxpayer wants a face-to-face CDP hearing, where will it be held?
A-D7. Except as provided in A-D8 of this paragraph (d)(2), a taxpayer who presents in the CDP hearing request relevant, non-frivolous reasons for disagreement with the NFTL filing will ordinarily be offered an opportunity for a face-to-face conference at the Appeals office closest to taxpayer's residence. A business taxpayer will ordinarily be offered an opportunity for a face-to-face conference at the Appeals office closest to the taxpayer's principal place of business. If that is not satisfactory to the taxpayer, the taxpayer will be given an opportunity for a hearing by telephone or by correspondence. In all cases, the Appeals officer or employee will review the case file, as described in A-F4 of paragraph (f)(2). If no face-to-face or telephonic conference is held, or other oral communication takes place, review of the documents in the case file, as described in A-F4 of paragraph (f)(2), will constitute the CDP hearing for purposes of section 6320(b).
Q-D8. In what circumstances will a face-to-face CDP conference not be granted?
A-D8. A taxpayer is not entitled to a face-to-face CDP conference at a location other than as provided in A-D7 of this paragraph (d)(2) and this A-D8. If all Appeals officers or employees at the location provided for in A-D7 of this paragraph (d)(2) have had prior involvement with the taxpayer as provided in A-D4 of this paragraph (d)(2), the taxpayer will not be offered a face-to-face conference at that location, unless the taxpayer elects to waive the requirement of section 6320(b)(3). The taxpayer will be offered a face-to-face conference at another Appeals office if Appeals would have offered the taxpayer a face-to-face conference at the location provided in A-D7 of this paragraph (d)(2), but for the disqualification of all Appeals officers or employees at that location. A face-to-face CDP conference concerning a taxpayer's underlying liability will not be granted if the request for a hearing or other taxpayer communication indicates that the taxpayer wishes only to raise irrelevant or frivolous issues concerning that liability. A face-to-face CDP conference concerning a collection alternative, such as an installment agreement or an offer to compromise liability, will not be granted unless other taxpayers would be eligible for the alternative in similar circumstances. For example, because the IRS does not consider offers to compromise from taxpayers who have not filed required returns or have not made certain required deposits of tax, as set forth in Form 656, “Offer in Compromise,” no face-to-face conference will be granted to a taxpayer who wishes to make an offer to compromise but has not fulfilled those obligations. Appeals in its discretion, however, may grant a face-to-face conference if Appeals determines that a face-to-face conference is appropriate to explain to the taxpayer the requirements for becoming eligible for a collection alternative. In all cases, a taxpayer will be given an opportunity to demonstrate eligibility for a collection alternative and to become eligible for a collection alternative, in order to obtain a face-to-face conference. For purposes of determining whether a face-to-face conference will be granted, the determination of a taxpayer's eligibility for a collection alternative is made without regard to the taxpayer's ability to pay the unpaid tax. A face-to-face conference need not be granted if the taxpayer does not provide the required information set forth in A-C1(ii)(E) of paragraph (c)(2). See also A-C1(iii) of paragraph (c)(2).

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (d):

# Example 1.
Individual A timely requests a CDP hearing concerning a NFTL filed with respect to the 1998 income tax liability assessed against individual A. Appeals employee B previously conducted a CDP hearing regarding a proposed levy for individual A's 1998 income tax liability. Because employee B's only prior involvement with individual A's 1998 income tax liability was in connection with a section 6330 CDP hearing, employee B may conduct the CDP hearing under section 6320 involving the NFTL filed for the 1998 income tax liability.

# Example 2.
Individual C timely requests a CDP hearing concerning a NFTL filed with respect to the 1998 income tax liability assessed against individual C. Appeals employee D previously conducted a Collection Appeals Program (CAP) hearing regarding a NFTL filed with respect to individual C's 1998 income tax liability. Because employee D's prior involvement with individual C's 1998 income tax liability was in connection with a non-CDP hearing, employee D may not conduct the CDP hearing under section 6320 unless individual C waives the requirement that the hearing will be conducted by an Appeals officer or employee who has had no prior involvement with respect to individual C's 1998 income tax liability.

# Example 3.
Same facts as in
Example 2
, except that the prior CAP hearing only involved individual C's 1997 income tax liability and employment tax liabilities for 1998 reported on Form 941, “Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return.” Employee D would not be considered to have prior involvement because the prior CAP hearing in which she participated did not involve individual C's 1998 income tax liability.

# Example 4.
Appeals employee F is assigned to a CDP hearing concerning a NFTL filed with respect to a trust fund recovery penalty (TFRP) assessed pursuant to section 6672 against individual E. Appeals employee F participated in a prior CAP hearing involving individual E's 1999 income tax liability, and participated in a CAP hearing involving the employment taxes of business entity X, which incurred the employment tax liability to which the TFRP assessed against individual E relates. Appeals employee F would not be considered to have prior involvement because the prior CAP hearings in which he
participated did not directly involve the TFRP assessed against individual E.

# Example 5.
Appeals employee G is assigned to a CDP hearing concerning a NFTL filed with respect to a TFRP assessed pursuant to section 6672 against individual H. In preparing for the CDP hearing, Appeals employee G reviews the Appeals case file concerning the prior CAP hearing involving the TFRP assessed pursuant to section 6672 against individual H. Appeals employee G is not deemed to have participated in the previous CAP hearing involving the TFRP assessed against individual H by such review.
(e)
Matters considered at CDP hearing
—(1)
In general.
Appeals will determine the timeliness of any request for a CDP hearing that is made by a taxpayer. Appeals has the authority to determine the validity, sufficiency, and timeliness of any CDP Notice given by the IRS and of any request for a CDP hearing that is made by a taxpayer. Prior to issuance of a determination, Appeals is required to obtain verification from the IRS office collecting the tax that the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure with respect to the filing of the NFTL have been met. The taxpayer may raise any relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax at the hearing, including appropriate spousal defenses, challenges to the appropriateness of the NFTL filing, and offers of collection alternatives. The taxpayer also may raise challenges to the existence or amount of the underlying liability, including a liability reported on a self-filed return, for any tax period specified on the CDP Notice if the taxpayer did not receive a statutory notice of deficiency for that tax liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute the tax liability. Finally, the taxpayer may not raise an issue that was raised and considered at a previous CDP hearing under section 6330 or in any other previous administrative or judicial proceeding if the taxpayer participated meaningfully in such hearing or proceeding. Taxpayers will be expected to provide all relevant information requested by Appeals, including financial statements, for its consideration of the facts and issues involved in the hearing.
(2)
Spousal defenses.
A taxpayer may raise any appropriate spousal defenses at a CDP hearing unless the Commissioner has already made a final determination as to spousal defenses in a statutory notice of deficiency or final determination letter. To claim a spousal defense under section 66 or section 6015, the taxpayer must do so in writing according to rules prescribed by the Commissioner or the Secretary. Spousal defenses raised under sections 66 and 6015 in a CDP hearing are governed in all respects by the provisions of sections 66 and section 6015 and the regulations and procedures thereunder.
(3)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (e) as follows:
Q-E1. What factors will Appeals consider in making its determination?
A-E1. Appeals will consider the following matters in making its determination:
(i) Whether the IRS met the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure.
(ii) Any issues appropriately raised by the taxpayer relating to the unpaid tax.
(iii) Any appropriate spousal defenses raised by the taxpayer.
(iv) Any challenges made by the taxpayer to the appropriateness of the NFTL filing.
(v) Any offers by the taxpayer for collection alternatives.
(vi) Whether the continued existence of the filed NFTL represents a balance between the need for the efficient collection of taxes and the legitimate concern of the taxpayer that any collection action be no more intrusive than necessary.
Q-E2. When is a taxpayer entitled to challenge the existence or amount of the tax liability specified in the CDP Notice?
A-E2. A taxpayer is entitled to challenge the existence or amount of the underlying liability for any tax period specified on the CDP Notice if the taxpayer did not receive a statutory notice of deficiency for such liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such liability. Receipt of a statutory notice of deficiency for this purpose means receipt in time to petition the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency determined in
the notice of deficiency. An opportunity to dispute the underlying liability includes a prior opportunity for a conference with Appeals that was offered either before or after the assessment of the liability. An opportunity for a conference with Appeals prior to the assessment of a tax subject to deficiency procedures is not a prior opportunity for this purpose.
Q-E3. Are spousal defenses subject to the limitations imposed under section 6330(c)(2)(B) on a taxpayer's right to challenge the tax liability specified in the CDP Notice at a CDP hearing?
A-E3. The limitations imposed under section 6330(c)(2)(B) do not apply to spousal defenses. When a taxpayer asserts a spousal defense, the taxpayer is not disputing the amount or existence of the liability itself, but asserting a defense to the liability which may or may not be disputed. A spousal defense raised under section 66 or section 6015 is governed by section 66 or section 6015 and the regulations and procedures thereunder. Any limitation under those sections, regulations, and procedures therefore will apply.
Q-E4. May a taxpayer raise at a CDP hearing a spousal defense under section 66 or section 6015 if that defense was raised and considered administratively and the Commissioner has issued a statutory notice of deficiency or final determination letter addressing the spousal defense?
A-E4. No. A taxpayer is precluded from raising a spousal defense at a CDP hearing when the Commissioner has made a final determination under section 66 or section 6015 in a final determination letter or statutory notice of deficiency. However, a taxpayer may raise spousal defenses in a CDP hearing when the taxpayer has previously raised spousal defenses, but the Commissioner has not yet made a final determination regarding this issue.
Q-E5. May a taxpayer raise at a CDP hearing a spousal defense under section 66 or section 6015 if that defense was raised and considered in a prior judicial proceeding that has become final?
A-E5. No. A taxpayer is precluded by the doctrine of res judicata and by the specific limitations under section 66 or section 6015 from raising a spousal defense in a CDP hearing under these circumstances.
Q-E6. What collection alternatives are available to the taxpayer?
A-E6. Collection alternatives include, for example, a proposal to withdraw the NFTL in circumstances that will facilitate the collection of the tax liability, subordination of the NFTL, discharge of the NFTL from specific property, an installment agreement, an offer to compromise, the posting of a bond, or the substitution of other assets. A collection alternative is not available unless the alternative would be available to other taxpayers in similar circumstances. See A-D8 of paragraph (d)(2).
Q-E7. What issues may a taxpayer raise in a CDP hearing under section 6320 if the taxpayer previously received a notice under section 6330 with respect to the same tax and tax period and did not request a CDP hearing with respect to that notice?
A-E7. The taxpayer may raise appropriate spousal defenses, challenges to the appropriateness of the NFTL filing, and offers of collection alternatives. The existence or amount of the underlying liability for any tax period specified in the CDP Notice may be challenged only if the taxpayer did not have a prior opportunity to dispute the tax liability. If the taxpayer previously received a CDP Notice under section 6330 with respect to the same tax and tax period and did not request a CDP hearing with respect to that earlier CDP Notice, the taxpayer had a prior opportunity to dispute the existence or amount of the underlying tax liability.
Q-E8. How will Appeals issue its determination?
A-E8. (i) Taxpayers will be sent a dated Notice of Determination by certified or registered mail. The Notice of Determination will set forth Appeals' findings and decisions. It will state whether the IRS met the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure; it will resolve any issues appropriately raised by the taxpayer relating to the unpaid tax; it will include a decision on any appropriate spousal defenses raised by the taxpayer; it will include a decision on any challenges made by the taxpayer to the appropriateness of the NFTL filing; it will
respond to any offers by the taxpayer for collection alternatives; and it will address whether the continued existence of the filed NFTL represents a balance between the need for the efficient collection of taxes and the legitimate concern of the taxpayer that any collection action be no more intrusive than necessary. The Notice of Determination will also set forth any agreements that Appeals reached with the taxpayer, any relief given the taxpayer, and any actions the taxpayer or the IRS are required to take. Lastly, the Notice of Determination will advise the taxpayer of the taxpayer's right to seek judicial review within 30 days of the date of the Notice of Determination.
(ii) Because taxpayers are encouraged to discuss their concerns with the IRS office collecting the tax or filing the NFTL, certain matters that might have been raised at a CDP hearing may be resolved without the need for Appeals consideration. Unless, as a result of these discussions, the taxpayer agrees in writing to withdraw the request that Appeals conduct a CDP hearing, Appeals will still issue a Notice of Determination. The taxpayer can, however, waive in writing Appeals' consideration of some or all of the matters it would otherwise consider in making its determination.
Q-E9. Is there a period of time within which Appeals must conduct a CDP hearing or issue a Notice of Determination?
A-E9. No. Appeals will, however, attempt to conduct a CDP hearing and issue a Notice of Determination as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances.
Q-E10. Why is the Notice of Determination and its date important?
A-E10. The Notice of Determination will set forth Appeals' findings and decisions with respect to the matters set forth in A-E1 of this paragraph (e)(3). The 30-day period within which the taxpayer is permitted to seek judicial review of Appeals' determination commences the day after the date of the Notice of Determination.
Q-E11. If an Appeals officer considers the merits of a taxpayer's liability in a CDP hearing when the taxpayer had previously received a statutory notice of deficiency or otherwise had an opportunity to dispute the liability prior to the NFTL, will the Appeals officer's determination regarding those liability issues be considered part of the Notice of Determination?
A-E11. No. An Appeals officer may consider the existence and amount of the underlying tax liability as a part of the CDP hearing only if the taxpayer did not receive a statutory notice of deficiency for the tax liability in question or otherwise have a prior opportunity to dispute the tax liability. Similarly, an Appeals officer may not consider any other issue if the issue was raised and considered at a previous hearing under section 6330 or in any other previous administrative or judicial proceeding in which the person seeking to raise the issue meaningfully participated. In the Appeals officer's sole discretion, however, the Appeals officer may consider the existence or amount of the underlying tax liability, or such other precluded issues, at the same time as the CDP hearing. Any determination, however, made by the Appeals officer with respect to such a precluded issue shall not be treated as part of the Notice of Determination issued by the Appeals officer and will not be subject to any judicial review. Because any decisions made by the Appeals officer on such precluded issues are not properly a part of the CDP hearing, such decisions are not required to appear in the Notice of Determination issued following the hearing. Even if a decision concerning such precluded issues is referred to in the Notice of Determination, it is not reviewable by the Tax Court because the precluded issue is not properly part of the CDP hearing.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1.
The IRS sends a statutory notice of deficiency to the taxpayer at his last known address asserting a deficiency for the tax year 1995. The taxpayer receives the notice of deficiency in time to petition the Tax Court for a redetermination of the asserted deficiency. The taxpayer does not timely file a petition with the Tax Court. The taxpayer is precluded from challenging the existence or amount of the tax liability in a subsequent CDP hearing.

# Example 2.
Same facts as in
Example 1,
except the taxpayer does not receive the notice of deficiency in time to petition the Tax Court and did not have another prior opportunity to dispute the tax liability. The taxpayer is not precluded from challenging the existence or amount of the tax liability in a subsequent CDP hearing.

# Example 3.
The IRS properly assesses a trust fund recovery penalty against the taxpayer. The IRS offers the taxpayer the opportunity for a conference with Appeals at which the taxpayer would have the opportunity to dispute the assessed liability. The taxpayer declines the opportunity to participate in such a conference. The taxpayer is precluded from challenging the existence or amount of the tax liability in a subsequent CDP hearing.
(f)
Judicial review of Notice of Determination
—(1)
In general.
Unless the taxpayer provides the IRS a written withdrawal of the request that Appeals conduct a CDP hearing, Appeals is required to issue a Notice of Determination in all cases where a taxpayer has timely requested a CDP hearing. The taxpayer may appeal such determinations made by Appeals within the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the Notice of Determination to the Tax Court.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (f) as follows:
Q-F1. What must a taxpayer do to obtain judicial review of a Notice of Determination?
A-F1. Subject to the jurisdictional limitations described in A-F2 of this paragraph (f)(2), the taxpayer must, within the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the Notice of Determination, appeal the determination by Appeals to the Tax Court.
Q-F2. With respect to the relief available to the taxpayer under section 6015, what is the time frame within which a taxpayer may seek Tax Court review of Appeals' determination following a CDP hearing?
A-F2. If the taxpayer seeks Tax Court review not only of Appeals' denial of relief under section 6015, but also of relief requested with respect to other issues raised in the CDP hearing, the taxpayer should request Tax Court review within the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the Notice of Determination. If the taxpayer only seeks Tax Court review of Appeals' denial of relief under section 6015, then the taxpayer should request Tax Court review, as provided by section 6015(e), within 90 days of Appeals' determination. If a request for Tax Court review is filed after the 30-day period for seeking judicial review under section 6320, then only the taxpayer's section 6015 claims may be reviewable by the Tax Court.
Q-F3. What issue or issues may the taxpayer raise before the Tax Court if the taxpayer disagrees with the Notice of Determination?
A-F3. In seeking Tax Court review of a Notice of Determination, the taxpayer can only ask the court to consider an issue, including a challenge to the underlying tax liability, that was properly raised in the taxpayer's CDP hearing. An issue is not properly raised if the taxpayer fails to request consideration of the issue by Appeals, or if consideration is requested but the taxpayer fails to present to Appeals any evidence with respect to that issue after being given a reasonable opportunity to present such evidence.
Q-F4. What is the administrative record for purposes of Tax Court review?
A-F4. The case file, including the taxpayer's request for hearing, any other written communications and information from the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative submitted in connection with the CDP hearing, notes made by an Appeals officer or employee of any oral communications with the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative, memoranda created by the Appeals officer or employee in connection with the CDP hearing, and any other documents or materials relied upon by the Appeals officer or employee in making the determination under section 6330(c)(3), will constitute the record in the Tax Court review of the Notice of Determination issued by Appeals.
(g)
Effect of request for CDP hearing and judicial review on periods of limitation and collection activity
—(1)
In general.
The periods of limitation under section 6502 (relating to collection after assessment), section 6531 (relating to criminal prosecutions), and section 6532 (relating to suits) are suspended
until the date the IRS receives the taxpayer's written withdrawal of the request for a CDP hearing by Appeals or the determination resulting from the CDP hearing becomes final by expiration of the time for seeking judicial review or the exhaustion of any rights to appeals following judicial review. In no event shall any of these periods of limitation expire before the 90th day after the date on which the IRS receives the taxpayer's written withdrawal of the request that Appeals conduct a CDP hearing or the determination with respect to such hearing becomes final upon either the expiration of the time for seeking judicial review or upon exhaustion of any rights to appeals following judicial review.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (g) as follows:
Q-G1. For what period of time will the periods of limitation under sections 6502, 6531, and 6532 remain suspended if the taxpayer timely requests a CDP hearing concerning the filing of a NFTL?
A-G1. The suspension period commences on the date the IRS receives the taxpayer's written request for a CDP hearing. The suspension period continues until the IRS receives a written withdrawal by the taxpayer of the request for a CDP hearing or the Notice of Determination resulting from the CDP hearing becomes final. In no event shall any of these periods of limitation expire before the 90th day after the day on which the IRS receives the taxpayer's written withdrawal of the request that Appeals conduct a CDP hearing or there is a final determination with respect to such hearing. The periods of limitation that are suspended under section 6320 are those which apply to the taxes and the tax period or periods to which the CDP Notice relates.
Q-G2. For what period of time will the periods of limitation under sections 6502, 6531, and 6532 be suspended if the taxpayer does not request a CDP hearing concerning the filing of a NFTL, or the taxpayer requests a CDP hearing, but his request is not timely?
A-G2. Under either of these circumstances, section 6320 does not provide for a suspension of the periods of limitation.
Q-G3. What, if any, enforcement actions can the IRS take during the suspension period?
A-G3. Section 6330(e), made applicable to section 6320 CDP hearings by section 6320(c), provides for the suspension of the periods of limitation discussed in paragraph (g)(1) of these regulations. Section 6330(e) also provides that levy actions that are the subject of the requested CDP hearing under that section shall be suspended during the same period. Levy actions, however, are not the subject of a CDP hearing under section 6320. The IRS may levy for tax periods and taxes covered by the CDP Notice under section 6320 and for other taxes and periods if the CDP requirements under section 6330 for those taxes and periods have been satisfied. The IRS also may file NFTLs for tax periods or taxes not covered by the CDP Notice, may file a NFTL for the same tax and tax period stated on the CDP Notice at another recording office, and may take other non-levy collection actions such as initiating judicial proceedings to collect the tax shown on the CDP Notice or offsetting overpayments from other periods, or of other taxes, against the tax shown on the CDP Notice. Moreover, the provisions in section 6330 do not apply when the IRS levies for the tax and tax period shown on the CDP Notice to collect a state tax refund due the taxpayer, or determines that collection of the tax is in jeopardy. Finally, section 6330 does not prohibit the IRS from accepting any voluntary payments made for the tax and tax period stated on the CDP Notice.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (g):

# Example 1.
The period of limitation under section 6502 with respect to the taxpayer's tax period listed in the NFTL will expire on August 1, 1999. The IRS sent a CDP Notice to the taxpayer on April 30, 1999. The taxpayer timely requested a CDP hearing. The IRS received this request on May 15, 1999. Appeals sends the taxpayer its determination on June 15, 1999. The taxpayer timely seeks judicial review of that determination. The period of limitation under section 6502 would
be suspended from May 15, 1999, until the determination resulting from that hearing becomes final by expiration of the time for seeking review or reconsideration before the Tax Court, plus 90 days.
(h)
Retained jurisdiction of Appeals
—(1)
In general.
The Appeals office that makes a determination under section 6320 retains jurisdiction over that determination, including any subsequent administrative hearings that may be requested by the taxpayer regarding the NFTL and any collection actions taken or proposed with respect to Appeals' determination. Once a taxpayer has exhausted his other remedies, Appeals' retained jurisdiction permits it to consider whether a change in the taxpayer's circumstances affects its original determination. Where a taxpayer alleges a change in circumstances that affects Appeals' original determination, Appeals may consider whether changed circumstances warrant a change in its earlier determination.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (h) as follows:
Q-H1. Are the periods of limitation suspended during the course of any subsequent Appeals consideration of the matters raised by a taxpayer when the taxpayer invokes the retained jurisdiction of Appeals under section 6330(d)(2)(A) or (d)(2)(B)?
A-H1. No. Under section 6320(b)(2), a taxpayer is entitled to only one CDP hearing under section 6320 with respect to the tax and tax period or periods specified in the CDP Notice. Any subsequent consideration by Appeals pursuant to its retained jurisdiction is not a continuation of the original CDP hearing and does not suspend the periods of limitation.
Q-H2. Is a decision of Appeals resulting from a retained jurisdiction hearing appealable to the Tax Court?
A-H2. No. As discussed in A-H1, a taxpayer is entitled to only one CDP hearing under section 6320 with respect to the tax and tax period or periods specified in the CDP Notice. Only determinations resulting from CDP hearings are appealable to the Tax Court.
(i)
Equivalent hearing
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer who fails to make a timely request for a CDP hearing is not entitled to a CDP hearing. Such a taxpayer may nevertheless request an administrative hearing with Appeals, which is referred to herein as an “equivalent hearing.” The equivalent hearing will be held by Appeals and generally will follow Appeals' procedures for a CDP hearing. Appeals will not, however, issue a Notice of Determination. Under such circumstances, Appeals will issue a Decision Letter.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (i) as follows:
Q-I1. What must a taxpayer do to obtain an equivalent hearing?
A-I1. (i) A request for an equivalent hearing must be made in writing. A written request in any form that requests an equivalent hearing will be acceptable if it includes the information and signature required in A-I1(ii) of this paragraph (i)(2).
(ii) The request must be dated and must include the following:
(A) The taxpayer's name, address, daytime telephone number (if any), and taxpayer identification number (e.g., SSN, ITIN or EIN).
(B) The type of tax involved.
(C) The tax period at issue.
(D) A statement that the taxpayer is requesting an equivalent hearing with Appeals concerning the filing of the NFTL.
(E) The reason or reasons why the taxpayer disagrees with the filing of the NFTL.
(F) The signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative.
(iii) The taxpayer must perfect any timely written request for an equivalent hearing that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in A-I1(ii) of this paragraph (i)(2) within a reasonable period of time after a request from the IRS. If the requirements are not satisfied within a reasonable period of time, the taxpayer's equivalent hearing request will be denied.
(iv) The taxpayer must affirm any timely written request for an equivalent hearing that is signed or alleged to have been signed on the taxpayer's behalf by the taxpayer's spouse or other unauthorized representative, and that otherwise meets the requirements set forth in A-I1(ii) of this paragraph (i)(2),
by filing, within a reasonable period of time after a request from the IRS, a signed written affirmation that the request was originally submitted on the taxpayer's behalf. If the affirmation is filed within a reasonable period of time after a request, the timely equivalent hearing request will be considered timely with respect to the non-signing taxpayer. If the affirmation is not filed within a reasonable period of time, the equivalent hearing request will be denied with respect to the non-signing taxpayer.
Q-I2. What issues will Appeals consider at an equivalent hearing?
A-I2. In an equivalent hearing, Appeals will consider the same issues that it would have considered at a CDP hearing on the same matter.
Q-I3. Are the periods of limitation under sections 6502, 6531, and 6532 suspended if the taxpayer does not timely request a CDP hearing and is subsequently given an equivalent hearing?
A-I3. No. The suspension period provided for in section 6330(e) relates only to hearings requested within the 30-day period that commences on the day after the end of the five business day period following the filing of the NFTL, that is, CDP hearings.
Q-I4. Will collection action, including the filing of additional NFTLs, be suspended if a taxpayer requests and receives an equivalent hearing?
A-I4. Collection action is not required to be suspended. Accordingly, the decision to take collection action during the pendency of an equivalent hearing will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Appeals may request the IRS office with responsibility for collecting the taxes to suspend all or some collection action or to take other appropriate action if it determines that such action is appropriate or necessary under the circumstances.
Q-I5. What will the Decision Letter state?
A-I5. The Decision Letter will generally contain the same information as a Notice of Determination.
Q-I6. Will a taxpayer be able to obtain Tax Court review of a decision made by Appeals with respect to an equivalent hearing?
A-I6. Section 6320 does not authorize a taxpayer to appeal the decision of Appeals with respect to an equivalent hearing. A taxpayer may under certain circumstances be able to seek Tax Court review of Appeals' denial of relief under section 6015. Such review must be sought within 90 days of the issuance of Appeals' determination on those issues, as provided by section 6015(e).
Q-I7. When must a taxpayer request an equivalent hearing with respect to a CDP Notice issued under section 6320?
A-I7. A taxpayer must submit a written request for an equivalent hearing within the one-year period commencing the day after the end of the five-business-day period following the filing of the NFTL. This period is slightly different from the period for submitting a written request for an equivalent hearing with respect to a CDP Notice issued under section 6330. For a CDP Notice issued under section 6330, a taxpayer must submit a written request for an equivalent hearing within the one-year period commencing the day after the date of the CDP Notice issued under section 6330.
Q-I8. How will the timeliness of a taxpayer's written request for an equivalent hearing be determined?
A-I8. The rules and regulations under section 7502 and section 7503 will apply to determine the timeliness of the taxpayer's request for an equivalent hearing, if properly transmitted and addressed as provided in A-I10 of this paragraph (i)(2).
Q-I9. Is the one-year period within which a taxpayer must make a request for an equivalent hearing extended because the taxpayer resides outside the United States?
A-I9. No. All taxpayers who want an equivalent hearing concerning the filing of the NFTL must request the hearing within the one-year period commencing the day after the end of the five-business-day period following the filing of the NFTL.
Q-I10. Where must the written request for an equivalent hearing be sent?
A-I10. The written request for an equivalent hearing must be sent, or hand delivered (if permitted), to the IRS office and address as directed on the CDP Notice. If the address of the issuing office does not appear on the
CDP Notice, the taxpayer should obtain the address of the office to which the written request should be sent or hand delivered by calling, toll-free, 1-800-829-1040 and providing the taxpayer's identification number (e.g., SSN, ITIN or EIN).
QI11. What will happen if the taxpayer does not request an equivalent hearing in writing within the one-year period commencing the day after the end of the five-business-day period following the filing of the NFTL?
AI11. If the taxpayer does not request an equivalent hearing with Appeals within the one-year period commencing the day after the end of the five-business-day period following the filing of the NFTL, the taxpayer foregoes the right to an equivalent hearing with respect to the unpaid tax and tax periods shown on the CDP Notice. A written request submitted within the one-year period that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in A-I1(ii) of this paragraph (i)(2) is considered timely if the request is perfected within a reasonable period of time pursuant to A-I1(iii) of this paragraph (i)(2). If a request for equivalent hearing is untimely, either because the request was not submitted within the one-year period or not perfected within the reasonable period provided, the equivalent hearing request will be denied. The taxpayer, however, may seek reconsideration by the IRS office collecting the tax, assistance from the National Taxpayer Advocate, or an administrative hearing before Appeals under its Collection Appeals Program or any successor program.
(j)
Effective date.
This section is applicable on or after November 16, 2006, with respect to requests made for CDP hearings or equivalent hearings on or after November 16, 2006.
[T.D. 8979, 67 FR 2561, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended by T.D. 9290, 71 FR 60839, Oct. 17, 2006]
§ 301.6321-1
Lien for taxes.
If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with any costs that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, belonging to such person. For purposes of section 6321 and this section, the term “any tax” shall include a State individual income tax which is a “qualified tax”, as defined in paragraph (b) of § 301.6361-4. The lien attaches to all property and rights to property belonging to such person at any time during the period of the lien, including any property or rights to property acquired by such person after the lien arises. Solely for purposes of sections 6321 and 6331, any interest in restricted land held in trust by the United States for an individual noncompetent Indian (and not for a tribe) shall not be deemed to be property, or a right to property, belonging to such Indian. For the method of allocating amounts collected pursuant to a lien between the Federal Government and a State or States imposing a qualified tax with respect to which the lien attached, see paragraph (f) of § 301.6361-1. For the special lien for estate and gift taxes, see section 6324 and § 301.6324-1
[T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59361, Dec. 20, 1978]
§ 301.6323(a)-1
Purchasers, holders of security interests, mechanic's lienors, and judgment lien creditors.
(a)
Invalidity of lien without notice.
The lien imposed by section 6321 is not valid against any purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) of § 301.6323(h)—1), holder of a security interest (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(h)—1), mechanic's lienor (as defined in paragraph (b) of § 301.6323(h)-1), or judgment lien creditor (as defined in paragraph (g) of § 301.6323(h)-1) until a notice of lien is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1). Except as provided by section 6323, if a person becomes a purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic's lienor, or judgment lien creditor after a notice of lien is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the interest acquired by such person is subject to the lien imposed by section 6321.
(b)
Cross references.
For provisions relating to the protection afforded a security interest arising after tax lien filing, which interest is covered by a commercial transactions financing agreement, real property construction
or improvement financing agreement, or an obligatory disbursement agreement, see §§ 301.6323(c)-1, 301.6323(c)-2, and 301.6323(c)-3, respectively. For provisions relating to the protection afforded to a security interest coming into existence by virtue of disbursements, made before the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing, see § 301.6323(d)-1. For provisions relating to priority afforded to interest and certain other expenses with respect to a lien or security interest having priority over the lien imposed by section 6321, see § 301.6323(e)-1.

[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35498, Aug. 23, 1976]
§ 301.6323(b)-1
Protection for certain interests even though notice filed.
(a)
Securities—(
1)
In general.
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a security (as defined in paragraph (d) of § 301.6323(h)-1) against—
(i) A purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) of § 301.6323(h)-1) of the security who at the time of purchase did not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(i)-1) of the existence of the lien;
(ii) A holder of a security interest (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(h)-1) in the security who did not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(i)-1) of the existence of the lien at the time the security interest came into existence or at the time such security interest was acquired from a previous holder for a consideration in money or money's worth; or
(iii) A transferee of an interest protected under subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph to the same extent the lien is invalid against his transferor.
For purposes of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, no person can improve his position with respect to the lien by reacquiring the interest from an intervening purchaser or holder of a security interest against whom the lien is invalid.
(2)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On May 1, 1969, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to A's delinquent tax liability. On May 20, 1969. A sells 100 shares of common stock in X corporation to B, who, on the date of the sale, does not have actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien. Because B purchased the stock without actual notice or knowledge of the lien, under subdivision (i) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the stock purchased by B is not subject to the lien.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that on May 30, 1969, B sells the 100 shares of common stock in X corporation to C who on May 5, 1969, had actual notice of the existence of the tax lien against A. Because the X stock when purchased by B was not subject to the lien, under subdivision (iii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the stock purchased by C is not subject to the lien. C succeeds to B's rights, even though C had actual notice of the lien before B's purchase.

# Example 3.
On June 1, 1970, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to D's delinquent tax liability. D owns 20 $1,000 bonds issued by the Y company. On June 10, 1970, D obtains a loan from M bank for $5,000 using the Y company bonds as collateral. At the time the loan is made M bank does not have actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the tax lien. Because M bank did not have actual notice or knowledge of the lien when the security interest came into existence, under subdivision (ii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the tax lien is not valid against M bank to the extent of its security interest.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example 3 except that on June 19, 1970, M bank assigns the chose in action and its security interest to N, who had actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien on June 1, 1970. Because the security interest was not subject to the lien to the extent of M bank's security interest, the security interest held by N is to the same extent entitled to priority over the tax lien because N succeeds to M bank's rights. See subdivision (iii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

# Example 5.
On July 1, 1970, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to E's delinquent tax liability. E owns ten $1,000 bonds issued by the Y company. On July 5, 1970, E borrows $4,000 from F and delivers the bonds to F as collateral for the loan. At the time the loan is made, F has actual knowledge of the existence of the tax lien and, therefore, holds the security interest subject to the lien on the bonds. On July 10, 1970, F sells the security interest to G for $4,000 and delivers the Y company
bonds pledged as collateral. G does not have actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien on July 10, 1970. Because G did not have actual notice or knowledge of the lien at the time he purchased the security interest, under subdivision (ii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the tax lien is not valid against G to the extent of his security interest.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in example 5 except that, instead of purchasing the security interest from F on July 10, 1970, G lends $4,000 to F and takes a security interest in F's security interest in the bonds on that date. Because G became the holder of a security interest in a security interest after notice of lien was filed and does not directly have a security interest in a security, the security interest held by G is not entitled to a priority over the tax lien under the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(b)
Motor vehicles
—(1)
In general.
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) of § 301.6323(h)-1) of a motor vehicle (as defined in paragraph (c) of § 301.6323(h)-1) if—
(i) At the time of the purchase, the purchaser did not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(i)-1) of the existence of the lien, and
(ii) Before the purchaser obtains such notice or knowledge, he has acquired actual possession of the motor vehicle and has not thereafter relinquished actual possession to the seller or his agent.
(2)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a delinquent taxpayer against whom a notice of tax lien has been filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, sells his automobile (which qualifies as a motor vehicle under paragraph (c) of § 301.6323(h)-1) to B, an automobile dealer. B takes actual possession of the automobile and does not thereafter relinquish actual possession to the seller or his agent. Subsequent to his purchase, B learns of the existence of the tax lien against A. Even though notice of lien was filed before the purchase, the lien is not valid against B, because B did not know of the existence of the lien before the purchase and before acquiring actual possession of the vehicle.

# Example 2.
C is a wholesaler of used automobiles. A notice of lien has been filed with respect to C's delinquent tax liability in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. Subsequent to such filing, D, a used automobile dealer, purchases and takes actual possession of 20 automobiles (which qualify as motor vehicles under the provisions of paragraph (c) of § 301.6323(h)-1) from C at an auction and places them on his lot for sale. C does not reacquire possession of any of the automobiles. At the time of his purchase, D does not have actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien against C. Even though notice of lien was filed before D's purchase, the lien was not valid against D because D did not know of the existence of the lien before the purchase and before acquiring actual possession of the vehicles.
(3)
Cross reference.
For provisions relating to additional circumstances in which the lien imposed by section 6321 may not be valid against the purchaser of tangible personal property (including a motor vehicle) purchased at retail, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Personal property purchased at retail
—(1)
In general.
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) of § 301.6323(h)-1) of tangible personal property purchased at a retail sale (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c)) unless at the time of purchase the purchaser intends the purchase to (or knows that the purchase will) hinder, evade, or defeat the collection of any tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
(2)
Definition of retail sale.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “retail sale” means a sale, made in the ordinary course of the seller's trade or business, of tangible personal property of which the seller is the owner. Such term includes a sale in customary retail quantities by a seller who is going out of business, but does not include a bulk sale or an auction sale in which goods are offered in quantities substantially greater than are customary in the ordinary course of the seller's trade or business or an auction sale of goods the owner of which is not in the business of selling such goods.
(3)
Example.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A purchases a refrigerator from the M company, a retail appliance dealer. Prior to such purchase, a notice of lien was
filed with respect to M's delinquent tax liability in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. At the time of the purchase A knows of the existence of the lien. However, A does not intend the purchase to hinder, evade, or defeat the collection of any internal revenue tax, and A does not have any reason to believe that the purchase will affect the collection of any internal revenue tax. Even though notice of lien was filed before the purchase, the lien is not valid against A because A in good faith purchased the refrigerator at retail in the ordinary course of the M company's business.
(d)
Personal property purchased in casual sale
—(1)
In general.
Even though a notice of lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in § 301.6323(h)-1(f)) of household goods, personal effects, or other tangible personal property of a type described in § 301.6334-1 (which includes wearing apparel, school books, fuel, provisions, furniture, arms for personal use, livestock, and poultry (whether or not the seller is the head of a family); and books and tools of a trade, business, or profession (whether or not the trade, business, or profession of the seller)), purchased, other than for resale, in a casual sale for less than $1,380, effective for 2010 and adjusted each year based on the rate of inflation (excluding interest and expenses described in § 301.6323(e)-1).
(2)
Limitation.
This paragraph applies only if the purchaser does not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(i)-1)—
(i) Of the existence of the tax lien, or
(ii) That the sale is one of a series of sales.
For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a sale is one of a series of sales if the seller plans to dispose of, in separate transactions, substantially all of his household goods, personal effects, and other tangible personal property described in § 301.6334-1.
(3)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, an attorney's widow, sells a set of law books for $200 to B, for B's own use. Prior to the sale a notice of lien was filed with respect to A's delinquent tax liability in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. B has no actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien. In addition, B does not know that the sale is one of a series of sales. Because the sale is a casual sale for less than $1,380 and involves books of a profession (tangible personal property of a type described in § 301.6334-1, irrespective of the fact that A has never engaged in the legal profession), the tax lien is not valid against B even though a notice of lien was filed prior to the time of B's purchase.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that B purchases the books for resale in his second-hand bookstore. Because B purchased the books for resale, he purchased the books subject to the lien.

# Example 3.
In an advertisement appearing in a local newspaper, G indicates that he is offering for sale a lawn mower, a used television set, a desk, a refrigerator, and certain used dining room furniture. In response to the advertisement, H purchases the dining room furniture for $200. H does not receive any information which would impart notice of a lien, or that the sale is one of a series of sales, beyond the information contained in the advertisement. Prior to the sale a notice of lien was filed with respect to G's delinquent tax liability in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. Because H had no actual notice or knowledge that substantially all of G's household goods were being sold or that the sale is one of a series of sales, and because the sale is a casual sale for less than $1,380, H does not purchase the dining room furniture subject to the lien. The household goods are of a type described in § 301.6334-1(a)(2) irrespective of whether G is the head of a family or whether all such household goods offered for sale exceed $8,250 in value.
(e)
Personal property subject to possessory liens.
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a holder of a lien on tangible personal property which under local law secures the reasonable price of the repair or improvement of the property if the property is, and has been, continuously in the possession of the holder of the lien from the time the possessory lien arose. For example, if local law gives an automobile repairman the right to retain possession of an automobile he has repaired as security for payment of the repair bill and the repairman retains continuous possession of the automobile until his lien is satisfied, a tax lien filed in accordance with section 6323(f)(1) which has attached to the automobile will not be valid to the extent of the reasonable price of the repairs. It is immaterial that the notice of tax lien was filed before the repairman undertook his work
or that he knew of the lien before undertaking the work.
(f)
Real property tax and special assessment liens
—(1)
In general.
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against the holder of another lien upon the real property (regardless of when such other lien arises), if such other lien is entitled under local law to priority over security interests in real property which are prior in time and if such other lien on real property secures payment of—
(i) A tax of general application levied by any taxing authority based upon the value of the property;
(ii) A special assessment imposed directly upon the property by any taxing authority, if the assessment is imposed for the purpose of defraying the cost of any public improvement; or
(iii) Charges for utilities or public services furnished to the property by the United States, a State or political subdivision thereof, or an instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing.
(2)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A owns Blackacre in the city of M. A notice of lien affecting Blackacre is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. Subsequent to the filing of the notice of lien, the city of M acquires a lien against Blackacre to secure payment of real estate taxes. Such taxes are levied against all property in the city in proportion to the value of the property. Under local law, the holder of a lien for real property taxes is entitled to priority over a security interest in real property even though the security interest is prior in time. Because the real property tax lien held by the city of M secures payment of a tax of general application and is entitled to priority over security interests which are prior in time, the lien held by the city of M is entitled to priority over the Federal tax lien with respect to Blackacre.

# Example 2.
B owns Whiteacre in N county. A notice of lien affecting Whiteacre is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. Subsequent to the filing of the notice of lien, N county constructs a sidewalk, paves the street, and installs water and sewer lines adjacent to Whiteacre. In order to defray the cost of these improvements, N county imposes upon Whiteacre a special assessment which under local law results in a lien upon Whiteacre that is entitled to priority over security interests that are prior in time. Because the special assessment lien is (i) entitled under local law to priority over security interests which are prior in time, and (ii) imposed directly upon real property to defray the cost of a public improvement, the special assessment lien has priority over the Federal tax lien with respect to Whiteacre.

# Example 3.
C owns Greenacre in town O. A notice of lien affecting Greenacre is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. Town O furnishes water and electricity to Greenacre and periodically collects a fee for these services. Subsequent to the filing of the notice of lien, town O supplies water and electricity to Greenacre, and C fails to pay the charges for these services. Under local law, town O acquires a lien to secure charges for the services, and this lien has priority over security interests which are prior in time. Because the lien of town O (i) is for services furnished to the real property and (ii) has priority over earlier security interests, town O's lien has priority over the Federal tax lien with respect to Greenacre.

Residential property subject to a mechanic's lien for certain repairs and improvements
—(1)
In general.
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a mechanic's lienor (as defined in § 301.6323(h)-1(b)) who holds a lien for the repair or improvement of a personal residence if—
(i) The residence is occupied by the owner and contains no more than four dwelling units; and
(ii) The contract price on the prime contract with the owner for the repair or improvement (excluding interest and expenses described in § 301.6323(e)-1) is not more than $6,890, effective for 2010 and adjusted each year based on the rate of inflation.
(iii) For purposes of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, the amounts of subcontracts under the prime contract with the owner are not to be taken into consideration for purposes of computing the $6,890 prime contract price. It is immaterial that the notice of tax lien was filed before the contractor undertakes his work or that he knew of the lien before undertaking his work.
(2)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A owns a building containing four apartments, one of which he occupies as his personal residence. A notice of lien which affects the building is filed in accordance
with § 301.6323(f)-1. Thereafter, A enters into a contract with B in the amount of $800, which includes labor and materials, to repair the roof of the building. B purchases roofing shingles from C for $300. B completes the work and A fails to pay B the agreed amount. In turn, B fails to pay C for the shingles. Under local law, B and C acquire mechanic's liens on A's building. Because the contract price on the prime contract with A is not more than $6,890 and under local law B and C acquire mechanic's liens on A's building, the liens of B and C have priority over the Federal tax lien.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the amount of the prime contract between A and B is $7,100. Because the amount of the prime contract with the owner, A, is in excess of $6,890, the tax lien has priority over the entire amount of each of the mechanic's liens of B and C, even though the amount of the contract between B and C is $300.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that A and B do not agree in advance upon the amount due under the prime contract but agree that B will perform the work for the cost of materials and labor plus 10 percent of such cost. When the work is completed, it is determined that the total amount due is $850. Because the prime contract price is not more than $6,890 and under local law B and C acquire mechanic's liens on A's residence, the liens of B and C have priority over the Federal tax lien.
(h)
Attorney's liens
—(1)
In general.
Even though notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against an attorney who, under local law, holds a lien upon, or a contract enforceable against, a judgment or other amount in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action. The priority afforded an attorney's lien under this paragraph shall not exceed the amount of the attorney's reasonable compensation for obtaining the judgment or procuring the settlement. For purposes of this paragraph, reasonable compensation means the amount customarily allowed under local law for an attorney's services for litigating or settling a similar case or administrative claim. However, reasonable compensation shall be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each individual case. It is immaterial that the notice of tax lien is filed before the attorney undertakes his work or that the attorney knows of the tax lien before undertaking his work. This paragraph does not apply to an attorney's lien which may arise from the defense of a claim or cause of action against a taxpayer except to the extent such lien is held upon a judgment or other amount arising from the adjudication or settlement of a counterclaim in favor of the taxpayer. In the case of suits against the taxpayer, see § 301.6325-1(d)(2) for rules relating to the subordination of the tax lien to facilitate tax collection.
(2)
Claim or cause of action against the United States.
Paragraph (h)(1) of this section does not apply to an attorney's lien with respect to—
(i) Any judgment or other fund resulting from the successful litigation or settlement of an administrative claim or cause of action against the United States to the extent that the United States, under any legal or equitable right, offsets its liability under the judgment or settlement against any liability of the taxpayer to the United States, or
(ii) Any amount credited against any liability of the taxpayer in accordance with section 6402.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A notice of lien is filed against A in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. Subsequently, A is struck by an automobile and retains B, an attorney to institute suit on A's behalf against the operator of the automobile. B knows of the tax lien before he begins his work. Under local law, B is entitled to a lien upon any recovery in order to secure payment of his fee. A is awarded damages of $10,000. B charges a fee of $3,000 which is the fee customarly allowed under local law in similar cases and which is found to be reasonable under the circumstances of this particular case. Because, under local law, B holds a lien for the amount of his reasonable compensation for obtaining the judgment, B's lien has priority over the Federal tax lien.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that before suit is instituted A and the owner of the automobile settle out of court for $7,500. B charges a reasonable and customary fee of $1,800 for procuring the settlement and under local law holds a lien upon the settlement in order to secure payment of the fee. Because, under local law, B holds a lien for the amount of his reasonable compensation for obtaining the settlement, B has priority over the Federal tax lien.

# Example 3.
In accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien in the amount of $8,000 is filed against C, a contractor. Subsequently C
retains D, an attorney, to initiate legal proceedings to recover the amount allegedly due him for construction work he has performed for the United States. C and D enter into an agreement which provides that D will receive a reasonable and customary fee of $2,500 as compensation for his services. Under local law, the agreement will give rise to a lien which is enforceable by D against any amount recovered in the suit. C is successful in the suit and is awarded $10,000. D claims $2,500 of the proceeds as his fee. The United States, however, exercises its right of set-off and applies $8,000 of the $10,000 award to satisfy C's tax liability. Because the $10,000 award resulted from the successful litigation of a cause of action against the United States, B's contract for attorney's fees is not enforceable against the amount recovered to the extent the United States offsets its liability under the judgment against C's tax liability. It is immaterial that D had no notice or knowledge of the tax lien at the time he began work on the case.
(i)
Certain insurance contracts
—(1)
In general.
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a life insurance, endowment, or annuity contract, against an organization which is the insurer under the contract, at any time—
(i) Before the insuring organization has actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(i)-1) of the existence of the tax lien,
(ii) After the insuring organization has actual notice or knowledge of the lien (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(i)-1), with respect to advances (including contractual interest thereon as provided in paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(e)-1) required to be made automatically to maintain the contract in force under an agreement entered into before the insuring organization had such actual notice or knowledge, or
(iii) After the satisfaction of a levy pursuant to section 6332(b), unless and until the Internal Revenue Service delivers to the insuring organization a notice (for example, another notice of levy, a letter, etc.) executed after the date of such satisfaction, that the lien exists.
Delivery of the notice described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph may be made by any means, including regular mail, and delivery of the notice shall be effective only from the time of actual receipt of the notification by the insuring organization. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to matured as well as unmatured insurance contracts.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On May 1, 1964, the X insurance company issues a life insurance policy to A. On June 1, 1970, a tax assessment is made against A, and on June 2, 1970, a notice of lien with respect to the assessment is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. On July 1, 1970, without actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien, the X company makes a “policy loan” to A. Under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, the loan, including interest (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(e)-1), will have priority over the tax lien because X company did not have actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien at the time the policy loan was made.

# Example 2.
On May 1, 1964, B enters into a life insurance contract with the Y insurance company. Under one of the provisions of the contract, in the event a premium is not paid, Y is to advance out of the cash loan value of the policy the amount of an unpaid premium in order to maintain the contract in force. The contract also provides for interest on any advances so made. On June 1, 1971, a tax assessment is made against B, and on June 2, 1971, in accordance with section 6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed. On July 1, 1971, B fails to pay the premium due on that date, and Y makes an automatic premium loan to keep the policy in force. At the time the automatic premium loan is made, Y had actual knowledge of the tax lien. Under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the lien is not valid against Y with respect to the advance (and the contractual interest thereon), because the advance was required to be made automatically under an agreement entered into before Y had actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien.

# Example 3.
On May 1, 1964, C enters into a life insurance contract with the Z insurance company. On January 4, 1971, an assessment is made against C for $5,000 unpaid income taxes, and on January 11, 1971, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed. On January 29, 1971, a notice of levy with respect to C's delinquent tax is served on Z company. The amount which C could have had advanced to him from Z company under the contract on the 90th day after service of the notice of levy on Z company is $2,000. The Z company pays $2,000 pursuant to the notice of levy, thereby satisfying the levy upon the contract in accordance with § 6332(b). On February 1, 1973, Z company advances $500 to C, which is the increment in
policy loan value since satisfaction of the levy of January 29, 1971. On February 5, 1973, a new notice of levy for the unpaid balance of the delinquent taxes, executed after the first levy was satisfied, is served upon Z company. Because the new notification was not received by Z company until after the policy loan was made, under paragraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, the tax lien is not valid against Z company with respect to the policy loan (including interest thereon in accordance with paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(e)-1).

# Example 4.
On June 1, 1973, a tax assessment is made against D and on June 2, 1973, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien with respect to the assessment is filed. On July 2, 1973, D executes an assignment of his rights, as the insured, under an insurance contract to M bank as security for a loan. M bank holds its security interest subject to the lien because it is not an insurer entitled to protection under section 6323(b)(9) and did not become a holder of the security interest prior to the filing of the notice of lien for purposes of section 6323(a). It is immaterial that a notice of levy had not been served upon the insurer before the assignment to M bank was made.
(j)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to any notice of Federal tax lien filed on or after April 4, 2011.
[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35501, Aug. 23, 1976, as amended by T.D. 9520, 76 FR 18385, Apr. 4, 2011; 76 FR 24813, May 3, 2011]
§ 301.6323(c)-1
Protection for commercial transactions financing agreements.
(a)
In general.
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a security interest which:
(1) Comes into existence after the tax lien filing,
(2) Is in qualified property covered by the terms of a commercial transactions financing agreement entered into before the tax lien filing, and
(3) Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time of the tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.
See paragraphs (a) and (e) of § 301.6323(h)-1 for definitions of the terms “security interest” and “tax lien filing,” respectively. For purposes of this section, a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of § 301.6323(h)-1.
(b)
Commercial transactions financing agreement.
For purposes of this section, the term “commercial transactions financing agreement” means a written agreement entered into by a person in the course of his trade or business—
(1) To make loans to the taxpayer (whether or not at the option of the person agreeing to make such loans) to be secured by commercial financing security acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business, or
(2) To purchase commercial financing security, other than inventory, acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business.
Such an agreement qualifies as a commercial transactions financing agreement only with respect to loans or purchases made under the agreement before (i) the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing or, (ii) the time when the lender or purchaser has actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(i)-1) of the tax lien filing, if earlier. For purposes of this paragraph, a loan or purchase is considered to have been made in the course of the lender's or purchaser's trade or business if such person is in the business of financing commercial transactions (such as a bank or commercial factor) of if the agreement is incidental to the conduct of such person's trade or business. For example, if a manufacturer finances the accounts receivable of one of his customers, he is considered to engage in such financing in the course of his trade or business. The extent of the priority of the lender or purchaser over the tax lien is the amount of his disbursements made before the 46th day after the date the notice of tax lien is filed, or made before the day (before such 46th day) on which the lender or purchaser has actual notice or knowledge of the filing of the notice of the tax lien.
(c)
Commercial financing security
—(1)
In general.
The term “commercial financing security” means—
(i) Paper of a kind ordinarily arising in commercial transactions.
(ii) Accounts receivable (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c)),
(iii) Mortgages on real property, and
(iv) Inventory.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “paper of a kind ordinarily arising in commercial transactions” in general includes any written document customarily used in commercial transactions. For example, such written documents include paper giving contract rights (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c)), chattel paper, documents of title to personal property, and negotiable instruments or securities. The term “commercial financing security” does not include general intangibles such as patents or copyrights. A mortgage on real estate (including a deed of trust, contract for sale, and similar instrument) may be commercial financing security if the taxpayer has an interest in the mortgage as a mortgagee or assignee. The term “commercial financing security” does not include a mortgage where the taxpayer is the mortgagor or realty owned by him. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “inventory” includes raw materials and goods in process as well as property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.
(2)
Definitions.
For purposes of §§ 301.6323(d)-1, 301.6323(h)-1 and this section—
(i) A contract right is any right to payment under a contract not yet earned by performance and not evidenced by an instrument or chattel paper, and
(ii) An account receivable is any right to payment for goods sold or leased or for services rendered which is not evidenced by an instrument or chattel paper.
(d)
Qualified property.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, qualified property consists solely of commercial financing security acquired by the taxpayer-debtor before the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing: Commercial financing security acquired before such day may be qualified property even though it is acquired by the taxpayer after the lender received actual notice or knowledge of the filing of the tax lien. For example, although the receipt of actual notice or knowledge of the filing of the notice of the tax lien has the effect of ending the period within which protected disbursements may be made to the taxpayer, property which is acquired by the taxpayer after the lender receives actual notice or knowledge of such filing and before such 46th day, which otherwise qualifies as commercial financing security, becomes commercial financing security to which the priority of the lender extends for loans made before he received the actual notice or knowledge. An account receivable (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) is acquired by a taxpayer at the time, and to the extent, a right to payment is earned by performance. Chattel paper, documents of title, negotiable instruments, securities, and mortgages on real estate are acquired by a taxpayer when he obtains rights in the paper or mortgage. Inventory is acquired by the taxpayer when title passes to him. A contract right (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) is acquired by a taxpayer when the contract is made. Identifiable proceeds, which arise from the collection or disposition of qualified property by the taxpayer, are considered to be acquired at the time such qualified property is acquired if the secured party has a continuously perfected security interest in the proceeds under local law. The term “proceeds” includes whatever is received when collateral is sold, exchanged, or collected. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “identifiable proceeds” does not include money, checks and the like which have been commingled with other cash proceeds. Property acquired by the taxpayer after the 45th day following tax lien filing, by the expenditure of proceeds, is not qualified property.
(e)
Purchaser treated as acquiring security interest.
A person who purchases commercial financing security, other than inventory, pursuant to a commercial transactions financing agreement is treated, for purposes of this section, as having acquired a security interest in the commercial financing security. In the case of a bona fide purchase at a discount, a purchaser of commercial financing security who satisfies the requirements of this section has priority over the tax lien to the full extent of the security.
(f)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) On June 1, 1970, a tax is assessed against M, a tool manufacturer, with respect to his delinquent tax liability. On June 15, 1970, M enters into a written financing agreement with X, a bank. The agreement provides that, in consideration of such sums as X may advance to M, X is to have a security interest in all of M's presently owned and subsequently acquired commercial paper, accounts receivable, and inventory (including inventory in the manufacturing stages and raw materials). On July 6, 1970, notice of the tax lien is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. On August 3, 1970, without actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien filing, X advances $10,000 to M. On August 5, 1970, M acquires additional inventory through the purchase of raw materials. On August 20, 1970, M has accounts receivable, arising from the sale of tools, amounting to $5,000. Under local law, X's security interest arising by reason of the $10,000 advance on August 3, 1970, has priority, with respect to the raw materials and accounts receivable, over a judgment lien against M arising July 6, 1970 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation.
(ii) Because the $10,000 advance was made before the 46th day after the tax lien filing, and the accounts receivable in the amount of $5,000 and the raw materials were acquired by M before such 46th day, X's $10,000 security interest in the accounts receivable and the inventory has priority over the tax lien. The priority of X's security interest also extends to the proceeds, received on or after the 46th day after the tax lien filing, from the liquidation of the accounts receivable and inventory held by M on August 20, 1970, if X has a continuously perfected security interest in identifiable proceeds under local law. However, the priority of X's security interest will not extend to other property acquired with such proceeds.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that on July 15, 1970, X has actual knowledge of the tax lien filing. Because an agreement does not qualify as a commercial transactions financing agreement when a disbursement is made after tax lien filing with actual knowledge of the filing, X's security interest will not have priority over the tax lien with respect to the $10,000 advance made on August 3, 1970.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that, instead of additional inventory, on August 5, 1970, M acquires an account receivable as the result of the sale of machinery which M no longer needs in his business. Even though the account receivable was acquired by taxpayer M before the 46th day after tax lien filing, the tax lien will have priority over X's security interest arising in the account receivable pursuant to the earlier written agreement because the account receivable was not acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business.

# Example 4.
Pursuant to a written agreement with the N Manufacturing Company entered into on January 4, 1971, Y a commercial factor, purchases the accounts receivable arising out of N's regular sales to its customers. On November 1, 1971, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to N's delinquent tax liability. On December 6, 1971, Y, without actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien filing, purchases all of the accounts receivable resulting from N's November 1971 sales. Y has taken appropriate steps under local law so that the December 6, 1971, purchase is protected against a judgment lien arising November 1, 1971 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation. Because the purchaser of commercial financing security, other than inventory, is treated as having acquired a security interest in commercial financing security, and because Y otherwise meets the requirements of this section, the tax lien is not valid with respect to Y's December 6, 1971, purchase of N's accounts receivable.
[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35503, Aug. 23, 1976]
§ 301.6323(c)-2
Protection for real property construction or improvement financing agreements.
(a)
In general.
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a security interest which:
(1) Comes into existence after the tax lien filing,
(2) Is in qualified property covered by the terms of a real property construction or improvement financing agreement entered into before the tax lien filing, and
(3) Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.
For purposes of this section, it is immaterial that the holder of the security interest had actual notice or knowledge of the lien at the time disbursements are made pursuant to such an agreement. See paragraphs (a) and (e) of § 301.6323(h)-1 for general definitions of the terms “security interest” and “tax lien filing.” For purposes of this section, a judgment lien is a lien
held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of § 301.6323(h)-1.
(b)
Real property construction or improvement financing agreement.
For purposes of this section, the term “real property construction or improvement financing agreement” means any written agreement to make cash disbursements (whether or not at the option of the party agreeing to make such disbursements):
(1) To finance the construction, improvement, or demolition of real property if the agreement provides for a security interest in the real property with respect to which the construction, improvement, or demolition has been or is to be made;
(2) To finance a contract to construct or improve, or demolish real property if the agreement provides for a security interest in the proceeds of the contract; or
(3) To finance the raising or harvesting of a farm crop or the raising of livestock or other animals if the agreement provides for a security interest in any property subject to the lien imposed by section 6321 at the time of tax lien filing, in the crop raised or harvested, or in the livestock or other animals raised.
For purposes of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (b), construction or improvement may include demolition. For purposes of any agreement described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (b), the furnishing of goods and services is treated as the disbursement of cash.
(c)
Qualified property.
For purposes of this section, the term “qualified property” includes only—
(1) In the case of an agreement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the real property with respect to which the construction or improvement has been or is to be made;
(2) In the case of an agreement described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the proceeds of the contract to construct or improve real property; or
(3) In the case of an agreement described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, property subject to the lien imposed by section 6321 at the time of tax lien filing, the farm crop raised or harvested, or the livestock or other animals raised.
(d)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, in order to finance the construction of a dwelling on a lot owned by him, mortgages the property to B. The mortgage, executed January 4, 2006, includes an agreement that B will make cash disbursements to A as the construction progresses. On February 1, 2006, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed and recorded in the public index with respect to A's delinquent tax liability. A continues the construction, and B makes cash disbursements on June 15, 2006, and December 15, 2006. Under local law B's security interest arising by virtue of the disbursements is protected against a judgment lien arising February 1, 2006 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation. Because B is the holder of a security interest coming into existence by reason of cash disbursements made pursuant to a written agreement, entered into before tax lien filing, to make cash disbursements to finance the construction of real property, and because B's security interest is protected, under local law, against a judgment lien arising as of the time of tax lien filing out of an unsecured obligation, B's security interest has priority over the tax lien.

# Example 2.
(i) C is awarded a contract for the demolition of several buildings. On March 3, 2004, C enters into a written agreement with D which provides that D will make cash disbursements to finance the demolition and also provides that repayment of the disbursements is secured by any sums due C under the contract. On April 1, 2004, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to C's delinquent tax liability. With actual notice of the tax lien, D makes cash disbursements to C on August 13, September 13, and October 13, 2004. Under local law D's security interest in the proceeds of the contract with respect to the disbursements is entitled to priority over a judgment lien arising on April 1, 2004 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation.
(ii) Because D's security interest arose by reason of disbursements made pursuant to a written agreement, entered into before tax lien filing, to make cash disbursements to finance a contract to demolish real property, and because D's security interest is valid under local law against a judgment lien arising as of the time of tax lien filed out of an unsecured obligation, the tax lien is not valid with respect to D's security interest in the proceeds of the demolition contract.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2
and, in addition, assume that, as further security for the cash disbursements, the March 3, 2004, agreement also provides for a security interest in all of C's demolition
equipment. Because the protection of the security interest arising from the disbursements made after tax lien filing under the agreement is limited under section 6323(c)(3) to the proceeds of the demolition contract and because, under the circumstances, the security interest in the equipment is not otherwise protected under section 6323, the tax lien will have priority over D's security interest in the equipment.

# Example 4.
(i) On January 3, 2006, F and G enter into a written agreement, whereby F agrees to provide G with cash disbursements, seed, fertilizer, and insecticides as needed by G, in order to finance the raising and harvesting of a crop on a farm owned by G. Under the terms of the agreement F is to have a security interest in the crop, the farm, and all other property then owned or thereafter acquired by G. In accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, on January 10, 2006, a notice of lien is filed and recorded in the public index with respect to G's delinquent tax liability. On March 3, 2006, with actual notice of the tax lien, F makes a cash disbursement of $5,000 to G and furnishes him seed, fertilizer, and insecticides having a value of $10,000. Under local law F's security interest, coming into existence by reason of the cash disbursement and the furnishing of goods, has priority over a judgment lien arising January 10, 2006 (the date of tax lien filing and recording in the public index) out of an unsecured obligation.
(ii) Because F's security interest arose by reason of a disbursement (including the furnishing of goods) made under a written agreement which was entered into before tax lien filing and which constitutes an agreement to finance the raising or harvesting of a farm crop, and because F's security interest is valid under local law against a judgment lien arising as of the time of tax lien filing out of an unsecured obligation, the tax lien is not valid with respect to F's security interest in the crop even though a notice of lien was filed before the security interest arose. Furthermore, because the farm is property subject to the tax lien at the time of tax lien filing, F's security interest with respect to the farm also has priority over the tax lien.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 4
and in addition that on October 2, 2006, G acquires several tractors to which F's security interest attaches under the terms of the agreement. Because the tractors are not property subject to the tax lien at the time of tax lien filing, the tax lien has priority over F's security interest in the tractors.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies with respect to any notice of Federal tax lien filed on or after April 4, 2011.
[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35503, Aug. 23, 1976, as amended by T.D. 9520, 76 FR 18386, Apr. 4, 2011]
§ 301.6323(c)-3
Protection for obligatory disbursement agreements.
(a)
In general.
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a security interest which:
(1) Comes into existence after the tax lien filing,
(2) Is in qualified property covered by the terms of an obligatory disbursement agreement entered into before the tax lien filing, and
(3) Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.
See paragraphs (a) and (e) of § 301.6323(h)-1 for definitions of the terms “security interest” and “tax lien filing.” For purposes of this section, a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of § 301.6323(h)-1.
(b)
Obligatory disbursement agreement.
For purposes of this section the term “obligatory disbursement agreement” means a written agreement, entered into by a person in the course of his trade or business, to make disbursements. An agreement is treated as an obligatory disbursement agreement only with respect to disbursements which are required to be made by reason of the intervention of the rights of a person other than the taxpayer. The obligation to pay must be conditioned upon an event beyond the control of the obligor. For example, the provisions of this section are applicable where an issuing bank obligates itself to honor drafts or other demands for payment on a letter of credit and a bank, in good faith, relies upon that letter of credit in making advances. The provisions of this section are also applicable, for example, where a bonding company obligates itself to make payments to indemnify against loss or liability and, under the terms of the bond, makes a payment with respect to a loss. The priority described in this section is not applicable, for example,
in the case of an accommodation endorsement by an endorser who assumes his obligation other than in the course of his trade or business.
(c)
Qualified property.
Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, the term “qualified property,” for purposes of this section, means property subject to the lien imposed by section 6321 at the time of tax lien filing and, to the extent that the acquisition is directly traceable to the obligatory disbursement, property acquired by the taxpayer after tax lien filing.
(d)
Special rule for surety agreements.
Where the obligatory disbursement agreement is an agreement insuring the performance of a contract of the taxpayer and another person, the term “qualified property” shall be treated as also including—
(1) The proceeds of the contract the performance of which was insured, and
(2) If the contract the performance of which was insured is a contract to construct or improve real property, to produce goods, or to furnish services, any tangible personal property used by the taxpayer in the performance of the insured contract.
For example, a surety company which holds a security interest, arising from cash disbursements made after tax lien filing under a payment or performance bond on a real estate construction project, has priority over the tax lien with respect to the proceeds of the construction contract and, in addition, with respect to any tangible personal property used by the taxpayer in the construction project if its security interest in the tangible personal property is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time the tax lien was filed, out of an unsecured obligation.
(3)
Examples.
This section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) On January 2, 1969, H, an appliance dealer, in order to finance the acquisition from O of a large inventory of appliances, enters into a written agreement with Z, a bank. Under the terms of the agreement, in return for a security interest in all of H's inventory, presently owned and subsequently acquired, Z issues an irrevocable letter of credit to allow H to make the purchase. On December 31, 1968 and January 10, 1969, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, separate notices of lien are filed with respect to H's delinquent tax liabilities. On March 31, 1969, Z honors the letter of credit. Under local law, Z's security interest in both existing and after-acquired inventory is protected against a judgment lien arising on or after January 10, 1969, out of an unsecured obligation. Under local law, Z's security interest in the inventory purchased under the letter of credit qualifies as a purchase money security interest and is valid against persons acquiring security interests in or liens upon such inventory at any time.
(ii) Because Z's security interest in H's inventory did not arise under a written agreement entered into before the filing of notice of the first tax lien on December 31, 1968, that lien is superior to Z's security interest except to the extent of Z's purchase money security interest. Because Z's interest qualifies as a purchase money security interest with respect to the inventory purchased under the letter of credit, the tax liens attach under section 6321 only to the equity acquired by H, and the rights of Z in the inventory so purchased as superior even to the lien filed on December 31, 1968, without regard to this section.
(iii) Because Z's security interest arose by reason of disbursements made under a written agreement which was entered into before the filing of notice of the second tax lien on January 10, 1969, and which constitutes an agreement to make disbursements required to be made by reason of the intervention of the rights of O, a person other than the taxpayer, and because Z's security interest is valid under local law against a judgment lien arising as of the time of such tax lien filing on January 10, 1969, out of an unsecured obligation, the second tax lien is, under this section, not valid with respect to Z's security interest in inventory owned by H on January 10, 1969, as well as any after-acquired inventory directly traceable to Z's disbursements (apart from such greater protection as Z enjoys, with respect to the latter, under its purchase money security interest). No protection against the second tax lien is provided under this section with respect to a security interest in any other inventory acquired by H after January 10, 1969, because such other inventory is neither subject to the tax lien at the time of tax lien filing nor directly traceable to Z's disbursements.

# Example 2.
On June 1, 1971, K is awarded a contract to construct an office building. At the same time, S, a surety company, agrees in writing to insure the performance of the contract. The agreement provides that in the event S must complete the job as the result of a default by K, S will be entitled to the proceeds of the contract. In addition, the agreement provides that S is to have a security interest in all property belonging to K. On December 1, 1971, prior to the completion of the building, K defaults. On the same date, under § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed
with respect to K's delinquent tax liability. S completes the building on June 1, 1972. Under local law S's security interest in the proceeds of the contract and S's security interest in the property of K are entitled to priority over a judgment lien arising December 1, 1971 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation. Because, for purposes of an obligatory disbursement agreement which is a surety agreement, the security interest may be in the proceeds of the insured contract, S's security interest in the proceeds of the contract has priority over the tax lien even though a notice of lien was filed before S's security interest arose. Furthermore, because the insured contract was a contract to construct real property, S's security interest in any of K's tangible personal property used in the performance of the contract also has priority over the tax lien.

# Example 3.
(i) On February 2, 1970, L enters into an agreement with M, a contractor, to construct an apartment building on land owned by L. Under a separate agreement, N bank agrees to furnish funds on a short-term basis to L for the payment of amounts due to M during the course of construction. Simultaneously, X, a financial institution, makes a binding commitment to N bank and L to provide long-term financing for the project after its completion. Under its commitment, X is obligated to pay off the balance of the construction loan held by N bank upon the execution by L of a new promissory note secured by a mortgage deed of trust upon the improved property. On September 4, 1970, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, notice of lien is properly filed with respect to L's delinquent tax liability. On September 8, 1970. X obtains actual notice of the tax lien filing. On September 14, 1970, the documents creating X's security interest are executed and recorded, N bank's lien for its construction loan is released, and X makes the required disbursements to N bank. Under local law, X's security interest is protected against a judgment lien arising on September 4, 1970 (the time of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation.
(ii) Because X's security interest arose by reason of a disbursement made under a written agreement entered into before tax lien filing, which constitutes an agreement to make disbursements required to be made by reason of the intervention of the rights of N bank, a person other than the taxpayer, and because X's security interest is valid under local law against a judgment lien arising as of the time of the tax lien filing out of an unsecured obligation, the tax lien is not valid with respect to X's security interest to the extent of the disbursement to N bank. The obligatory disbursement is protected under section 6323(c)(4) even if X is not subrogated to N bank's rights or X's agreement is not itself a real property construction financing agreement.
[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35504, Aug. 23, 1976]
§ 301.6323(d)-1
45-day period for making disbursements.
(a)
In general.
Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a security interest which comes into existence, after tax lien filing, by reason of disbursements made before the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing, or if earlier, before the person making the disbursements has actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien filing, but only if the security interest is—
(1) In property which is subject, at the time of tax lien filing, to the lien imposed by section 6321 and which is covered by the terms of a written agreement entered into before tax lien filing, and
(2) Protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), a contract right (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of § 301.6323(c)-1) is subject, at the time of tax lien filing, to the lien imposed by section 6321 if the contract has been made by such time. An account receivable (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of § 301.6323(c)-1) is subject, at the time of tax lien filing, to the lien imposed by section 6321 if, and to the extent, a right to payment has been earned by performance at such time. For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (a), a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of § 301.6323(h)-1. For purposes of this section, it is immaterial that the written agreement provides that the disbursements are to be made at the option of the person making the disbursements. See paragraphs (a) and (e) of § 301.6323(h)-1 for definitions of the terms “security interest” and “tax lien filing,” respectively. See paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(i)-1 for certain circumstances under which a person is deemed to have actual notice or knowledge of a fact.
(b)
Examples.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On December 1, 1967, an assessment is made against A with respect to his delinquent tax liability. On January 2, 1968, A enters into a written agreement with B whereby B agrees to lend A $10,000 in return for a security interest in certain property owned by A. On January 10, 1968, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1 notice of the tax lien affecting the property is filed. On February 1, 1968, B, without actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien filing, disburses the loan to A. Under local law, the security interest arising by reason of the disbursement is entitled to priority over a judgment lien arising January 10, 1968 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation. Because the disbursement was made before the 46th day after tax lien filing, because the disbursement was made pursuant to a written agreement entered into before tax lien filing, and because the resulting security interest is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising as of the date of tax lien filing out of an unsecured obligation, B's $10,000 security interest has priority over the tax lien.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that when B disburses the $10,000 to A on February 10, 1968, B has actual knowledge of the tax lien filing. Because the disbursement was made with actual knowledge of tax lien filing, B's security interest does not have priority over the tax lien even though the disbursement was made before the 46th day after the tax lien filing. Furthermore, B is not protected under § 301.6323(a)-1(a) as a holder of a security interest because he had not parted with money or money's worth prior to the time the notice of tax lien was filed (January 10, 1968) even though he had made a firm commitment to A before that time.
[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35505, Aug. 23, 1976]
§ 301.6323(e)-1
Priority of interest and expenses.
(a)
In general.
If the lien imposed by section 6321 is not valid as against another lien or security interest, the priority of the other lien or security interest also extends to each of the following items to the extent that under local law the item has the same priority as the lien or security interest to which it relates:
(1) Any interest or carrying charges (including finance, service, and similar charges) upon the obligation secured,
(2) The reasonable charges and expenses of an indenture trustee (including, for example, the trustee under a deed of trust) or agent holding the security interest for the benefit of the holder of the security interest,
(3) The reasonable expenses, including reasonable compensation for attorneys, actually incurred in collecting or enforcing the obligation secured,
(4) The reasonable costs of insuring, preserving, or repairing the property to which the lien or security interest relates,
(5) The reasonable costs of insuring payment of the obligation secured (including amounts paid by the holder of the security interest for mortgage insurance, such as that issued by the Federal Housing Administration), and
(6) Amounts paid to satisfy any lien on the property to which the lien or security interest relates, but only if the lien so satisfied is entitled to priority over the lien imposed by section 6321.
(b)
Collection expenses.
The reasonable expenses described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section include expenditures incurred by the protected holder of the lien or security interest to establish the priority of his interest or to collect, by foreclosure or otherwise, the amount due him from the property subject to his lien. Accordingly, the amount of the encumbrance which is protected is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the security interest.
(c)
Costs of insuring, preserving, etc.
The reasonable costs of insuring, preserving, or repairing described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section include expenditures by the holder of a security interest for fire and casualty insurance on the property subject to the security interest and amounts paid by the holder of the lien or security interest to repair the property. Such reasonable costs also include the amounts paid by the holder of the lien or security interest in a leasehold to the lessor of the leasehold to preseve the leasehold subject to the lien or security interest. Accordingly, the amount of the lien or security interest which is protected is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the lien or security interest.
(d)
Satisfaction of liens.
The amounts described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section include expenditures incurred
by the protected holder of a lien or security interest to discharge a statutory lien for State sales taxes on the property subject to his lien or security interest if both his lien or security interest and the sales tax lien have priority over a Federal tax lien. Accordingly, the amount of the lien or security interest is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the lien or security interest even though under local law the holder of the lien or security interest is not subrogated to the rights of the holder of the State sales tax lien. However, if the holder of the lien or security interest is subrogated, within the meaning of paragraph (b) of § 301.6323(i)-1, to the rights of the holder of the sales tax lien, he will also be entitled to any additional protection afforded by section 6323(i)(2).
[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35506, Aug. 23, 1976]
§ 301.6323(f)-1
Place for filing notice; form.
(a)
Place for filing.
The notice of lien referred to in § 301.6323(a)-1 shall be filed as follows:
(1)
Under State laws
—(i)
Real property.
In the case of real property, notice shall be filed in one office within the State (or the county or other governmental subdivision), as designated by the laws of the State, in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Personal property.
In the case of personal property, whether tangible or intangible, the notice shall be filed in one office within the State (or the county or other governmental subdivision), as designated by the laws of the State, in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2)
With the clerk of the United States district court.
Whenever a State has not by law designated one office which meets the requirements of subparagraph (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this paragraph (a), the notice shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the U.S. district court for the judicial district in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. For example, a State has not by law designated one office meeting the requirements of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph (a), if more than one office is designated within the State, county, or other governmental subdivision for filing notices with respect to all real property located in such State, county, or other governmental subdivision. A State has not by law designated one office meeting the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph (a), if more than one office is designated in the State, county, or other governmental subdivision for filing notices with respect to all of the personal property of a particular taxpayer. A state law that conforms to or reenacts a federal law establishing a national filing system does not constitute a designation by state law of an office for filing liens against personal property. Thus, if state law provides that a notice of lien affecting personal property must be filed in the office of the county clerk for the county in which the taxpayer resides and also adopts a federal law that requires a notice of lien to be filed in another location in order to attach to a specific type of property, the state is considered to have designated only one office for the filing of the notice of lien, and to protect its lien the Internal Revenue Service need only file its notice in the office of the county clerk for the county in which the taxpayer resides.
(3)
With the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia.
If the property subject to the lien imposed by section 5321 is deemed situated, under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, in the District of Columbia, the notice shall be filed in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia.
(b)
Situs of property subject to lien.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, property is deemed situated as follows:
(1)
Real property.
Real property is deemed situated at its physical location.
(2)
Personal property.
Personal property, whether tangible or intangible, is deemed situated at the residence of the taxpayer at the time the notice of lien is filed.
For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b), the residence of a corporation or partnership is deemed to be the place at which the principal executive office of the business is located, and the residence of a taxpayer whose residence is not within the United States is deemed to be in the District of Columbia.
(c)
National filing system.
The filing of federal tax liens is to be governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code and is not subject to any other federal law that may establish a national system for filing liens and encumbrances against a particular type of personal property. Thus, for example, the Service is not subject to the requirements established by the Federal Aviation Agency for filing liens against civil aircraft in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
(d)
Form
—(1)
In general.
The notice referred to in § 301.6323(a)-1 shall be filed on Form 668, “Notice of Federal Tax Lien Under Internal Revenue Laws”. Such notice is valid notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the form or content of a notice of lien. For example, omission from the notice of lien of a description of the property subject to the lien does not affect the validity thereof even though State law may require that the notice contain a description of the property subject to the lien.
(2)
Form 668 defined.
The term
Form 668
means either a paper form or a form transmitted electronically, including a form transmitted by facsimile (fax) or electronic mail (e-mail). A Form 668 must identify the taxpayer, the tax liability giving rise to the lien, and the date the assessment arose regardless of the method used to file the notice of Federal tax lien.
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The law of State X provides that notices of Federal tax lien affecting personal property are to be filed in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of the county where the taxpayer resides. The laws of State X also provide that notices of lien affecting real property are to be filed with the recorder of deeds of the county where the real property is located. On June 1, 1970, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed in county M with respect to the delinquent tax liability of A. At the time the notice is filed, A is a resident of county M and owns real property in that county. One year later A moves to county N and one year after that A moves to county O. Because the situs of personal property is deemed to be at the residence of the taxpayer at the time the notice of lien is filed, the notice continues to be effectively filed with respect to A's personal property even though A no longer resides in county M. Furthermore, because the situs of real property is deemed to be at its physical location, the notice of lien also continues to be effectively filed with respect to A's real property.

# Example 2.
B is a resident of Canada but owns personal property in the United States. On January 4, 1971, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia. On January 2, 1973, B changes his residence to State Y in the United States. Because the residence of a taxpayer who is not a resident of the United States is deemed to be in the District of Columbia and the situs of personal property is deemed to be at the residence of the taxpayer at the time of filing, the lien continues to be effectively filed with respect to the personal property of B located in the United States even though B has returned to the United States and taken up residence in State Y and even though B has at no time been in the District of Columbia.

# Example 3.
The law of State Z in effect before July 1, 1967, provides that notices of lien affecting real property are to be filed in the office of the recorder of deeds of the county in which the real property is located, but that if the real property is registered under the Torrens system of title registration the notice is to be filed with the registrar of titles rather than the recorder of deeds. The law of State Z in effect after June 30, 1967, provides that all notices of lien affecting real property are to be filed with the recorder of deeds of the county in which the real property is located. Accordingly, where the Torrens system is adopted by a county in State Z, there were before July 1, 1967, two offices designated for filing notices of Federal tax lien affecting real property in the county because one office was designated for Torrens real property and another office was designated for non-Torrens real property. Because State Z had not designated one office within the State, county, or other governmental subdivision for filing notices before July 1, 1967, with respect to all real property located in the State, county, or governmental subdivision, before July 1, 1967, the place for filing notices of lien under this section, affecting property located in counties adopting the Torrens system, was with the clerk of the U.S. district court for the judicial district in which the real property is located. However, after June 30, 1967, the place for filing notices of lien under this section,
affecting both Torrens and non-Torrens real property in counties adopting the Torrens system is with the recorder of deeds for each such county. Notices of lien filed under this section with the clerk of the U.S. district court before July 1, 1967, remain validly filed whether or not refiled with the recorder of deeds after the change in State law or upon refiling during the required refiling period.

# Example 4.
The law of State W provides that notices of lien affecting personal property of corporations and partnerships are to be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. Notices of lien affecting personal property of any other person are to be filed in the office of the clerk of court for the county where the person resides. Because the State law designates only one filing office within State W with respect to personal property of any particular taxpayer, notices of lien filed under this section, affecting personal property, shall be filed in the office designated under State law.

# Example 5.
The law of State F provides that notices of lien affecting personal property are to be filed with the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the personal property is located. State F has conformed state law to federal law to provide that all instruments affecting title to an interest in any civil aircraft of the United States must be recorded in the Office of the Federal Aviation Administrator (FAA) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On July 1, 1990, a tax lien arises against ABC airline, which owns aircraft situated in State F. The Internal Revenue Service files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien with the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the aircraft is located but does not file the notice with the FAA in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Because the FAA system adopted by State F does not constitute a second place of filing pursuant to section 6323(f), the federal tax lien is validly filed.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as
Example 5
except that State F did not reenact or conform state law to the FAA requirements. The result is the same because the filing of federal tax liens is governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code, and is not subject to any other national filing system.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies with respect to any notice of Federal tax lien filed on or after April 4, 2011.
[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35507, Aug. 23, 1976; 41 FR 41690, Sept. 23, 1976, as amended by T.D. 8234, 53 FR 47676, Nov. 25, 1988; T.D. 8557, 59 FR 38120, July 27, 1994; T.D. 9520, 76 FR 18386, Apr. 4, 2011]
§ 301.6323(g)-1
Refiling of notice of tax lien.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Requirement to refile.
In order to continue the effect of a notice of lien, the notice must be refiled in the place described in paragraph (b) of this section during the required refiling period (described in paragraph (c) of this section). If two or more notices of lien are filed with respect to a particular tax assessment, and each notice of lien contains a certificate of release that releases the lien when the required refiling period ends, the failure to comply with the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (c) of this section in respect to one of the notices of lien releases the lien and renders ineffective the refiling of any other notice of lien.
(2)
Effect of refiling.
A timely refiled notice of lien is effective as of the date on which the notice of lien to which it relates was effective.
(3)
Effect of failure to refile
—If the Internal Revenue Service fails to refile a notice of lien in the manner described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the notice is not effective, after the expiration of the required refiling period, as against any person described in section 6323(a), without regard to when the interest of the person in the property subject to the lien was acquired. If a notice of lien contains a certificate of release that provides that the lien is released at the end of the required refiling period unless the notice of lien is refiled, and the notice of lien is not refiled, then the lien is extinguished and the notice of lien is ineffective.
(i) However, neither the failure to refile before the expiration of the refiling period, nor the release of the lien, shall alter or impair any right of the United States to property or its proceeds that is the subject of a levy or judicial proceeding commenced prior to the end of the refiling period or the release of the lien, except to the extent that a person acquires an interest in the property for adequate consideration after the commencement of the proceeding and does not have notice of, and is not bound by, the outcome of the proceeding.
(ii) If a suit or levy referred to in the preceding sentence is dismissed or released and the property is subject to the lien at such time, a notice of lien
with respect to the property is not effective after the suit or levy is dismissed or released unless refiled during the required refiling period.

Filing of new notice.
If a notice of lien is not refiled, and the notice of lien contains a certificate of release that automatically releases the lien when the required refiling period ends, the lien is released as of that date and is no longer in existence. The Internal Revenue Service must revoke the release before it can file a new notice of lien. This new filing must meet the requirements of section 6323(f) and § 301.6323(f)-1 and is effective from the date on which such filing is made.
(b)
Place for refiling notice of lien
—(1)
In general.
A notice of lien refiled during the required refiling period (described in paragraph (c) of this section) shall be effective only—
(i) If the notice of lien is refiled in the office in which the prior notice of lien (including a refiled notice) was filed under the provisions of section 6323; and
(ii) In any case in which 90 days or more prior to the date the refiling of the notice of lien under subdivision (i) is completed, the Internal Revenue Service receives written information (in the manner described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b)) concerning a change in the taxpayer's residence, if a notice of such lien is also filed in accordance with section 6323(f)(1)(A)(ii) in the State in which such new residence is located (or, if such new residence is located without the United States, in the District of Columbia).
A notice of lien is considered as refiled in the office in which the prior notice or refiled notice was filed under the provisions of section 6323 if it is refiled in the office which, pursuant to a change in the applicable local law, assumed the functions of the office in which the prior notice or refiled notice was filed. If on or before the 90th day referred to in subdivision (ii) more than one written notice is received concerning a change in the taxpayer's residence, a notice of lien is required by this subdivision to be filed only with respect to the residence shown on the written notice received on the most recent date. Subdivision (ii) is applicable regardless of whether the taxpayer resides at the new residence on the date the refiling of notice of lien under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is completed.
(2)
Notice of change of taxpayer's residence
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, for purposes of this section, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence will be effective only if it (A) is received, in writing, from the taxpayer or his representative by the district director or the service center director having jurisdiction where the original notice of lien was filed, (B) relates to an unpaid tax liability of the taxpayer, and (C) states the taxpayer's name and the address of his new residence. Although it is not necessary that a written notice contain the taxpayer's identifying number authorized by section 6109, it is preferable that it include such number. For purposes of this subdivision, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence shown on a return or an amended return (including a return of the same tax) will not be effective to notify the Internal Revenue Service.
(ii)
Notice received before August 23, 1976.
For purposes of this section, a notice of a change of a taxpayer's residence will also be effective if it (A) is received, in writing, by any office of the Internal Revenue Service before August 23, 1976, from the taxpayer or his representative, (B) relates to an unpaid tax liability of the taxpayer, and (C) states the taxpayer's name and the address of his new residence.
(iii)
By return or amended return.
For purposes of this section, in the case of a notice of lien which relates to an assessment of tax made after December 31, 1966, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence will also be effective if it is contained in a return or amended return of the same type of tax filed with the Internal Revenue Service by the taxpayer or his representative which on its face indicates that there is a change in the taxpayer's address and correctly states the taxpayer's name, the address of his new residence, and his identifying number required by section 6109.
(iv)
Other rules applicable.
Except as provided in subdivisions (i), (ii), and
(iii) of this subparagraph, no communication (either written or oral) to the Internal Revenue Service will be considered effective as notice of a change of a taxpayer's residence under this section, whether or not the Service has actual notice or knowledge of the taxpayer's new residence. For the purpose of determining the date on which a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence is received under this section, the notice shall be treated as received on the date it is actually received by the Internal Revenue Service without reference to the provisions of section 7502.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1.
A, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State M and owns real property in State N. In accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, notices of lien are filed in States M and N. The notices of lien contain certificates of release that release the lien at the end of the required refiling period. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in either M or N, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of lien with the appropriate office in M as well as with the appropriate office in N.

# Example 2.
B, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State M. In accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, notice of lien is properly filed in that State. One year before the beginning of the required refiling period, B establishes his residence in State N, and B immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in M, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, notices of lien with (i) the appropriate office in M, and (ii) the appropriate office in N, because B properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to N more than 89 days prior to the date refiling of the notice of lien in M is completed. Even if the Internal Revenue Service had acquired actual notice or knowledge of B's change in residence by other means, if B had not properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence, the effect of the notice of lien in State M could have been continued without any refiling in State N.

# Example 3.
C, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State O. In accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, notice of lien is properly filed in that State. Four years before the required refiling period, C establishes his residence in State P, and C immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Three years before the required refiling period, C establishes his residence in State R, and again C immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in O, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, notices of lien with (i) the appropriate office in O, and (ii) the appropriate office in R. Refiling in R is required because the notice received by the Service of C's change in residence to R was the most recent notice received more than 89 days prior to the date refiling in O is completed. The notice of lien is not required to be filed in P, even though C properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P, because such notice is not the most recent one received.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example 3, except that C does not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to R in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in O, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of lien with (i) the appropriate office in O, and (ii) the appropriate office in P. Refiling in P is required because C properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P, even though C is not a resident of P on the date refiling of the notice of lien in O is completed. The Internal Revenue Service is not required to file a notice of lien in R because C did not properly notify the Service of his change in residence to R.

# Example 5.
D, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State M and owns real property in States N and O. In accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, the Internal Revenue Service files notices of lien in M, N, and O States. Nine years and 6 months after the date of the assessment shown on the notice of lien, D establishes his residence in P, and at that time the Internal Revenue Service receives from D a notification of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. On a date which is 9 years and 7 months after the date of the assessment shown on the notice of lien, the Internal Revenue Service properly refiles notices of lien in M, N, and O which refilings are sufficient to continue the effect of each of the notices of lien. The Internal Revenue Service is not required to file a notice of lien in P because D did not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change of residence to P more than 89 days prior to the date each of the refilings in M, N, and O was completed.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in example 5 except that the refiling of the notice
of lien in O occurs 100 days after D notifies the Internal Revenue Service of hischange in residence to P in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in O, in addition to refiling the notice of lien in O, the Internal Revenue Service must also refile, during the required refiling period, a notice of lien in P because D properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change of residence to P more than 89 days prior to the date the refiling in O was completed. However, the Internal Revenue Service is not required to refile the notice of lien in P to maintain the effect of the notices of lien in M and N because D did not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P more than 89 days prior to the date the refilings in M and N were completed.

# Example 7.
E, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State T. Because T has not designated one office in the case of personal property for filing notices of lien in accordance with the provisions of section 6323(f)(1)(A)(ii), the Internal Revenue Service properly files a notice of lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States district court. However, solely as a matter of convenience for those who may have occasion to search for notices of lien, and not as a matter of legal effectiveness, the Internal Revenue Service also files notice of lien with the recorder of deeds of the county in T where E resides. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service sends a copy of the notice of lien to the X life insurance company to give the company actual notice of the notice of lien. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien, the Internal Revenue Service must refile the notice of lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States district court during the required refiling period. In order to continue the effect of the notice of the lien, it is not necessary to refile the notice of lien with the Recorder of Deeds of the county where E resides, because the refiling of the notice of lien with the recorder of deeds does not constitute a proper filing for the purposes of section 6323(f). In addition, to continue the effect of the notice of lien under this section it is not necessary to send a copy of the notice of lien to the X life insurance company, because the sending of a notice of lien to an insurance company does not constitute a proper filing for the purposes of section 6323(f).
(c)
Required refiling period
—(1)
In general.
For the purpose of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the term
required refiling period
means—
(i) The 1-year period ending 30 days after the expiration of 10 years after the date of the assessment of the tax; and
(ii) The 1-year period ending with the expiration of 10 years after the close of the preceding required refiling period for such notice of lien.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph:

# Example 1.
On March 10, 1998, an assessment of tax is made against B, a delinquent taxpayer, and a lien for the amount of the assessment arises on that date. On July 10, 1998, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed. The notice of lien filed on July 10, 1998, is effective through April 9, 2008. The first required refiling period for the notice of lien begins on April 10, 2007, and ends on April 9, 2008. A refiling of the notice of lien during that period will extend the effectiveness of the notice of lien filed on July 10, 1998, through April 9, 2018. The second required refiling period for the notice of lien begins on April 10, 2017, and ends on April 9, 2018.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the Internal Revenue Service fails to refile a notice of lien during the first required refiling period (April 10, 2007, through April 9, 2008). A notice of lien is filed on June 9, 2009, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. This notice is ineffective if the original notice contained a certificate of release, as the certificate of release would have had the effect of extinguishing the lien as of April 10, 2008. The Internal Revenue Service could revoke the release and file a new notice of lien, which would be effective as of the date it was filed.
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies with respect to any notice of Federal tax lien filed on or after April 4, 2011.
[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35509, Aug. 23, 1976, as amended by T.D. 9520, 76 FR 18386, Apr. 4, 2011]
§ 301.6323(h)-0
Scope of definitions.
Except as otherwise provided by § 301.6323(h)-1 the definitions provided by § 301.6323(h)-1 apply for purposes of §§ 301.6323(a)-1 through 301.6324-1.
[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35509, Aug. 23, 1976]
§ 301.6323(h)-1
Definitions.
(a)
Security interest
—(1)
In general.
The term “security interest” means any interest in property acquired by contract for the purpose of securing
payment or performance of an obligation or indemnifying against loss or liability. A security interest exists at any time—
(i) If, at such time, the property is in existence and the interest has become protected under local law against a subsequent judgment lien (as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (a)) arising out of an unsecured obligation; and
(ii) To the extent that, at such time, the holder has parted with money or money's worth (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (a)).
For purposes of this subparagraph, a contract right (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of § 301.6323(c)-1) is in existence when the contract is made. An account receivable (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of § 301.6323(c)-1) is in existence when, and to the extent, a right to payment is earned by performance.
A security interest must be in existence, within the meaning of this paragraph, at the time as of which its priority against a tax lien is determined. For example, to be afforded priority under the provisions of paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(a)-1 a security interest must be in existence within the meaning of this paragraph before a notice of lien is filed.
(2)
Protection against a subsequent judgment lien.
(i) For purposes of this paragraph, a security interest is deemed to be protected against a subsequent judgment lien on—
(A) The date on which all actions required under local law to establish the priority of a security interest against a judgment lien have been taken, or
(B) If later, the date on which all required actions are deemed effective, under local law, to establish the priority of the security interest against a judgment lien.
For purposes of this subdivision, the dates described in (A) and (B) of this subdivision (i) shall be determined without regard to any rule or principle of local law which permits the relation back of any requisite action to a date earlier than the date on which the action is actually performed. For purposes of this paragraph, a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of this section.
(ii) The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (a)(2):

# Example.
(i) Under the law of State X, a security interest in certificated securities, negotiable documents, or instruments may be perfected, and hence protected against a judgment lien, by filing or by the secured party taking possession of the collateral. However, a security interest in such intangible personal property is considered to be temporarily perfected for a period of 20 days from the time the security interest attaches, to the extent that it arises for new value given under an authenticated security agreement. Under the law of X, a security interest attaches to such collateral when there is an agreement between the creditor and debtor that the interest attaches, the debtor has rights in the property, and consideration is given by the creditor. Under the law of X, in the case of temporary perfection, the security interest in such property is protected during the 20-day period against a judgment lien arising, after the security interest attaches, out of an unsecured obligation. Upon expiration of the 20-day period, the holder of the security interest must perfect its security interest under local law.
(ii) Because the security interest is perfected during the 20-day period against a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation, and because filing or the taking of possession before the conclusion of the period of temporary perfection is not considered, for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, to be a requisite action which relates back to the beginning of such period, the requirements of this paragraph are satisfied. Because filing or taking possession is a condition precedent to continued perfection, filing or taking possession of the collateral is a requisite action to establish such priority after expiration of the period of temporary perfection. If there is a lapse of perfection for failure to file or take possession, the determination of when the security interest exists (for purposes of protection against the tax lien) is made without regard to the period of temporary perfection.
(3)
Money or money's worth.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term
money or money's worth
includes money, a security (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), tangible or intangible property, services, and other consideration reducible to a money value. Money or money's worth also includes any consideration which otherwise would constitute money or money's worth under the preceding sentence which was parted with before the security interest would otherwise exist if, under local law, past consideration is
sufficient to support an agreement giving rise to a security interest, and provided that the grant of the security interest is not a fraudulent transfer under local law or 28 U.S.C. § 3304(a)(2). A firm commitment to part with money, a security, tangible or intangible property, services, or other consideration reducible to a money value does not, in itself, constitute a consideration in money or money's worth. A relinquishing or promised relinquishment of dower, curtesy, or of a statutory estate created in lieu of dower or curtesy, or of other marital rights is not a consideration in money or money's worth. Nor is love and affection, promise of marriage, or any other consideration not reducible to a money value a consideration in money or money's worth.
(4)
Holder of a security interest.
For purposes of this paragraph, the holder of a security interest is the person in whose favor there is a security interest. For provisions relating to the treatment of a purchaser of commercial financing security as a holder of a security interest, see § 301.6323(c)-1(e).
(b)
Mechanic's lienor
—(1)
In general.
The term “mechanic's lienor” means any person who under local law has a lien on real property (or on the proceeds of a contract relating to real property) for services, labor, or materials furnished in connection with the construction or improvement (including demolition) of the property. A mechanic's lienor is treated as having a lien on the later of—
(i) The date on which the mechanic's lien first becomes valid under local law against subsequent purchasers of the real property without actual notice, or
(ii) The date on which the mechanic's lienor begins to furnish the services, labor, or materials.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On February 1, 1968, A lets a contract for the construction of an office building on property owned by him. On March 1, 1968, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien for delinquent Federal taxes owed by A is filed. On April 1, 1968, B, a lumber dealer, delivers lumber to A's property. On May 1, 1968, B records a mechanic's lien against the property to secure payment of the price of the lumber. Under local law, B's mechanic's lien is valid against subsequent purchasers of real property without notice from February 1, 1968, which is the date the construction contract was entered into. Because the date on which B's mechanic's lien is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers is February 1, and the date on which B begins to furnish the materials is April 1, the date on which B becomes a mechanic's lienor within the meaning of this paragraph is April 1, the later of these two dates. Under paragraph (a) of § 301.6323(a)-1, B's mechanic's lien will not have priority over the Federal tax lien, even though under local law the mechanic's lien relates back to the date of the contract.
(c)
Motor vehicle.
(1) The term “motor vehicle” means a self-propelled vehicle which is registered for highway use under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country.
(2) A motor vehicle is “registered for highway use” at the time of a sale if immediately prior to the sale it is so registered under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country. Where immediately prior to the sale of a motor vehicle by a dealer, the dealer is permitted under local law to operate it under a dealer's tag, license, or permit issued to him, the motor vehicle is considered to be registered for highway use in the name of the dealer at the time of the sale.
(d)
Security.
The term “security” means any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness, issued by a corporation or a government or political subdivision thereof, with interest coupons or in registered form, share of stock, voting trust certificate, or any certificate of interest or participation in, certificate of deposit or receipt for, temporary or interim certificate for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing; negotiable instrument; or money.
(e)
Tax lien filing.
The term “tax lien filing” means the filing of notice of the lien imposed by section 6321 in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1.
(f)
Purchaser
—(1)
In general.
The term “purchaser” means a person who, for adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (f)), acquires an interest (other than a lien or security interest) in property which
is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice.
(2)
Interest in property.
For purposes of this paragraph, each of the following interest is treated as an interest in property, if it is not a lien or security interest:
(i) A lease of property,
(ii) A written executory contract to purchase or lease property,
(iii) An option to purchase or lease property and any interest therein, or
(iv) An option to renew or extend a lease of property.
(3)
Adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth” means a consideration in money or money's worth having a reasonable relationship to the true value of the interest in property acquired. See paragraph (a)(3) of this section for definition of the term “money or money's worth.” Adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth may include the consideration in a bona fide bargain purchase. The term also includes the consideration in a transaction in which the purchaser has not completed performance of his obligation, such as the consideration in an installment purchase contract, even though the purchaser has not completed the installment payments.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A enters into a contract for the purchase of a house and lot from B. Under the terms of the contract A makes a down payment and is to pay the balance of the purchase price in 120 monthly installments. After payment of the last installment, A is to receive a deed to the property. A enters into possession, which under local law protects his interest in the property against subsequent purchasers without actual notice. After A has paid five monthly installments, a notice of lien for Federal taxes is filed against B in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. Because the contract is an executory contract to purchase property and is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice, A qualifies as a purchaser under this paragraph.

# Example 2.
C owns a residence which he leases to his son-in-law, D, for a period of 5 years commencing January 1, 1968. The lease provides for payment of $100 a year, although the fair rental value of the residence is $2,500 a year. The lease is recorded on December 31, 1967. On March 1, 1968, a notice of tax lien for unpaid Federal taxes of C is filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1. Under local law, D's interest is protected against subsequent purchasers without actual notice. However, because the rental paid by D has no reasonable relationship to the value of the interest in property acquired, D does not qualify as a purchaser under this paragraph.
(g)
Judgment lien creditor.
The term “judgment lien creditor” means a person who has obtained a valid judgment, in a court of record and of competent jurisdiction, for the recovery of specifically designated property or for a certain sum of money. In the case of a judgment for the recovery of a certain sum of money, a judgment lien creditor is a person who has perfected a lien under the judgment on the property involved. A judgment lien is not perfected until the identity of the lienor, the property subject to the lien, and the amount of the lien are established. Accordingly, a judgment lien does not include an attachment or garnishment lien until the lien has ripened into judgment, even though under local law the lien of the judgment relates back to an earlier date. If recording or docketing is necessary under local law before a judgment becomes effective against third parties acquiring liens on real property, a judgment lien under such local law is not perfected with respect to real property until the time of such recordation or docketing. If under local law levy or seizure is necessary before a judgment lien becomes effective against third parties acquiring liens on personal property, then a judgment lien under such local law is not perfected until levy or seizure of the personal property involved. The term “judgment” does not include the determination of a quasi-judicial body or of an individual acting in a quasi-judicial capacity such as the action of State taxing authorities.
(h)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies as of April 4, 2011.
[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35511, Aug. 23, 1976, as amended by T.D. 9520, 76 FR 18387, Apr. 4, 2011]
§ 301.6323(i)-1
Special rules.
(a)
Actual notice or knowledge.
For purposes of subchapter C (section 6321
and following), chapter 64 of the Code, an organization is deemed, in any transaction, to have actual notice or knowledge of any fact from the time the fact is brought to the attention of the individual conducting the transaction, and in any event from the time the fact would have been brought to the individual's attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless such communication is part of his regular duties or unless he has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.
(b)
Subrogation
—(1)
In general.
Where, under local law, one person is subrogated to the rights of another with respect to a lien or interest, such person shall be subrogated to such rights for purposes of any lien imposed by section 6321 or 6324. Thus, if a tax lien imposed by section 6321 or 6324 is not valid with respect to a particular interest as against the holder of that interest, then the tax lien also is not valid with respect to that interest as against any person who, under local law, is a successor in interest to the holder of that interest.
(2)
Example.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On February 1, 1968, an assessment is made and a tax lien arises with respect to A's delinquent tax liability. On February 25, 1968, in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is properly filed. On March 1, 1968, A negotiates a loan from B, the security for which is a second mortgage on property owned by A. The first mortgage on the property is held by C and has priority over the tax lien. Upon default by A, C begins proceedings to foreclose upon the first mortgage. On September 1, 1968, B pays the amount of principal and interest in default to C in order to protect the second mortgage against the pending foreclosure of C's senior mortgage. Under local law, B is subrogated to C's rights to the extent of the payment to C. Therefore, the tax lien is invalid against B to the extent he became subrogated to C's rights even though the tax lien is valid against B's second mortgage on the property.
(c)
Disclosure of amount of outstanding lien.
If a notice of lien has been filed (see § 301.6323(f)-1), the amount of the outstanding obligation secured by the lien is authorized to be disclosed as a matter of public record on Form 668 “Notice of Federal Tax Lien Under Internal Revenue Laws.” The amount of the outstanding obligation secured by the lien remaining unpaid at the time of an inquiry is authorized to be disclosed to any person who has a proper interest in determining this amount. Any person who has a right in the property or intends to obtain a right in the property by purchase or otherwise will, upon presentation by him of satisfactory evidence be considered to have a proper interest. Any person desiring this information may make his request to the office of the Internal Revenue Service named on the notice of lien with respect to which the request is made. The request should clearly describe the property subject to the lien, identify the applicable lien, and give the reasons for requesting the information.
[T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35511, Aug. 23, 1976]
§ 301.6323(j)-1
Withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien in certain circumstances.
(a)
In general.
The Commissioner or his delegate (Commissioner) may withdraw a notice of federal tax lien filed under this section, if the Commissioner determines that any of the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section exist. A notice of federal tax lien is withdrawn by the filing by the Commissioner of a notice of withdrawal in the office in which the notice of federal tax lien is filed. If a notice of withdrawal is filed, chapter 64 of subtitle F, relating to collection, will be applied as if the withdrawn notice had never been filed. A copy of the notice of withdrawal will be provided to the taxpayer. Upon written request by a taxpayer with respect to whom a notice of federal tax lien has
been or will be withdrawn, the Commissioner will promptly make reasonable efforts to notify any credit reporting agency and any financial institution or creditor identified by the taxpayer of the withdrawal of such notice. The withdrawal of a notice of federal tax lien will not affect the underlying federal tax lien.
(b)
Conditions authorizing withdrawal.
The Commissioner may authorize the withdrawal of a notice of federal tax lien upon determining that one of the following conditions exists:
(1)
Premature or not in accordance with administrative procedures.
The filing of the notice of federal tax lien was premature or otherwise not in accordance with the administrative procedures of the Secretary.
(2)
Installment agreement.
The taxpayer has entered into an agreement under section 6159 to satisfy the liability for which the lien was imposed by means of installment payments. Entry into an installment agreement may not, however, be the basis for withdrawal of a notice of lien if the installment agreement specifically provides that a notice of federal tax lien will not be withdrawn.
(3)
Facilitate collection.
The withdrawal of the notice of federal tax lien will facilitate the collection of the tax liability for which the lien was imposed.
(4)
Best interests of the United States and the taxpayer
—(i)
In general.
The taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate) has consented to the withdrawal of the notice of federal tax lien, and withdrawal of the notice would be in the best interest of the taxpayer, as determined by the taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate), and in the best interest of the United States, as determined by the Commissioner.
(ii)
Best interest of the taxpayer.
When a taxpayer requests the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien based on the best interests of the United States and the taxpayer, the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate) generally will determine whether the withdrawal of the notice of federal tax lien is in the best interest of the taxpayer. If, however, a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to withdraw a notice and has not specifically requested the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate) to determine the taxpayer's best interest, a finding by the Commissioner that the withdrawal of notice is in the best interest of the taxpayer will be sufficient to support withdrawal. If the Commissioner decides independently of a request by the taxpayer to withdraw a notice of federal tax lien, the taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate) must consent to the withdrawal.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1.
A owes $1,000 in Federal income taxes. The IRS files a notice of federal tax lien to secure A's tax liability. However, the IRS failed to follow procedure provided by the Internal Revenue Manual (but not required by statute) with regard to managerial approval prior to the filing of a notice of federal tax lien. The Commissioner may withdraw the notice of federal tax lien because the filing of the notice was not in accordance with the Secretary's administrative procedures.

# Example 2.
A owes $1,000 in federal income taxes. A enters into an agreement to pay the outstanding federal income tax liability in installments. The agreement provides that a notice of federal tax lien may be filed if the taxpayer defaults. A timely pays the installments each month and has not defaulted in any way. Eleven months after entering into the installment agreement, the Internal Revenue Service files a notice of federal tax lien. Noting that there has been no default, the taxpayer asks the Internal Revenue Service to withdraw the notice of federal tax lien. In this situation, the Commissioner may withdraw the notice of federal tax lien because the taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement.

# Example 3.
A is an employee of X Corporation. A notice of federal tax lien has been filed to secure an outstanding tax liability against A. A, who has no assets and no other secured creditors, has agreed to pay the balance of tax due through payroll deductions at a rate higher than the Internal Revenue Service could obtain through a wage levy in order to get the notice of federal tax lien withdrawn. X Corporation has agreed to allow A to enter into a payroll deduction agreement. In this situation, the Commissioner may withdraw the notice of federal tax lien to facilitate collection.

# Example 4.
A is owner of a farm machinery dealership against whom a notice of federal tax lien has been filed to secure an outstanding tax liability. A currently is paying
the tax liability by an installment agreement. X Corporation has agreed to provide A with 100 tractors to increase A's inventory if the notice of federal tax lien is withdrawn. A asks the Internal Revenue Service to withdraw the notice of federal tax lien. The Commissioner determines that the larger inventory would enable A to generate additional tractor sales. Increased sales would enable A to increase the amount of installment payments and, consequently, reduce the amount of time needed to satisfy the liability. A, who has no other assets or secured creditors, has agreed to modify the installment agreement. The Commissioner may withdraw the notice of federal tax lien because the withdrawal is in the best interest of the taxpayer and the United States.
(c)
Determinations by the Commissioner.
The Commissioner must determine whether any of the conditions authorizing the withdrawal of a notice of federal tax lien exist if a taxpayer submits a request for withdrawal in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The Commissioner may also make this determination independent of a request from the taxpayer based on information received from a source other than the taxpayer. If the Commissioner determines that conditions authorizing the withdrawal are not present, the Commissioner may not authorize the withdrawal. If the Commissioner determines conditions for withdrawal are present, the Commissioner may (but is not required to) authorize the withdrawal.
(d)
Procedures for request for withdrawal
—(1)
Manner.
A request for the withdrawal of a notice of federal tax lien must be made in writing in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Commissioner.
(2)
Form.
The written request will include the following information and documents—
(i) Name, current address, and taxpayer identification number of the person requesting the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien;

(v) A request to disclose the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien to the persons listed in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.
(e)
Supplemental list of credit agencies, financial institutions, and creditors
—(1)
In general.
If the Commissioner grants a withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien, the taxpayer may supplement the list in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. If no list was provided in the request to withdraw the notice of federal tax lien, the list in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section and the request for notification in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section may be submitted after the notice is withdrawn.
(2)
Manner.

[T.D. 8951, 66 FR 33465, June 22, 2001]
§ 301.6324-1
Special liens for estate and gift taxes; personal liability of transferees and others.
(a)
Estate tax.
(1) A lien for estate tax attaches at the date of the decedent's death to every part of the gross estate, whether or not the property comes into possession of the duly qualified executor or administrator. The lien attaches to the extent of the tax shown to be due by the return and of any deficiency in tax found to be due upon review and audit. If the estate tax is not paid when due, then the spouse, transferee, trustee (except the trustee of an employee's trust which meets the requirements of section 401(a)), surviving tenant, person in possession of the property by reason of the exercise, nonexercise, or release of a power of appointment, or beneficiary, who receives, or has on the date of the decedent's death, property included in the gross estate under sections 2034 to 2042, inclusive, shall be personally liable for the tax to the extent of the value, at the time of the decedent's death, of the property.
(2) Unless the tax is paid in full or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the lien upon the entire property constituting the gross estate continues for a period of 10 years after the decedent's death, except that the lien shall be divested with respect to—
(i) The portion of the gross estate used for the payment of charges against the estate and expenses of its administration allowed by any court having jurisdiction thereof;
(ii) Property included in the gross estate under sections 2034 to 2042, inclusive, which is transferred by (or transferred by the transferee of) the spouse, transferee, trustee, surviving tenant, person in possession of the property by reason of the exercise, nonexercise, or release of a power of appointment, or beneficiary to a purchaser or holder of a security interest. In such case a like lien attaches to all the property of the spouse, transferee, trustee, surviving tenant, person in possession, beneficiary, or transferee of any such person, except the part which is transferred to a purchaser or a holder of a security interest. See section 6323(h) (1) and (6) and the regulations thereunder, respectively, for the definitions of “security interest” and “purchaser”;
(iii) The portion of the gross estate (or any interest therein) which has been transferred to a purchaser or holder of a security interest if payment is made of the full amount of tax determined by the district director pursuant to a request of the fiduciary (executor, in the case of the estate of a decedent dying before January 1, 1971) for discharge from personal liability as authorized by section 2204 (relating to discharge of fiduciary from personal liability) but there is substituted a like lien upon the consideration received from the purchaser or holder of a security interest; and
(iv) Property as to which the district director has issued a certificate releasing a lien under section 6325(a) and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Lien for gift tax.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a lien attaches upon all gifts made during the period for which the return was filed (see § 25.6019-1 of this chapter) for the amount of tax imposed upon the gifts made during such period. The lien extends for a period of 10 years from the time the gifts are made, unless the tax is sooner paid in full or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time. If the tax is not paid when due, the donee of any gift becomes personally liable for the tax to the extent of the value of his gift. Any part of the property comprised in the gift transferred by the donee (or by a transferee of the donee) to a purchaser or holder of a security interest is divested of the lien, but a like lien, to the extent of the value of the gift, attaches to all the property (including after-acquired property) of the donee (or the transferee) except any part transferred to a purchaser or holder of a security interest. See section 6323(h) (1) and (6) and the regulations thereunder, respectively, for the definitions of “security interest” and “purchaser.”
(c)
Exceptions.
(1) A lien described in either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section is not valid against a mechanic's lienor (as defined in section 6323(h) (2) and the regulations thereunder) and, subject to the conditions set forth under section 6323(b) (relating to protection for certain interests even
though notice filed), is not valid with respect to any lien or interest described in section 6323(b) and the regulations thereunder.
(2) If a lien described in either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section is not valid against a lien or security interest (as defined in section 6323(h) (1) and the regulations thereunder), the priority of the lien or security interest extends to any item described in section 6323(e) (relating to priority of interest and expenses) to the extent that, under local law, the item has the same priority as the lien or security interest to which it relates.
(d)
Application of lien imposed by section 6321.
The general lien under section 6321 and the special lien under subsection (a) or (b) of section 6324 for the estate or gift tax are not exclusive of each other, but are cumulative. Each lien will arise when the conditions precedent to the creation of such lien are met and will continue in accordance with the provisions applicable to the particular lien. Thus, the special lien may exist without the general lien being in force, or the general lien may exist without the special lien being in force, or the general lien and the special lien may exist simultaneously, depending upon the facts and pertinent statutory provisions applicable to the respective liens.
[T.D. 7238, 37 FR 28740, Dec. 29, 1972]
§ 301.6324A-1
Election of and agreement to special lien for estate tax deferred under section 6166 or 6166A.
(a)
Election of lien.
If payment of a portion of the estate tax is deferred under section 6166 or 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal by Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981), an executor of a decedent's estate who seeks to be discharged from personal liability may elect a lien in favor of the United States in lieu of the bonds required by sections 2204 and 6165. This election is made by applying to the Internal Revenue Service office where the estate tax return is filed at any time prior to payment of the full amount of estate tax and interest due. The application is to be a notice of election requesting the special lien provided by section 6324A and is to be accompanied by the agreement described in paragraph (b) (1) of this section.
(b)
Agreement to lien
—(1)
In general.
A lien under this section will not arise unless all parties having any interest in all property designated in the notice of election as property to which the lien is to attach sign an agreement in which they consent to the creation of the lien. (Property so designated need not be property included in the decedent's estate.) The agreement is to be attached to the notice in which the lien under section 6324A is elected. It must be in a form that is binding on all parties having any interest on the property and must contain the following:
(i) The decedent's name and taxpayer identification number as they appear on the estate tax return;
(ii) The amount of the lien;
(iii) The fair market value of the property to be subject to the lien as of the date of the decedent's death and the date of the election under this section;
(iv) The amount, as of the date of the decedent's death and the date of the election, of all encumbrances on the property, including mortgages and any lien under section 6324B;
(v) A clear description of the property which is to be subject to the lien, and in the case of property other than land, a statement of its estimated remaining useful life; and
(vi) Designation of an agent (including the agent's address) for the beneficiaries of the estate and the consenting parties to the lien for all dealings with the Internal Revenue Service on matters arising under section 6166 or 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal by Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981), or under section 6324A.
(2)
Persons having an interest in designated property.
An interest in property is any interest which as of the date of the election can be asserted under applicable local law so as to affect the disposition of any property designated in the agreement required under this section. Any person in being at the date of the election who has any such interest in the property, whether present or future, or vested or contingent, must enter into the agreement.
Included among such persons are owners of remainder and executory interests, the holders of general or special powers of appointment, beneficiaries of a gift over in default of exercise of any such power, co-tenants, joint tenants, and holders of other undivided interests when the decedent held a joint or undivided interest in the property, and trustees of trusts holding any interest in the property. An heir who has the power under local law to caveat (challenge) a will and thereby affect disposition of the property is not, however, considered to be a person with an interest in property under section 6324A solely by reason of that right. Likewise, creditors of an estate are not such persons solely by reason of their status as creditors.
(3)
Consent on behalf of interested party.
If any person required to enter into the agreement provided for by this paragraph either desires that an agent act for him or her or cannot legally bind himself or herself due to infancy or other incompetency, a representative authorized under local law to bind the interested party in an agreement of this nature is permitted to sign the agreement on his or her behalf.
(4)
Duties of agent designated in agreement.
The Internal Revenue Service will contact the agent designated in the agreement under paragraph (b)(1) on all matters relating to continued qualification of the estate under section 6166 or 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal by Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981) and on all matters relating to the special lien arising under section 6324A. It is the duty of the agent as attorney-in-fact for the parties with interests in the property subject to the lien under section 6324A to furnish the Service with any requested information and to notify the Service of any event giving rise to acceleration of the deferred amount of tax.
(c)
Partial substitution of bond for lien.
If the amount of unpaid estate tax plus interest exceeds the value (determined for purposes of section 6324A(b)(2)) of property listed in the agreement under paragraph (b) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service may condition the release from personal liability upon the executor's submitting an agreement listing additional property or furnishing an acceptable bond in the amount of such excess.
(d)
Relation of sections 6324A and 2204.
The lien under section 6324A is deemed to be a bond under section 2204 for purposes of determining an executor's release from personal liability. If an election has been made under section 6324A, the executor may not substitute a bond pursuant to section 2204 in lieu of that lien. If a bond has been supplied under section 2204, however, the executor may, by filing a proper notice of election and agreement, substitute a lien under section 6324A for any part or all of such bond.
(e)
Relation of sections 6324A and 6324.
If there is a lien under this section on any property with respect to an estate, that lien is in lieu of the lien provided by section 6324 on such property with respect to the same estate.
(f)
Section 6324A lien to be in lieu of bond under section 6165.
The lien under section 6324A is in lieu of any bond otherwise required under section 6165 with respect to tax to be paid in installments under section 6166 or section 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal by Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981).
(g)
Special rule for estates for which elections under section 6324A are made on or before August 30, 1980.
If a lien is elected under section 6324A on or before August 30, 1980, the original election may be revoked. To revoke an election, the executor must file a notice of revocation containing the decedent's name, date of death, and taxpayer identification number with the Internal Revenue Service office where the original estate tax return for the decedent was filed. The notice must be filed on or before January 31, 1981 (or if earlier, the date on which the period of limitation for assessment expires).

§ 301.6325-1
Release of lien or discharge of property.
(a)
Release of lien
—(1)
Liability satisfied or unenforceable.
The appropriate official shall issue a certificate of release for a filed notice of Federal tax lien, no later than 30 days after the date on which he finds that the entire tax liability listed in such notice of Federal tax lien either has been fully satisfied (as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section) or has become legally unenforceable. In all cases, the liability for the payment of the tax continues until satisfaction of the tax in full or until the expiration of the statutory period for collection, including such extension of the period for collection as is agreed to.
(2)
Bond accepted.
The appropriate official shall issue a certificate of release of any tax lien if he is furnished and accepts a bond that is conditioned upon the payment of the amount assessed (together with all interest in respect thereof), within the time agreed upon in the bond, but not later than 6 months before the expiration of the statutory period for collection, including any agreed upon extensions. For provisions relating to bonds, see sections 7101 and 7102 and §§ 301.7101-1 and 301.7102-1.
(3)
Certificate of release for a lien which has become legally unenforceable.
The appropriate official shall have the authority to file a notice of Federal tax lien which also contains a certificate of release pertaining to those liens which become legally unenforceable. Such release will become effective as a release as of a date prescribed in the document containing the notice of Federal tax lien and certificate of release.
(4)
Satisfaction of tax liability.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, satisfaction of the tax liability occurs when—
(i) The appropriate official determines that the entire tax liability listed in a notice of Federal tax lien has been fully satisfied. Such determination will be made as soon as practicable after tender of payment; or
(ii) The taxpayer provides the appropriate official with proof of full payment (as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section) with respect to the entire tax liability listed in a notice of Federal tax lien together with the information and documents set forth in paragraph (a)(7) of this section. See paragraph (a)(6) of this section if more than one tax liability is listed in a notice of Federal tax lien.
(5)
Proof of full payment.
As used in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, the term
proof of full payment
means—
(i) An internal revenue cashier's receipt reflecting full payment of the tax liability in question;
(ii) A canceled check in an amount sufficient to satisfy the tax liability for which the release is being sought;
(iii) A record, made in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Commissioner, of proper payment of the tax liability by credit or debit card or by electronic funds transfer; or
(iv) Any other manner of proof acceptable to the appropriate official.
(6)
Notice of a Federal tax lien which lists multiple liabilities.
When a notice of Federal tax lien lists multiple tax liabilities, the appropriate official shall issue a certificate of release when all of the tax liabilities listed in the notice of Federal tax lien have been fully satisfied or have become legally unenforceable. In addition, if the taxpayer requests that a certificate of release be issued with respect to one or more tax liabilities listed in the notice of Federal tax lien and such liability has been fully satisfied or has become legally unenforceable, the appropriate official shall issue a certificate of release. For example, if a notice of Federal tax lien lists two separate liabilities and one of the liabilities is satisfied, the taxpayer may request the issuance of a certificate of release with respect to the satisfied tax liability and the appropriate official shall issue a release.
(7)
Taxpayer requests.
A request for a certificate of release with respect to a notice of Federal tax lien shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate official. The request shall contain the information required in the appropriate IRS Publication.
(b)
Discharge of specific property from the lien
—(1)
Property double the amount of the liability.
(i) The appropriate official may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to a Federal tax lien
imposed under chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code if he determines that the fair market value of that part of the property remaining subject to the Federal tax lien is at least double the sum of the amount of the unsatisfied liability secured by the Federal tax lien and of the amount of all other liens upon the property which have priority over the Federal tax lien. In general, fair market value is that amount which one ready and willing but not compelled to buy would pay to another ready and willing but not compelled to sell the property.
(ii) The following example illustrates a case in which a certificate of discharge may not be given under this subparagraph:

# Example.
The Federal tax liability secured by a lien is $1,000. The fair market value of all property which after the discharge will continue to be subject to the Federal tax lien is $10,000. There is a prior mortgage on the property of $5,000, including interest, and the property is subject to a prior lien of $100 for real estate taxes. Accordingly, the taxpayer's equity in the property over and above the amount of the mortgage and real estate taxes is $4,900, or nearly five times the amount required to pay the assessed tax on which the Federal tax lien is based. Nevertheless, a discharge under this subparagraph is not permissible. In the illustration, the sum of the amount of the Federal tax liability ($1,000) and of the amount of the prior mortgage and the lien for real estate taxes ($5,000 + $100 = $5,100) is $6,100. Double this sum is $12,200, but the fair market value of the remaining property is only $10,000. Hence, a discharge of the property is not permissible under this subparagraph, since the Code requires that the fair market value of the remaining property be at least double the sum of two amounts, one amount being the outstanding Federal tax liability and the other amount being all prior liens upon such property. In order that the discharge may be issued, it would be necessary that the remaining property be worth not less than $12,200.
(2)
Part payment; interest of United States valueless
—(i)
Part payment.
The appropriate official may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to a Federal tax lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code if there is paid over to him in partial satisfaction of the liability secured by the Federal tax lien an amount determined by him to be not less than the value of the interest of the United States in the property to be so discharged. In determining the amount to be paid, the appropriate official will take into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the expenses to which the government has been put in the matter. In no case shall the amount to be paid be less than the value of the interest of the United States in the property with respect to which the certificate of discharge is to be issued.
(ii)
Interest of the United States valueless.
The appropriate official may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the Federal tax lien if he determines that the interest of the United States in the property to be so discharged has no value.
(3)
Discharge of property by substitution of proceeds of sale.
The appropriate official may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to a Federal tax lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code if such part of the property is sold and, pursuant to a written agreement with the appropriate official, the proceeds of the sale are held, as a fund subject to the Federal tax liens and claims of the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as the Federal tax liens or claims had with respect to the discharged property. This paragraph does not apply unless the sale divests the taxpayer of all right, title, and interest in the property sought to be discharged. Any reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the property and the administration of the sale proceeds shall be paid by the applicant or from the proceeds of the sale before satisfaction of any Federal tax liens or claims of the United States.
(4)
Right of substitution of value
—(i)
Issuance of certificate of discharge to property owner who is not the taxpayer.
If an owner of property subject to a Federal tax lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code submits an application for a certificate of discharge pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the appropriate official shall issue a certificate of discharge of such property after the owner either
deposits with the appropriate official an amount equal to the value of the interest of the United States in the property, as determined by the appropriate official pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section, or furnishes an acceptable bond in a like amount. This paragraph does not apply if the person seeking the discharge is the person whose unsatisfied liability gave rise to the Federal tax lien. Thus, if the property is owned by both the taxpayer and another person, the other person may obtain a certificate of discharge of the property under this paragraph, but the taxpayer may not.
(ii)
Refund of deposit and release of bond.
The appropriate official may, in his discretion, determine that either the entire unsatisfied tax liability listed on the notice of Federal tax lien can be satisfied from a source other than the property sought to be discharged, or the value of the interest of the United States is less than the prior determination of such value. The appropriate official shall refund the amount deposited with interest at the overpayment rate determined under section 6621 or release the bond furnished to the extent that he makes this determination.
(iii)
Refund request.
If a property owner desires an administrative refund of his deposit or release of the bond, the owner shall file a request in writing with the appropriate official. The request shall contain such information as the appropriate IRS Publication may require. The request must be filed within 120 days after the date the certificate of discharge is issued. A refund request made under this paragraph neither is required nor is effective to extend the period for filing an action in court under section 7426(a)(4).
(iv)
Internal Revenue Service's use of deposit if court action not filed.
If no action is filed under section 7426(a)(4) for refund of the deposit or release of the bond within the 120-day period specified therein, the appropriate official shall, within 60 days after the expiration of the 120-day period, apply the amount deposited or collect on such bond to the extent necessary to satisfy the liability listed on the notice of Federal tax lien, and shall refund, with interest at the overpayment rate determined under section 6621, any portion of the amount deposited that is not used to satisfy the liability. If the appropriate official has not completed the application of the deposit to the unsatisfied liability before the end of the 60-day period, the deposit will be deemed to have been applied to the unsatisfied liability as of the 60th day.
(5)
Application for certificate of discharge.
Any person desiring a certificate of discharge under this paragraph (b) shall submit an application in writing to the appropriate official. The application shall contain the information required by the appropriate IRS Publication. For purposes of this paragraph (b), any application for certificate of discharge made by a property owner who is not the taxpayer, and any amount submitted pursuant to the application, will be treated as an application for discharge and a deposit under section 6325(b)(4) unless the owner of the property submits a statement, in writing, that the application is being submitted under another paragraph of section 6325 and not under section 6325(b)(4), and the owner in writing waives the rights afforded under paragraph (b)(4), including the right to seek judicial review.
(6)
Valuation of interest of United States.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4) of this section, in determining the value of the interest of the United States in the property, or any part thereof, with respect to which the certificate of discharge is to be issued, the appropriate official shall give consideration to the value of the property and the amount of all liens and encumbrances thereon having priority over the Federal tax lien. In determining the value of the property, the appropriate official may, in his discretion, give consideration to the forced sale value of the property in appropriate cases.
(c)
Estate or gift tax liability fully satisfied or provided for
—(1)
Certificate of discharge.
If the appropriate official determines that the tax liability for estate or gift tax has been fully satisfied, he may issue a certificate of discharge of any or all property from the lien imposed thereon. If the appropriate official determines that the tax liability
for estate or gift tax has been adequately provided for, he may issue a certificate discharging particular items of property from the lien. If a lien has arisen under section 6324B (relating to special lien for additional estate tax attributable to farm, etc., valuation) and the appropriate official determines that the liability for additional estate tax has been fully secured in accordance with § 20.6324B-1(c) of this chapter, the appropriate official may issue a certificate of discharge of the real property from the section 6324B lien. The issuance of such a certificate is a matter resting within the discretion of the appropriate official, and a certificate will be issued only in case there is actual need therefor. The primary purpose of such discharge is not to evidence payment or satisfaction of the tax, but to permit the transfer of property free from the lien in case it is necessary to clear title. The tax will be considered fully satisfied only when investigation has been completed and payment of the tax, including any deficiency determined, has been made.
(2)
Application for certificate of discharge.
An application for a certificate of discharge of property from the lien for estate or gift tax should be filed with the appropriate official responsible for the collection of the tax. It should be made in writing under penalties of perjury and should explain the circumstances that require the discharge, and should fully describe the particular items for which the discharge is desired. Where realty is involved each parcel sought to be discharged from the lien should be described on a separate page and each such description submitted in duplicate. In the case of an estate tax lien, the application should show the applicant's relationship to the estate, such as executor, heir, devisee, legatee, beneficiary, transferee, or purchaser. If the estate or gift tax return has not been filed, a statement under penalties of perjury may be required showing (i) the value of the property to be discharged, (ii) the basis for such valuation, (iii) in the case of the estate tax, the approximate value of the gross estate and the approximate value of the total real property included in the gross estate, (iv) in the case of the gift tax, the total amount of gifts made during the calendar year and the prior calendar years subsequent to the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1932 and the approximate value of all real estate subject to the gift tax lien, and (v) if the property is to be sold or otherwise transferred, the name and address of the purchaser or transferee and the consideration, if any, paid or to be paid by him.
(3) For provisions relating to transfer certificates in the case of nonresident estates, see § 20.6325-1 of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations).
(d)
Subordination of lien
—(1)
By payment of the amount subordinated.
The appropriate official may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of subordination of a lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code upon any part of the property subject to the lien if there is paid over to the appropriate officialr an amount equal to the amount of the lien or interest to which the certificate subordinates the lien of the United States. For this purpose, the tax lien may be subordinated to another lien or interest on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For example, if a notice of a Federal tax lien is filed and a delinquent taxpayer secures a mortgage loan on a part of the property subject to the tax lien and pays over the proceeds of the loan to a appropriate official after an application for a certificate of subordination is approved, the appropriate official will issue a certificate of subordination. This certificate will have the effect of subordinating the tax lien to the mortgage.
(2)
To facilitate tax collection
—(i)
In general.
The appropriate official may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of subordination of a lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code upon any part of the property subject to the lien if the appropriate official believes that the subordination of the lien will ultimately result in an increase in the amount realized by the United States from the property subject to the lien and will facilitate the ultimate collection of the tax liability.
(ii)
Examples.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a farmer needs money in order to harvest his crop. A Federal tax lien,
notice of which has been filed, is outstanding with respect to A's property. B, a lending institution is willing to make the necessary loan if the loan is secured by a first mortgage on the farm which is prior to the Federal tax lien. Upon examination, the appropriate official believes that ultimately the amount realizable from A's property will be increased and the collection of the tax liability will be facilitated by the availability of cash when the crop is harvested and sold. In this case, the appropriate official may, in his discretion, subordinate the tax lien on the farm to the mortgage securing the crop harvesting loan.

# Example 2.
C owns a commercial building which is deteriorating and in unsalable condition. Because of outstanding Federal tax liens, notices of which have been filed, C is unable to finance the repair and rehabilitation of the building. D, a contractor, is willing to do the work if his mechanic's lien on the property is superior to the Federal tax liens. Upon examination, the appropriate official believes that ultimately the amount realizable from C's property will be increased and the collection of the tax liability will be facilitated by arresting deterioration of the property and restoring it to salable condition. In this case, the appropriate official may, in his discretion, subordinate the tax lien on the building to the mechanic's lien.

# Example 3.
E, a manufacturer of electronic equipment, obtains financing from F, a lending institution, pursuant to a security agreement, with respect to which a financing statement was duly filed under the Uniform Commercial Code on June 1, 1970. On April 15, 1971, F gains actual notice or knowledge that notice of a Federal tax lien had been filed against E on March 31, 1971, and F refuses to make further advances unless its security interest is assured of priority over the Federal tax lien. Upon examination, the appropriate official believes that ultimately the amount realizable from E's property will be increased and the collection of the tax liability will be facilitated if the work in process can be completed and the equipment sold. In this case, the appropriate official may, in his discretion, subordinate the tax lien to F's security interest for the further advances required to complete the work.

# Example 4.
Suit is brought against G by H, who claims ownership of property the legal title to which is held by G. A Federal tax lien against G, notice of which has previously been filed, will be enforceable against the property if G's title is confirmed. Because section 6323(b)(8) is inapplicable, J, an attorney, is unwilling to defend the case for G unless he is granted a contractual lien on the property, superior to the Federal tax lien. Upon examination, the appropriate official believes that the successful defense of the case by G will increase the amount ultimately realizable from G's property and will facilitate collection of the tax liability. In this case, the appropriate official may, in his discretion, subordinate the tax lien to J's contractual lien on the disputed property to secure J's reasonable fees and expenses.
(3)
Subordination of section 6324B lien.
The appropriate official may issue a certificate of subordination with respect to a lien imposed by section 6324B if the appropriate official determines that the interests of the United States will be adequately secured after such subordination. For example,
A,
a qualified heir of qualified real property, needs to borrow money for farming purposes. If the current fair market value of the real property is $150,000, the amount of the claim to which the special lien is to be subordinated is $40,000, the potential liability for additional tax (as defined in section 2032A(c)) is less than $55,000, and there are no other facts to indicate that the interest of the United States will not be adequately secured, the appropriate official may issue a certificate of subordination. The result would be the same if the loan were for bona fide purposes other than farming.
(4)
Application for certificate of subordination.
Any person desiring a certificate of subordination under this paragraph shall submit an application therefor in writing to the appropriate official responsible for the collection of the tax. The application shall contain such information as the appropriate official may require.
(e)
Nonattachment of lien.
If the appropriate official determines that, because of confusion of names or otherwise, any person (other than the person against whom the tax was assessed) is or may be injured by the appearance that a notice of lien filed in accordance with § 301.6323(f)-1 refers to such person, the appropriate official may issue a certificate of nonattachment. Such certificate shall state that the lien, notice of which has been filed, does not attach to the property of such person. Any person desiring a certificate of nonattachment under this paragraph shall submit an application therefor in writing to the appropriate official responsible for the collection of the tax. The application shall contain such information as the appropriate official may require.
(f)
Effect of certificate
—(1)
Conclusiveness.
Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, if a certificate is issued under section 6325 by the appropriate official and the certificate is filed in the same office as the notice of lien to which it relates (if the notice of lien has been filed), the certificate shall have the following effect—
(i) In the case of a certificate of release issued under paragraph (a) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that the tax lien referred to in the certificate is extinguished;
(ii) In the case of a certificate of discharge issued under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that the property covered by the certificate is discharged from the tax lien;
(iii) In the case of a certificate of subordination issued under paragraph (d) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that the lien or interest to which the Federal tax lien is subordinated is superior to the tax lien; and
(iv) In the case of a certificate of nonattachment issued under paragraph (e) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that the lien of the United States does not attach to the property of the person referred to in the certificate.
(2)
Revocation of certificate of release or nonattachment
—(i)
In general.
If the appropriate official determines that either—
(
a
) A certificate of release or a certificate of nonattachment of the general tax lien imposed by section 6321 was issued erroneously or improvidently, or
(
b
) A certificate of release of such lien was issued in connection with a compromise agreement under section 7122 which has been breached,
and if the period of limitation on collection after assessment of the tax liability has not expired, the appropriate official may revoke the certificate and reinstate the tax lien. The provisions of this subparagraph do not apply in the case of the lien imposed by section 6324 relating to estate and gift taxes.
(ii)
Method of revocation and reinstatement.
The revocation and reinstatement described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is accompanied by—
(
a
) Mailing notice of the revocation to the taxpayer at his last known address (see § 301.6212-2 for further guidance regarding the definition of last known address); and
(
b
) Filing notice of the revocation of the certificate in the same office in which the notice of lien to which it relates was filed (if the notice of lien has been filed).
(iii)
Effect of reinstatement
—(
a
)
Effective date.
A tax lien reinstated in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph is effective on and after the date the notice of revocation is mailed to the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (ii)(
a
) of this subparagraph, but the reinstated lien is not effective before the filing of notice of revocation, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (ii)(
b
) of this subparagraph, if the filing is required by reason of the fact that a notice of the lien had been filed.
(
b
)
Treatment of reinstated lien.
As of the effective date of reinstatement, a reinstated lien has the same force and effect as a general tax lien imposed by section 6321 which arises upon assessment of a tax liability. The reinstated lien continues in existence until the expiration of the period of limitation on collection after assessment of the tax liability to which it relates. The reinstatement of the lien does not retroactively reinstate a previously filed notice of lien. The reinstated lien is not valid against any holder of a lien or interest described in § 301.6323(a)-1 until notice of the reinstated lien has been filed in accordance with the provisions of § 301.6323(f)-1 subsequent to or concurrent with the time the reinstated lien became effective.
(iv)
Example.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On March 1, 1967, an assessment of an unpaid Federal tax liability is made against A. On March 1, 1968, notice of the Federal tax lien, which arose at the time of assessment, is filed. On April 1, 1968, A executes a bona fide mortgage on property belonging to him to B. On May 1, 1968, a certificate of release of the tax lien is erroneously issued and is filed by A in the same office in which the notice of lien was filed. On June 3, 1968, the lien is reinstated in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph. On
July 1, 1968, A executes a bona fide mortgage on property belonging to him to C. On August 1, 1968, a notice of the lien which was reinstated is properly filed in accordance with the provisions of § 301.6323(f)-1. The mortgages of both B and C will have priority over the rights of the United States with respect to the tax liability in question. Because a reinstated lien continues in existence only until the expiration of the period of limitation on collection after assessment of the tax liability to which the lien relates, in the absence of any extension or suspension of the period of limitation on collection after assessment, the reinstated lien will become unenforceable by reason of lapse of time after February 28, 1973.
(3)
Certificates void under certain conditions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code, any lien for Federal taxes attaches to any property with respect to which a certificate of discharge has been issued if the person liable for the tax reacquires the property after the certificate has been issued. Thus, if property subject to a Federal tax lien is discharged therefrom and is later reacquired by the delinquent taxpayer at a time when the lien is still in existence, the tax lien attaches to the reacquired property and is enforceable against it as in the case of after-acquired property generally.
(g)
Filing of certificates and notices.
If a certificate or notice described in this section may not be filed in the office designated by State law in which the notice of lien imposed by section 6321 (to which the certificate or notice relates) is filed, the certificate or notice is effective if filed in the office of the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which the State office where the notice of lien is filed is situated.
(h) As used in this section, the term
appropriate official
means either the official or office identified in the relevant IRS Publication or, if such official or office is not so identified, the Secretary or his delegate.
(i)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to any release of lien or discharge of property that is requested after January 31, 2008.
(Secs. 6324B (90 Stat. 1861, 26 U.S.C. 6324B) and 7805 (68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C. 7805))
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7429, 41 FR 35512, Aug. 23, 1976; T.D. 7847, 47 FR 50857, Nov. 10, 1982; T.D. 8939, 66 FR 2821, Jan. 12, 2001; 73 FR 5742, T.D. 9378, Jan. 31, 2008; T.D. 9378, 73 FR 9672, Feb. 22, 2008]
§ 301.6326-1
Administrative appeal of the erroneous filing of notice of federal tax lien.
(a)
In general.
Any person may appeal to the district director of the district in which a notice of federal tax lien was filed on the property or rights to property of such person for a release of lien alleging an error in the filing of notice of lien. Such appeal may be used only for the purpose of correcting the erroneous filing of a notice of lien, not to challenge the underlying deficiency that led to the imposition of a lien. If the district director determines that the Internal Revenue Service has erroneously filed the notice of any federal tax lien, the district director shall expeditiously, and, to the extent practicable, within 14 days after such determination, issue a certificate of release of lien. The certificate of release of such lien shall include a statement that the filing of notice of lien was erroneous.
(b)
Appeal alleging an error in the filing of notice of lien.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an appeal of the filing of notice of federal tax lien must be based on any one of the following allegations:
(1) The tax liability that gave rise to the lien, plus any interest and additions to tax associated with said liability, was satisfied prior to the filing of notice of lien;
(2) The tax liability that gave rise to the lien was assessed in violation of the deficiency procedures set forth in section 6213 of the Internal Revenue Code;
(3) The tax liability that gave rise to the lien was assessed in violation of title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code); or
(4) The statutory period for collection of the tax liability that gave rise to the lien expired prior to the filing of notice of federal tax lien.
(c)
Notice of federal tax lien that lists multiple liabilities.
When a notice of federal tax lien lists multiple liabilities, a person may appeal the filing of notice of lien with respect to one or more of the liabilities listed in the notice, if the notice was erroneously filed with respect to such liabilities. If a notice of federal tax lien was erroneously filed with respect to one or more liabilities listed in the notice, the district director shall issue a certificate of release with respect to such liabilities. For example, if a notice of federal tax lien lists tax liabilities for years 1980, 1981 and 1982, and the entire liabilities for 1981 and 1982 were paid prior to the filing of notice of lien, the taxpayer may appeal the filing of notice of lien with respect to the 1981 and 1982 liabilities and the district director must issue a certificate of release with respect to the 1981 and 1982 liabilities.
(d)
Procedures for appeal
—(1)
Manner.
An appeal of the filing of notice of federal tax lien shall be made in writing to the district director (marked for the attention of the Chief, Special Procedures Function) of the district in which the notice of federal tax lien was filed.
(2)
Form.
The appeal shall include the following information and documents:
(i) Name, current address, and taxpayer identification number of the person appealing the filing of notice of federal tax lien;
(ii) A copy of the notice of federal tax lien affecting the property, if available; and
(iii) The grounds upon which the filing of notice of federal tax lien is being appealed.
(A) If the ground upon which the filing of notice is being appealed is that the tax liability in question was satisfied prior to the filing, proof of full payment as defined in paragraph (e) of this section must be provided.
(B) If the ground upon which the filing of notice is being appealed is that the tax liability that gave rise to lien was assessed in violation of the deficiency procedures set forth in section 6213 of the Internal Revenue Code, the appealing party must explain how the assessment was erroneous.
(C) If the ground upon which the filing of notice is being appealed is that the tax liability that gave rise to the lien was assessed in violation of title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code), the appealing party must provide the following:
(
1
) The identity of the court and the district in which the bankruptcy petition was filed; and
(
2
) The docket number and the date of filing of the bankruptcy petition.
(
3
)
Time.
An administrative appeal of the erroneous filing of notice of federal tax lien shall be made within 1 year after the taxpayer becomes aware of the erroneously filed tax lien.
(e)
Proof of full payment.
As used in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the term “proof of full payment” means:
(1) An internal revenue cashier's receipt reflecting full payment of the tax liability in question prior to the date the federal tax lien issue was filed;
(2) A canceled check to the Internal Revenue Service in an amount which was sufficient to satisfy the tax liability for which release is being sought; or
(3) Any other manner of proof acceptable to the district director.
(f)
Exclusive remedy.
The appeal established by section 6326 of the Internal Revenue Code and by this section shall be the exclusive administrative remedy with respect to the erroneous filing of a notice of federal tax lien.
(g)
Effective date.
The provisions of this section are effective July 7, 1989.

# Seizure of Property for Collection of Taxes
§ 301.6330-1
Notice and opportunity for hearing prior to levy.
(a)
Notification
—(1)
In general.
Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Commissioner, or his or her delegate (the Commissioner), will prescribe procedures to provide persons upon whose property or rights to property the IRS intends to levy (hereinafter referred to as the taxpayer) on or after January 19, 1999, notice of that intention and to give them the right to, and the opportunity for, a pre-levy Collection Due Process (CDP) hearing with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Office of Appeals (Appeals). This pre-levy Collection Due Process Hearing Notice (CDP Notice) must be given in person,
left at the dwelling or usual place of business of the taxpayer, or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the taxpayer's last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see § 301.6212-2.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
state tax refunds.
Section 6330(f) does not require the Commissioner to provide the taxpayer with notification of the taxpayer's right to a CDP hearing prior to issuing a levy to collect state tax refunds owing to the taxpayer. However, the Commissioner will prescribe procedures to give the taxpayer notice of the right to, and the opportunity for, a CDP hearing with Appeals with respect to any such levy issued on or after January 19, 1999, within a reasonable time after the levy has occurred. The notification required to be given following a levy on a state tax refund is referred to as a post-levy CDP Notice.
(ii)
Jeopardy.
Section 6330(f) does not require the Commissioner to provide the taxpayer with notification of the taxpayer's right to a CDP hearing prior to a levy when there has been a determination that collection of the tax is in jeopardy. However, the Commissioner will prescribe procedures to provide notice of the right to, and the opportunity for, a CDP hearing with Appeals to the taxpayer with respect to any such levy issued on or after January 19, 1999, within a reasonable time after the levy has occurred. The notification required to be given following a jeopardy levy also is referred to as post-levy CDP Notice.
(3)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (a) as follows:
Q-A1.
Who is the person to be notified under section 6330?
A-A1.
Under section 6330(a)(1), a pre-levy or post-levy CDP Notice is required to be given only to the person whose property or right to property is intended to be levied upon, or, in the case of a levy made on a state tax refund or a jeopardy levy, the person whose property or right to property was levied upon. The person described in section 6330(a)(1) is the same person described in section 6331(a)—i.e., the person liable to pay the tax due after notice and demand who refuses or neglects to pay (referred to here as the taxpayer). A pre-levy or post-levy CDP Notice therefore will be given only to the taxpayer.
Q-A2.
Will the IRS give notification to a known nominee of, a person holding property of, or a person who holds property subject to a lien with respect to, the taxpayer of the IRS' intention to issue a levy?
A-A2.
No. Such a person is not the person described in section 6331(a)(1), but such persons have other remedies. See A-B5 of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
Q-A3.
Will the IRS give notification for each tax and tax period it intends to include or has included in a levy issued on or after January 19, 1999?
A-A3.
Yes. The notification of an intent to levy or of the issuance of a jeopardy or state tax refund levy will specify each tax and tax period that will be or was included in the levy.
Q-A4.
Will the IRS give notification to a taxpayer with respect to levies for a tax and tax period issued on or after January 19, 1999, even though the IRS had issued a levy prior to January 19, 1999, with respect to the same tax and tax period?
A-A4.
Yes. The IRS will provide appropriate pre-levy or post-levy notification to a taxpayer regarding the first levy it intends to issue or has issued on or after January 19, 1999, with respect to a tax and tax period, even though it had issued a levy with respect to that same tax and tax period prior to January 19, 1999.
Q-A5.
When will the IRS provide this notice?
A-A5.
Beginning on January 19, 1999, the IRS will give a pre-levy CDP Notice to the taxpayer of the IRS' intent to levy on property or rights to property, other than in state tax refund and jeopardy levy situations, at least 30 days prior to the first such levy with respect to a tax and tax period. If the taxpayer has not received a pre-levy CDP Notice and the IRS levies on a state tax refund or issues a jeopardy levy on or after January 19, 1999, the IRS will provide a post-levy CDP Notice to the taxpayer within a reasonable time after that levy.
Q-A6.
What must a pre-levy CDP Notice include?
A-A6.
Pursuant to section 6330(a)(3), a pre-levy CDP Notice must include, in simple and nontechnical terms:
(i) The amount of the unpaid tax.
(ii) Notification of the right to request a CDP hearing.
(iii) A statement that the IRS intends to levy.
(iv) The taxpayer's rights with respect to the levy action, including a brief statement that sets forth—
(A) The statutory provisions relating to the levy and sale of property;
(B) The procedures applicable to the levy and sale of property;
(C) The administrative appeals available to the taxpayer with respect to the levy and sale and the procedures relating to those appeals;
(D) The alternatives available to taxpayers that could prevent levy on the property (including installment agreements); and
(E) The statutory provisions and the procedures relating to the redemption of property and the release of liens on property.
Q-A7.
What must a post-levy CDP Notice include?
A-A7.
A post-levy CDP Notice must include, in simple and nontechnical terms:
(i) The amount of the unpaid tax.
(ii) Notification of the right to request a CDP hearing.
(iii) A statement that the IRS has levied upon the taxpayer's state tax refund or has made a jeopardy levy on property or rights to property of the taxpayer, as appropriate.
(iv) The taxpayer's rights with respect to the levy action, including a brief statement that sets forth—
(A) The statutory provisions relating to the levy and sale of property;
(B) The procedures applicable to the levy and sale of property;
(C) The administrative appeals available to the taxpayer with respect to the levy and sale and the procedures relating to those appeals;
(D) The alternatives available to taxpayers that could prevent any further levies on the taxpayer's property (including installment agreements); and
(E) The statutory provisions and the procedures relating to the redemption of property and the release of liens on property.
Q-A8.
How will this pre-levy or post-levy notification under section 6330 be accomplished?
A-A8.
The IRS will notify the taxpayer by means of a pre-levy CDP Notice or a post-levy CDP Notice, as appropriate. The additional information the IRS is required to provide, together with Form 12153, Request for a Collection Due Process Hearing, will be included with the CDP Notice.
(i) The IRS may effect delivery of a pre-levy CDP Notice (and accompanying materials) in one of three ways:
(A) By delivering the notice personally to the taxpayer.
(B) By leaving the notice at the taxpayer's dwelling or usual place of business.
(C) By mailing the notice to the taxpayer at the taxpayer's last known address by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
(ii) The IRS may effect delivery of a post-levy CDP Notice (and accompanying materials) in one of three ways:
(A) By delivering the notice personally to the taxpayer.
(B) By leaving the notice at the taxpayer's dwelling or usual place of business.
(C) By mailing the notice to the taxpayer at the taxpayer's last known address by certified or registered mail.
Q-A9.
What are the consequences if the taxpayer does not receive or accept the notification which was properly left at the taxpayer's dwelling or usual place of business, or properly sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the taxpayer's last known address?
A-A9.
Notification properly sent to the taxpayer's last known address or left at the taxpayer's dwelling or usual place of business is sufficient to start the 30-day period within which the taxpayer may request a CDP hearing. See paragraph (c) of this section for when a request for a CDP hearing must be filed. Actual receipt is not a prerequisite to the validity of the CDP Notice.
Q-A10.
What if the taxpayer does not receive the CDP Notice because the
IRS did not send that notice by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer's last known address, or failed to leave it at the dwelling or usual place of business of the taxpayer, and the taxpayer fails to request a CDP hearing with Appeals within the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the CDP Notice?
A-A10.
When the IRS determines that it failed properly to provide a taxpayer with a CDP Notice, it will promptly provide the taxpayer with a substitute CDP Notice and provide the taxpayer with an opportunity to request a CDP hearing. Substitute CDP Notices are discussed in Q
A-B3 of paragraph (b)(2) and Q
A-C8 of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (a):

# Example 1.
Prior to January 19, 1999, the IRS issues a continuous levy on a taxpayer's wages and a levy on that taxpayer's fixed right to future payments. The IRS is not required to release either levy on or after January 19, 1999, until the requirements of section 6343(a)(1) are met. The taxpayer is not entitled to a CDP Notice or a CDP hearing under section 6330 with respect to either levy because both levy actions were initiated prior to January 19, 1999.

# Example 2.
The same facts as in
Example 1,
except the IRS intends to levy upon a taxpayer's bank account on or after January 19, 1999. The taxpayer is entitled to a pre-levy CDP Notice with respect to this proposed new levy.
(b)
Entitlement to a CDP hearing
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer is entitled to one CDP hearing with respect to the unpaid tax and tax periods covered by the pre-levy or post-levy CDP Notice provided to the taxpayer. The taxpayer must request the CDP hearing within the 30-day period commencing on the day after the date of the CDP Notice.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b) as follows:
Q-B1.
Is the taxpayer entitled to a CDP hearing where a levy for state tax refunds is issued on or after January 19, 1999, even though the IRS had previously issued other levies prior to January 19, 1999, seeking to collect the taxes owed for the same period?
A-B1.
Yes. The taxpayer is entitled to a CDP hearing under section 6330 for the type of tax and tax periods set forth in the state tax refund levy issued on or after January 19, 1999.
Q-B2.
Is the taxpayer entitled to a CDP hearing when the IRS, more than 30 days after issuance of a CDP Notice under section 6330 with respect to the unpaid tax and periods, provides subsequent notice to that taxpayer that the IRS intends to levy on property or rights to property of the taxpayer for the same tax and tax periods shown on the CDP Notice?
A-B2.
No. Under section 6330, only the first pre-levy or post-levy CDP Notice with respect to the unpaid tax and tax periods entitles the taxpayer to request a CDP hearing. If the taxpayer does not timely request a CDP hearing with Appeals following that first notification, the taxpayer foregoes the right to a CDP hearing with Appeals and judicial review of Appeals' determination with respect to levies relating to that tax and tax period. The IRS generally provides additional notices or reminders (reminder notifications) to the taxpayer of its intent to levy when no collection action has occurred within 180 days of a proposed levy. Under such circumstances, a taxpayer may request an equivalent hearing as described in paragraph (i) of this section.
Q-B3.
When the IRS provides a taxpayer with a substitute CDP Notice and the taxpayer timely requests a CDP hearing, is the taxpayer entitled to a CDP Hearing before Appeals?
A-B3.
Yes. Unless the taxpayer provides the IRS a written withdrawal of the request that Appeals conduct a CDP hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to a CDP hearing before Appeals. Following the hearing, Appeals will issue a Notice of Determination, and the taxpayer is entitled to seek judicial review of that Notice of Determination.
Q-B4.
If the IRS sends a second CDP Notice under section 6330 (other than a substitute CDP Notice) for a tax period and with respect to an unpaid tax for which a CDP Notice under section 6330 was previously sent, is the taxpayer entitled to a section 6330 CDP hearing based on the second CDP Notice?
A-B4.
No. The taxpayer is entitled to only one CDP hearing under section 6330 with respect to the tax and tax period. The taxpayer must request the
CDP hearing within 30 days of the date of the first CDP Notice provided for that tax and tax period.
Q-B5.
Will the IRS give pre-levy or post-levy CDP Notices to known nominees of, persons holding property of, or persons holding property subject to a lien with respect to the taxpayer?
A-B5.
No. Such person is not the person described in section 6331(a) and is, therefore, not entitled to a CDP hearing or an equivalent hearing (as discussed in paragraph (i) of this section). Such person, however, may seek reconsideration by the IRS office collecting the tax, assistance from the National Taxpayer Advocate, or an administrative hearing before Appeals under its Collection Appeals Program. However, any such administrative hearing would not be a CDP hearing under section 6330 and any determination or decision resulting from the hearing would not be subject to judicial review.
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (b):

# Example.
Federal income tax liability for 1997 is assessed against individual D. D buys an asset and puts it in individual E's name. The IRS gives D a CDP Notice of intent to levy with respect to the 1997 tax liability. The IRS will not notify E of its intent to levy. The IRS is not required to notify E of its intent to levy although E holds property of individual D. E is not the taxpayer.
(c)
Requesting a CDP hearing
—(1)
In general.
When a taxpayer is entitled to a CDP hearing under section 6330, the CDP hearing must be requested during the 30-day period that commences the day after the date of the CDP Notice.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (c) as follows:
Q-C1.
What must a taxpayer do to obtain a CDP hearing?
A-C1.
(i) The taxpayer must make a request in writing for a CDP hearing. The request for a CDP hearing shall include the information and signature specified in A-C1(ii) of this paragraph (c)(2). See A-D7 and A-D8 of paragraph (d)(2).
(ii) The written request for a CDP hearing must be dated and must include the following:
(A) The taxpayer's name, address, daytime telephone number (if any), and taxpayer identification number (e.g., SSN, ITIN or EIN).
(B) The type of tax involved.
(C) The tax period at issue.
(D) A statement that the taxpayer requests a hearing with Appeals concerning the proposed levy.
(E) The reason or reasons why the taxpayer disagrees with the proposed levy.
(F) The signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative.
(iii) If the IRS receives a timely written request for CDP hearing that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in A-C1(ii) of this paragraph (c)(2), the IRS will make a reasonable attempt to contact the taxpayer and request that the taxpayer comply with the unsatisfied requirements. The taxpayer must perfect any timely written request for a CDP hearing that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in A-C1(ii) of this paragraph (c)(2) within a reasonable period of time after a request from the IRS.
(iv) Taxpayers are encouraged to use Form 12153, “Request for a Collection Due Process Hearing,” in requesting a CDP hearing so that the request can be readily identified and forwarded to Appeals. Taxpayers may obtain a copy of Form 12153 by contacting the IRS office that issued the CDP Notice, by downloading a copy from the IRS Internet site,
http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f12153.pdf,
or by calling, toll-free, 1-800-829-3676.
(v) The taxpayer must affirm any timely written request for a CDP hearing which is signed or alleged to have been signed on the taxpayer's behalf by the taxpayer's spouse or other unauthorized representative by filing, within a reasonable period of time after a request from the IRS, a signed, written affirmation that the request was originally submitted on the taxpayer's behalf. If the affirmation is filed within a reasonable period of time after a request, the timely CDP hearing request will be considered timely with respect to the non-signing taxpayer. If the affirmation is not filed within a reasonable period of time after a request, the CDP hearing request will be denied with respect to the non-signing taxpayer.
Q-C2.
Must the request for the CDP hearing be in writing?
A-C2.
Yes. There are several reasons why the request for a CDP hearing must be in writing. The filing of a timely request for a CDP hearing is the first step in what may result in a court proceeding. A written request will provide proof that the CDP hearing was requested and thus permit the court to verify that it has jurisdiction over any subsequent appeal of the Notice of Determination issued by Appeals. In addition, the receipt of the written request will establish the date on which the periods of limitation under section 6502 (relating to collection after assessment), section 6531 (relating to criminal prosecutions), and section 6532 (relating to suits) are suspended as a result of the CDP hearing and any judicial appeal. Moreover, because the IRS anticipates that taxpayers will contact the IRS office that issued the CDP Notice for further information or assistance in filling out Form 12153, or to attempt to resolve their liabilities prior to going through the CDP hearing process, the requirement of a written request should help prevent any misunderstanding as to whether a CDP hearing has been requested. If the information requested on Form 12153 is furnished by the taxpayer, the written request also will help to establish the issues for which the taxpayer seeks a determination by Appeals.
Q-C3.
When must a taxpayer request a CDP hearing with respect to a CDP Notice issued under section 6330?
A-C3.
A taxpayer must submit a written request for a CDP hearing within the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the CDP Notice issued under section 6330. This period is slightly different from the period for submitting a written request for a CDP hearing with respect to a CDP Notice issued under section 6320. For a CDP Notice issued under section 6320, a taxpayer must submit a written request for a CDP hearing within the 30-day period commencing the day after the end of the five business day period following the filing of the notice of federal tax lien (NFTL).
Q-C4.
How will the timeliness of a taxpayer's written request for a CDP hearing be determined?
A-C4.
The rules and regulations under section 7502 and section 7503 will apply to determine the timeliness of the taxpayer's request for a CDP hearing, if properly transmitted and addressed as provided in A-C6 of this paragraph (c)(2).
Q-C5.
Is the 30-day period within which a taxpayer must make a request for a CDP hearing extended because the taxpayer resides outside the United States?
A-C5.
No. Section 6330 does not make provision for such a circumstance. Accordingly, all taxpayers who want a CDP hearing under section 6330 must request such a hearing within the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the CDP Notice.
Q-C6.
Where must the written request for a CDP hearing be sent?
A-C6.
The written request for a CDP hearing must be sent, or hand delivered (if permitted), to the IRS office and address as directed on the CDP Notice. If the address of that office does not appear on the CDP Notice, the taxpayer should obtain the address of the office to which the written request should be sent or hand delivered by calling, toll-free, 1-800-829-1040 and providing the taxpayer's identification number (e.g., SSN, ITIN or EIN).
Q-C7.
What will happen if the taxpayer does not request a CDP hearing in writing within the 30-day period commencing on the day after the date of the CDP Notice issued under section 6330?
A-C7.
If the taxpayer does not request a CDP hearing in writing within the 30-day period that commences on the day after the date of the CDP Notice, the taxpayer foregoes the right to a CDP hearing under section 6330 with respect to the unpaid tax and tax periods shown on the CDP Notice. A written request submitted within the 30-day period that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in A-C1(ii)(A), (B), (C), (D) or (F) of this paragraph (c)(2) is considered timely if the request is perfected within a reasonable period of time pursuant to A-C1(iii) of this paragraph (c)(2). If the request for CDP hearing is untimely, either because the request was not submitted within the 30-day period or not perfected within the reasonable period provided, the
taxpayer will be notified of the untimeliness of the request and offered an equivalent hearing. In such cases, the taxpayer may obtain an equivalent hearing without submitting an additional request. See paragraph (i) of this section.
Q-C8.
When must a taxpayer request a CDP hearing with respect to a substitute CDP Notice?
A-C8.
A CDP hearing with respect to a substitute CDP Notice must be requested in writing by the taxpayer prior to the end of the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the substitute CDP Notice.
Q-C9.
Can taxpayers attempt to resolve the matter of the proposed levy with an officer or employee of the IRS office collecting the tax liability stated on the CDP Notice either before or after requesting a CDP hearing?
A-C9.
Yes. Taxpayers are encouraged to discuss their concerns with the IRS office collecting the tax, either before or after they request a CDP hearing. If such a discussion occurs before a request is made for a CDP hearing, the matter may be resolved without the need for Appeals consideration. However, these discussions do not suspend the running of the 30-day period within which the taxpayer is required to request a CDP hearing, nor do they extend that 30-day period. If discussions occur after the request for a CDP hearing is filed and the taxpayer resolves the matter with the IRS office collecting the tax, the taxpayer may withdraw in writing the request that a CDP hearing be conducted by Appeals. The taxpayer can also waive in writing some or all of the requirements regarding the contents of the Notice of Determination.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1.
The IRS mails a CDP Notice of intent to levy to individual A's last known address on June 24, 1999. Individual A has until July 26, 1999, a Monday, to request a CDP hearing. The 30-day period within which individual A may request a CDP hearing begins on June 25, 1999. Because the 30-day period expires on July 24, 1999, a Saturday, individual A's written request for a CDP hearing will be considered timely if it is properly transmitted and addressed to the IRS in accordance with section 7502 and the regulations thereunder no later than July 26, 1999.

# Example 2.
Same facts as in
Example 1,
except that individual A is on vacation, outside the United States, or otherwise does not receive or read the CDP Notice until July 19, 1999. As in
Example 1,
individual A has until July 26, 1999, to request a CDP hearing. If individual A does not request a CDP hearing, individual A may request an equivalent hearing as to the levy at a later time. The taxpayer should make a request for an equivalent hearing at the earliest possible time.

# Example 3.
Same facts as in
Example 2,
except that individual A does not receive or read the CDP Notice until after July 26, 1999, and does not request a hearing by July 26, 1999. Individual A is not entitled to a CDP hearing. Individual A may request an equivalent hearing as to the levy at a later time. The taxpayer should make a request for an equivalent hearing at the earliest possible time.

# Example 4.
Same facts as in
Example 1,
except the IRS determines that the CDP Notice mailed on June 24, 1999, was not mailed to individual A's last known address. As soon as practicable after making this determination, the IRS will mail a substitute CDP Notice to individual A at individual A's last known address, hand deliver the substitute CDP Notice to individual A, or leave the substitute CDP Notice at individual A's dwelling or usual place of business. Individual A will have 30 days commencing on the day after the date of the substitute CDP Notice within which to request a CDP hearing.
(d)
Conduct of CDP hearing
—(1)
In general.
If a taxpayer requests a CDP hearing under section 6330(a)(3)(B) (and does not withdraw that request), the CDP hearing will be held with Appeals. The taxpayer is entitled to only one CDP hearing under section 6330 with respect to the unpaid tax and tax periods shown on the CDP Notice. To the extent practicable, the CDP hearing requested under section 6330 will be held in conjunction with any CDP hearing the taxpayer requests under section 6320. A CDP hearing will be conducted by an employee or officer of Appeals who, prior to the first CDP hearing under section 6320 or section 6330, has had no involvement with respect to the tax for the tax periods to be covered by the hearing, unless the taxpayer waives this requirement.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (d) as follows:
Q-D1.
Under what circumstances can a taxpayer receive more than one pre-
levy CDP hearing under section 6330 with respect to a tax period?
A-D1.
The taxpayer may receive more than one CDP pre-levy hearing under section 6330 with respect to a tax period where the tax involved is a different type of tax (for example, an employment tax liability, where the original CDP hearing for the tax period involved an income tax liability), or where the same type of tax for the same period is involved, but where the amount of the unpaid tax has changed as a result of an additional assessment of tax (not including interest or penalties) for that period or an additional accuracy-related or filing-delinquency penalty has been assessed. The taxpayer is not entitled to another CDP hearing under section 6330 if the additional assessment represents accruals of interest, accruals of penalties, or both.
Q-D2.
Will a CDP hearing with respect to one tax period be combined with a CDP hearing with respect to another tax period?
A-D2.
To the extent practicable, a CDP hearing with respect to one tax period shown on a CDP Notice will be combined with any and all other CDP hearings which the taxpayer has requested.
Q-D3.
Will a CDP hearing under section 6330 be combined with a CDP hearing under section 6320?
A-D3.
To the extent it is practicable, a CDP hearing under section 6330 will be held in conjunction with a CDP hearing under section 6320.
Q-D4.
What is considered to be prior involvement by an employee or officer of Appeals with respect to the tax and tax period or periods involved in the hearing?
A-D4.
Prior involvement by an Appeals officer or employee includes participation or involvement in a matter (other than a CDP hearing held under either section 6320 or section 6330) that the taxpayer may have had with respect to the tax and tax period shown on the CDP Notice. Prior involvement exists only when the taxpayer, the tax and the tax period at issue in the CDP hearing also were at issue in the prior non-CDP matter, and the Appeals officer or employee actually participated in the prior matter.
Q-D5.
How can a taxpayer waive the requirement that the officer or employee of Appeals have no prior involvement with respect to the tax and tax period or periods involved in the CDP hearing?
A-D5.
The taxpayer must sign a written waiver.
Q-D6.
How are CDP hearings conducted?
A-D6.
The formal hearing procedures required under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551
et seq.,
do not apply to CDP hearings. CDP hearings are much like Collection Appeal Program (CAP) hearings in that they are informal in nature and do not require the Appeals officer or employee and the taxpayer, or the taxpayer's representative, to hold a face-to-face meeting. A CDP hearing may, but is not required to, consist of a face-to-face meeting, one or more written or oral communications between an Appeals officer or employee and the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative, or some combination thereof. A transcript or recording of any face-to-face meeting or conversation between an Appeals officer or employee and the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative is not required. The taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative does not have the right to subpoena and examine witnesses at a CDP hearing.
Q-D7.
If a taxpayer wants a face-to-face CDP hearing, where will it be held?
A-D7.
Except as provided in A-D8 of this paragraph (d)(2), a taxpayer who presents in the CDP hearing request relevant, non-frivolous reasons for disagreement with the proposed levy will ordinarily be offered an opportunity for a face-to-face conference at the Appeals office closest to taxpayer's residence. A business taxpayer will ordinarily be offered an opportunity for a face-to-face conference at the Appeals office closest to the taxpayer's principal place of business. If that is not satisfactory to the taxpayer, the taxpayer will be given an opportunity for a hearing by telephone or by correspondence. In all cases, the Appeals officer or employee will review the case file, as described in A-F4 of paragraph (f)(2). If no face-to-face or telephonic
conference is held, or other oral communication takes place, review of the documents in the case file, as described in A-F4 of paragraph (f)(2), will constitute the CDP hearing for purposes of section 6330(b).
Q-D8.
In what circumstances will a face-to-face CDP conference not be granted?
A-D8.
A taxpayer is not entitled to a face-to-face CDP conference at a location other than as provided in A-D7 of this paragraph (d)(2) and this A-D8. If all Appeals officers or employees at the location provided for in A-D7 of this paragraph (d)(2) have had prior involvement with the taxpayer as provided in A-D4 of this paragraph (d)(2), the taxpayer will not be offered a face-to-face conference at that location, unless the taxpayer elects to waive the requirement of section 6330(b)(3). The taxpayer will be offered a face-to-face conference at another Appeals office if Appeals would have offered the taxpayer a face-to-face conference at the location provided in A-D7 of this paragraph (d)(2), but for the disqualification of all Appeals officers or employees at that location. A face-to-face CDP conference concerning a taxpayer's underlying liability will not be granted if the request for a hearing or other taxpayer communication indicates that the taxpayer wishes only to raise irrelevant or frivolous issues concerning that liability. A face-to-face CDP conference concerning a collection alternative, such as an installment agreement or an offer to compromise liability, will not be granted unless other taxpayers would be eligible for the alternative in similar circumstances. For example, because the IRS does not consider offers to compromise from taxpayers who have not filed required returns or have not made certain required deposits of tax, as set forth in Form 656, “Offer in Compromise,” no face-to-face conference will be granted to a taxpayer who wishes to make an offer to compromise but has not fulfilled those obligations. Appeals in its discretion, however, may grant a face-to-face conference if Appeals determines that a face-to-face conference is appropriate to explain to the taxpayer the requirements for becoming eligible for a collection alternative. In all cases, a taxpayer will be given an opportunity to demonstrate eligibility for a collection alternative and to become eligible for a collection alternative, in order to obtain a face-to-face conference. For purposes of determining whether a face-to-face conference will be granted, the determination of a taxpayer's eligibility for a collection alternative is made without regard to the taxpayer's ability to pay the unpaid tax. A face-to-face conference need not be granted if the taxpayer does not provide the required information set forth in A-C1(ii)(E) of paragraph (c)(2). See also A-C1(iii) of paragraph (c)(2).
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (d):

# Example 1.
Individual A timely requests a CDP hearing concerning a proposed levy for the 1998 income tax liability assessed against individual A. Appeals employee B previously conducted a CDP hearing regarding a NFTL filed with respect to individual A's 1998 income tax liability. Because employee B's only prior involvement with individual A's 1998 income tax liability was in connection with a section 6320 CDP hearing, employee B may conduct the CDP hearing under section 6330 involving the proposed levy for the 1998 income tax liability.

# Example 2.
Individual C timely requests a CDP hearing concerning a proposed levy for the 1998 income tax liability assessed against individual C. Appeals employee D previously conducted a Collection Appeals Program (CAP) hearing regarding a NFTL filed with respect to individual C's 1998 income tax liability. Because employee D's prior involvement with individual C's 1998 income tax liability was in connection with a non-CDP hearing, employee D may not conduct the CDP hearing under section 6330 unless individual C waives the requirement that the hearing will be conducted by an Appeals officer or employee who has had no prior involvement with respect to individual C's 1998 income tax liability.

# Example 3.
Same facts as in
Example 2
, except that the prior CAP hearing only involved individual C's 1997 income tax liability and employment tax liabilities for 1998 reported on Form 941, “Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return.” Employee D would not be considered to have prior involvement because the prior CAP hearing in which she participated did not involve individual C's 1998 income tax liability.

# Example 4.
Appeals employee F is assigned to a CDP hearing concerning a proposed levy for a trust fund recovery penalty (TFRP) assessed pursuant to section 6672 against individual E. Appeals employee F participated in
a prior CAP hearing involving individual E's 1999 income tax liability, and participated in a CAP hearing involving the employment taxes of business entity X, which incurred the employment tax liability to which the TFRP assessed against individual E relates. Appeals employee F would not be considered to have prior involvement because the prior CAP hearings in which he participated did not directly involve the TFRP assessed against individual E.

# Example 5.
Appeals employee G is assigned to a CDP hearing concerning a proposed levy for a TFRP assessed pursuant to section 6672 against individual H. In preparing for the CDP hearing, Appeals employee G reviews the Appeals case file concerning the prior CAP hearing involving the TFRP assessed pursuant to section 6672 against individual H. Appeals employee G is not deemed to have participated in the previous CAP hearing involving the TFRP assessed against individual H by such review.
(e)
Matters considered at CDP hearing
—(1)
In general.
Appeals will determine the timeliness of any request for a CDP hearing that is made by a taxpayer. Appeals has the authority to determine the validity, sufficiency, and timeliness of any CDP Notice given by the IRS and of any request for a CDP hearing that is made by a taxpayer. Prior to issuance of a determination, Appeals is required to obtain verification from the IRS office collecting the tax that the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure with respect to the proposed levy have been met. The taxpayer may raise any relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax at the hearing, including appropriate spousal defenses, challenges to the appropriateness of the proposed levy, and offers of collection alternatives. The taxpayer also may raise challenges to the existence or amount of the underlying liability, including a liability reported on a self-filed return, for any tax period specified on the CDP Notice if the taxpayer did not receive a statutory notice of deficiency for that tax liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute the tax liability. Finally, the taxpayer may not raise an issue that was raised and considered at a previous CDP hearing under section 6320 or in any other previous administrative or judicial proceeding if the taxpayer participated meaningfully in such hearing or proceeding. Taxpayers will be expected to provide all relevant information requested by Appeals, including financial statements, for its consideration of the facts and issues involved in the hearing.
(2)
Spousal defenses.
A taxpayer may raise any appropriate spousal defenses at a CDP hearing unless the Commissioner has already made a final determination as to spousal defenses in a statutory notice of deficiency or final determination letter. To claim a spousal defense under section 66 or section 6015, the taxpayer must do so in writing according to rules prescribed by the Commissioner or the Secretary. Spousal defenses raised under sections 66 and 6015 in a CDP hearing are governed in all respects by the provisions of sections 66 and section 6015 and the regulations and procedures thereunder.
(3)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (e) as follows:
Q-E1.
What factors will Appeals consider in making its determination?
A-E1.
Appeals will consider the following matters in making its determination:
(i) Whether the IRS met the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure.
(ii) Any issues appropriately raised by the taxpayer relating to the unpaid tax.
(iii) Any appropriate spousal defenses raised by the taxpayer.
(iv) Any challenges made by the taxpayer to the appropriateness of the proposed collection action.
(v) Any offers by the taxpayer for collection alternatives.
(vi) Whether the proposed collection action balances the need for the efficient collection of taxes and the legitimate concern of the taxpayer that any collection action be no more intrusive than necessary.
Q-E2.
When is a taxpayer entitled to challenge the existence or amount of the tax liability specified in the CDP Notice?
A-E2.
A taxpayer is entitled to challenge the existence or amount of the underlying liability for any tax period specified on the CDP Notice if the taxpayer did not receive a statutory notice of deficiency for such liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity
to dispute such liability. Receipt of a statutory notice of deficiency for this purpose means receipt in time to petition the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency determined in the notice of deficiency. An opportunity to dispute the underlying liability includes a prior opportunity for a conference with Appeals that was offered either before or after the assessment of the liability. An opportunity for a conference with Appeals prior to the assessment of a tax subject to deficiency procedures is not a prior opportunity for this purpose.
Q-E3.
Are spousal defenses subject to the limitations imposed under section 6330(c)(2)(B) on a taxpayer's right to challenge the tax liability specified in the CDP Notice at a CDP hearing?
A-E3.
The limitations imposed under section 6330(c)(2)(B) do not apply to spousal defenses. When a taxpayer asserts a spousal defense, the taxpayer is not disputing the amount or existence of the liability itself, but asserting a defense to the liability which may or may not be disputed. A spousal defense raised under section 66 or section 6015 is governed by section 66 or section 6015 and the regulations and procedures thereunder. Any limitation under those sections, regulations, and procedures therefore will apply.
Q-E4.
May a taxpayer raise at a CDP hearing a spousal defense under section 66 or section 6015 if that defense was raised and considered administratively and the Commissioner has issued a statutory notice of deficiency or final determination letter addressing the spousal defense?
A-E4.
No. A taxpayer is precluded from raising a spousal defense at a CDP hearing when the Commissioner has made a final determination (under section 66 or section 6015) as to spousal defenses in a final determination letter or statutory notice of deficiency. However, a taxpayer may raise spousal defenses in a CDP hearing when the taxpayer has previously raised spousal defenses, but the Commissioner has not yet made a final determination regarding this issue.
Q-E5.
May a taxpayer raise at a CDP hearing a spousal defense under section 66 or section 6015 if that defense was raised and considered in a prior judicial proceeding that has become final?
A-E5.
No. A taxpayer is precluded by the doctrine of res judicata and by the specific limitations under section 66 or section 6015 from raising a spousal defense in a CDP hearing under these circumstances.
Q-E6.
What collection alternatives are available to the taxpayer?
A-E6.
Collection alternatives include, for example, a proposal to withhold the proposed levy or future collection action in circumstances that will facilitate the collection of the tax liability, an installment agreement, an offer to compromise, the posting of a bond, or the substitution of other assets. A collection alternative is not available unless the alternative would be available to other taxpayers in similar circumstances. See A-D8 of paragraph (d)(2).
Q-E7.
What issues may a taxpayer raise in a CDP hearing under section 6330 if the taxpayer previously received a notice under section 6320 with respect to the same tax and tax period and did not request a CDP hearing with respect to that notice?
A-E7.
The taxpayer may raise appropriate spousal defenses, challenges to the appropriateness of the proposed collection action, and offers of collection alternatives. The existence or amount of the underlying liability for any tax period specified in the CDP Notice may be challenged only if the taxpayer did not have a prior opportunity to dispute the tax liability. If the taxpayer previously received a CDP Notice under section 6320 with respect to the same tax and tax period and did not request a CDP hearing with respect to that earlier CDP Notice, the taxpayer had a prior opportunity to dispute the existence or amount of the underlying tax liability.
Q-E8.
How will Appeals issue its determination?
A-E8.
(i) Taxpayers will be sent a dated Notice of Determination by certified or registered mail. The Notice of Determination will set forth Appeals' findings and decisions. It will state whether the IRS met the requirements of any applicable law or administrative
procedure; it will resolve any issues appropriately raised by the taxpayer relating to the unpaid tax; it will include a decision on any appropriate spousal defenses raised by the taxpayer; it will include a decision on any challenges made by the taxpayer to the appropriateness of the collection action; it will respond to any offers by the taxpayer for collection alternatives; and it will address whether the proposed collection action represents a balance between the need for the efficient collection of taxes and the legitimate concern of the taxpayer that any collection action be no more intrusive than necessary. The Notice of Determination will also set forth any agreements that Appeals reached with the taxpayer, any relief given the taxpayer, and any actions the taxpayer or the IRS are required to take. Lastly, the Notice of Determination will advise the taxpayer of the taxpayer's right to seek judicial review within 30 days of the date of the Notice of Determination.
(ii) Because taxpayers are encouraged to discuss their concerns with the IRS office collecting the tax, certain matters that might have been raised at a CDP hearing may be resolved without the need for Appeals consideration. Unless, as a result of these discussions, the taxpayer agrees in writing to withdraw the request that Appeals conduct a CDP hearing, Appeals will still issue a Notice of Determination, but the taxpayer can waive in writing Appeals' consideration of some or all of the matters it would otherwise consider in making its determination.
Q-E9.
Is there a period of time within which Appeals must conduct a CDP hearing or issue a Notice of Determination?
A-E9.
No. Appeals will, however, attempt to conduct a CDP hearing and issue a Notice of Determination as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances.
Q-E10.
Why is the Notice of Determination and its date important?
A-E10.
The Notice of Determination will set forth Appeals' findings and decisions with respect to the matters set forth in A-E1 of this paragraph (e)(3). The 30-day period within which the taxpayer is permitted to seek judicial review of Appeals' determination commences the day after the date of the Notice of Determination.
Q-E11.
If an Appeals officer considers the merits of a taxpayer's liability in a CDP hearing when the taxpayer had previously received a statutory notice of deficiency or otherwise had an opportunity to dispute the liability prior to the issuance of a notice of intention to levy, will the Appeals officer's determination regarding those liability issues be considered part of the Notice of Determination?
A-E11.
No. An Appeals officer may consider the existence and amount of the underlying tax liability as a part of the CDP hearing only if the taxpayer did not receive a statutory notice of deficiency for the tax liability in question or otherwise have a prior opportunity to dispute the tax liability. Similarly, an Appeals officer may not consider any other issue if the issue was raised and considered at a previous hearing under section 6320 or in any other previous administrative or judicial proceeding in which the person seeking to raise the issue meaningfully participated. In the Appeals officer's sole discretion, however, the Appeals officer may consider the existence or amount of the underlying tax liability, or such other precluded issues, at the same time as the CDP hearing. Any determination, however, made by the Appeals officer with respect to such a precluded issue shall not be treated as part of the Notice of Determination issued by the Appeals officer and will not be subject to any judicial review. Because any decisions made by the Appeals officer on such precluded issues are not properly a part of the CDP hearing, such decisions are not required to appear in the Notice of Determination issued following the hearing. Even if a decision concerning such precluded issues is referred to in the Notice of Determination, it is not reviewable by the Tax Court because the precluded issue is not properly part of the CDP hearing.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1.
The IRS sends a statutory notice of deficiency to the taxpayer at his last known address asserting a deficiency for the
tax year 1995. The taxpayer receives the notice of deficiency in time to petition the Tax Court for a redetermination of the asserted deficiency. The taxpayer does not timely file a petition with the Tax Court. The taxpayer is precluded from challenging the existence or amount of the tax liability in a subsequent CDP hearing.

# Example 2.
Same facts as in
Example 1,
except the taxpayer does not receive the notice of deficiency in time to petition the Tax Court and did not have another prior opportunity to dispute the tax liability. The taxpayer is not precluded from challenging the existence or amount of the tax liability in a subsequent CDP hearing.

# Example 3.
The IRS properly assesses a trust fund recovery penalty against the taxpayer. The IRS offers the taxpayer the opportunity for a conference with Appeals at which the taxpayer would have the opportunity to dispute the assessed liability. The taxpayer declines the opportunity to participate in such a conference. The taxpayer is precluded from challenging the existence or amount of the tax liability in a subsequent CDP hearing.
(f)
Judicial review of Notice of Determination
—(1)
In general.
Unless the taxpayer provides the IRS a written withdrawal of the request that Appeals conduct a CDP hearing, Appeals is required to issue a Notice of Determination in all cases where a taxpayer has timely requested a CDP hearing. The taxpayer may appeal such determinations made by Appeals within the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the Notice of Determination to the Tax Court.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (f) as follows:
Q-F1.
What must a taxpayer do to obtain judicial review of a Notice of Determination?
A-F1.
Subject to the jurisdictional limitations described in A-F2 of this paragraph (f)(2), the taxpayer must, within the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the Notice of Determination, appeal the determination by Appeals to the Tax Court.
Q-F2.
With respect to the relief available to the taxpayer under section 6015, what is the time frame within which a taxpayer may seek Tax Court review of Appeals' determination following a CDP hearing?
A-F2.
If the taxpayer seeks Tax Court review not only of Appeals' denial of relief under section 6015, but also of relief with respect to other issues raised in the CDP hearing, the taxpayer should request Tax Court review within the 30-day period commencing the day after the date of the Notice of Determination. If the taxpayer only seeks Tax Court review of Appeals' denial of relief under section 6015, the taxpayer should request review by the Tax Court, as provided by section 6015(e), within 90 days of Appeals' determination. If a request for Tax Court review is filed after the 30-day period for seeking judicial review under section 6330, then only the taxpayer's section 6015 claims may be reviewable by the Tax Court.
Q-F3.
What issue or issues may the taxpayer raise before the Tax Court if the taxpayer disagrees with the Notice of Determination?
A
-F3.
In seeking Tax Court review of a Notice of Determination, the taxpayer can only ask the court to consider an issue, including a challenge to the underlying tax liability, that was properly raised in the taxpayer's CDP hearing. An issue is not properly raised if the taxpayer fails to request consideration of the issue by Appeals, or if consideration is requested but the taxpayer fails to present to Appeals any evidence with respect to that issue after being given a reasonable opportunity to present such evidence.
Q-F4.
What is the administrative record for purposes of Tax Court review?
A-F4.
The case file, including the taxpayer's request for hearing, any other written communications and information from the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative submitted in connection with the CDP hearing, notes made by an Appeals officer or employee of any oral communications with the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative, memoranda created by the Appeals officer or employee in connection with the CDP hearing, and any other documents or materials relied upon by the Appeals officer or employee in making the determination under section 6330(c)(3), will constitute the record in the Tax Court review of the Notice of Determination issued by Appeals.
(g)
Effect of request for CDP hearing and judicial review on periods of limitation and collection activity
—(1)
In general.
The periods of limitation under section 6502 (relating to collection after assessment), section 6531 (relating to criminal prosecutions), and section 6532 (relating to suits) are suspended until the date the IRS receives the taxpayer's written withdrawal of the request for a CDP hearing by Appeals or the determination resulting from the CDP hearing becomes final by expiration of the time for seeking judicial review or the exhaustion of any rights to appeals following judicial review. In no event shall any of these periods of limitation expire before the 90th day after the date on which the IRS receives the taxpayer's written withdrawal of the request that Appeals conduct a CDP hearing or the Notice of Determination with respect to such hearing becomes final upon either the expiration of the time for seeking judicial review or upon exhaustion of any rights to appeals following judicial review.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (g) as follows:
Q-G1.
For what period of time will the periods of limitation under section 6502, section 6531, and section 6532 remain suspended if the taxpayer timely requests a CDP hearing concerning a pre-levy or post-levy CDP Notice?
A-G1.
The suspension period commences on the date the IRS receives the taxpayer's written request for a CDP hearing. The suspension period continues until the IRS receives a written withdrawal by the taxpayer of the request for a CDP hearing or the Notice of Determination resulting from the CDP hearing becomes final upon either the expiration of the time for seeking judicial review or upon exhaustion of any rights to appeals following judicial review. In no event shall any of these periods of limitation expire before the 90th day after the day on which there is a final determination with respect to such hearing. The periods of limitation that are suspended under section 6330 are those which apply to the taxes and the tax period or periods to which the CDP Notice relates.
Q-G2.
For what period of time will the periods of limitation under section 6502, section 6531, and section 6532 be suspended if the taxpayer does not request a CDP hearing concerning the CDP Notice, or the taxpayer requests a CDP hearing, but his request is not timely?
A-G2.
Under either of these circumstances, section 6330 does not provide for a suspension of the periods of limitation.
Q-G3.
What, if any, enforcement actions can the IRS take during the suspension period?
A-G3.
Section 6330(e) provides for the suspension of the periods of limitation discussed in paragraph (g)(1) of these regulations. Section 6330(e) also provides that levy actions that are the subject of the requested CDP hearing under that section shall be suspended during the same period. The IRS, however, may levy for other taxes and periods not covered by the CDP Notice if the CDP requirements under section 6330 for those taxes and periods have been satisfied. The IRS also may file NFTLs for tax periods and taxes, whether or not covered by the CDP Notice issued under section 6330, and may take other non-levy collection actions such as initiating judicial proceedings to collect the tax shown on the CDP Notice or offsetting overpayments from other periods, or of other taxes, against the tax shown on the CDP Notice. Moreover, the provisions in section 6330 do not apply when the IRS levies for the tax and tax period shown on the CDP Notice to collect a state tax refund due the taxpayer, or determines that collection of the tax is in jeopardy. Finally, section 6330 does not prohibit the IRS from accepting any voluntary payments made for the tax and tax period stated on the CDP Notice.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (g):

# Example 1.
The period of limitation under section 6502 with respect to the taxpayer's tax period listed in the CDP Notice will expire on August 1, 1999. The IRS sent a CDP Notice to the taxpayer on April 30, 1999. The taxpayer timely requested a CDP hearing. The IRS received this request on May 15, 1999. Appeals sends the taxpayer its determination on June 15, 1999. The taxpayer
timely seeks judicial review of that determination. The period of limitation under section 6502 would be suspended from May 15, 1999, until the determination resulting from that hearing becomes final by expiration of the time for seeking review or reconsideration before the Tax Court, plus 90 days.

# Example 2.
Same facts as in
Example 1,
except the taxpayer does not seek judicial review of Appeals' determination. Because the taxpayer requested the CDP hearing when fewer than 90 days remained on the period of limitation, the period of limitation will be extended to October 13, 1999 (90 days from July 15, 1999).
(h)
Retained jurisdiction of Appeals
—(1)
In general.
The Appeals office that makes a determination under section 6330 retains jurisdiction over that determination, including any subsequent administrative hearings that may be requested by the taxpayer regarding levies and any collection actions taken or proposed with respect to Appeals' determination. Once a taxpayer has exhausted his other remedies, Appeals' retained jurisdiction permits it to consider whether a change in the taxpayer's circumstances affects its original determination. Where a taxpayer alleges a change in circumstances that affects Appeals' original determination, Appeals may consider whether changed circumstances warrant a change in its earlier determination.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (h) as follows:
Q-H1.
Are the periods of limitation suspended during the course of any subsequent Appeals consideration of the matters raised by a taxpayer when the taxpayer invokes the retained jurisdiction of Appeals under section 6330(d)(2)(A) or (B)?
A-H1.
No. Under section 6330(b)(2), a taxpayer is entitled to only one CDP hearing under section 6330 with respect to the tax and tax periods specified in the CDP Notice. Any subsequent consideration by Appeals pursuant to its retained jurisdiction is not a continuation of the original CDP hearing and does not suspend the periods of limitation.
Q-H2.
Is a decision of Appeals resulting from a retained jurisdiction hearing appealable to the Tax Court?
A-H2.
No. As discussed in A-H1, a taxpayer is entitled to only one CDP hearing under section 6330 with respect to the tax and tax period or periods specified in the CDP Notice. Only determinations resulting from CDP hearings are appealable to the Tax Court.
(i)
Equivalent hearing
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer who fails to make a timely request for a CDP hearing is not entitled to a CDP hearing. Such a taxpayer may nevertheless request an administrative hearing with Appeals, which is referred to herein as an “equivalent hearing.” The equivalent hearing will be held by Appeals and generally will follow Appeals procedures for a CDP hearing. Appeals will not, however, issue a Notice of Determination. Under such circumstances, Appeals will issue a Decision Letter.
(2)
Questions and answers.
The questions and answers illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (i) as follows:
Q-I1.
What must a taxpayer do to obtain an equivalent hearing?
A-I1.
(i) A request for an equivalent hearing must be made in writing. A written request in any form that requests an equivalent hearing will be acceptable if it includes the information and signature required in A-I1(ii) of this paragraph (i)(2).
(ii) The request must be dated and must include the following:
(A) The taxpayer's name, address, daytime telephone number (if any), and taxpayer identification number (e.g., SSN, ITIN or EIN).
(B) The type of tax involved.
(C) The tax period at issue.
(D) A statement that the taxpayer is requesting an equivalent hearing with Appeals concerning the levy.
(E) The reason or reasons why the taxpayer disagrees with the proposed levy.
(F) The signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative.
(iii) The taxpayer must perfect any timely written request for an equivalent hearing that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in A-I1(ii) of this paragraph (i)(2) within a reasonable period of time after a request from the IRS. If the requirements are not satisfied within a reasonable period of time, the taxpayer's equivalent hearing request will be denied.
(iv) The taxpayer must affirm any timely written request for an equivalent hearing that is signed or alleged to have been signed on the taxpayer's behalf by the taxpayer's spouse or other unauthorized representative, and that otherwise meets the requirements set forth in A-I1(ii) of this paragraph (i)(2), by filing, within a reasonable period of time after a request from the IRS, a signed written affirmation that the request was originally submitted on the taxpayer's behalf. If the affirmation is filed within a reasonable period of time after a request, the timely equivalent hearing request will be considered timely with respect to the non-signing taxpayer. If the affirmation is not filed within a reasonable period of time, the equivalent hearing request will be denied with respect to the non-signing taxpayer.
Q-I2.
What issues will Appeals consider at an equivalent hearing?
A-I2.
In an equivalent hearing, Appeals will consider the same issues that it would have considered at a CDP hearing on the same matter.
Q-I3.
Are the periods of limitation under sections 6502, 6531, and 6532 suspended if the taxpayer does not timely request a CDP hearing and is subsequently given an equivalent hearing?
A-I3.
No. The suspension period provided for in section 6330(e) relates only to hearings requested within the 30-day period that commences the day following the date of the pre-levy or post-levy CDP Notice, that is, CDP hearings.
Q-I4.
Will collection action be suspended if a taxpayer requests and receives an equivalent hearing?
A-I4.
Collection action is not required to be suspended. Accordingly, the decision to take collection action during the pendency of an equivalent hearing will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Appeals may request the IRS office with responsibility for collecting the taxes to suspend all or some collection action or to take other appropriate action if it determines that such action is appropriate or necessary under the circumstances.
Q-I5.
What will the Decision Letter state?
A-I5.
The Decision Letter will generally contain the same information as a Notice of Determination.
Q-I6.
Will a taxpayer be able to obtain Tax Court review of a decision made by Appeals with respect to an equivalent hearing?
A-I6.
Section 6330 does not authorize a taxpayer to appeal the decision of Appeals with respect to an equivalent hearing. A taxpayer may under certain circumstances be able to seek Tax Court review of Appeals' denial of relief under section 6015. Such review must be sought within 90 days of the issuance of Appeals' determination on those issues, as provided by section 6015(e).
Q-I7.
When must a taxpayer request an equivalent hearing with respect to a CDP Notice issued under section 6330?
A-I7.
A taxpayer must submit a written request for an equivalent hearing within the one-year period commencing the day after the date of the CDP Notice issued under section 6330. This period is slightly different from the period for submitting a written request for an equivalent hearing with respect to a CDP Notice issued under section 6320. For a CDP Notice issued under section 6320, a taxpayer must submit a written request for an equivalent hearing within the one-year period commencing the day after the end of the five-business-day period following the filing of the NFTL.
Q-I8.
How will the timeliness of a taxpayer's written request for an equivalent hearing be determined?
A-I8.
The rules and regulations under section 7502 and section 7503 will apply to determine the timeliness of the taxpayer's request for an equivalent hearing, if properly transmitted and addressed as provided in A-I10 of this paragraph (i)(2).
Q-I9.
Is the one-year period within which a taxpayer must make a request for an equivalent hearing extended because the taxpayer resides outside the United States?
A-I9. No.
All taxpayers who want an equivalent hearing must request the hearing within the one-year period commencing the day after the date of the CDP Notice issued under section 6330.
Q-I10.
Where must the written request for an equivalent hearing be sent?
A-I10.
The written request for an equivalent hearing must be sent, or hand delivered (if permitted), to the IRS office and address as directed on the CDP Notice. If the address of the issuing office does not appear on the CDP Notice, the taxpayer should obtain the address of the office to which the written request should be sent or hand delivered by calling, toll-free, 1-800-829-1040 and providing the taxpayer's identification number (e.g., SSN, ITIN or EIN).
Q-I11.
What will happen if the taxpayer does not request an equivalent hearing in writing within the one-year period commencing the day after the date of the CDP Notice issued under section 6330?
A-I11.
If the taxpayer does not request an equivalent hearing with Appeals within the one-year period commencing the day after the date of the CDP Notice issued under section 6330, the taxpayer foregoes the right to an equivalent hearing with respect to the unpaid tax and tax periods shown on the CDP Notice. A written request submitted within the one-year period that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in A-I1(ii) of this paragraph (i)(2) is considered timely if the request is perfected within a reasonable period of time pursuant to A-I1(iii) of this paragraph (i)(2). If a request for equivalent hearing is untimely, either because the request was not submitted within the one-year period or not perfected within the reasonable period provided, the equivalent hearing request will be denied. The taxpayer, however, may seek reconsideration by the IRS office collecting the tax, assistance from the National Taxpayer Advocate, or an administrative hearing before Appeals under its Collection Appeals Program or any successor program.
(j)
Effective date.
This section is applicable on or after November 16, 2006 with respect to requests made for CDP hearings or equivalent hearings on or after November 16, 2006.
[T.D. 8980, 67 FR 2551, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended by T.D. 9291, 71 FR 60831, Oct. 17, 2006]
§ 301.6331-1
Levy and distraint.
(a)
Authority to levy
—(1)
In general.
If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the tax within 10 days after notice and demand, the district director to whom the assessment is charged (or, upon his request, any other district director) may proceed to collect the tax by levy. The district director may levy upon any property, or rights to property, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, belonging to the taxpayer. The district director may also levy upon property with respect to which there is a lien provided by section 6321 or 6324 for the payment of the tax. For exemption of certain property from levy, see section 6334 and the regulations thereunder. As used in section 6331 and this section, the term “tax” includes any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with costs and expenses. Property subject to a Federal tax lien which has been sold or otherwise transferred by the taxpayer may be seized while in the hands of the transferee or any subsequent transferee. However, see provisions under sections 6323 and 6324 (a)(2) and (b) for protection of certain transferees against a Federal tax lien. Levy may be made by serving a notice of levy on any person in possession of, or obligated with respect to, property or rights to property subject to levy, including receivables, bank accounts, evidences of debt, securities, and salaries, wages, commissions, or other compensation. A levy on a bank reaches any interest that accrues on the taxpayer's balance under the terms of the bank's agreement with the depositor during the 21-day holding period provided for in section 6332(c). Except as provided in § 301.6331-1(b)(1) with regard to a levy on salary or wages, a levy extends only to property possessed and obligations which exist at the time of the levy. Obligations exist when the liability of the obligor is fixed and determinable although the right to receive payment thereof may be deferred until a later date. For example, if on the first day of the month a delinquent taxpayer sold personal property subject to an agreement that the buyer remit the purchase price on the last day of the month, a levy made
on the buyer on the 10th day of the month would reach the amount due on the sale, although the buyer need not satisfy the levy by paying over the amount to the district director until the last day of the month. Similarly, a levy only reaches property in the possession of the person levied upon at the time the levy is made together with interest that accrues during the 21-day holding period provided for in section 6332(c). For example, a levy made on a bank with respect to the account of a delinquent taxpayer is satisfied if the bank surrenders the amount of the taxpayer's balance at the time the levy is made. The levy has no effect upon any subsequent deposit made in the bank by the taxpayer. Subsequent deposits may be reached only by a subsequent levy on the bank.
(2)
Jeopardy cases.
If the district director finds that the collection of any tax is in jeopardy, he or she may make notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax and, upon failure or refusal to pay such tax, collection thereof by levy shall be lawful without regard to the 10-day period provided in section 6331(a), the 30-day period provided in section 6331(d), or the limitation on levy provided in section 6331(g)(1).
(3)
Bankruptcy or receivership cases.
During a bankruptcy proceeding or a receivership proceeding in either a Federal or a State court, the assets of the taxpayer are in general under the control of the court in which such proceeding is pending. Taxes cannot be collected by levy upon assets in the custody of a court, whether or not such custody is incident to a bankruptcy or receivership proceeding, except where the proceeding has progressed to such a point that the levy would not interfere with the work of the court or where the court grants permission to levy. Any assets which under applicable provisions of law are not under the control of the court may be levied upon, for example, property exempt from court custody under State law or the bankrupt's earnings and property acquired after the date of bankruptcy. However, levy upon such property is not mandatory and the Government may rely upon payment of taxes in the proceeding.
(4)
Certain types of compensation
—(i)
Federal employees.
Levy may be made upon the salary or wages of any officer or employee (including members of the Armed Forces), or elected or appointed official, of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of either, by serving a notice of levy on the employer of the delinquent taxpayer. As used in this subdivision, the term “employer” means (
a
) the officer or employee of the United States, the District of Columbia, or of the agency or instrumentality of the United States or the District of Columbia, who has control of the payment of the wages, or (
b
) any other officer or employee designated by the head of the branch, department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or of the District of Columbia as the party upon whom service of the notice of levy may be made. If the head of such branch, department, agency or instrumentality designates an officer or employee other than one who has control of the payment of the wages, as the party upon whom service of the notice of levy may be made, such head shall promptly notify the Commissioner of the name and address of each officer or employee so designated and the scope or extent of his authority as such designee.
(ii)
State and municipal employees.
Salaries, wages, or other compensation of any officer, employee, or elected or appointed official of a State or Territory, or of any agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision thereof, are also subject to levy to enforce collection of any Federal tax.
(iii)
Seamen.
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 12 of the Seamen's Act of 1915 (46 U.S.C. 601), wages of seamen, apprentice seamen, or fishermen employed on fishing vessels are subject to levy. See section 6334(c).
(5)
Noncompetent Indians.
Solely for purposes of sections 6321 and 6331, any interest in restricted land held in trust by the United States for an individual noncompetent Indian (and not for a tribe) shall not be deemed to be property, or a right to property, belonging to such Indian.
(b)
Continuing levies and successive seizures
—(1)
Continuing effect of levy on salary and wages.
A levy on salary or
wages has continuous effect from the time the levy originally is made until the levy is released pursuant to section 6343. For this purpose, the term
salary or wages
includes compensation for services paid in the form of fees, commissions, bonuses, and similar items. The levy attaches to both salary or wages earned but not yet paid at the time of the levy, advances on salary or wages made subsequent to the date of the levy, and salary or wages earned and becoming payable subsequent to the date of the levy, until the levy is released pursuant to section 6343. In general, salaries or wages that are the subject of a continuing levy and are not exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(8) or (9), are to be paid to the district director, the service center director, or the compliance center director (director) on the same date the payor would otherwise pay over the money to the taxpayer. For example, if an individual normally is paid on the Wednesday following the close of each work week, a levy made upon his or her employer on any Monday would apply to both wages due for the prior work week and wages for succeeding work weeks as such wages become payable. In such a case, the levy would be satisfied if, on the first Wednesday after the levy and on each Wednesday thereafter until the employer receives a notice of release from levy described in section 6343, the employer pays over to the director wages that would otherwise be paid to the employee on such Wednesday (less any exempt amount pursuant to section 6334).
(2)
Successive seizures.
Whenever any property or rights to property upon which a levy has been made are not sufficient to satisfy the claim of the United States for which the levy is made, the district director may thereafter, and as often as may be necessary, proceed to levy in like manner upon any other property or rights to property subject to levy of the person against whom such claim exists or on which there is a lien imposed by section 6321 or 6324 (or the corresponding provision of prior law) for the payment of such claim until the amount due from such person, together with all costs and expenses, is fully paid.
(c)
Service of notice of levy by mail.
A notice of levy may be served by mailing the notice to the person upon whom the service of a notice of levy is authorized under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In such a case the date and time the notice is delivered to the person to be served is the date and time the levy is made. If the notice is sent by certificated mail, return receipt requested, the date of delivery on the receipt is treated as the date the levy is made. If, after receipt of a notice of levy, an officer or other person authorized to act on behalf of the person served signs and notes the date and time of receipt on the notice of levy, the date and time so the contrary, the date and time of delivery.
Any person may, upon written notice to the district director having audit jurisdiction over such person, have all notices of levy by mail sent to one designated office. After such a notice is received by the district director, notices of levy by mail will be sent to the designated office until a written notice withdrawing the request or a written notice designating a different office is received by the district director.
(d)
Effective date.
These regulations are effective December 10, 1992.
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7139, 36 FR 15041, Aug. 12, 1971; T.D. 7620, 44 FR 27987, May 14, 1979; T.D. 7874, 48 FR 10061, Mar. 10, 1983; T.D. 8558, 59 FR 38903, Aug. 1, 1994]
§ 301.6331-2
Procedures and restrictions on levies.
(a)
Notice of intent to levy
—(1)
In general.
Levy may be made upon the salary, wages, or other property of a taxpayer for any unpaid tax no less than 30 days after the district director, the service center director, or the compliance center director (director) has notified the taxpayer in writing of the intent to levy. The notice must be given in person, be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of the taxpayer, or be sent by registered or certified mail to the taxpayer's last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see § 301.6212-2. The notice of intent to levy is separate from, but may be given at the same time as, the notice and demand described in § 301.6331-1.
(2)
Content of Notice.
The notice of intent to levy is to contain a brief statement in nontechnical terms including the following information—
(i) The Internal Revenue Code provisions and the procedures relating to levy and sale of property;
(ii) The administrative appeals available with respect to the levy and sale of property and the procedures relating to such appeals;
(iii) The alternatives available that could prevent levy on the property (including the use of an installment agreement under section 6159); and
(iv) The Internal Revenue Code provisions and the procedures relating to redemption of property and release of liens on property.
(b)
Uneconomical levy
—(1)
In general.
No levy may be made on property if the director estimates that the anticipated expenses with respect to the levy and sale will exceed the fair market value of the property. The estimate is to be made on an aggregate basis for all of the items that are anticipated to be seized pursuant to the levy. Generally, no levy should be made on individual items of insignificant monetary value. For the definition of fair market value, see § 301.6325-1(b)(1)(i). See § 301.6341-1 concerning the expenses of levy and sale.
(2)
Time of estimate.
The estimate, which may be formal or informal, is to be made at the time of the seizure or within a reasonable period of time prior to a seizure. The estimate may be based on earlier estimates of fair market value and anticipated expenses of the same or similar property.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1.
A director anticipates that the taxpayer has only one item of property that can be seized and sold. This item is estimated to have a fair market value of $250.00. The director also estimates that the costs of seizure and sale will total $300.00 if this item is seized. The director is prohibited from levying on this one item of the taxpayer's property because the costs of seizure and sale are estimated to exceed the property's fair market value.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that the director anticipates that the taxpayer has 10 items of property that can be seized and sold. Each of those items is estimated to have a fair market value of $250.00. The director also estimates that the costs of seizure and sale will total $300.00 regardless of how many of those items are seized. The director is prohibited from levying on only one item of the taxpayer's property because the costs of seizure and sale are estimated to exceed the fair market value of the single item of property. The director, however, would not be prohibited from levying on two or more items of the taxpayer's property because the aggregate fair market value of the seized property would exceed the estimated costs of seizure and sale.

# Example 3.
The taxpayer has three items of property, A, B, and C. The director anticipates that the value of items A, B, and C depends on their being sold as a unit. The director estimates that due to high anticipated costs of storing or maintaining item B prior to the sale, the aggregate fair market value of items A, B, and C will not exceed the anticipated expenses of seizure and sale if all three items are seized. Accordingly, the director is prohibited from levying on items A, B, and C.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
except that the director does not anticipate that the value of items A, B, and C depends on those items being sold as a unit. If the director estimates that the aggregate fair market value of items A and C exceeds the aggregate anticipated costs of the seizure and sale of those two items, items A and C can be seized and sold. The director is prohibited from levying on item B because the high cost of storing or maintaining item B is estimated to exceed the fair market value of item B.
(c)
Restriction on levy on date of appearance.
Except for continuing levies on salaries or wages described in § 301.6331-1(b)(1), no levy may be made on any property of a person on the day that person, or an officer or employee of that person, is required to appear in response to a summons served for the purpose of collecting any underpayment of tax from that person. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the date on which an appearance is required is the date fixed by an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to section 7605 or the date (if any) fixed as the result of a judicial proceeding instituted under sections 7604 and 7402(b) seeking the enforcement of the summons.
(d)
Jeopardy.
Paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section do not apply to a levy if the director finds, for purposes of
§ 301.6331-1(a)(2), that the collection of tax is in jeopardy.
(e)
Effective date.
These regulations are effective December 10, 1992.
[T.D. 8558, 59 FR 38903, Aug. 1, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8939, 66 FR 2821, Jan. 12, 2001]

§ 301.7122-1.
[T.D. 9027, 67 FR 77417, Dec. 18, 2002]
§ 301.6331-4
Restrictions on levy while installment agreements are pending or in effect.
(a)
Prohibition on levy
—(1)
In general.
No levy may be made to collect a tax liability that is the subject of an installment agreement during the period that a proposed installment agreement is pending with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for 30 days immediately following the rejection of a proposed installment agreement, during the period that an installment agreement is in effect, and for 30 days immediately following the termination of an installment agreement. If, within the 30 days following the rejection or termination of an installment agreement, the taxpayer files an appeal with the IRS Office of Appeals, no levy may be made while the rejection or termination is being considered by Appeals. This section will not prohibit levy to collect the liability of any person other than the person or persons named in the installment agreement.
(2)
When a proposed installment agreement becomes pending.
A proposed installment agreement becomes pending when it is accepted for processing. The IRS may not accept a proposed installment agreement for processing following reference of a case involving the liability that is the subject of the proposed installment agreement to the Department of Justice for prosecution or defense. The proposed installment agreement remains pending until the IRS accepts the proposal, the IRS notifies the taxpayer that the proposal has been rejected, or the proposal is withdrawn by the taxpayer. If a proposed installment agreement that has been accepted for processing does not contain sufficient information to permit the IRS to evaluate whether the proposal should be accepted, the IRS will request the taxpayer to provide the needed additional information. If the taxpayer does not submit the additional information that the IRS has requested within a reasonable time period after such a request, the IRS may reject the proposed installment agreement.
(3)
Revised proposals of installment agreements submitted following rejection.
If, following the rejection of a proposed installment agreement, the taxpayer makes a good faith revision of the proposal and submits the revision within 30 days of the date of rejection, the provisions of this section shall apply to that revised proposal.
(4)
Exceptions.
Paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not prohibit levy if the taxpayer files a written notice with the IRS that waives the restriction on levy imposed by this section, the IRS determines that the proposed installment agreement was submitted solely to delay collection, or the IRS determines that collection of the tax to which the installment agreement or proposed installment agreement relates is in jeopardy.
(b)
Other actions by the IRS while levy is prohibited
—(1)
In general.
The IRS may take actions other than levy to protect the interests of the Government with regard to the liability identified in an installment agreement or proposed installment agreement. Those actions include, for example—
(i) Crediting an overpayment against the liability pursuant to section 6402;
(ii) Filing or refiling notices of Federal tax lien; and
(iii) Taking action to collect from any person who is not named in the installment agreement or proposed installment agreement but who is liable for the tax to which the installment agreement relates.
(2)
Proceedings in court.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2), the IRS will not refer a case to the Department of Justice for the commencement of a proceeding in court, against a person named in an installment agreement or proposed installment agreement, if levy to collect the liability is prohibited by paragraph
(a)(1) of this section. Without regard to whether a person is named in an installment agreement or proposed installment agreement, however, the IRS may authorize the Department of Justice to file a counterclaim or third-party complaint in a refund action or to join that person in any other proceeding in which liability for the tax that is the subject of the installment agreement or proposed installment agreement may be established or disputed, including a suit against the United States under 28 U.S.C. 2410. In addition, the United States may file a claim in any bankruptcy proceeding or insolvency action brought by or against such person. If a person named in an installment agreement is joined in a proceeding, the United States obtains a judgment against that person, and the case is referred back to the IRS for collection, collection will continue to occur pursuant to the terms of the installment agreement.
(c)
Statute of limitations
—(1)
Suspension of the statute of limitations on collection.
The statute of limitations under section 6502 for collection of any liability shall be suspended during the period that a proposed installment agreement relating to that liability is pending with the IRS, for 30 days immediately following the rejection of a proposed installment agreement, and for 30 days immediately following the termination of an installment agreement. If, within the 30 days following the rejection or termination of an installment agreement, the taxpayer files an appeal with the IRS Office of Appeals, the statute of limitations for collection shall be suspended while the rejection or termination is being considered by Appeals. The statute of limitations for collection shall continue to run if an exception under paragraph (a)(4) of this section applies and levy is not prohibited with respect to the taxpayer.
(2)
Waivers of the statute of limitations on collection.
The IRS may continue to request, to the extent permissible under section 6502 and § 301.6159-1, that the taxpayer agree to a reasonable extension of the statute of limitations for collection.
(d)
Cross-reference.
For provisions relating to the making of levies while an installment agreement is pending or in effect,
see
§ 301.6159-1.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) are applicable beginning December 18, 2002. Paragraph (d) is applicable beginning November 25, 2009.
[T.D. 9027, 67 FR 77417, Dec. 18, 2002, as amended by T.D. 9473, 74 FR 61530, Nov. 25, 2009]
§ 301.6332-1
Surrender of property subject to levy.
(a)
Requirement
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in § 301.6332-2, relating to levy in the case of life insurance and endowment contracts, and in § 301.6332-3, relating to property held by banks, any person in possession of (or obligated with respect to) property or rights to property subject to levy and upon which a levy has been made shall, upon demand of the district director, surrender the property or rights (or discharge the obligation) to the district director, except that part of the property or rights (or obligation) which, at the time of the demand, is actually or constructively under the jurisdiction of a court because of an attachment or execution under any judicial process.
(2)
Levy on bank deposits held in offices outside the United States.
Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), if a levy has been made upon property or rights to property subject to levy which a bank engaged in the banking business in the United States or a possession of the United States is in possession of (or obligated with respect to), the Commissioner shall not enforce the levy with respect to any deposits held in an office of the bank outside the United States or a possession of the United States, unless the notice of levy specifies that the district director intends to reach such deposits. The notice of levy shall not specify that the district director intends to reach such deposits unless the district director believes—
(i) That the taxpayer is within the jurisdiction of a U.S. court at the time the levy is made and that the bank is in possession of (or obligated with respect to) deposits of the taxpayer in an office of the bank outside the United
States or a possession of the United States; or
(ii) That the taxpayer is not within the jurisdiction of a U.S. court at the time the levy is made, that the bank is in possession of (or obligated with respect to) deposits of the taxpayer in an office outside the United States or a possession of the United States, and that such deposits consist, in whole or in part, of funds transferred from the United States or a possession of the United States in order to hinder or delay the collection of a tax imposed by the Code. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “possession of the United States” includes Guam, the Midway Islands, the Panama Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and Wake Island.
(b)
Enforcement of levy
—(1)
Extent of personal liability.
Any person who, upon demand of the district director, fails or refuses to surrender any property or right to property subject to levy is liable in his own person and estate in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights not so surrendered, together with costs and interest. The liability, however, may not exceed the amount of the taxes for the collection of which the levy was made. Interest is to be computed at the annual rate referred to in regulations under section 6621 from the date of the levy, or, in the case of a continuing levy on salary or wages (see section 6331(d)(3)), from the date the person would otherwise have been obligated to pay over the wages or salary to the taxpayer. Any amount recovered, other than cost, will be credited against the tax liability for the collection of which the levy was made.
(2)
Penalty for violation.
In addition to the personal liability described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (b), any person who is required to surrender property or rights to property and who fails or refuses to surrender them without reasonable cause is liable for a penalty equal to 50 percent of the amount recoverable under section 6332(d)(1). No part of the penalty described in this subparagraph shall be credited against the tax liability for the collection of which the levy was made. The penalty described in this subparagraph is not applicable in cases where bona fide dispute exists concerning the amount of the property to be surrendered pursuant to a levy or concerning the legal effectiveness of the levy. However, if a court in a later enforcement suit sustains the levy, then reasonable cause would usually not exist to refuse to honor a later levy made under similar circumstances.
(c)
Effect of honoring levy
—(1)
In general.
Any person in possession of, or obligated with respect to, property or rights to property subject to levy and upon which a levy has been made who, upon demand by the district director, surrenders the property or rights to property, or discharges the obligation, to the district director, or who pays a liability described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is discharged from any obligation or liability to the delinquent taxpayer and any other person with respect to the property or rights to property arising from the surrender or payment.
(2)
Exception for certain incorrectly surrendered property.
Any person who surrenders to the Internal Revenue Service property or rights to property not properly subject to levy in which the delinquent taxpayer has no apparent interest is not relieved of liability to a third party who has an interest in the property. However, if the delinquent taxpayer has an apparent interest in property or rights to property, a person who makes a good faith determination that such property or rights to property in his or her possession has been levied upon by the Internal Revenue Service and who surrenders the property to the United States in response to the levy is relived of liability to a third party who has an interest in the property or rights to property, even if it is subsequently determined that the property was not properly subject to levy.
(3)
Remedy.
In situations described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, taxpayers and third parties who have an interest in property surrendered in response to a levy may secure from the Internal Revenue Service the administrative relief provided for in section 6343(b) or may bring suit to recover the property under section 7426.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
M Bank is served with a notice of levy for an unpaid tax liability due from A in the amount of $2,000. M Bank holds $2,000 in a checking account in the names of A or B or C. Although all of the deposits into the account were made by B and C, A has an unrestricted right to withdraw the funds from the account. M Bank surrenders the entire account to the district director at the end of the holding period provided in section 6332(c). Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, M Bank is not liable to B or C for any amount, even if B or C prove that the funds in the account did not belong to A, because A's unrestricted right to withdraw the funds is an interest which in subject to levy. B or C may, however, seek the return of the funds from the United States as provided in sections 6343(b) and 7426 of the Internal Revenue Code.

# Example 2.
A is indebted to B for $400. Unbeknownst to A, B has assigned his right to receive payment to C. A is served with a notice of levy for an unpaid tax liability due from B for $400. A, acting with no knowledge of the assignment to C, surrenders $400 to the district director. A is discharged from his obligation to pay B, the taxpayer. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, because B had an apparent interest in the funds that A owed to B, and because A determined in good faith that those funds had been levied upon, A is also discharged from any liability to C, even though the money is not properly subject to levy. C may, however, seek return of the payment from the United States as provided in sections 6343(b) and 7426 of the Internal Revenue Code.

# Example 3.
M Bank is served with a notice of levy for an unpaid tax liability due from “John H. Smith, Sr.” in the amount of $5,000. M Bank fails to read the notice of levy carefully. When searching its records, M Bank finds the name of “John H. Smith, Jr.” and looks no further. M Bank surrenders $5,000 from John H. Smith, Jr.'s checking account to the district director. M Bank is not discharged from liability under section 6332(e) of the Internal Revenue Code because the delinquent taxpayer (John H. Smith, Sr.) had no apparent interest in the account of John H. Smith, Jr. (Generally, John H. Smith Jr. may seek return of the payment from the United States as provided in sections 6343 and 7426 of the Internal Revenue Code.)

# Example 4.
M Bank is served with a notice of levy for an unpaid tax liability due from “Robert A. Jones” in the amount of $5,000. M Bank searches its records and identifies four separate accounts of $1,000 each in the name of “Robert A. Jones.” All four accounts list different addresses and social security identification numbers. M Bank surrenders all four accounts totalling $4,000 in response to the levy. M Bank could not in good faith have determined that all four accounts were levied upon. Therefore, M Bank is not discharged from liability to any person other than the taxpayer whose account was levied upon.
(5)
Effective date.
Paragraph (c) of this section is effective January 11, 1993. However, persons surrendering property to the Internal Revenue Service may rely on the regulations with respect to levies issued after November 10, 1988.
(d)
Person defined.
The term “person,” as used in section 6332(a) and this section, includes an officer or employee of a corporation or a member or employee of a partnership, who is under a duty to surrender the property or rights to property or to discharge the obligation. In the case of a levy upon the salary or wages of an officer, employee, or elected or appointed official of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of either, the term “person” includes the officer or employee of the United States, of the District of Columbia, or of such agency or instrumentality who is under a duty to discharge the obligation. As to the officer or employee who is under such duty, see paragraph (a)(4)(i) of § 301.6331-1.
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7180, 37 FR 7317, Apr. 13, 1972; T.D. 7620, 44 FR 27988, May 14, 1979; T.D. 8466, 58 FR 17, Jan. 4, 1993; T.D.8467, 58 FR 3829, Jan. 12, 1993]
§ 301.6332-2
Surrender of property subject to levy in the case of life insurance and endowment contracts.
(a)
In general.
This section provides special rules relating to the surrender of property subject to levy in the case of life insurance and endowment contracts. The provisions of § 301.6332-1 which relate generally to the surrender of property subject to levy apply, to the extent not inconsistent with the special rules set forth in this section, to a levy in the case of life insurance and endowment contracts.
(b)
Effect of service of notice of levy
—(1)
In general.
(i) A notice of levy served by a district director on an insuring organization with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract issued by the organization shall constitute—
(A) A demand by the district director for the payment of the cash loan value of the contract adjusted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, and
(B) The exercise of the right of the person against whom the tax is assessed to the advance of such cash loan value.
(ii) It is unnecessary for the district director to surrender the contract document to the insuring organization upon which the levy is made. However, the notice of levy will include a certification by the district director that a copy of the notice of levy has been mailed to the person against whom the tax is assessed at his last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see § 301.6212-2. At the time of service of the notice of levy, the levy is effective with respect to the cash loan value of the insurance contract, subject to the condition that if the levy is not satisfied or released before the 90th day after the date of service, the levy can be satisfied only by payment of the amount described in paragraph (c) of this section. Other than satisfaction or release of the levy, no event during the 90-day period subsequent to the date of service of the notice of levy shall release the cash loan value from the effect of the levy. For example, the termination of the policy by the taxpayer or by the death of the insured during such 90-day period shall not release the levy. For the rules relating to the time when the insuring organization is to pay over the required amount, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Notification of amount subject to levy
—(i)
Full payment before the 90th day.
In the event that the unpaid liability to which the levy relates is satisfied at any time during the 90-day period subsequent to the date of service of the notice of levy, the district director will promptly give the insuring organization written notification that the levy is released.
(ii)
Notification after the 90th day.
In the event that notification is not given under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the district director will, promptly following the 90th day after service of the notice of levy, give the insuring organization written notification of the current status of all accounts listed on the notice of levy, and of the total payments received since service of the notice of levy. This notification will be given to the insuring organization whether or not there has been any change in the status of the accounts.
(c)
Satisfaction of levy
—(1)
In general.
The levy described in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract shall be deemed to be satisfied if the insuring organization pays over to the district director the amount which the person against whom the tax is assessed could have had advanced to him by the organization on the 90th day after service of the notice of levy on the organization. However, this amount is increased by the amount of any advance (including contractual interest thereon), generally called a policy loan, made to the person on or after the date the organization has actual notice or knowledge, within the meaning of section 6323(i)(1), of the existence of the tax lien with respect to which the levy is made. The insuring organization may, nevertheless, make an advance (including contractual interest thereon), generally called an automatic premium loan, made automatically to maintain the contract in force under an agreement entered into before the organization has such actual notice or knowledge. In any event, the amount paid to the district director by the insuring organization is not to exceed the amount of the unpaid liability shown on the notification described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The amount, determined in accordance with the provisions of this section, subject to the levy shall be paid to the district director by the insuring organization promptly after receipt of the notification described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The satisfaction of a levy with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract will not discharge the contract from the tax lien. However, see section 6323(b)(9)(C) and the regulations thereunder concerning the liability of an insurance company after satisfaction of a levy with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract. If the person against whom the tax is assessed so directs, the insuring organization, on a date before the 90th day
after service of the notice of levy, may satisfy the levy by paying over an amount computed in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph substituting such date for the 90th day. In the event of termination of the policy by the taxpayer or by the death of the insured on a date before the 90th day after service of the notice of levy, the amount to be paid over to the district director by the insuring organization in satisfaction of the levy shall be an amount computed in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph substituting the date of termination of the policy or the date of death for the 90th day.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On March 5, 1968, a notice of levy for an unpaid income tax assessment due from A in the amount of $3,000 is served on the X Insurance Company with respect to A's life insurance policy. On March 5, 1968, the cash loan value of the policy is $1,500. On April 9, 1968, A does not pay a premium due on the policy in the amount of $200. Under an automatic premium advance provision contained in the policy originally issued in 1960, X advances the premium out of the cash value of the policy. As of June 3, 1968 (the 90th day after service of the notice of levy), pursuant to the provisions of the policy, the amount of accrued charges upon the automatic premium advance in the amount of $200 for the period April 9, 1968, through June 3, 1968, is $2. On June 5, 1968, the district director gives written notification to X indicating that A's unpaid tax assessment is $2,500. Under this section, X is required to pay to the district director, promptly after receipt of the June 5, 1968, notification, the sum of $1,298 ($1,500 less $200 less $2), which is the amount A could have had advanced to him by X on June 3, 1968.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that on May 10, 1968, A requests and X grants an advance in the amount of $1,000. X has actual notice of the existence of the lien by reason of the service of the notice of levy on March 5, 1968. This advance is not required to be made automatically under the policy and reduces the amount of the cash value of the policy. For the use of the $1,000 advance during the period May 10, 1968, through June 3, 1968, X charges A the sum of $3. Under this section, X is required to pay to the district director, promptly after receipt of the June 5, 1968, notification, the sum of $1,298. This $1,298 amount is composed of the $295 amount ($1,500 less $200 less $2 less $1,000 less $3) A could have had advanced to him by X on June 3, 1968, plus the $1,000 advance plus the charges in the amount of $3 with respect thereto.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the insurance contract does not contain an automatic premium advance provision. The contract does provide that, upon default in the payment of premiums, the policy shall automatically be converted to paid-up term insurance with no cash or loan value. A fails to make the premium payment of $200 due on April 9, 1968. After expiration of a grace period to make the premium payment, the X Insurance Company applies the cash loan value of $1,500 to effect the conversion. Since the service of the notice of levy constitutes the exercise of A's right to receive the cash loan value and the amount applied to effect the conversion is not an automatic advance to A to maintain the policy in force, the conversion of the policy is not an event which will release the cash loan value from the effect of the levy. Therefore, X Insurance Company is required to pay to the district director, promptly after receipt of the June 5, 1968 notification, the sum of $1,500.
(d)
Other enforcement proceedings.
The satisfaction of the levy described in paragraph (b) of this section by an insuring organization shall be without prejudice to any civil action for the enforcement of any Federal tax lien with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract. Thus, this levy procedure is not the exclusive means of subjecting the life insurance and endowment contracts of the person against whom a tax is assessed to the collection of his unpaid assessment. The United States may choose to foreclose the tax lien in any case where it is appropriate, as, for example, to reach the cash surrender value (as distinguished from cash loan value) of a life insurance or endowment contract.
(e)

[T.D. 7180, 37 FR 7317, Apr. 13, 1972, as amended by T.D. 8939, 66 FR 2821, Jan. 12, 2001]
§ 301.6332-3
The 21-day holding period applicable to property held by banks.
(a)
In general.
This section provides special rules relating to the surrender, after 21 days, of deposits subject to levy which are held by banks. The provisions of § 301.6332-1 which relate generally to the surrender of property subject to levy apply, to the extent not inconsistent with the special rules set forth in this section, to a levy on property held by banks.
(b)
Definition of bank.
For purposes of this section, the term “bank” means—
(1) A bank or trust company or domestic building and loan association incorporated and doing business under the laws of the United States (including laws relating to the District of Columbia) or of any State, a substantial part of the business of which consists of receiving deposits and making loans and discounts, or of exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks under authority of the Comptroller of the Currency, and which is subject by law to supervision and examination by State or Federal authority having supervision over banking institutions;
(2) Any credit union the member accounts of which are insured in accordance with the provisions of title II of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1781
et seq.;
and
(3) A corporation which, under the laws of the State of its incorporation, is subject to supervision and examination by the Commissioner of Banking or other officer of such State in charge of the administration of the banking laws of such State.
(c)
21-day holding period
—(1)
In general.
When a levy is made on deposits held by a bank, the bank shall surrender such deposits (not otherwise subject to an attachment or execution under judicial process) only after 21 calendar days after the date the levy is made. The district director may request an extension of the 21-day holding period pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section. During the prescribed holding period, or any extension thereof, the levy shall be released only upon notification to the bank by the district director of a decision by the Internal Revenue Service to release the levy. If the bank does not receive such notification from the district director within the prescribed holding period, or any extension thereof, the bank must surrender the deposits, including any interest thereon as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section (up to the amount of the levy), on the first business day after the holding period, or any extension thereof, expires. See § 301.6331-1(c) to determine when a levy served by mail is made.
(2)
Payment of interest on deposits.
When a bank surrenders levied deposits at the end of the 21-day holding period (or at the end of any longer period that has been requested by the district director), the bank must include any interest that has accrued on the deposits prior to and during the holding period, and any extension thereof, under the terms of the bank's agreement with its depositor, but the bank must not surrender an amount greater than the amount of the levy. If the deposits are held in a noninterest bearing account at the time the levy is made, the bank need not include any interest on the deposits at the end of the holding period, or any extension thereof, under this paragraph. Interest that accrues on deposits and is surrendered to the district director at the end of the holding period, or any extension thereof, is treated as a payment to the bank's customer.
(3)
Transactions affecting accounts.
A levy on deposits held by a bank applies to those funds on deposit at the time the levy is made, up to the amount of the levy, and is effective as of the time the levy is made. No withdrawals may be made on levied upon deposits during the 21-day holding period, or any extension thereof.
(4)
Waiver of 21-day holding period.
A depositor may waive the 21-day holding period by notifying the bank of the depositor's intention to do so. Where more than one depositor is listed as the owner of a levied account, all depositors listed as owners of the account must agree to a waiver of the 21-day holding period. If the 21-day holding period is waived, the bank must include with the surrendered deposits a notification to the district director of the waiver.
(5)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On April 2, 1992, a notice of levy for an unpaid income tax assessment due from A in the amount of $10,000 is served on X Bank with respect to A's savings account. At the time the notice of levy is served, X Bank holds $5,000 in A's interest-bearing savings account. On April 24, 1992, (the first business day after the 21-day holding period) X Bank must surrender $5,000 plus any interest that accrued on the account under the terms of A's contract with X Bank up through April 23, 1992, (the last day of the holding period).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that on April 3, 1992, A deposits an additional $5,000 into the account. On April 24, 1992, X Bank must still surrender only $5,000 plus the interest which accrued thereon until the end of the holding period, because the notice of levy served on April 2, 1992, attached only to those funds on deposit at the time the notice was served and not to any subsequent deposits.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that at the time the notice of levy is served on X Bank, A's savings account contains $50,000. On April 24, 1992, X Bank must surrender $10,000, which is the amount of the levy. The levy will not apply to any interest that accrues on the deposit during the 21-day holding period, because the entire amount of the levy is satisfied by the deposits existing at the time the levy is served.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that the amount of the levy is $5,002. Under the terms of A's contract with the bank, the account will earn more than $2 of interest during the 21-day holding period. On April 24, 1992, X Bank must surrender $5,002 to the district director. The remaining interest which accrued during the 21-day holding period is not subject to the levy.

# Example 5.
On September 3, 1992, A opens a $5,000 six-month certificate of deposit account with X Bank. Under the terms of the account, the depositor must forfeit up to 30 days of interest on the account in the event of early withdrawal. On January 4, 1993, a notice of levy for an unpaid income tax assessment due from A in the amount of $10,000 is served with respect to A's certificate of deposit account. On January 26, 1993, the bank must surrender $5,000 plus the interest which accrued on the account through January 25, 1993, minus the penalty of 30 days of interest as provided in the deposit agreement.

# Example 6.
Same facts as in
Example 5
except that the notice of levy is served on X Bank on February 15, 1993. The certificate matures on March 2, 1993. On March 8, X Bank must surrender $5,000 plus the interest that accrued on the certificate without any reduction for penalties.
(d)
Notification to the district director of errors with respect to levied upon bank accounts
—(1)
In general.
If a depositor believes that there is an error with respect to the levied upon account which the depositor wishes to have corrected, the depositor shall notify the district director to whom the assessment is charged by telephone to the telephone number listed on the face of the notice of levy in order to enable the district director to conduct an expeditious review of the alleged error. The district director may require any supporting documentation necessary to the review of the alleged error. The notification by telephone provided for in this section does not constitute or substitute for the filing by a third party of a written request under § 301.6343-1(b)(2) for the return of property wrongfully levied upon.
(2)
Disputes regarding the merits of the underlying assessment.
This section does not constitute an additional procedure for an appeal regarding the merits of an underlying assessment. However, if in the judgment of the district director a genuine dispute regarding the merits of an underlying assessment appears to exist, the district director may request an extension of the 21-day holding period.
(3)
Notification of errors from sources other than the depositor.
The district director may take action to release the levy on the bank account based on information obtained from a source other than the depositor, including the bank in which the account is maintained.
(e)
Effective date.
These provisions are effective with respect to levies issued on or after January 4, 1993.
[T.D. 8466, 58 FR 18, Jan. 4, 1993]
§ 301.6333-1
Production of books.
If a levy has been made or is about to be made on any property or rights to property, any person, having custody or control of any books or records containing evidence or statements relating to the property or rights to property subject to levy, shall, upon demand of the internal revenue officer who has made or is about to make the
levy, exhibit such books or records to such officer.
§ 301.6334-1
Property exempt from levy.
(a)
Enumeration.
In addition to exemptions allowed as a matter of Internal Revenue Service policy, there shall be exempt from levy—
(1)
Wearing apparel and school books.
Such items of wearing apparel and such school books as are necessary for the taxpayer or for members of his family. Expensive items of wearing apparel, such as furs, which are luxuries and are not necessary for the taxpayer or for members of his family, are not exempt from levy.
(2)
Fuel, provisions, furniture, and personal effects.
So much of the fuel, provisions, furniture, and personal effects in the taxpayer's household, and of the arms for personal use, livestock, and poultry of the taxpayer, that does not exceed $6,250 in value.
(3)
Books and tools of a trade, business or profession.
So many of the books and tools necessary for the trade, business, or profession of an individual taxpayer as do not exceed in the aggregate $3,125 in value.
(4)
Unemployment benefits.
Any amount payable to an individual with respect to his unemployment (including any portion thereof payable with respect to dependents) under an unemployment compensation law of the United States, of any State, or of the District of Columbia or of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
(5)
Undelivered mail.
Mail, addressed to any person, which has not been delivered to the addressee.
(6)
Certain annuity and pension payments.
Annuity or pension payments under the Railroad Retirement Act (45 U.S.C. chapter 9), benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (45 U.S.C. chapter 11), special pension payments received by a person whose name has been entered on the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard Medal of Honor roll (38 U.S.C. 562), and annuities based on retired or retainer pay under chapter 73 of title 10 of the United States Code.
(7)
Workmen's compensation.
Any amount payable to an individual as workmen's compensation (including any portion thereof payable with respect to dependents) under a workmen's compensation law of the United States, any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
(8)
Judgments for support of minor children.
If the taxpayer is required under any type of order or decree (including an interlocutory decree or a decree of support pendente lite) of a court of competent jurisdiction, entered prior to the date of levy, to contribute to the support of that taxpayer's minor children, so much of that taxpayer's salary, wages, or other income as is necessary to comply with such order or decree. The taxpayer must establish the amount necessary to comply with the order or decree. The Service is not required to release a levy until such time as it is established that the amount to be released from levy actually will be applied in satisfaction of the support obligation. The Service may make arrangements with a delinquent taxpayer to establish a specific amount of such taxpayer's salary, wage, or other income for each pay period that shall be exempt from levy, for purposes of complying with a support obligation. If the taxpayer has more than one source of income sufficient to satisfy the support obligation imposed by the order or decree, the amount exempt from levy, at the discretion of the Service, may be allocated entirely to one salary, wage or source of other income or be apportioned between the several salaries, wages, or other sources of income.
(9)
Minimum exemption for wages, salary, and other income.
Amounts payable to or received by the taxpayer as wages or salary for personal services, or as other income, to the extent provided in § 301.6334-2 through § 301.6334-4.

(11)
Certain public assistance payments.
Any amount payable to an individual as a recipient of public assistance under—

et seq.
); or
(ii) State or local government public assistance or public welfare programs for which eligibility is determined by a needs or income test.
(12)
Assistance under Job Training Partnership Act.
Any amount payable to a participant under the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1501 et. seq.) from funds appropriated pursuant to such Act.
(13)
Residences exempt in small deficiency cases and principal residences and certain business assets exempt in absence of certain approval or jeopardy
—(i) Residences in small deficiency cases. If the amount of the levy does not exceed $5,000, any real property used as a residence of the taxpayer or any real property of the taxpayer (other than real property which is rented) used by any other individual as a residence.
(ii)
Principal residences and certain business assets.
Except to the extent provided in section 6334(e), the principal residence (within the meaning of section 121) of the taxpayer and tangible personal property or real property (other than real property which is rented) used in the trade or business of an individual taxpayer.
(b)
Appraisal.
The internal revenue officer seizing property of the type described in section 6334(a) shall appraise and set aside to the owner the amount of such property declared to be exempt. If the taxpayer objects at the time of the seizure to the valuation fixed by the officer making the seizure, such officer shall summon three disinterested individuals who shall make the valuation.
(c)
Other property.
No other property or rights to property are exempt from levy except the property specifically exempted by section 6334(a). No provision of a State law may exempt property or rights to property from levy for the collection of any Federal tax. Thus, property exempt from execution under State personal or homestead exemption laws is, nevertheless, subject to levy by the United States for collection of its taxes.
(d)
Levy allowed on principal residence.
The Service will seek approval, in writing, by a judge or magistrate of a district court of the United States prior to levy of property that is owned by the taxpayer and used as the principal residence of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, the taxpayer's former spouse, or the taxpayer's minor child.
(1)
Nature of judicial proceeding.
The Government will initiate a proceeding for judicial approval of levy on a principal residence by filing a petition with the appropriate United States District Court demonstrating that the underlying liability has not been satisfied, the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure relevant to the levy have been met, and no reasonable alternative for collection of the taxpayer's debt exists. The petition will ask the court to issue to the taxpayer an order to show cause why the principal residence property should not be levied and will also ask the court to issue a notice of hearing.
(2) The taxpayer will be granted a hearing to rebut the Government's prima facie case if the taxpayer files an objection within the time period required by the court raising a genuine issue of material fact demonstrating that the underlying tax liability has been satisfied, that the taxpayer has other assets from which the liability can be satisfied, or that the Service did not follow the applicable laws or procedures pertaining to the levy. The taxpayer is not permitted to challenge the merits underlying the tax liability in the proceeding. Unless the taxpayer files a timely and appropriate objection, the court would be expected to
enter an order approving the levy of the principal residence property.
(3)
Notice letter to be issued to certain family members.
If the property to be levied is owned by the taxpayer but is used as the principal residence of the taxpayer's spouse, the taxpayer's former spouse, or the taxpayer's minor child, the Government will send a letter to each such person providing notice of the commencement of the proceeding. The letter will be addressed in the name of the taxpayer's spouse or ex-spouse, individually or on behalf of any minor children. If it is unclear who is living in the principal residence property and/or what such person's relationship is to the taxpayer, a letter will be addressed to “Occupant”. The purpose of the letter is to provide notice to the family members that the property may be levied. The family members may not be joined as parties to the judicial proceeding because the levy attaches only to the taxpayer's legal interest in the subject property and the family members have no legal standing to contest the proposed levy.
(e)
Levy allowed on certain business assets.
The property described in section 6334(a)(13)(B)(ii) shall not be exempt from levy if—
(1) An Area Director of the Service personally approves (in writing) the levy of such property; or
(2) The Secretary finds that the collection of tax is in jeopardy. An Area Director may not approve a levy under paragraph (e)(1) unless the Area Director determines that the taxpayer's other assets subject to collection are insufficient to pay the amount due, together with expenses of the proceeding. When other assets of an individual taxpayer include permits issued by a State and required under State law for the harvest of fish or wildlife in the taxpayer's trade or business, the taxpayer's other assets also include future income that may be derived by such taxpayer from the commercial sale of fish or wildlife under such permit.
(f)
Levy allowed on certain specified payments.
Any payment described in section 6331(h)(2)(B) or (C) shall not be exempt from levy if the Secretary approves the levy thereon under section 6331(h).
(g)
Inflation adjustment.
For any calendar year beginning after 1999, each dollar amount referred to in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section will be increased by an amount equal to the dollar amount multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year (using the language “calendar year 1998” instead of “calendar year 1992” in section 1(f)(3)(B)). If any dollar amount as adjusted is not a multiple of $10, the dollar amount will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10 (rounding up if the amount is a multiple of $5).
(h)
Effective date.
This section is generally effective with respect to levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt by a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by the regulations in this section prior to February 21, 1995, will be considered as meeting the requirements of the regulations in this section. In addition, paragraph (a)(11)(i) of this section is applicable with respect to levies issued after December 31, 1996. Paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(8), (a)(13), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of this section apply as of March 7, 2005.
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7180, 37 FR 7319, Apr. 13, 1972; T.D. 7182, 37 FR 7887, Apr. 21, 1972; T.D. 7620, 44 FR 27988, May 14, 1979; T.D. 8568, 59 FR 53088, Oct. 21, 1994; T.D. 8725, 62 FR 39117, July 22, 1997; T.D. 9189, 70 FR 10885, Mar. 7, 2005]
§ 301.6334-2
Wages, salary, and other income.
(a)
In general.
Under section 6334 (a)(9) and (d) certain amounts payable to or received by a taxpayer as wages, salary, or other income are exempt from levy. This section describes the income of a taxpayer that is eligible for the exemption from levy (paragraph (b) of this section) and how exempt amounts are to be paid to the taxpayer (paragraph (c) of this section). Section 301.6334-3 describes that sum that will be exempt from levy for each of the taxpayer's pay periods. Pay periods are described in § 301.6334-3. For the amounts exempt from levy, see § 301.6334-3.
(b)
Eligible taxpayer income.
Only wages, salary, or other income payable to the taxpayer after the levy is made
on the payor may be exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). No amount of wages, salary, or other income that is paid to the taxpayer before levy is made on the payor will be so exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Delinquent taxpayer A, an individual, is employed by the M Corporation and is paid wages on Friday of each week. Accordingly, A is paid wages on Friday, February 16, 1990. On Saturday, February 17, A deposits these wages into his personal checking account at Bank N. On Tuesday, February 20, a notice of levy is served on the M Corporation and also on Bank N. Amounts payable to A as wages on Friday, February 23, 1990, and any payday thereafter may be exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). No amount of wages A deposited in his account at Bank N on February 17, 1990, is exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9).
(c)
Payment of exempt amounts to taxpayer
—(1)
From wages, salary, or income from other sources where levy on all sources not made.
In the case of a taxpayer who has more than one source of wages, salary, or other income, the district director may elect to levy on only one or more sources while leaving other sources of income free from levy. If the wages, salary, or other income that the district director leaves free from levy equal or exceed the amount to which the taxpayer is entitled as an exemption from levy under section 6334(a)(9), computed in accordance with § 301.6334-3 (and are not otherwise exempt), the district director may treat no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income on which the district director elects to levy as exempt from levy. In such a case, the district director must notify the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served that no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income is exempt from levy. The employer or other person upon whom the levy is served may rely on such notification in paying over amounts pursuant to the levy. In the absence of such notification from the district director, however, the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served must determine the amount exempt from levy pursuant to § 301.6334-3 as if that employer or other person upon whom the levy is served is the only source of wages, salary, or other income. Amounts not exempt from levy are to be paid to the district director in accordance with the terms of the levy. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(1) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Delinquent taxpayer C is an employee of O Corporation and is paid wages totalling $450 on Friday of each week. C also performs services for P Corporation and is paid a salary of $250 on Friday of each week. On Tuesday, February 20, 1990, a levy is served on O Corporation with respect to the wages payable to C. A levy is not served on P Corporation. C's filing status is single and C is entitled to 1 personal exemption. Under § 301.6334-3, C is entitled to an exemption from levy under 6334(a)(9) totalling $101.92 for each weekly pay period. However, because levy has not been made on C's salary paid by the P Corporation ($250 per week) and that salary exceeds the weekly amount ($101.92) to which C is entitled as exempt from levy, the district director may treat no amount of C's wages paid by the O Corporation as exempt from levy. If the district director requires such treatment, the district director must notify O Corporation that no amount of C's wages is exempt from levy and O Corporation may rely on such notification; in the absence of such notification O Corporation must treat $101.92 as exempt from levy.
(2)
Where sources not levied upon are less than exempt amount.
If the taxpayer's income upon which the district director does not levy is less than the amount to which the taxpayer is entitled as exempt from levy, then an additional amount, determined to be exempt from levy pursuant to § 301.6334-3, may be paid to the taxpayer from the sources of wages, salary, or other income upon which levy has been made. In such a case, the district director must designate those wages, salary, or other income from which the exempt amount is to be paid to the taxpayer, and must notify the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served of the amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income that is exempt from levy. The employer or other person may rely on such notification in paying over amounts pursuant to the levy. In the absence of such notification from the district director, the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served must determine the amount exempt from levy pursuant to § 301.6334-3 as if that employer or other
person upon whom the levy is served is the only source of wages, salary, or other income. Amounts not exempt from levy are to be paid to the district director in accordance with the terms of the levy. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(2) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Delinquent taxpayer C is an employee of O Corporation and is paid wages totalling $50 on Friday of each week. C also performs services for P Corporation and is paid a salary of $75 on Friday of each week. On Tuesday, February 20, 1990, a levy is served on P Corporation with respect to the wages and salary of C. C's filing status is single and C is entitled to 1 personal exemption. Under § 301.6334-3, C is entitled to an exemption from levy under section 6334(a)(9) totalling $101.92 for each weekly pay period. The district director may notify P Corporation that only $51.92 of C's wages is exempt from levy and P Corporation may rely on such notification; in the absence of such notification, P Corporation must treat the entire $75 salary as exempt from levy.
(d)
Effective date.
These provisions are effective with respect to levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt by a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the requirements of these regulations.
[T.D. 8568, 59 FR 53088, Oct. 21, 1994]
§ 301.6334-3
Determination of exempt amount.
(a)
Individuals paid on weekly basis.
In the case of any individual who is paid or receives all of his or her wages, salary, and other income on a weekly basis, the amount of wages, salary, and other income payable to or received by him or her during any week that is exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9) is the exempt amount.
(b)
Term defined.
The term
exempt amount
means an amount equal to—
(1) The sum of—
(i) The standard deduction (including additional standard deductions on account of age or blindness); and
(ii) The aggregate amount of the deductions for personal exemptions allowed the taxpayer under section 151 in the taxable year in which such levy occurs;
(2) Divided by 52.
(c)
Written and properly verified statement.
Unless the taxpayer submits to the employer for forwarding to the district director a written and properly verified statement (as described in § 301.6334-4) specifying the facts necessary to determine the proper amount under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section must be applied as if the taxpayer were a married individual filing a separate return with only 1 personal exemption.
(d)
Individuals paid on basis other than weekly
—(1)
In general.
In the case of an individual who is paid or receives wages, salary, and other income other than on a weekly basis, the amount payable to that individual during any applicable pay period that is exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9) is the amount that as nearly as possible will result in the same total exemption from levy for such individual over that period of time other than weekly as that to which the individual would have been entitled under paragraph (b) of this section if, during such period of time, the individual were paid or received such wages, salary, and other income on a regular weekly basis.
(2)
Specific pay periods other than weekly.
In the case of wages, salary, or other income paid to an individual on the basis of an established calendar period regularly used by the employer or other person levied upon for payroll or payment purposes, the exempt amount of wages, salary, and other income payable to or received by an individual during an applicable pay period other than weekly equals—
(i) The sum of—
(A) The standard deduction (including additional standard deductions on account of age or blindness); and
(B) The aggregate amount of the deductions for personal exemptions allowed the taxpayer under section 151 in the taxable year in which such levy occurs;
(ii) Divided by—
(A) 260 in the case of a daily pay period;
(B) 26 in the case of a bi-weekly pay period;
(C) 24 in the case of a semi-monthly pay period; and
(D) 12 in the case of a monthly pay period.
(3)
Nonspecific pay periods.
In the case of wages, salary, or other income paid to an individual on a one-time or a recurrent but irregular basis and which is not paid on the basis of an established calendar period regularly used by the employer or other person levied upon for payroll or payment purposes, the exempt amount of wages, salary, and other income payable to or received by an individual equals the exempt amount defined in paragraph (b) of this section multiplied by the number (but not more than 52) of full weeks (consisting of seven calendar days) to which such payment is attributable. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(3) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Taxpayer A's exempt amount per week (as determined under paragraph (b) of this section) is $100. Taxpayer A is hired by Corporation X to perform a specific task for Corporation X at a flat fee of $1,500 which is to be paid at the completion of the task. Taxpayer A completes the task in 10 weeks. The total exempt amount is $1,000 and $500 is subject to levy.
(e)
Levies continuing into following years.
The exempt amount is computed on the basis of the standard deduction (including additional standard deductions on account of age or blindness) for the taxpayer's filing status and the amount of the deduction for a personal exemption in effect in the taxable year in which the original notice of levy is served. Unless the taxpayer submits a new verified statement in accordance with § 301.6334-4, the exempt amount remains the same for pay periods following the pay period in which the notice of levy is served even if there is a change in the taxpayer's factual situation or a change by operation of law (such as by indexing or otherwise) to the standard deduction or personal exemption amounts.
(f)
Effective date.
These provisions are effective with respect to levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt by a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the requirements of these regulations.
[T.D. 8568, 59 FR 53089, Oct. 21, 1994]
§ 301.6334-4
Verified statements.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of §§ 301.6334-2 and 301.6334-3, the amount of wages, salary, or other income that is exempt from levy must be determined on the basis of a written and properly verified statement submitted by the taxpayer to his or her employer for submission to the district director specifying the facts necessary to determine the standard deduction and the aggregate amount of the deductions for personal exemptions allowed the taxpayer under section 151 in the taxable year in which the levy is served. In the absence of submission of such statement, the amount that is exempt from levy must be determined as if the taxpayer were a married individual filing a separate return with only 1 personal exemption.
(b)
Content of statement.
The statement in paragraph (a) of this section must be a written statement signed under penalty of perjury, and dated, containing the following information—
(1) The filing status of the taxpayer as either:
(i) Single;
(ii) Married filing a joint return;
(iii) Married filing a separate return;
(iv) Head of household; or
(v) Qualifying widow or widower with dependent child;
(2) The name, relationship, and Social Security Number of each individual whom the taxpayer can claim as a personal exemption on the taxpayer's income tax return; and
(3) Any additional standard deductions that the taxpayer can claim on account of age (65 or older) or blindness on the taxpayer's income tax return.
(c)
Submission of verified statement
—(1)
Obligation of employer.
An employer upon whom a notice of levy for wages, salary, or other income of a taxpayer is served must promptly notify the taxpayer of the fact that a notice of levy has been served. Unless otherwise indicated on the face of the notice of levy, the employer must request the taxpayer to provide the employer with a written statement signed under penalty of perjury, and dated, containing
the information set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and this statement must be submitted by the employer to the district director. The employer must submit this statement to the district director at the time the employer first responds to the notice of levy.
(2)
Submission by taxpayer.
The taxpayer must provide the employer upon whom the notice of levy has been served with a verified statement complying with paragraph (b) of this section. Unless the taxpayer provides a verified statement, the amount that is exempt from levy must be determined as if the taxpayer were a married individual filing a separate return with only 1 personal exemption.
(3)
Additional statements.
A taxpayer may submit a verified statement to his or her employer at any time. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, such verified statement will be effective for any payment of wages, salary, or other income made after the date of submission and will replace any previously submitted verified statement. The employer must provide the district director with the statement on the next occasion on which the employer responds to the notice of levy.
(d)
Effect of verified statement
—(1) A verified statement submitted by an employee is effective upon receipt by the employer, and the employer is required to compute the exempt amount on the basis of the information contained in the verified statement unless notified to the contrary by the Internal Revenue Service.
(2) The Internal Revenue Service may find that a verified statement submitted by an employee contains a materially incorrect statement, or it may determine, after written request to the employee for verification of information contained in the verified statement, that it lacks sufficient information to determine whether the verified statement is correct. If the Internal Revenue Service so finds or determines, and notifies the employer in writing that the verified statement is defective, upon receipt of such notice the employer shall consider the verified statement to be defective for purposes of computing the exempt amount.
(3) If the Internal Revenue Service notifies the employer that the verified statement is defective, the Internal Revenue Service will, based upon its finding, advise the employer that the employer is to compute the exempt amount as if no verified statement had been submitted by the employee or will describe upon what basis the exempt amount is to be computed. The Internal Revenue Service will also specify which Internal Revenue Service office to contact for further information.
(4) In addition to any notice furnished to the employer for the employer's use, the Internal Revenue Service will provide the employer with a copy for the employee of each notice it furnishes the employer.
(5) The employer must promptly furnish the employee with a copy of any Internal Revenue Service notice with respect to a verified statement submitted by the employee.
(6) Once paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies, the employer must continue to compute the exempt amount on the basis of the written notice from the Internal Revenue Service until the Internal Revenue Service by written notice advises the employer to compute the exempt amount on the basis of a new verified statement (as described in paragraph (d)(7) of this section) and revokes its earlier written notice.
(7) Once paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies, the employee may submit a new verified statement together with a written explanation of any circumstances of the employee which have changed since the Internal Revenue Service's earlier written notice, or any other circumstances or reasons as justification or support for the claims made by the employee on the new verified statement. The employee may submit the new verified statement and written explanation either—
(i) To the Internal Revenue Service office specified in the notice furnished to the employer under paragraph (d)(3) of this section; or
(ii) To the employer, who must forward the new verified statement and written explanation to the Internal Revenue Service office specified in the notice earlier furnished to the employer on the next occasion on which
the employer responds to the notice of levy.
(e)
Effective date.
These provisions are effective with respect to levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt by a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the requirements of these regulations.

§ 301.6335-1
Sale of seized property.
(a)
In general.
Section 6335 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and this section provide the rules under which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) conducts sales of property seized by levy.
(b)
Notice of seizure
—(1)
Issuance and delivery.
As soon as practicable after seizure of property, the IRS must give written notice to the property's owner (or, in the case of personal property, to the property's possessor). The written notice must be delivered to the owner (or to the possessor, in the case of personal property) or left at the owner's usual place of abode or business if there is such within the internal revenue district in which the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily located or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, the notice may be mailed to the owner's last known address. For purposes of this section, the term
internal revenue district
means an internal revenue district within the meaning of section 7621 of the Code and includes an IRS field collection territory or other successor IRS subdivision or office.
(2)
Contents.
The notice of seizure must specify the sum demanded and contain, in the case of personal property, a list sufficient to identify the property seized and, in the case of real property, a description with reasonable certainty of the property seized.
(c)
Notice of sale
—(1)
In general.
As soon as practicable after seizure of the property, the IRS must give notice of sale in writing to the owner. Such notice will be delivered to the owner or left at the owner's usual place of abode or business if located within the internal revenue district in which the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily located or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, the notice may be mailed to the owner's last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address,
see
§ 301.6212-2. The notice must specify the property to be sold, and the time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale thereof, and must expressly state that only the right, title, and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to such property is to be offered for sale. The notice will also be published in some newspaper published in the county wherein the seizure is made or in a newspaper generally circulated in that county. For example, if a newspaper of general circulation in a county but not published in that county will reach more potential bidders for the property to be sold than a newspaper published within the county, or if there is a newspaper of general circulation within the county but no newspaper published within the county, the IRS may publish the notice of sale in the newspaper of general circulation within the county. If there is no newspaper published or generally circulated in the county, the notice will be posted at the post office nearest the place where the seizure is made, to the extent authorized under law, and in not less than two other public places.
(2)
Alternative methods.
The IRS may use other methods of giving notice of sale and of advertising seized property, in addition to those referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the IRS believes that the nature of the seized property to be sold is such that a wider or more specialized advertising coverage will enhance the possibility of obtaining a higher price for the seized property.
(3)
Exception.
Whenever levy is made without regard to the 10-day period provided in section 6331(a) (relating to cases in which collection is in jeopardy), a public notice of sale of the property seized shall not be made within such 10-day period unless section 6336 (relating to perishable goods) is applicable.
(d)
Time, place, manner, and conditions of sale.
The time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale of property seized by levy shall be as follows:
(1)
Time and place of sale.
The sale will be held at the time and place stated in the notice of sale. The time of sale will not be less than 10 days nor more than 40 days from the time of giving public notice under section 6335(b) of the Code and paragraph (c) of this section. The place of an in-person sale will be within the county in which the property is seized, except such sale may be held at a place outside that county if the IRS determines, by special order of a delegated official, that substantially higher bids may be obtained for the property by holding the sale in such other county. The place of an online sale will generally be the county in which the property is seized. If, based on the facts and circumstances, the IRS determines that the place of an online sale is not within the county in which the property is seized, the sale may be conducted online by special order when doing so would be more efficient or would likely result in more competitive bids.
(2)
Adjournment of sale.
When it appears that an adjournment of the sale will best serve the interest of the United States or that of the taxpayer, the IRS may adjourn the sale from time to time, but the date of the sale will not be later than one month after the date fixed in the original notice of sale.
(3)
Determinations relating to minimum price
—(i)
Minimum price.
Before the sale of property seized by levy, the IRS will determine a minimum price, taking into account the expenses of levy and sale, for which the property must be sold. The IRS will either announce the minimum price before the sale begins or defer announcement of the minimum price until after the receipt of the highest bid, in which case, if the highest bid is greater than the minimum price, no announcement of the minimum price will be made.
(ii)
Purchase by the United States.
Before the sale of seized property, the IRS will determine whether the purchase of the property by the United States at the minimum price would be in the best interest of the United States. In determining whether the purchase of the property would be in the best interest of the United States, the IRS may consider all relevant facts and circumstances including, for example—
(A) Marketability of property;
(B) Cost of maintaining the property;
(C) Cost of repairing or restoring the property;
(D) Cost of transporting the property;
(E) Cost of safeguarding the property;
(F) Cost of potential toxic waste cleanup; and
(G) Other factors pertinent to the type of property.
(4)
Disposition of property at sale
—(i)
Sale to highest bidder at or above minimum price.
If one or more persons offer to buy the property for at least the amount of the minimum price, the property shall be sold to the highest bidder.
(ii)
Property deemed sold to United States at minimum price.
If no one offers at least the amount of the minimum price for the property and the Secretary has determined that it would be in the best interest of the United States to purchase the property for the minimum price, the property shall be declared to be sold to the United States for the minimum price.
(iii)
Release to owner.
If the property is not declared to be sold under paragraph (d)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, the property will be released to the owner of the property and the expense of the levy and sale will be added to the amount of tax for the collection of which the United States made the levy. Any property released under this paragraph (d)(4)(iii) will remain subject to any lien imposed by subchapter C of chapter 64 of subtitle F of the Code.
(5)
Offering of property
—(i)
Sale of indivisible property.
If any property levied upon is not divisible, so as to enable the IRS by sale of a part thereof to raise the whole amount of the tax and expenses of levy and sale, the whole of such property will be sold. For application of surplus proceeds of sale,
see
section 6342(b) of the Code.
(ii)
Separately, in groups, or in the aggregate.
The IRS, in selecting how seized property will be offered for sale, will consider which method is likely to produce the highest total sales price as well as which method is most feasible. The seized property may be offered for sale—
(A) As separate items,
(B) As groups of items,
(C) In the aggregate, or
(D) Both as separate items (or in groups) and in the aggregate, in which case, the property will be sold under the method that produces the highest aggregate amount.
(iii)
Condition of title and of property.
Only the right, title, and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to the property seized shall be offered for sale, and such interest shall be offered subject to any prior outstanding mortgages, encumbrances, or other liens in favor of third parties which are valid as against the delinquent taxpayer and are superior to the lien of the United States. All seized property shall be offered for sale “as is” and “where is” and without recourse against the United States. No guaranty or warranty, express or implied, shall be made by the internal revenue officer offering the property for sale, as to the validity of the title, quality, quantity, weight, size, or condition of any of the property, or its fitness for any use or purpose. No claim shall be considered for allowance or adjustment or for rescission of the sale based upon failure of the property to conform with any representation, express or implied.
(iv)
Terms of payment.
The property will be offered for sale in accordance with whichever of the following terms is fixed by the IRS in the public notice of sale:
(A) Payment in full upon acceptance of the highest bid, or
(B) An initial payment upon acceptance of the highest bid if the payment is in the amount (either the dollar amount or the percentage of the purchase price) specified in the notice of sale and followed by payment of the balance (including all costs incurred for the protection or preservation of the property subsequent to the sale and prior to final payment) within a specified period, not to exceed one month from the date of the sale.
(6)
Method of sale and sale procedures.
The IRS will sell the property either at a public auction (at which open competitive bids will be received) or at a public sale under sealed bids.
(i)
Invitation to bidders.
Bids will be solicited through a public notice of sale.
(ii)
Form for use by bidders.
A bid must be submitted in the manner specified by the IRS in the notice of sale or in instructions referenced by that notice.
(iii)
Remittance with bid.
The notice of sale, or instructions referenced in the notice, will specify the initial payment amount, acceptable forms of the remittance (such as check, credit or debit card, electronic payment, or other means), and the address (physical or online) at which the bid and remittance must be submitted.
(iv)
Time for receiving bids.
A bid will not be considered unless it is received in the manner and before the time specified in the notice of sale, instructions referenced in the notice, or in the announcement of the adjournment of the sale.
(v)
Consideration of bids.
The public notice of sale will specify whether the property is to be sold separately, by groups, or in the aggregate, or by a combination of these methods, as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section. If the notice, or instructions referenced in the notice, specifies an alternative method, bidders may submit bids under one or more of the alternatives. In case of error in computing the total price of a group of property in any bid, the unit price of each piece of property will control. The IRS has the right to waive any technical defects in a bid. A technical defect in a bid is deemed waived if the IRS treats it as the winning bid. In the event two or more highest bids are equal in amount, the IRS will reopen the bidding until a high bid is submitted without any ties. After the opening, examination, and consideration of all bids, the IRS will announce the amount of the highest bid or bids and the name of the successful bidder or bidders. Any remittance submitted in connection with an unsuccessful bid will be returned at the conclusion of the sale.
(vi)
Withdrawal of bids.
A bid may be withdrawn only in the manner specified in the notice of sale or in instructions referenced in the notice. A technical defect in a bid confers no right on the bidder for the withdrawal of the bid after it has been opened or accepted.
(7)
Payment of bid price.
All payments for property sold under this section must be made in the form and manner
(whether by check, credit or debit card, electronic payment, or other means) specified by the IRS in the public notice of sale or in instructions referenced in the notice. If payment in full is required upon acceptance of the highest bid, the payment must be made at the time and in accordance with the terms specified in the notice of sale. If deferred payment is permitted, the initial payment must be made upon acceptance of the bid at the time and in accordance with the terms specified in the notice of sale, and the balance must be paid on or before the date fixed for payment thereof. Any remittance submitted with a successful bid will be applied toward the purchase price.
(8)
Delivery and removal of personal property.
Responsibility of the United States for the protection or preservation of seized personal property shall cease immediately upon acceptance of the highest bid. The risk of loss is on the purchaser of personal property upon acceptance of his bid. Possession of any personal property shall not be delivered to the purchaser until the purchase price has been paid in full. If payment of part of the purchase price for personal property is deferred, the United States will retain possession of such property as security for the payment of the balance of the purchase price and, as agent for the purchaser, will cause the property to be cared for until the purchase price has been paid in full or the sale is declared null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price. In such case, all charges and expenses incurred in caring for the property after the acceptance of the bid shall be borne by the purchaser.
(9)
Default in payment.
If payment in full is required upon acceptance of the bid and is not paid when due, the IRS will proceed again to sell the property in the manner provided in section 6335(e) of the Code and this section. If the conditions of the sale permit part of the payment to be deferred, and if such part is not paid within the prescribed period, suit may be instituted against the purchaser for the purchase price or such part thereof as has not been paid, together with interest at the rate of six percent per annum from the date of the sale; or, in the discretion of the IRS, the sale may be declared null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price and the property may again be advertised and sold as provided in section 6335(b), (c), and (e) of the Code and this section. In the event of such readvertisement and sale, any new purchaser will receive such property or rights to property free and clear of any claim or right of the former defaulting purchaser, of any nature whatsoever, and the amount paid upon the bid price by such defaulting purchaser will be forfeited to the United States.
(10)
Stay of sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision.
For restrictions on sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision, see section 6863(b)(3) and § 301.6863-2.
(11)
Participation in sale by revenue officers.
No revenue officer who seized the property to be sold at a sale conducted under section 6335 of the Code and this section may participate in the sale of that seized property. This restriction does not apply to sales of perishable goods conducted under section 6336 of the Code.
(e)
Right to request the sale of seized property
—(1)
In general.
The owner of any property seized by levy may request that the IRS sell such property within 60 days after such request, or within any longer period specified by the owner. The IRS must comply with such a request unless it determines that compliance with the request is not in its best interests. If the IRS decides not to comply with the request, it must notify the owner of the determination within the 60-day period, or any longer period specified by the owner.
(2)
Procedures to request the sale of seized property
—(i)
Manner.
A request for the sale of seized property shall be made in writing to the group manager of the revenue officer whose signature is on Levy Form 668-B. If the owner does not know the group manager's name or address, the owner may send the request to the revenue officer, marked for the attention of his or her group manager.
(ii)
Form.
The request for sale of seized property within 60 days, or such longer period specified by the owner, shall include:
(A) The name, current address, current home and work telephone numbers and any convenient times to be contacted, and taxpayer identification number of the owner making the request;
(B) A description of the seized property that is the subject of the request;
(C) A copy of the notice of seizure, if available;
(D) The period within which the owner is requesting that the property be sold; and
(E) The signature of the owner or duly authorized representative. For purposes of these regulations, a duly authorized representative is any attorney, certified public accountant, enrolled actuary, or any other person permitted to represent the owner before the Internal Revenue Service who is not disbarred or suspended from practice before the Internal Revenue Service and who has written power of attorney executed by the owner.
(3)
Notification to owner.
The IRS will respond in writing to a request for sale of seized property as soon as practicable after receipt of such request and in no event later than 60 days after receipt of the request, or, if later, the date specified by the owner for the sale.
(f)
Applicability date.
The rules of this section apply to sales of property seized on or after November 5, 2024.
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7180, 37 FR 7319, Apr. 13, 1972; T.D. 8398, 57 FR 7546, Mar. 3, 1992; T.D. 8691, 61 FR 66217, Dec. 17, 1996; T.D. 8939, 66 FR 2821, Jan. 12, 2001; T.D. 10011,89 FR 87785, Nov. 5, 2024]
§ 301.6336-1
Sale of perishable goods.
(a)
Appraisal of certain seized property.
If the district director determines that any property seized by levy is liable to perish or become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping, or that such property cannot be kept without great expense, he shall appraise the value of such property and return it to the owner if the owner complies with the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section or, if the owner does not comply with such conditions, dispose of the property in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Return to owner.
If the owner of the property can be readily found, the district director shall give him written notice of his determination of the appraised value of the property. However, if the district director determines that the circumstances require immediate action, he may give the owner an oral notice of his determination of the appraised value of the property, which notice shall be confirmed in writing prior to sale. The property shall be returned to the owner if, within the time specified in the notice, the owner—
(1) Pays to the district director an amount equal to the appraised value, or
(2) Gives an acceptable bond as prescribed by section 7101 and § 301.7101-1. Such bond shall be in an amount not less than the appraised value of the property and shall be conditioned upon the payment of such amount at such time as the district director determines to be appropriate in the circumstances.
(c)
Immediate sale.
If the owner does not pay the amount of the appraised value of the seized property within the time specified in the notice, or furnish bond as provided in paragraph (b) of this section within such time, the district director shall as soon as practicable make public sale of the property in accordance with the following terms and conditions—
(1)
Notice of sale.
If the owner can readily be found, a notice shall be given to him. A notice of sale also shall be posted in two public places in the county in which the property is to be sold. The notice shall specify the time and place of sale, the property to be sold, and the manner and conditions of sale. The district director may give such other notice and in such other manner as he deems advisable under the circumstances.
(2)
Sale.
The property shall be sold at public auction to the highest bidder.
(3)
Terms.
The purchase price shall be paid in full upon acceptance of the highest bid. The payment shall be made in cash, or by a certified, cashier's or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order.
§ 301.6337-1
Redemption of property.
(a)
Before sale.
Any person whose property has been levied upon shall have the right to pay the amount due, together with costs and expenses of the proceeding, if any, to the district director at any time prior to the sale of the property. Upon such payment the district director shall restore such property to the owner and all further proceedings in connection with the levy on such property shall cease from the time of such payment.
(b)
Redemption of real estate after sale
—(1)
Period.
The owner of any real estate sold as provided in section 6335, his heirs, executors, or administrators, or any person having any interest therein, or a lien thereon, or any person in their behalf, shall be permitted to redeem the property sold, or any particular tract of such property, at any time within 120 days after the sale thereof.
(2)
Price.
Such property or tract of property may be redeemed upon payment to the purchaser, or in case he cannot be found in the county in which the property to be redeemed is situated, then to the district director for the internal revenue district in which the property is situated, for the use of the purchaser, his heirs, or assigns, the amount paid by such purchaser and interest thereon at the rate of 20 percent per annum. In case real and personal property (or several tracts of real property) are purchased in the aggregate, the redemption price of the real property (or of each of the several tracts) shall be determined on the basis of the ratio, as of the time of sale, of the value of the real property (or tract) to the value of the total property purchased. For this purpose the minimum price or the highest bid price, whichever is higher, offered for the property separately or in groups shall be treated as the value.
(c)
Record.
When any real property is redeemed, the district director shall cause entry of the fact to be made upon the record of sale kept in accordance with section 6340, and such entry shall be evidence of such redemption. The party who redeems the property shall notify the district director of the internal revenue district in which the property is situated of the date of such redemption and of the transfer of the certificate of sale, the amount of the redemption price, and the name of the party to whom such redemption price was paid.
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7180, 37 FR 7319, Apr. 13, 1972]
§ 301.6338-1
Certificate of sale; deed of real property.
(a)
Certificate of sale.
In the case of property sold as provided in section 6335 (relating to sale of seized property), the district director shall give to the purchaser a certificate of sale upon payment in full of the purchase price. A certificate of sale of real property shall set forth the real property purchased, for whose taxes the same was sold, the name of the purchaser, and the price paid therefor.
(b)
Deed to real property.
In the case of any real property sold as provided in section 6335 and not redeemed in the manner and within the time prescribed in section 6337, the district director shall execute (in accordance with the laws of the State in which the real property is situated pertaining to sales of real property under execution) to the purchaser of such real property at the sale or his assigns, upon surrender of the certificate of sale, a deed of the real property so purchased, reciting the facts set forth in the certificate.
(c)
Deed to real property purchased by the United States.
If real property is declared purchased by the United States at a sale pursuant to section 6335, the district director shall at the proper time execute a deed therefor and shall, without delay, cause the deed to be duly recorded in the proper registry of deeds.
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7180, 37 FR 7319, Apr. 13, 1972]
§ 301.6339-1
Legal effect of certificate of sale of personal property and deed of real property.
(a)
Certificate of sale of property other than real property.
In all cases of sale pursuant to section 6335 of property (other than real property), the certificate of such sale—
(1)
As evidence.
Shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the officer to
make such sale, and conclusive evidence of the regularity of his proceedings in making the sale; and
(2)
As conveyance.
Shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title, and interest of the party delinquent in and to the property sold; and
(3)
As authority for transfer of corporate stock.
If such property consists of corporate stocks, shall be notice, when received, to any corporation, company, or association of such transfer, and shall be authority to such corporation, company, or association to record the transfer on its books and records in the same manner as if the stocks were transferred or assigned by the party holding the stock certificate, in lieu of any original or prior certificate, which shall be void, whether canceled or not; and
(4)
As receipts.
If the subject of sale is securities or other evidences of debt, shall be a good and valid receipt to the person holding the certificate of sale as against any person holding or claiming to hold possession of such securities or other evidences of debt; and
(5)
As authority for transfer of title to motor vehicle.
If such property consists of a motor vehicle, shall be notice, when received, to any public official charged with the registration of title to motor vehicles, of such transfer and shall be authority to such official to record the transfer on his books and records in the same manner as if the certificate of title to such motor vehicle were transferred or assigned by the party holding the certificate of title, in lieu of any original or prior certificate, which shall be null and void, whether canceled or not.
(b)
Deed to real property.
In the case of the sale of real property pursuant to section 6335—
(1)
Deed as evidence.
The deed of sale given pursuant to section 6338 shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated; and
(2)
Deed as conveyance of title.
If the proceedings of the district director as set forth have been substantially in accordance with the provisions of law, such deed shall be considered and operate as a conveyance of all the right, title, and interest the party delinquent had in and to the real property thus sold at the time the lien of the United States attached thereto.
(c)
Effect of junior encumbrances.
A certificate of sale of personal property given or a deed to real property executed pursuant to section 6338 discharges the property from all liens, encumbrances, and titles over which the lien of the United States, with respect to which the levy was made, has priority. For example, a mortgage on real property executed after a notice of a Federal tax lien has been filed is extinguished when the district director executes a deed to the real property to a purchaser thereof at a sale pursuant to section 6335 following the seizure of the property by the United States. The proceeds of such a sale are distributed in accordance with priority of the liens, encumbrances, or titles. See section 6342(b) and the regulations thereunder for provisions relating to the distribution of surplus proceeds. See section 7426(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder for judicial procedures with respect to surplus proceeds.
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7180, 37 FR 7320, Apr. 13, 1972]
§ 301.6340-1

The records shall set forth (1) the tax for which any such sale was made, the dates of seizure and sale, the name of the party assessed and all proceedings in making such sale, the amount of expenses, the names of the purchasers, the date of the deed, and, in the case of redemption of the property, (2) the date of such redemption and of the transfer of the certificate of sale, the amount of the redemption price, and the name of the party to whom such redemption price was paid.
(b)

A copy of such record, or any part thereof, certified by the district director shall be evidence in any court of the truth of the facts therein stated.
§ 301.6341-1
Expense of levy and sale.
The district director shall determine the expenses to be allowed in all cases of levy and sale. Such expenses shall
include the expenses of protection and preservation of the property during the period subsequent to the levy, as well as the actual expenses incurred in connection with the sale thereof. In case real and personal property (or several tracts of real property) are sold in the aggregate, the district director shall properly apportion the expenses to the real property (or to each tract).
§ 301.6342-1
Application of proceeds of levy.
(a)
Collection of liability.
Any money realized by proceedings under subchapter D, chapter 64, of the Code or by sale of property redeemed by the United States (if the interest of the United States in the property was a lien arising under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code), is applied in the manner specified in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph (a). Money realized by proceedings under subchapter D, chapter 64, of the Code includes money realized by seizure, by sale of seized property, or by surrender under section 6332 (except money realized by the imposition of a 50 percent penalty pursuant to section 6332(c)(2)).
(1)
Expense of levy and sale.
First, against the expenses of the proceedings or sale, including expenses allowable under section 6341 and amounts paid by the United States to redeem property.
(2)
Specific tax liability on seized property.
If the property seized and sold is subject to a tax imposed by any internal revenue law which has not been paid, the amount remaining after applying subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), shall then be applied against such tax liability (and, if such tax was not previously assessed, it shall then be assessed);
(3)
Liability of delinquent taxpayer.
The amount, if any, remaining after applying subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (a), shall then be applied against the liability in respect of which the levy was made or the sale of redeemed property was conducted.
(b)
Surplus proceeds.
Any surplus proceeds remaining after the application of paragraph (a) of this section shall, upon application and satisfactory proof in support thereof, be credited or refunded by the district director to the person or persons legally entitled thereto. The delinquent taxpayer is the person entitled to the surplus proceeds unless another person establishes a superior claim thereto.
[32 FR 15241, Nov. 3, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7180, 37 FR 7320, Apr. 13, 1972]
§ 301.6343-1
Requirement to release levy and notice of release.
(a)
In general.
A district director, service center director, or compliance center director (
director
) must promptly release a levy upon all, or part of, property or rights to property levied upon and must promptly notify the person upon whom the levy was made of such a release, if the director determines that any of the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section (conditions requiring release) exist. The director must make a determination whether any of the conditions requiring release exist if a taxpayer submits a request for release of levy in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this section; however, the director may make this determination based upon information received from a source other than the taxpayer. The director may require any supporting documentation as is reasonably necessary to determine whether a condition requiring release exists.
(b)
Conditions requiring release.
The director must release the levy upon all or a part of the property or rights to property levied upon if he or she determines that one of the following conditions exists—
(1)
Liability satisfied or unenforceable
—(i)
General rule.
The liability for which the levy was made is satisfied or the period of limitations provided in section 6502 (and any period during which the period of limitations is suspended as provided by law) has lapsed. A levy is considered made on the date on which the notice of seizure provided in section 6335(a) is given. A levy that is made within the period of limitations provided in section 6502 does not become unenforceable simply because the person who receives the levy does not surrender the subject property within the period of limitations. In this case, the liability remains enforceable to the extent of the value of the levied upon property. However, a levy made outside the period of limitations (normally ten
years without suspensions) must be released unless—
(A) The taxpayer agreed in writing to extend the period of limitations as provided in section 6502(a)(2) and § 301.6502-1; or
(B) A proceeding in court to collect the liability has begun within the period of limitations.
(ii)
Special situations.
A continuing levy on salary or wages made under section 6331(e) must be released at the end of the period of limitations in section 6502. However, a levy on a fixed and determinable right to payment which right includes payments to be made after the period of limitations expires does not become unenforceable upon the expiration of the period of limitations and will not be released under this condition unless the liability is satisfied.
(2)
Release will facilitate collection.
The release of the levy will facilitate collection of the liability. A director has the discretion to release the levy in all situations, including those where the proceeds from the sale will not fully satisfy the tax liabilities of the taxpayer, under terms and conditions as he or she determines are warranted.
(i)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (b)(2):

# Example.
A and B each own machines which, when used together, produce widgets. A owes delinquent federal taxes. A notice of federal tax lien is properly filed against all property or rights to property belonging to A. A's machine is seized to satisfy A's delinquent tax liability. The fair market value of A's property is greater than the expenses of seizure and sale, but less than the amount of A's tax liability. A and B find a buyer who wants to buy both machines together. The buyer will only buy the machines together. A's property has a greater value as part of the package than it does by itself. The larger value, as shown in the sale contract, is enough to pay A's tax liability in full. In this situation a release of the levy will facilitate collection because the sale of both machines can be completed and A's liability will be paid in full at the settlement.
(ii)
Compliance with other conditions.
The director may find that collection will be facilitated by the taxpayer's compliance with conditions other than immediate payment, such as:
(A) The delinquent taxpayer delivers a satisfactory arrangement, which is accepted by the director, for placing property in escrow to secure the payment of the liability (including the expenses of the levy) which is the basis of the levy.
(B) The delinquent taxpayer delivers an acceptable bond to the director conditioned upon the payment of the liability (including the expenses of levy) which is the basis of the levy. This bond shall be in the form provided in section 7101 and § 301.7101-1.
(C) There is paid to the director an amount determined by the director to be equal to the interest of the United States in the seized property or the part of the seized property to be released.
(D) The delinquent taxpayer executes an agreement to extend the statute of limitations in accordance with section 6502(a)(2) and § 301.6502-1.
(iii)
Expenses of sale exceed the government's interest.
If the director determines that the value of the United States' interest in the seized property does not exceed the expenses of sale of the property, a release of the levy will be deemed to facilitate collection of the liability even though the fair market value of property which has been seized exceeds the expenses of seizure and sale.
(3)
Installment agreement.
The taxpayer has entered into an agreement under section 6159 to satisfy the liability by means of installment payments, unless the agreement provides otherwise. However, the director is not required to release the levy under this condition if a release of the levy will jeopardize the secured creditor status of the United States, e.g., where there is an intervening judgment lien creditor and a notice of tax lien has not been filed.
(4)
Economic hardship
—(i)
General rule.
The levy is creating an economic hardship due to the financial condition of an individual taxpayer. This condition applies if satisfaction of the levy in whole or in part will cause an individual taxpayer to be unable to pay his or her reasonable basic living expenses. The determination of a reasonable amount for basic living expenses will be made by the director and will vary
according to the unique circumstances of the individual taxpayer. Unique circumstances, however, do not include the maintenance of an affluent or luxurious standard of living.
(ii)
Information from taxpayer.
In determining a reasonable amount for basic living expenses the director will consider any information provided by the taxpayer including—
(A) The taxpayer's age, employment status and history, ability to earn, number of dependents, and status as a dependent of someone else;
(B) The amount reasonably necessary for food, clothing, housing (including utilities, home-owner insurance, home-owner dues, and the like), medical expenses (including health insurance), transportation, current tax payments (including federal, state, and local), alimony, child support, or other court-ordered payments, and expenses necessary to the taxpayer's production of income (such as dues for a trade union or professional organization, or child care payments which allow the taxpayer to be gainfully employed);
(C) The cost of living in the geographic area in which the taxpayer resides;
(D) The amount of property exempt from levy which is available to pay the taxpayer's expenses;
(E) Any extraordinary circumstances such as special education expenses, a medical catastrophe, or natural disaster; and
(F) Any other factor that the taxpayer claims bears on economic hardship and brings to the attention of the director.
(iii)
Good faith requirement.
In addition, in order to obtain a release of a levy under this subparagraph, the taxpayer must act in good faith. Examples of failure to act in good faith include, but are not limited to, falsifying financial information, inflating actual expenses or costs, or failing to make full disclosure of assets.
(5)
Fair market value exceeds liability.
The fair market value of the property exceeds the liability for which the levy was made and release of the levy on a part of the property can be made without hindering the collection of the liability. The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (b)(5):

# Example.
The Internal Revenue Service levies upon ten widgets which belong to the taxpayer to satisfy the taxpayer's outstanding tax liabilities. Subsequent to the levy, the taxpayer establishes that market conditions have increased the aggregate fair market value of widgets so that the value of seven widgets equals the aggregate anticipated expenses of sale and seizure and the tax liabilities for which the levy was made. The director must release three widgets from the levy and return them to the taxpayer.
(c)
Request for release of levy
—(1)
Information to be submitted by taxpayer.
A taxpayer who wishes to obtain a release of a levy must submit a request for release in writing or by telephone to the district director for the Internal Revenue district in which the levy was made. The taxpayer making the request must provide the following information—
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer;
(ii) A description of the property levied upon;
(iii) The type of tax and the period for which the tax is due;
(iv) The date of the levy and the originating Internal Revenue district, if known; and
(v) A statement of the grounds upon which the request for release of the levy is based.
(2)
Time for submission.
Except in extraordinary circumstances, a request for release of a levy must be made more than five days prior to a scheduled sale of the property to which the levy relates.
(3)
Determination by director
—(i)
When required.
The director must promptly make a determination concerning release prior to sale in all cases where a request for release of a levy is made except those where the request for release is made five or fewer days prior to a scheduled sale of the property to which the levy relates.
(ii)
Time for making required determination.
The determination will be made, generally, within 30 days of a request for release made 30 or more days prior to a scheduled sale of the property to which the levy relates. If a request for release is made less than 30 days prior to the scheduled sale but more than 5 days before the scheduled
sale, a determination must be made prior to the scheduled sale. If necessary the director may postpone the scheduled sale in order to make this determination.
(iii)
Discretionary determination.
The director has the discretion, but is not required, to make a determination concerning release prior to sale in cases where a request for release of a levy is made five or fewer days prior to a scheduled sale of the property to which the levy relates.
(4)
Notification to taxpayer of determination.
The director must promptly notify the taxpayer if the levy is released. If the director determines that none of the conditions requiring release of the levy exist, the director must promptly notify the taxpayer of the decision not to release the levy and the reason why the levy is not being released.
(d)
Expedited determination with respect to certain business property
—(1)
General procedure
—(i)
Submission by taxpayer.
If a levy is made on essential business property as is described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the taxpayer may obtain an expedited determination of whether any of the conditions requiring release of the levy exist. In order to obtain an expedited determination, the taxpayer must submit, within the time frame specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the information required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and include with the information an explanation of why the property levied upon qualifies for an expedited determination of whether a condition requiring release of the levy exists.
(ii)
Time for making required determination.
The director must make such a determination by the later of 10 business days from the time the director receives the request for release, or 10 business days from the time the director receives any necessary supporting documentation, if 10 or more business days remain before a scheduled sale of the property to which the levy relates. An expedited determination concerning release must be made prior to sale in all cases where a request for release of a levy is made within the time frame specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If necessary the director may postpone the scheduled sale in order to make this determination.
(iii)
Discretionary determination.
The director has the discretion, but is not required, to make an expedited determination concerning release in cases where the taxpayer does not submit, within the time frame specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the information required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and include with the information an explanation of why the property levied upon qualifies for an expedited determination of whether a condition requiring release of the levy exists.
(2)
Essential business property defined.
For purposes of this section,
essential business property
means tangible personal property used in carrying on the trade or business of the taxpayer which when levied upon prevents the taxpayer from continuing to carry on the trade or business.
(3)
Seizure of perishable goods.
The provisions of this paragraph do not apply in the case of a seizure of perishable goods. Those seizures are governed by the provisions of section 6336 and § 301.6336-1.
(e)
Effect of a release of levy.
If property has not yet been surrendered to the director in response to a levy, a release of the levy under section 6343(a) will relieve the possessor of any obligation to surrender the property. Otherwise, a release of a levy under section 6343(a) will cause the property to be returned to the custody of the person or persons legally entitled thereto. The release of a levy on any property under this section does not prevent any subsequent levy on the property. Section 301.6343-2, dealing with return of wrongfully levied upon property, is subject to section 6402 which prohibits the Internal Revenue Service from refunding a payment of money that has been deposited in the Treasury and credited to the taxpayer's liability unless there is an overpayment.
(f)
Effective date.
This section is effective as of December 30, 1994.
[T.D. 8587, 59 FR 35, Jan. 3, 1995]
§ 301.6343-2
Return of wrongfully levied upon property.
(a)
Return of property
—(1)
General rule.
If the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) determines that property has been wrongfully levied upon, the IRS may return—
(i) The specific property levied upon;
(ii) An amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon; or
(iii) An amount of money equal to the amount of money received by the United States from a sale of the property.
(2)
Time of return.
If the United States is in possession of specific property, the property may be returned at any time. An amount equal to the amount of money levied upon or received from a sale of the property may be returned at any time before the expiration of 9 months from the date of the levy. When a request described in paragraph (b) of this section is filed for the return of property before the expiration of 9 months from the date of levy, an amount of money may be returned after a reasonable period of time subsequent to the expiration of the 9-month period if necessary for the investigation and processing of such request.
(3)
Specific property.
In general the specific property levied upon will be returned whenever possible. For this purpose, money that is specifically identifiable, as in the case of a coin collection which may be worth substantially more than its face value, is treated as specific property.
(4)
Purchase by United States.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, if property is declared purchased by the United States at a sale pursuant to section 6335(e), the United States is treated as having received an amount of money equal to the minimum price determined by the IRS before the sale or, if larger, the amount received by the United States from the resale of the property.
(b)
Request for return of property.
A written request for the return of property wrongfully levied upon must be given to the IRS official, office and address specified in IRS Publication 4528, “Making an Administrative Wrongful Levy Claim Under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 6343(b),” or any successor publication. The relevant IRS publications may be downloaded from the IRS internet site at
http://www.irs.gov.
Under this section, a request for the return of property wrongfully levied upon is not effective if it is given to an office other than the office listed in the relevant publication. The written request must contain the following information—
(1) The name and address of the person submitting the request;
(2) A detailed description of the property levied upon;
(3) A description of the claimant's basis for claiming an interest in the property levied upon; and
(4) The name and address of the taxpayer, the originating IRS office, and the date of the levy as shown on the notice of levy form, or levy form, or, in lieu thereof, a statement of the reasons why such information cannot be furnished.
(c)
Inadequate request.
A request for the return of property wrongfully levied upon will not be considered adequate unless it is a written request containing the information required by paragraph (b) of this section. However, unless a notification is mailed by the IRS to the claimant within 30 days of receipt of the request to inform the claimant of the inadequacies, any written request will be considered adequate. If the IRS timely notifies the claimant of the inadequacies of his request, the claimant has 30 days from the receipt of the notification of inadequacy to supply in writing any omitted information. Where the omitted information is so supplied within the 30-day period, the request will be considered to be adequate from the time the original request was made for purposes of determining the applicable period of limitation upon suit under section 6532(c).
(d)
Payment of interest.
Interest is paid at the overpayment rate established under section 6621—
(1) In the case of money returned under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, from the date the IRS received the money to a date (to be determined by the IRS) preceding the date of return by not more than 30 days; or
(2) In the case of money returned under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, from the date of the sale of the property to a date (to be determined by the IRS) preceding the date of return by not more than 30 days.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
These regulations are effective on July 8, 2008.
[T.D. 8587, 59 FR 37, Jan. 3, 1995, as amended by T.D. 9344, 72 FR 39739, July 20, 2007; T.D. 9410, 73 FR 38916, July 8, 2008]
§ 301.6343-3
Return of property in certain cases.
(a)
In general.
If money has been levied upon and applied toward the taxpayer's liability, or property has been levied upon and sold, and the receipts have been applied toward the taxpayer's liability, or property has been levied upon and purchased by the United States and the United States still possesses the property, and the Commissioner determines that any of the conditions in paragraph (c) of this section exist, the Commissioner may return—
(1) An amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon;
(2) An amount of money equal to the amount of money received by the United States from a sale of the property; or
(3) The specific property levied upon and purchased by the United States.
(b)
Return of levied upon property in possession of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pending sale under section 6335.
Other than as provided in § 301.6343-1(b) or in paragraph (d) of this section, the Commissioner, in his or her discretion, may return levied upon property that is in the possession of the United States pending sale under section 6335.
(c)
Conditions authorizing the return of property.
The Commissioner may return property upon determining that one of the following conditions exist:
(1)
Premature or not in accordance with administrative procedures.
The levy was premature or otherwise not in accordance with the administrative procedures of the Secretary.
(2)
Installment agreement.
Subsequent to the levy, the taxpayer enters into an agreement under section 6159 to satisfy the liability for which the levy was made by means of installment payments. If, however, the agreement specifically provides that already levied upon property will not be returned under section 6343(d), the Commissioner may not grant a request for return of property under this paragraph (c)(2).
(3)
Facilitate collection.
The return of property will facilitate the collection of the tax liability for which the levy was made.
(4)
Best interests of the United States and the taxpayer
—(i)
In general.
The taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) has consented to the return of property, and the return of property would be in the best interest of the taxpayer, as determined by the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate), and in the best interest of the United States, as determined by the Commissioner.
(ii)
Best interest of the taxpayer.
The National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) generally will determine whether the return of property is in the best interest of the taxpayer. If, however, a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to return property and has not specifically requested the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) to determine the taxpayer's best interest, a finding by the Commissioner that the return of property is in the best interest of the taxpayer will be sufficient to support the return of property. Only the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) may determine that a return of property is not in the best interest of the taxpayer.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1.
A owes $1,000 in Federal income taxes. The IRS levies on a broker with respect to a money market account belonging to the taxpayer and receives payment from the broker which it applies to the taxpayer's outstanding liability. However, the IRS failed to follow procedure provided by the Internal Revenue Manual (but not required by statute) with regard to managerial approval prior to the making of the levy. The Commissioner may return an amount of money equal to the amount of money the IRS levied upon and applied toward the taxpayer's tax liability.

# Example 2.
B owes $1,000 in Federal income taxes. The IRS levies on a bank with respect to a savings account belonging to the taxpayer and receives funds from the bank, which it applies to the taxpayer's liability. Subsequent to the levy, B enters into an installment agreement, under which B will pay
timely installments to satisfy the entire liability. The installment agreement does not by its terms preclude the return of levied upon property. The revenue officer verifies that B is financially capable of paying the entire liability, including accruals, in the agreed-upon installment payments. The Commissioner may return an amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon and applied toward the taxpayer's liability.

# Example 3.
C owns a house that is deteriorating and in unsalable condition. C is in the process of renovating the house for sale when the IRS levies upon C's bank account for the payment of a $20,000 outstanding Federal tax liability and receives funds in the amount of $3,000, which it applies toward C's liability. A notice of federal tax lien is the only lien encumbrancing the house. C requests that an amount of money equal to the amount seized from the bank account be returned so that C can complete the renovations on the house. Without the funds, C will be unable to complete the renovations and sell the house. Upon examination, the Commissioner determines that the IRS will be able to collect the entire tax liability if C's house is restored to salable condition. If the National Taxpayer Advocate, or the Commissioner in lieu of the National Taxpayer Advocate, determines that the return of the seized money is in the taxpayer's best interest, the Commissioner may return an amount of money equal to the amount seized from the bank account, in the best interest of the taxpayer and the United States.
(d)
Best Interests of the United States and the taxpayer to release levy and return of property where levy made in violation of law
—(1)
In general.
If the IRS makes a levy in violation of the law, it is in the best interests of the United States and the taxpayer to release the levy and the IRS will return to the taxpayer any property obtained pursuant to the levy. For example, the IRS will release the levy and return the taxpayer's property if the levy was made—
(i) Without giving the requisite thirty-day notice of the right to a hearing under section 6330;
(ii) During the pendency of a proceeding for refund of divisible tax in violation of section 6331(i);
(iii) Before investigation of the status of levied upon property in violation of section 6331(j);
(iv) During the pendency of an offer-in-compromise in violation of section 6331(k)(1); or
(v) During the period an offer to enter into an installment agreement is pending (or for 30 days following the rejection of an offer, or, if the rejection is timely appealed, during the period that the appeal is pending) or during the period an installment agreement is in effect (or during the 30 days following a termination or, if a timely appeal of termination is filed, during the period the appeal is pending) in violation of section 6331(k)(2).
(2)
Property may not be credited to outstanding liability without the taxpayer's permission.
When the release of a levy and the return of property are required under this paragraph (d), the property or the proceeds from the sale of the property received by the IRS pursuant to the levy must be returned to the taxpayer unless the taxpayer requests otherwise. The property or proceeds of sale may not be credited to any outstanding tax liability of the taxpayer, including the one with respect to which the IRS made the levy, without the written permission of the taxpayer.
(e)
Time of return.
Levied upon property in possession of the IRS (other than money) may be returned under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section at any time. An amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon or received from a sale of property may be returned at any time before the expiration of 9 months from the date of the levy. When a request for the return of money filed in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section is filed before the expiration of the 9-month period, or a determination to return an amount of money is made before the expiration of the 9-month period, the money may be returned within a reasonable period of time after the expiration of the 9-month period if additional time is necessary for investigation or processing.
(f)
Purchase by the United States.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if property is declared purchased by the United States at a sale pursuant to section 6335(e)(1)(C), the United States will be treated as having received an amount of money equal to the minimum price determined by the Commissioner before the sale.
(g)
Determinations by the Commissioner.
The Commissioner must determine whether any of the conditions authorizing the return of property exists
if a taxpayer submits a request for the return of property in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The Commissioner also may make this determination independently. If the Commissioner determines that conditions authorizing the return of property are not present, the Commissioner may not authorize the return of property. If the Commissioner determines that conditions authorizing the return of property are present, the Commissioner may (but is not required to, unless the reason for the return of property is that the levy was made in violation of law and is governed by paragraph (d) of this section) authorize the return of property. If the Commissioner decides independently to return property under paragraph (c)(4) of this section based on the best interests of the taxpayer and the United States, the taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his or her delegate) must consent to the return of property.
(h)
Procedures for request for the return of property
—(1)
Manner.
A request for the return of property must be made in writing to the address on the levy form.
(2)
Form.
The written request must include the following information—
(i) The name, current address, and taxpayer identification number of the person requesting the return of money (or property purchased by the United States);
(ii) A description of the property levied upon;
(iii) The date of the levy; and
(iv) A statement of the grounds upon which the return of money is being requested (or property purchased by the United States).
(i)
No interest.
No interest will be paid on any money returned under this section.
(j)
Administrative collection upon default.
If the Commissioner returns property under this section, and the taxpayer fails to pay the previously assessed liability for which the levy was made on the returned property, the Commissioner may administratively collect the liability. Collection may include levying again on the returned property as long as statutory and administrative requirements are followed.
(k)
Effective date.
This section is applicable on July 14, 2005.
[T.D. 9213, 70 FR 40670, July 14, 2005]
§ 301.6361-1
Collection and administration of qualified taxes.
(a)
In general.
In the case of any State which has in effect a State agreement (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6361-4), the Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall collect and administer each qualified tax (as defined in paragraph (b) of § 301.6361-4) of such State. No fee or other charge shall be imposed upon any State for the collection or administration of any qualified tax of such State or any other State. In any such case of collection and administration of qualified taxes, the provisions of subtitle F (relating to procedure and administration), subtitle G (relating to the Joint Committee on Taxation), and chapter 24 (relating to the collection of income tax at source on wages), and the provisions of regulations thereunder, insofar as such provisions relate to the collection and administration of the taxes imposed on the income of individuals by chapter 1 (and the civil and criminal sanctions provided by subtitle F, or by title 18 of the United States Code (relating to crimes and criminal procedure), with respect to such collection and administration) shall apply to the collection and administration of qualified taxes as if such taxes were imposed by chapter 1, except to the extent that the application of such provisions (and sanctions) are modified by regulations issued under subchapter E (as defined in paragraph (d) of § 301.6361-4). Any extension of time which is granted for the making of a payment, or for the filing of any return, which relates to any Federal tax imposed by subtitle A (or by subtitle C with respect to filing a return) shall constitute automatically an extension of the same amount of time for the making of the corresponding payment or for the filing of the corresponding return relating to any qualified tax.
(b)
Returns of qualified taxes.
Every individual, estate, or trust which has liability for one or more qualified taxes for a taxable year—
(1) Shall file a Federal income tax return at the time prescribed pursuant to
section 6072(a) (whether or not such return is required by section 6012), and shall file therewith on the prescribed form a return under penalties of perjury for each tax which is—
(i) A qualified resident tax imposed by a State of which the taxpayer was a resident, as defined in § 301.6362-6, for any part of the taxable year;
(ii) A qualified nonresident tax imposed by a State within which was located the source or sources from which the taxpayer derived, while not a resident of such State and while not exempt from liability for the tax by reason of a reciprocal agreement between such State and the State of which he is a resident, 25 percent or more of his aggregate wage and other business income, as defined in paragraph (c) of § 301.6362-5, for the taxable year; or
(iii) A qualified resident or nonresident tax with respect to which any amount was currently collected from the taxpayer's income (including collection by withholding on wages or by payment of estimated income tax), as provided in paragraph (f) of § 301.6362-6, for any part of the taxable year; and
(2) Shall declare (in addition to the declaration required with respect to the return of the Federal income tax and in the place and manner prescribed by form or instructions thereto) under penalties of perjury that, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the taxpayer (or, in the case of an estate or trust, of the fiduciary who executes the Federal income tax return), he has no liability for any qualified tax for the taxable year other than any such liabilities returned with the Federal income tax return (pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (b)). Such declaration shall constitute a return indicating no liability with respect to each qualified tax other than any such tax for which liability is so returned. A Federal income tax return form which is filed but which does not contain such declaration shall constitute a Federal income tax return only if the taxpayer in fact has no liability for any qualified State tax for the taxable year.
(c)
Credits
—(1)
Credit for tax of another State or political subdivision
—(i)
In general.
A credit allowable under a qualified tax law against the tax imposed by such law for a taxpayer's tax liability to another State or a political subdivision of another State shall be allowed if the requirements of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph are met, and if the credit meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of § 301.6362-4. Such credit shall be allowed without regard to whether the tax imposed by the other State or subdivision thereof is a qualified tax, and without regard to whether such tax has been paid.
(ii)
Substantiation of tax liability for which a credit is allowed.
If the liability which gives rise to a credit of the type described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is with respect to a qualified tax, then the fact of such liability shall be substantiated by filing the return on which such liability is reported. If such liability is not with respect to a qualified tax, then the Commissioner may require a taxpayer who claims entitlement to such a credit to complete a form to be submitted with his return of the qualified tax against which the credit is claimed. On such form the taxpayer shall identify each of the other States (the liabilities to which were not substantiated as provided in the first sentence of this subdivision) or political subdivisions to which the taxpayer reported a liability for a tax giving rise to the credit, furnish the name or description of each such tax, state the amount of the liability so reported with respect to each such tax and the beginning and ending dates of the taxable period for which such liability was reported, and provide such other information as is requested in the form or in the instructions thereto. In addition, the taxpayer shall agree on such form to notify the Commissioner in the event that the amount of any tax liability (or portion thereof) which is claimed as giving rise to a credit of the type described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is changed or adjusted, whether as a result of an amended return filed by the taxpayer, a determination by the jurisdiction imposing the tax, or in any other manner.
(2)
Credit or withheld qualified tax.
An individual from whose wages an amount is withheld on account of a qualified tax shall receive a credit for such amount against his aggregate liability for all such qualified taxes and the Federal income tax for the taxable
year, whether or not such tax has been paid over to the Federal Government by the employer. The credit shall operate in the manner provided by section 31(a) of the Code and the regulations thereunder with respect to Federal income tax withholding.
(d)
Collection of qualified taxes at source on wages
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, every employer making payment of wages to an employee described in such subparagraph shall deduct and withhold upon such wages the amount prescribed with respect to the qualified tax designated in such subparagraph. The amounts prescribed for withholding with respect to each such qualified tax shall be published in Circular E (Employer's Tax Guide) or other appropriate Internal Revenue Service publications. See paragraph (f)(1) of § 301.6362-7 with respect to civil and criminal penalties to which an employer shall be subject with respect to his responsibilities relating to qualified taxes.
(2)
Specific withholding requirements.
An employer shall deduct and withhold upon an employee's wages the amount prescribed with respect to a qualified tax with respect to which such employee is subject to the current collection provisions pursuant to paragraph (f) of § 301.6362-6, unless:
(i) In the case of a qualified resident tax, the employee's services giving rise to the wages are performed in another State, and such other State or a political subdivision thereof imposes a nonresident tax on such employee with respect to which the withholding amount exceeds the prescribed withholding amount with respect to such qualified resident tax, and the State imposing such qualified resident tax grants a credit against it for such nonresident tax.
(ii) In the case of a qualified nonresident tax, either:
(A) Residents of the State in which the employee resides are exempt from liability for the qualified nonresident tax imposed by the State from sources within which his wage income is derived, by reason of an interstate compact or agreement to which the two States are parties, or
(B) The State in which the employee resides imposes a qualified resident tax on such employee with respect to which the prescribed withholding amounts exceed the prescribed withholding amounts with respect to the qualified nonresident tax imposed by the State from sources within which his wage income is derived, and the State in which he resides grants a credit against its qualifed resident tax for such qualified nonresident tax.
If the nonresident tax described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is a qualified nonresident tax imposed by a State, then the reference in such subdivision to the State in which the services are performed shall be construed as a reference to the State from sources within which the wage income is derived, within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of § 301.6362-5.
(3)
Forms, procedures, and returns relating to withholding with respect to qualified taxes
—(i)
Forms W-4 and W-4P.
Forms W-4 (Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate) and W-4P (Annuitant's Request for Income Tax Withholding), shall include information as to the State in which the employee resides, and shall be used for purposes of withholding with respect to both Federal and qualified taxes. An employee shall show on his Form W-4 the State in which he resides for purposes of this paragraph, and shall file a new Form W-4 within 10 days after he changes his State of residence. An employee who fails to meet either of the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence, with the intent to evade the withholding tax imposed with respect to a qualifed tax, shall be subject to the penalty provided in section 7205 of the Code. An employer shall be responsible for determining the State within which are located the sources from which the employee's wage income is derived for purposes of this paragraph; and, if the employee does not file a Form W-4, the employer shall assume for such purposes that the employee resides in that State. When an employer and an employee enter into a voluntary withholding agreement pursuant to
§ 31.3402(p)-1, the employer shall withhold the amount prescribed with respect to the qualified resident tax imposed by the State in which the employee resides, as indicated on Form W-4. Similarly, if an annuitant requests withholding with respect to his annuity payments pursuant to section 3402 (o)(1)(B) of the Code, the payer shall withhold the whole dollar amount specified by the annuitant with respect to a qualified resident tax, provided that the combined withholding with respect to Federal and qualified taxes on each annuity payment shall be a whole dollar amount not less than $5, and that the net amount of any annuity payment received by the payee shall not be reduced to less than $10.
(ii)
Forms W-2 and W-2P.
Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement) and W-2P (the corresponding form for annuities) shall show:
(A) The total amount withheld with respect to the Federal income tax;
(B) The total amount withheld with respect to qualified taxes;
(C) The name of each State imposing a qualified tax in which the employee (or annuitant) resided during the taxable year, as shown on Form W-4 (or W-4P);
(D) The name of each State imposing a qualified nonresident tax within which were located sources from which the employee's wage income was derived during a period of the taxable year in which he was not shown as a resident of such State on Form W-4, and the amount of the employee's wage income so derived; and
(E) The name of each State or locality that imposes an income tax which is not a qualified tax and with respect to which the employer withheld on the employee's wage income for the taxable year, and the amount of wage income with respect to which the employer so withheld.
(iii)
Requirements relating to deposit and payment of withheld tax.
Rules relating to the deposit and remittance of withheld Federal income and FICA taxes, including those prescribed in section 6302 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, shall apply also to amounts withheld with respect to qualified taxes. Thus, an employer's liability with respect to the deposit and payment of withheld taxes shall be for the combined amount of withholding with respect to Federal and qualified taxes. The Federal Tax Deposit form shall separately indicate:
(A) The combined total amount of Federal income, FICA, and qualified taxes withheld;
(B) The combined total amount of qualified taxes withheld; and
(C) The total amount of qualified taxes withheld with respect to each electing State.
Data indicating the total amount of tax deposits processed by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the qualified taxes of an electing State will be available to that State upon request on as frequent as a weekly basis. These data will be available no later than 10 working days after the end of the calendar week in which the deposits were processed by the Service.
(iv)
Employment tax returns.
Forms 941 (Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return), 941-E (Quarterly Return of Withheld Income Tax), 941-M (Employer's Monthly Federal Tax Return), 942 (Employer's Quarterly Tax Return for Household Employees), and 943 (Employer's Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Employees), shall indicate the total amount withheld with respect to each qualified tax, as directed by such forms or their instructions.
(e)
Criminal penalties.
A criminal offense committed with respect to a qualified tax shall be treated as a separate offense from a similar offense committed with respect to the Federal tax. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer willfully attempts to evade both the Federal tax and a qualified tax by failing to report a portion of his income, he shall be considered as having committed two criminal offenses, each subject to a separate penalty under section 7201. See also § 301.6362-7(f) with respect to criminal penalties.
(f)
Allocation of amounts collected with respect to tax and criminal fines
—(1)
In general.
The aggregate amount that has been collected from a taxpayer (including amounts collected by withholding) in respect of liability for both one or more qualified taxes and the Federal income tax for a taxable year shall be allocated among the Federal Government and the States imposing qualified
taxes for which the taxpayer is liable in the proportion which the taxpayer's liability for each such tax bears to his aggregate liability for such year to all of such taxing jurisdictions with respect to such taxes. A reallocation shall be made either when an amount is collected from the taxpayer or his employer or is credited or refunded to the taxpayer, subsequent to the making of the initial allocation, or when a determination is made by the Commissioner that an error was made with respect to a previous allocation. However, any such allocation or reallocation shall not affect the amount of a taxpayer's or employer's liability to either jurisdiction, or the amount of the assessment and collection which may be made with respect to a taxpayer or employer. Accordingly, such allocations and reallocations shall not be taken into consideration for purposes of the application of statutes of limitation or provisions relating to interest, additions to tax, penalties, and criminal sanctions. See example 4 in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph (e). In addition, any such allocation or reallocation shall not affect the amount of the deduction to which a taxpayer is entitled under section 164 for a year in which he made payment (including payments made by withholding) of an amount which was designated as being in respect of his liability for a qualified tax. However, to the extent that an amount which was paid by a taxpayer and designated as being in respect of his liability for a qualified tax is allocated or reallocated in such a manner as to apply it toward the taxpayer's liability for the Federal income tax, such allocation or reallocation shall be treated as a refund to the taxpayer of an amount paid in respect of a State income tax, and shall be included in the gross income of the taxpayer to the extent appropriate under section 111 and the regulations thereunder in the year in which the allocation or reallocation is made. See section 451 and the regulations thereunder. Similarly, to the extent that an amount which was paid by a taxpayer and designated as being in respect of his Federal income tax liability is allocated or reallocated in such a manner as to apply it toward his liability for a qualified tax, such allocation or reallocation shall be treated as a payment made by the taxpayer in respect of a State income tax, and shall be deductible under section 164 in the year in which the allocation or reallocation is made. The Internal Revenue Service shall notify the taxpayer in writing of any allocation or reallocation of tax liabilities in a proportion other than that of the respective tax liabilities shown on the taxpayer's returns.
(2)
Amounts of collections and liabilities.
For purposes of this paragraph the aggregate amount that has been collected from a taxpayer or his employer in respect of tax liability shall include the amounts of interest provided in chapter 67, and additions to tax and assessable penalties provided in chapter 68, which are collected with respect to such tax; but shall not include criminal fines provided in chapter 75, or in title 18 of the United States Code, which are collected with respect to offenses relating to such tax. (See subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (e) with respect to the treatment of such criminal fines.) However, for purposes of this paragraph, the amount of the taxpayer's liability for each tax shall exclude his liability for such interest additions to tax, and assessable penalties with respect to such tax, and his liability for criminal fines imposed with respect to offenses relating to such tax. For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of the taxpayer's liability for each tax shall be computed by taking credits into account, except that there shall be no reduction for any amounts paid on account of such liability, whether by means of withholding, estimated tax payment, or otherwise.
(3)
Special rules relating to criminal fines.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, when a criminal charge is brought against a taxpayer with respect to a taxable year pursuant to chapter 75, or to title 18 of the United States Code, or to a corresponding provision of a qualified tax law, alleging that an offense was committed against the United States with respect to the Federal income tax or against a State with respect to a qualified tax, and an amount of money is collected by the Federal Government as a fine as a result of
such charge, then the Federal Government shall remit an amount to each State, if any, which is an affected jurisdiction. The amount remitted to each such State shall bear the same proportion to the total amount collected as a fine as the taxpayer's liability with respect to the qualified taxes of that State bears to the aggregate of the taxpayer's income tax liabilities to all affected jurisdictions for the taxable year, as determined under subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (e). For purposes of this subparagraph, an affected jurisdiction is (A) a jurisdiction with respect to the tax of which a criminal charge described in the preceding sentence was brought for the taxable year, or (B) a jurisdiction with respect to the Federal income tax or the qualified tax of which the acts or omissions alleged in such a criminal charge would constitute the basis for the bringing of a criminal charge for the same taxable year. However, in no case shall the amount received by an affected State, or the amount of the excess of the amount received by the Federal Government over the amount of its remissions to States, with respect to a fine exceed the maximum fine prescribed by statute for the offense against that jurisdiction with respect to which a criminal charge was brought, or with respect to which the bringing of a criminal charge could have been supported on the basis of the acts or omissions alleged in a criminal charge brought. For purposes of this subparagraph, the amount collected as a fine as a result of a criminal charge shall include amounts paid in settlement of an actual or potential liability for a fine, amounts paid pursuant to a conviction and amounts paid pursuant to a plea of guilty or
nolo contendere.
(ii) If a criminal charge described in the first sentence of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is actually brought with respect to the income tax of every affected jurisdiction with respect to the taxable year, and if a Court adjudicates on the merits the taxpayer's liability for a fine to each such jurisdiction, and includes in its decree a direction of the amount, if any, to be paid as a fine to each such jurisdiction, then that decree shall govern the allocation of the amount of money collected by the Federal Government as a fine with respect to the taxable year.
(4)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The total combined amount of State X qualified tax and Federal income tax collected from A, a resident of State X, for the taxable year is $5,100. The amounts of A's liabilities for such taxes for that year are $800 to State X and $4,000 to the Federal Government. Since A's tax liability to State X is one-sixth of the combined tax liability ($4,800), one-sixth ($50) of the amount to be refunded to A ($300) is chargeable against State X's account, and five-sixths ($250) is chargeable against the Federal Government's account.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the total amount collected from A is $4,500. Since A's liabilities for the State X tax and the Federal tax are one-sixth and five-sixths, respectively, of the combined tax liability, the Federal Government shall pay over to State X one-sixth ($750) of the amount actually collected from A, and the Federal Government shall retain five-sixths ($3,750).

# Example 3.
The total amount of State X qualified tax, State Y qualified tax, and Federal income tax collected from B, a resident of State X who is employed in State Y, for the taxable year is $5,500. The amounts of B's liabilities for such taxes for that year are: $250 for the State X tax (after allowance of a credit for State Y's qualified tax), $750 for the State Y tax, and $4,000 for the Federal tax. Since B's liability for the State X tax ($250) is 5 percent of the combined tax liability ($5,000), his liability for the State Y tax ($750) is 15 percent of such combined liability, and his liability for the Federal tax ($4,000) is 80 percent of such combined liability, the total amount to be refunded to B ($500) shall be chargeable in the following manner: 5 percent ($25) against State X's account, 15 percent ($75) against State Y's account, and 80 percent ($400) against the Federal Government's account.

# Example 4.
C is liable for $2,000 in Federal income tax and $500 in State X qualified tax (a resident tax) for the taxable year. However, on his Federal income tax return for such year, C erroneously described himself as a resident of State Y (which does not have a qualified tax), and he filed with such return his declaration to the effect that he had no qualified tax liability for the year. Accordingly, C paid only $2,000 for his Federal tax liability, and such amount was retained in the account of the Federal Government. Subsequently, C's error is discovered. The amount collected by the Federal Government from C for such year must be allocated between the Federal Government and State X in proportion to C's tax liability to both.
Accordingly, the Federal Government must pay over to State X the amount of $400 (which is
1/5
($500/$2,500) of the $2,000 collected). If the Federal Government collects from C the additional $500 owed, it will retain $400 of such amount and pay the remaining $100 to State X. Similarly, if the Federal Government collects from C any interest, or any additions to tax or assessable penalties under chapter 68,
4/5
of the amount of such collections shall be retained by the Federal Government and
1/5
of such amount shall be paid over to State X. However, notwithstanding the allocation of the funds between the taxing jurisdictions, C's liability for the $500 retains its character as a liability for State X tax. Therefore, any interest, additions to tax, or assessable penalities imposed with respect to the State X tax shall be imposed with respect to C's full $500 liability for such tax, notwithstanding the fact that amounts collected with respect to such items shall be allocated
4/5
to the Federal Government.

# Example 5.
A criminal charge is brought against D pursuant to chapter 75, alleging that he willfully evaded the payment of Federal income tax by failing to report interest income derived from obligations of the United States. D enters a plea of
non contendere
to the charge and pays $2,500 as a fine to the Federal Government. The act alleged in the criminal charge would not support the bringing of a criminal charge under a State law corresponding to chapter 75, or to title 18 of the United States Code, with respect to the qualified tax of any State; accordingly, the United States is the only affected jurisdiction, and no remittances shall be made to any State with respect to the amount collected by the Federal Government as a fine.

# Example 6.
A criminal charge is brought against E pursuant to chapter 75, alleging that he willfully attempted to evade the assessment of liability for both Federal income tax and the qualified tax of State X by filing false and fraudulent income tax returns. E's case is settled upon the condition that he pay a fine in the amount of $5,000. As determined pursuant to subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, E's liabilities for the taxable year are in the amounts of $7,200 to the Federal Government and $800 to State X. Accordingly, after the Federal Government collects the fine, $500 ($5,000 + $800 × $8,000) is remitted to State X.

# Example 7.
Assume the same facts as in example 6, except that E is tried and convicted on both charges, and pursuant to court decree he pays to the United States a fine of $6,000 with respect to each charge, or a total of $12,000. Because a criminal charge was brought with respect to each affected jurisdiction, and the allocation of the total amount paid as a fine was specifically imposed by a court decree, the direction of the Court shall govern the allocation. Accordingly, after the Federal Government collects the fines it pays over $6,000 to the account of State X.

§ 301.6361-2
Judicial and administrative proceedings; Federal representation of State interests.
(a)
Civil proceedings
—(1)
General rule.
Any person shall have the same right to bring or contest a civil action, and to obtain a review thereof, with respect to a qualified tax (including the current collection thereof) in the same court or courts which would be available to him, and pursuant to the same requirements and procedures to which he would be subject, under chapter 76 (relating to judicial proceedings), and under title 28 of the United States Code (relating to the judiciary and judicial procedure), if the tax were imposed by section 1 or chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this section, the term “person” includes the Federal Government. Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (a), to the extent that the preceding sentence provides judicial procedures (including review procedures) with respect to any matter, such procedures shall replace civil judicial procedures under State law.
(2)
Exception.
The right or power of the courts of any State to pass on matters involving the constitution of such State is unaffected by any provision of this paragraph; however, the jurisdiction of a State court in such matters shall not extend beyond the issue of constitutionality. Thus, if in a case involving the validity of a qualified tax statute under the State constitution, the State court holds such statute constitutional, such court shall not proceed to decide the amount of the tax liability.
(b)
Criminal proceedings.
Only the Federal Government shall have the right to bring a criminal action with respect to a qualified tax (including the current collection thereof). Such an action shall be brought in the same court or courts which would be available to the Federal Government, and pursuant to the same requirements and procedures to which the Federal Government would be subject, if the tax
were imposed by section 1 or chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(c)
Administrative proceedings.
Any person shall have the same rights in administrative proceedings of the Internal Revenue Service with respect to a qualified tax (including the current collection thereof) which would be available to him, and shall be subject to the same administrative requirements and procedures to which he would be subject, if the tax were imposed by section 1 or chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(d)
United States representation of State interests
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (d), the Federal Government shall appear on behalf of any State the qualified tax of which it collects (or did collect for the year in issue), and shall represent such State's interests in any administrative or judicial proceeding, either civil or criminal in nature, which relates to the administration and collection of such qualified tax, in the same manner as it represents the interests of the United States in corresponding proceedings involving Federal income tax matters.
(2)
Exceptions.
The Federal Government shall not so represent a State's interests either—
(i) In proceedings in a State court involving the constitution of such State, to the extent of such constitutional issue, or
(ii) In proceedings in any court involving the relationship between the United States and the State, to the extent of the issue pertaining to such relationship, if either:
(A) The proceeding is one which is initiated by the United States against the State, or by the State against the United States, and no individual (except in his official capacity as a governmental official) is an original party to the proceeding, or
(B) The proceeding is not one described in (A), but the State elects to represent its own interests to the extent permissible under this subdivision.
(3)
Finality of Federal administrative determinations.
State and local government officials and employees may not review Federal administrative determinations concerning tax liabilities of, refunds owed to, or criminal prosecutions of, individuals with respect to qualified taxes. See, however, § 301.6363-3 relating to State administration of a qualified tax with respect to transition years. If requested by an electing State, the Commissioner or his delegate may, under terms and conditions set forth in an agreement with such State, permit such State to carry on operations supplementary to the Federal administration of the State's qualified tax (including supplemental audits or examinations of tax returns by State audit personnel), but all administrative determinations shall be made by the Federal Government without review by the State. An agreement which permits supplemental audits or examinations of tax returns by State audit personnel shall provide that the audits and examinations shall be conducted under the supervision and control of the Commissioner or his delegate, who shall have the authority to determine which returns shall be audited and when the audits shall occur. Also, such agreements shall provide that the results of any such supplemental audit shall be referred to the Commissioner or his delegate for final administrative determination. The Commissioner or his delegate shall, to the extent permitted by law, allow an electing State reasonable access to tax returns and other appropriate records and information relating to its qualified tax for the purpose of conducting any such supplemental operations. In addition, the Secretary or his delegate shall permit an electing State to inspect the workpapers which are compiled in the course of verification by the Treasury Department of the correctness of the accounting by which the amounts of the actual net collections attributable to the electing State's qualified taxes are determined.
[T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59364, Dec. 20, 1978]
§ 301.6361-3
Transfers to States.
(a)
Periodic transfers.
In general, amounts collected by the Federal Government which are allocable to qualified taxes (including criminal fines which are required to be paid to a State, as determined under paragraph (f)(3) of § 301.6361-1) shall be promptly transferred to each State imposing such a tax. Transfers of such amounts,
based on percentages of estimated Federal collections, shall be made not less frequently than every third business day unless the State agrees to accept transfers at less frequent intervals.
(b)
Determination of amounts of transfers.
The amounts allocable to the qualified taxes of each State for purposes of periodic transfer shall be determined as a percentage of the estimated aggregate net individual income tax collections made by the Federal Government. For purposes of this paragraph, the “aggregate net individual income tax collections” shall include amounts collected on account of the Federal individual income tax and all qualified taxes by all means (including withholding, tax returns, and declarations of estimated tax), and shall be reduced to the extent of any liability to taxpayers for credits or refunds by reason of overpayments of such taxes. The percentage of the estimated amount of such collections which is allocated to each State shall be based on an estimate which is to be made by the Office of Tax Analysis prior to the beginning of each calendar year as to what portion of the estimated aggregate net individual income tax collections for the forthcoming year will be attributable to the qualified taxes of that State. Each State will be notified prior to the beginning of each calendar year of the amount which it is estimated that the State will receive by application of that percentage for the year. However, the Office of Tax Analysis shall, from time to time throughout the calendar year, revise the percentage estimates when such a revision is, in the opinion of that office necessary to conform such estimates to the actual receipts. When such a revision is made, the payments to the State will be adjusted accordingly.
(c)
Adjustment of difference between actual collections and periodic transfers.
At least once annually the Secretary or his delegate shall determine the difference between the aggregate amount of the actual net collections made (taking into account credits, refunds, and amounts received by withholding with respect to which a tax return is not filed) which is attributable to each State's qualified taxes during the preceding year and the aggregate amount actually transferred to such State based on estimates during such year. The amount of such difference, as so determined, shall be a charge against, or an addition to, the amounts otherwise determined to be payable to the State.
(d)
Recipient of transferred funds.
All funds transferred pursuant to section 6361(c) and paragraph (a) of this section shall be transferred by the Federal Government to the State official designated by the Governor to receive such funds in the State agreement pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of § 301.6363-1, unless the Governor notifies the Secretary or his delegate in writing of the designation of a different State official to receive the funds.

§ 301.6362-2
Qualified resident tax based on taxable income.
(a)
In general.
A tax meets the requirements of section 6362(b) and this section only if it is imposed on the amount of the taxable income, as defined in section 63, of the individual, estate, or trust, adjusted—
(1) By subtracting an amount equal to the amount of the taxpayer's interest on obligations of the United States which was included in his gross income for the taxable year;
(2) By adding an amount equal to the amount of the taxpayer's net State income tax deduction, as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6362-4, for the taxable year;
(3) By adding an amount equal to the amount of the taxpayer's net tax-exempt income, as defined in paragraph (b) of § 301.6362-4, for the taxable year; and
(4) If a credit is allowed against the tax in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section for sales tax imposed by the State or a political subdivision thereof, by adding an amount equal to the amount of the taxpayer's deduction under section 164(a)(4) for such sales tax.
The tax may provide for either a single rate or multiple rates which vary with the amount of taxable income, as adjusted.
(b)
Permitted adjustments.
A tax which otherwise meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not be deemed to fail to meet such requirements solely because it provides for one or more of the following adjustments:
(1) A credit meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of § 301.6362-4 is allowed against the tax for the taxpayer's income tax liability to another State or a political subdivision thereof.
(2) A tax is imposed on the amount taxed under section 56 (relating to the minimum tax for tax preferences).
(3) A credit is allowed against the tax for all or a portion of any general sales tax imposed by the State or a political subdivision thereof with respect to sales either to the taxpayer or to one or more of his dependents.
(c)
Method of making mandatory adjustments.
The mandatory adjustments provided in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made directly to taxable income. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of § 301.6362-4, no account
shall be taken of any reduction or increase in the Federal adjusted gross income which would result from the exclusion from, or inclusion in, gross income of the items which are the subject of the adjustments. Thus, for example, when for purposes of the calculation the taxpayer's Federal taxable income is adjusted to reflect the exclusion from gross income of interest on obligations of the United States, no change shall be made in the amount of the taxpayer's deduction for medical expenses, or in the amount of his charitable contribution base, even though such amounts would ordinarily depend upon the amount of adjusted gross income.
[T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59366, Dec. 20, 1978]
§ 301.6362-3
Qualified resident tax which is a percentage of Federal tax.
(a)
In general.
A tax meets the requirements of section 6362(c) and this section only if:
(1) The tax is imposed as a single specified percentage of the excess of the taxes imposed by chapter 1 over the sum of the credits allowable under part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 (other than the credits allowable under sections 31 and 39), and
(2) The amount of the tax is decreased by the amount of the decrease in such liability which would result from excluding from the taxpayer's gross income an amount equal to the amount of interest on obligations of the United States which was included in his gross income for the taxable year.
(b)
Permitted adjustments.
A tax which otherwise meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not be deemed to fail to meet such requirements solely because it provides for one or more of the following three adjustments:
(1) The amount of a taxpayer's liability for tax is increased by the amount of the increase in such liability which would result from including in such taxpayer's gross income all of the following:
(i) An amount equal to the amount of his net State income tax deduction, as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6362-4, for the taxable year,
(ii) An amount equal to the amount of his net tax-exempt income, as defined in paragraph (b) of § 301.6362-4, for the taxable year, and
(iii) If a credit is allowed against the tax under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for sales tax imposed by the State or a political subdivision thereof, an amount equal to the amount of his deduction under section 164(a)(4) for such sales tax.
(2) A credit meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of § 301.6362-4 is allowed against the tax for the income tax of another State or a political subdivision thereof.
(3) A credit is allowed against the tax for all or a portion of any general sales tax imposed by the State or a political subdivision thereof with respect to sales either to the taxpayer or to one or more of his dependents.
(c)
Method of making adjustments.
Except as specifically provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1) of this section and in paragraph (c)(2) of § 301.6362-4, no account shall be taken of any reduction or increase in the Federal adjusted gross income which would result from the exclusion from, or inclusion in, gross income of the items which are the subject of the adjustments provided in those paragraphs. Thus, for example, when for purposes of the calculation the taxpayer's Federal income tax liability is adjusted to reflect the exclusion from gross income of interest on obligations of the United States, no change shall be made in the amount of the taxpayer's deduction for medical expenses, or in the amount of his charitable contribution base, even though such amounts would ordinarily depend upon the amount of adjusted gross income. Also, when calculating the adjusted Federal tax liability to which the rate of the State tax is to be applied, no adjustment shall be made in the amount of any credit against Federal tax to which a taxpayer is entitled.
[T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59366, Dec. 20, 1978]
§ 301.6362-4
Rules for adjustments relating to qualified resident taxes.
(a)
Net State income tax deduction.
For purposes of section 6362 (b)(1)(B) and (c)(3)(B), and §§ 301.6362-2 and 301.6362-3, the “net State income tax deduction”
shall be the excess (if any) of (1) the amount deducted from income under section 164(a)(3) as taxes paid to a State or to a political subdivision thereof, over (2) the amounts included in income as recoveries of prior income taxes which were paid to a State or to a political subdivision thereof and which had been deducted under section 164(a)(3).
(b)
Net tax-exempt income.
For purposes of section 6362 (b)(1)(C) and (c)(3)(A) and §§ 301.6362-2 and 301.6362-3, the “net tax-exempt income” shall be the excess (if any) of:
(1) The sum of (i) the interest on obligations described in section 103 (a)(1) other than obligations of the State imposing the tax and the political subdivisions thereof, and (ii) the interest on obligations described in such section of such State and the political subdivisions thereof which under the law of the State is subject to the tax; over
(2) The sum of (i) the amount of deductions allocable to the interest described in subparagraph (1) (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (b), which is disallowed pursuant to section 265 and the regulations thereunder, and (ii) the amount of the adjustment to basis allocable to such obligations which is required to be made for the taxable year under section 1016(a) (5) or (6).
For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph (b), a State may, at its option, subject to the tax the interest from all, none, or some of its section 103(a)(1) obligations and those of its political subdivisions. For example, a State may subject to tax all of such obligations other than those which it or its political subdivisions issued prior to a specified date, which may be the date that subchapter E became applicable to the State.
(c)
Credits for taxes of other jurisdictions
—(1)
In general.
A State tax law that provides for a credit, pursuant to section 6362(b)(2) (B) or (C) or section 6362(c)(4), and paragraph (b)(1) of § 301.6362-2 or paragraph (b)(2) of § 301.6362-3, for income tax of another State or a political subdivision thereof shall provide that, in the case of each taxpayer, the amount of the credit shall equal the amount of his liability with respect to such other jurisdiction's tax for the taxable year which runs concurrently with, or which ends in, the taxable year used by the taxpayer for purposes of the State tax which provides for the credit. Such a credit may be allowed with respect to every income tax (whether or not qualified) imposed on the taxpayer by another State or a political subdivision thereof, or only with respect to certain of such taxes. However, for purposes of this paragraph, the amount which is treated as being the amount of the taxpayer's liability with respect to any such tax imposed by another jurisdiction shall not exceed the amount of liability for such tax which is both—
(A) Reported to the taxing authorities responsible for collecting such other jurisdiction's tax, and
(B) Substantiated pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of § 301.6361-1.
(2)
Limitation.
The amount of any credit allowed for the taxable year pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the product of the amount of the resident tax against which the credit is allowed, as computed without subtracting any such credit, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of income subject to tax by both the State imposing the resident tax against which the credit is allowed and the other jurisdiction whose tax is being credited, and the denominator of which is the amount of income subject to tax by the State imposing the resident tax against which the credit is allowed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, “income subject to tax” means the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income which is taken into account for purposes of computing tax liability; in the case of a qualified resident tax, an appropriate modification shall be made to take into account any adjustments which are made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) and (3) of § 301.6362-2, or pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(1)(ii) of § 301.6362-3.
(3)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) A, a calendar-year, cash-basis taxpayer, is a resident of State X throughout the taxable year. For such year, his adjusted gross income for Federal income tax purposes consists of $24,000, consisting of $3,000
derived from employment in State X, $5,000 derived from employment in State Y. $15,000 derived from employment in State Z, and $1,000 in interest income from United States savings bonds. In addition, he received net tax-exempt income in the amount of $2,000. For the taxable year, he incurs liabilities of $200 for the State Y nonresident income tax, and $1,400 for the State Z nonresident income tax. State X, which has in effect a State agreement for the taxable year, imposes a resident tax against which credits are allowed for the nonresident taxes imposed by States Y and Z. Without taking any such credits into account, however, the amount of A's liability for such resident tax would be $1,500. A properly reports his nonresident income tax liabilities to States Y and Z at the same time that he files his return with respect to the State X tax, and he substantiates on such return his liabilities to States Y and Z.
(ii) The amount of A's income subject to tax in State X is $25,000 (his adjusted gross income of $24,000, minus the United States savings bond income of $1,000, plus the net tax-exempt income of $2,000). The amount of the credit allowable against the State X resident tax for the amount of A's liability with respect to the State Y nonresident tax is calculated as follows: The maximum amount of credit is the actual amount of his liability to Y, or $200. Under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of the credit is limited to $300 ($1,500 × $5,000/$25,000). Thus, such limit has no effect, and the full $200 is allowable as a credit against A's liability for the resident tax of State X. The amount of the credit allowable against the State X resident tax for the amount of A's liability with respect to the State Z nonresident tax is calculated as follows: The maximum amount of the credit is the actual amount of his liability to Z, or $1,400. Under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of the credit is limited to $900 (1,500 × $15,000/$25,000). Thus, such limit has the effect of reducing to $900 the amount of the credit allowable for tax of State Z against A's liability for the resident tax of State X.

# Example 2.
(i) B, a calendar-year, cash-basis taxpayer, is a resident of State X employed in State Y through March 14, 1977. On March 15, 1977, B becomes a resident of State Z and remains a resident of such State through the remainder of 1977. For 1977, the amount of B's adjusted gross income for Federal income tax purposes is $20,000, consisting of $6,000 derived from employment in State Y which B held during the period of his residence in State X, $12,000 derived from employment in State Z which B held during the period of his residence in State Z, and $2,000 in interest income from various bank accounts. During 1977, B has no interest income from United States obligations, and no tax-exempt income. For 1977, B incurs a liability of $200 to State Y on account of its nonresident income tax imposed with respect to his $6,000 of income derived from sources within that State. State Z, which has in effect a State agreement for 1977, imposes a resident income tax on B which, if B had been a resident of State Z for all 1977, would amount to $1,200 prior to the allowance of any credits under this paragraph. However, by reason of paragraph (e)(1) of § 301.6362-6, B's liability for the resident tax of State Z, before taking into account credits allowed under this paragraph, is reduced to $960 ($1,200 ×
292/365
, or
4/5
). Furthermore, State Z allows a credit for the nonresident tax imposed by State Y.
(ii) The amount of the credit allowable against the State Z resident tax for the amount of B's liability with respect to the State Y nonresident tax is calculated as follows: The maximum amount of the credit is the amount of his actual liability to State Y, or $200. Under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of the credit is limited to $288 ($960 × $6,000/$20,000). Thus, such limit has no effect, and the full $200 is allowable as a credit for tax of State Y against B's liability for the resident tax of State Z.

§ 301.6362-5
Qualified nonresident tax.
(a)
In general.
A tax meets the requirements of section 6362(d) and this section only if:
(1) The tax is imposed by a State which simultaneously imposes a resident tax meeting the requirements of section 6362(b) and § 301.6362-2 or of section 6362(c) and § 301.6362-3;
(2) The tax is required to be computed in accordance with either the method prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section or another method of which the Secretary or his delegate approves upon submission by the State of the laws pertaining to the tax;
(3) The tax is imposed only on the wage and other business income derived from sources within such State (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), of all individuals each of whom derives 25 percent or more of his aggregate wage and other business income for the taxable year from sources within such State while he is neither (i) a resident of such State within the meaning of section 6362(e) and § 301.6362-6, nor (ii) exempt from liability for the tax by reason of a reciprocal agreement between such State and the State of which he is a resident within the meaning of those provisions;
(4) The amount of the tax imposed with respect to any individual does not exceed the amount of tax for which such individual would be liable under the qualified resident tax imposed by such State if he were a resident of the State for the period during which he earned wage or other business income from sources within the State, and if his taxable income for such period were an amount equal to the sum of the zero bracket amount (within the meaning of section 63(d) and determined as if he had been a resident of the State for such period) and the excess of:
(i) The amount of his wage and other business income derived from sources within the State, over
(ii) That portion of the sum of the zero bracket amount and the nonbusiness deductions (
i.e.,
all deductions from adjusted gross income allowable in computing taxable income) taken into account for purposes of the State's qualified resident tax which bears the same ratio to such sum as the amount described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph bears to his total adjusted gross income for the year; and
(5) For purposes of the tax, wage or other business income is considered as being the income of the individual whose income it is for purposes of section 61.
(b)
Approved method of computing liability for qualified nonresident tax.
A tax satisfies the requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the amount of the tax is computed either as a percentage of the excess of the amount described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section over the amount described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, or by application of progressive rates to such excess.
(c)
Definition of wage and other business income.
For purposes of section 6362(d) and this section, the term “wage and other business income” means the following types of income:
(1) Wages, as defined in section 3401(a) and the regulations thereunder, but for these purposes:
(i) The amount of wages shall exclude amounts which are treated as wages under section 3402 (o) or (p) (relating to supplemental unemployment compensation benefits, annuity payments, and voluntary withholding agreements), and amounts which are treated as disability payments to the extent that they are excluded from gross income for Federal income tax purposes, pursuant to section 105(d), and
(ii) The amount of wages shall be reduced by those expenses which are directly related to the earning of such wages and with respect to which deductions are properly claimed from gross income in computing adjusted gross income;
(2) Net earnings from self-employment, as defined in section 1402(a); and
(3) The distributive share of income of any trade or business carried on by a trust, estate, or electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(a) and the regulations thereunder), to the extent that such share:
(i) Is includible in the gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year, and
(ii) Would constitute net earnings from self-employment if the trade or business were carried on by a partnership.
For purposes of this subparagraph, “distributive share” includes the income of a trust or estate which is taxable to the taxpayer as a beneficiary under applicable Federal income tax rules, and the undistributed taxable income of an electing small business corporation which is taxable to the taxpayer as a shareholder under section 1373.
(d)
Income derived from sources within a State
—(1)
Income attributable primarily to services.
Except as otherwise provided by Federal statute (see paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) of § 301.6362-7), wage income and other business income (net earnings from self-employment or distributive shares) which is attributable more to services performed by the taxpayer than to a capital investment of the taxpayer shall be considered to have been derived from sources within a State only if the services of the taxpayer which give rise to the income are performed in such State. If for a taxable year only a portion of the taxpayer's services giving rise to the income from one employment, trade, or business is performed within a State, then it shall be presumed that the amount of income from such employment, trade, or business
which is derived from sources within that State equals that portion of the total income derived from such employment, trade, or business for the year which the amount of time spent by the taxpayer for such year performing services with respect to that employment, trade, or business in that State bears to the aggregate amount of time spent by the taxpayer for such year performing all of such services. However, the presumption stated in the preceding sentence may be rebutted in the event that the taxpayer proves, by use of detailed records, that the correct allocation of his income is otherwise.
(2)
Income attributable primarily to investment.
Except as otherwise provided by Federal statute (see paragraph (j) of § 301.6362-7), business income (net earnings from self-employment or distributive shares) which is attributable more to a capital investment of the taxpayer than to services performed by the taxpayer shall be considered to have been derived from sources within the State, if any, in which the significant activities of the trade or business are conducted. If for the taxable year only a portion of the significant activities conducted with respect to one trade or business is conducted within a certain State, then the portion of the taxpayer's total income for the year from such trade or business which is considered to be derived from sources within that State shall be computed as follows:
(i)
Allocation by records.
The portion of the taxpayer's total income from the trade or business which is considered to be derived from sources within the State shall be the portion which is allocable to such sources according to the records of the taxpayer or of the partnership, trust, estate, or electing small business corporation from which his income is derived, provided that the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the district director, when requested to do so, that those records fairly and equitably reflect the income which is allocable to sources within the State. An allocation made pursuant to this subdivision shall be based on the location of the significant activities of the trade or business, and not on the location at which the taxpayer's personal services are performed.
(ii)
Allocation by formula.
If the taxpayer (or the trade or business) does not keep records meeting the requirements of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, or if the taxpayer fails to meet the burden of proof set forth therein, then the amount of the taxpayer's income from the trade or business which is considered to be derived from sources within the State shall be determined by multiplying the total of his income (as defined in paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section) from the trade or business for the taxable year by the percentage which is the average of these three percentages:
(A)
Property percentage.
The percentage computed by dividing the average of the value, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of real and tangible personal property connected with the taxpayer's trade or business and located within the State, by the average of the value, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of all such property located both within and without the State. For this purpose, real property shall include real property rented to the taxpayer in connection with the trade or business, or rented to the trade or business.
(B)
Payroll percentage.
The percentage computed by dividing the total wages, salaries, and other compensation for personal services which is paid or incurred during the taxable year to employees in connection with the taxpayer's trade or business, and which would be treated as derived by such employees from sources within the State pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (d), by the total of all such wages, salaries, and other compensation for personal services which is so paid or incurred without regard to whether such payments would be treated as derived by the employees from sources within the State. For purposes of this subdivision (ii), no amount paid as deferred compensation pursuant to a retirement plan to a former employee shall be taken into consideration.
(C)
Gross income percentage.
The percentage computed by dividing the gross sales or charges for services performed by or through an agency located within the State by the total of all gross sales or charges for services performed both within and without the State. The
sales or charges to be allocated to the State shall include all sales which are negotiated, and charges which are for services performed, by an employee, agent, agency, or independent contractor chiefly situated at, or working principally out of an office located within, the State.
(3)
Income attributable to real estate investment.
Notwithstanding subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (d), income and deductions from the rental of real property, and gain and loss from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of real property, shall not be subject to allocation under subparagraph (2), but shall be considered as entirely derived from sources located within the State in which such property is located.
(4)
Treatment of losses.
A loss attributable to the taxpayer's employment, or to his conduct of, participation in, or investment in a trade or business, shall be allocated in the same manner as the income attributable to such employment or trade or business would be allocated pursuant to this paragraph.
(5)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, an employee who earns $10,000 in wage income attributable to services, and who has no other wage or other business income, spends 60 percent of his working time performing services for his employer in State X, 30 percent in State Y, and 10 percent in State Z. In the absence of the requisite proof to the contrary, A's wage income is considered to have been derived 60 percent from sources located within State X, 30 percent within State Y, and 10 percent within State Z. Assuming that A is a nonresident with respect to all three States, and that they all impose qualified nonresident taxes, then the qualified nonresident tax of State X is imposed on $6,000, the qualified nonresident tax of State Y is imposed on $3,000, and the qualified nonresident tax of State Z is not imposed on any of the income because A did not derive at least 25 percent of his wage and other business income from sources located within State Z.

# Example 2.
B, who earns no wage income but who has a total of $10,000 of other business income for the taxable year, all of which is net income from self-employment attributable primarily to services, spends 45 percent of his working time performing services in State X, 30 percent in State Y, and 25 percent in State Z. However, the rates that B is able to charge for his services and the business expenses which he incurs vary in the different States, and he is able to prove by detailed records that his net income from self-employment was in fact derived 50 percent from sources located within State X, 35 percent from sources located within State Y, and 15 percent from sources located within State Z. Assuming that B is a nonresident with respect to all three States, and that they all impose qualified nonresident taxes, then the qualified nonresident tax of State X is imposed on $5,000, the qualified nonresident tax of State Y is imposed on $3,500, and the qualified nonresident tax of State Z is not imposed on any of the income because B did not derive at least 25 percent of his wage and other business income from sources located within State Z.

# Example 3.
C is a partner in a profitable business concern, in which he has a substantial capital investment. His net earnings from self-employment attributable to his partnership interest are $75,000 for the taxable year. The fair market value of the services which C performs for the partnership during the taxable year is $30,000. C's income is therefore attributable primarily to his capital investment. The partnership business is carried on partially within and partially without State X. Neither C nor the partnership maintains records from which the portion of C's $75,000 income which is considered to be derived from sources within State X can be satisfactorily proven. As determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the partnership's “property percentage” in State X is 70, its “payroll percentage” therein is 60, and its “gross income percentage” therein is 56. The amount of C's partnership income considered to be derived from sources within State X is $46,500 ($75,000 × 62 percent). This result would obtain even if C's services for the partnership are performed entirely within State X.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in (3), except that the records of the partnership of which C is a member indicate that the net profits of the partnership are derived 40 percent from business activities conducted in State X, and 60 percent from business activities conducted in State Y. C is requested to prove that those records fairly and equitably reflect the income which is allocable to sources within State X. The documentary evidence which he adduces in support of the allocation made by the records shows how such allocation results from a careful step-by-step tracing of the profitability of each phase and aspect of the partnership's operations, and shows the State in which each such phase and aspect of the operations is conducted. C's proof is satisfactory to show that the percentage allocation, and the amount of his partnership income considered to be derived from sources within State X is $30,000, or $75,000 multiplied by 40 percent. This result would obtain even if B's services
for the partnership are performed entirely within State X.
[T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59367, Dec. 20, 1978]
§ 301.6362-6
Requirements relating to residence.
(a)
In general.
A tax imposed by a State meets the requirements of section 6362(e) and this section if in effect it provides that:
(1) The State of residence of an individual, estate, or trust is determined according to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) respectively, of section 6362(e), and according to paragraph (b), (c), or (d), respectively, of this section.
(2) The liability for a resident tax imposed by such State upon an individual or trust which changes residence to another State in the taxable year is determined according to section 6362(e)(4) and paragraph (e) of this section.
(3) The rules relating to current collection of tax apply as provided in section 6362(e)(5) and paragraph (f) of this section.
(b)
Residence of an individual
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph (b), an individual is treated as a resident of a State with respect to a taxable year only if:
(i) His principal place of residence (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b)) is within such State for a period of at least 135 consecutive days, at least 30 days of which are in such taxable year; or
(ii) In the case of a citizen or resident of the United States who is not a resident of any State (determined as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) with respect to such taxable year, his domicile (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (b)) is in such State for at least 30 days during such taxable year.
With respect to an individual who is a resident (determined as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) of more than one State during a taxable year, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(2)
Principal place of residence
—(i)
Definition.
For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph (b), and paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the term “principal place of residence” shall mean the place which is an individual's primary home. An individual's temporary absence from his primary home shall not effect a change with respect thereto. On the other hand, if an individual moves to another State, other than as a mere transient or sojourner, he shall be treated as having changed the location of his primary home.
(ii)
Examples.
The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A has a city home and a country home. He resides in the city home for 7 months of the year and uses the address of that home as his legal residence for purposes of driver's license, automobile registration, and voter registration. He resides in the country home 5 months of the year. His city home is considered his principal place of residence.

# Example 2.
During the taxable year, B, a construction worker, is employed at several different locations in different States. The duration of each job on which he is employed ranges from a few weeks to several months, and he knows when he accepts a job what its approximate duration will be. He owns a house in State X which he uses as his legal residence for purposes of driver's license, automobile registration, and voter registration. In addition, his family lives there during the entire year, and B lives there during periods between jobs. However, the duration of the jobs and the distance between the job-sites and his house require him to live in the localities of the respective job-sites during the period of his employment, although occasionally he returns to his house in State X on weekends. B's house in State X is his principal place of residence during all of the taxable year.

# Example 3.
C, a dependent of his parents who are residents of State X, is a full-time student in a 4-year degree program at a college in State Y. During the 9-month academic year, C lives on the college campus, but he returns to his parents' home in State X for the summer recess. C gives the State Y as his residence for purposes of his driver's license and voter registration, but lists the address of his parents' home in State X as his “permanent address” on the records of the college which he attends. Although C's domicile remains at his parents' home in State X, his presence in State Y cannot be regarded as that of a mere transient or sojourner; accordingly, C's principal place of residence is in State Y for that portion of the taxable year during which he attends college.

# Example 4.
D loses his job in State X, where he lived and worked for many years. After a series of unsuccessful attempts to find other employment in State X, he accepts a job in State Y. D gives up his apartment in State X and moves to State Y upon commencing his
new job; however, he intends to continue to explore available employment opportunities in State X so that he may return there as soon as an opportunity to do so arises. D changes his principal place of residence when he moves to State Y.
(3)
Domicile defined.
For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph (b), and paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the term “domicile” shall mean an individual's fixed or permanent home. An individual acquires a domicile in a place by living there; even for a brief period of time, with no definite present intention of later removing therefrom. Residence without the requisite intention to remain indefinitely will not suffice to change domicile, nor will intention to change domicile effect such a change until accompanied by actual removal. A domicile, once acquired, is maintained until a new domicile is acquired.
(4)
Period of residence
—(i)
General rule.
An individual who becomes a resident of a State pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (b), or who is at the beginning of a taxable year a resident of a State pursuant to such provision, shall be treated as continuing to be a resident of such State through the end of the taxable year, unless, prior thereto, such individual becomes a resident, under the principles of subparagraph (1), of another State or a possession or foreign country. In the event that the individual becomes a resident of such another jurisdiction prior to the end of the taxable year, his residence in such State shall be treated as ending on the day prior to the day on which he becomes a resident of such other jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph (1).
(ii)
Examples.
The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a calendar-year taxpayer, has his principal place of residence in State X from the beginning of 1976 through August 1, 1976, when he gives up pemanently such principal place of residence. He spends the remainder of 1976 traveling outside of the United States, but does not become a resident of any other country. A is considered to be a resident of State X for the entire year 1976.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that A ceases his traveling and establishes his principal place of residence in State Y on November 15, 1976. Assume, also, that A maintains that principal place of residence for more than 135 consecutive days. Under these circumstances, for his taxable year 1976, A is considered to be a resident of State X from January 1 through November 14, and a resident of State Y from November 15 through December 31.
(5)
Special rules.
(i) No provision of subchapter E or the regulations thereunder shall be construed to require or authorize the treatment of a Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner as a resident of a State other than the State which he represents in Congress.
(ii) For special rules relating to members of the Armed Forces, see paragraph (h) of § 301.6362-7.
(6)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a calendar-year taxpayer, maintains his principal place of residence in State X from December 1, 1976, through April 15, 1977. Assuming that A was not a resident of any other jurisdiction at any time during 1976, A is treated as a resident of State X for the entire year 1976. Such result would obtain even if A was absent from State X on vacation for some portion of December 1976. Moreover, such result would obtain even if it is assumed that A was a domiciliary of State Y from January 1, 1976, through April 15, 1977, because an individual's domicile does not determine his residence so long as residence in one State for the taxable year can be determined from the general rule stated in the first sentence of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 (including the fact of A's domicile in State Y), except that A maintained his principal place of residence in State Z from September 15, 1975, through January 31, 1976, inclusive. With respect to the year 1976, A is treated as a resident of State Z from January 1 through November 30, and as a resident of State X from December 1 through December 31. A's liability for the qualified taxes of the respective States for 1976 shall be determined pursuant to the provisions in paragraph (e) of this section.
(c)
Residence of an estate.
An estate of an individual is treated as a resident of the last State of which such individual was a resident, as determined under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section, prior to his death. However, the estate of an individual who was not a resident of any State (as determined without regard to the 30-day requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) immediately prior to his death,
and who was not a resident of any State at any time during the 3-year period ending on the date of his death, is not treated as a resident of any State. For purposes of determining the decedent's last State of residence, the rules of paragraph (b) shall be applied irrespective of whether subchapter E was in effect at the time the period of 135 consecutive days of residence began, or whether the decedent's last State of residence is a State electing to enter into an agreement pursuant to subchapter E. The determination of the State of residence of an estate pursuant to this paragraph shall not be governed by any determination under State law as to which State is treated as the residence or domicile of the decedent for purposes other than its individual income tax (such as liability for State inheritance tax or jurisdiction of probate proceedings).
(d)
Residence of a trust
—(1)
In general.
(i) The State of residence of a trust shall be determined by reference to the circumstances of the individual who, by either an inter-vivos transfer or a testamentary transfer, is deemed to be the “principal contributor” to the trust under the provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
(ii) If only one individual has ever contributed assets to the trust, including the assets which were transferred to the trust at its inception, then such individual is the principal contributor to the trust. However, if on any day subsequent to the initial creation of the trust, such trust receives assets having a value greater than the aggregate value of all assets theretofore contributed to it, then the trust shall be deemed (for the limited purpose of determining the State of residence) to have been “created” anew, and the individual who on the day of such creation contributed more (in value) than any other individual contributed on that day shall become the principal contributor to the trust. When a trust is created anew, all references in this paragraph to the creation of the trust shall be construed as referring to the most recent creation. For purposes of this paragraph, the value of any asset shall be its fair market value on the day that it was contributed to the trust; any subsequent appreciation or depreciation in the value of the asset shall be disregarded.
(2)
Testamentary trust.
A trust with respect to which a deceased individual is the principal contributor by reason of property passing on his death is treated as a resident of the last State of which such individual was a resident, as determined under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section, before his death. However, if such deceased individual was not a resident of any State (as determined without regard to the 30-day requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) immediately prior to his death, and was not a resident of any State at any time during the 3-year period ending on the date of his death, then a testamentary trust of which he is the principal contributor by reason of property passing on his death is not treated as a resident of any State. All property passing on the transferor's death is treated for this purpose as a contribution made to the trust on the date of death, regardless of when the property is actually paid over to the trust.
(3)
Nontestamentary trust.
A trust which is not a trust described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (d), is treated as a resident of the State in which the principal contributor to the trust, during the 3-year period ending on the date of the creation of the trust, had his principal place of residence for an aggregate number of days longer than the aggregate number of days he had his principal place of residence in any other State. However, if the principal contributor to such a trust was not a resident of any State at any time during such 3-year period, then the trust is not treated as a resident of any State.
(4)
Special rules.
If the application of the provisions of the foregoing subparagraphs of this paragraph results in a determination of more than one State of residence for a trust, or does not provide a rule by which the residence or nonresidence of the trust can be determined, then the determination of the State of residence of such trust shall be made according to the rules of the applicable subdivision of this subparagraph.
(i) If, at the time of creation of the trust, 50 percent or more in value of
the trust corpus consists of real property, then the trust shall be treated as a resident of the State in which more of the real property (in value) which was in the trust at such time was located than any other State.
(ii) If, at the time of creation of the trust, less than 50 percent in value of the trust corpus consists of real property, then the trust shall be treated as a resident of the State in which, at such time, the trustee, if an individual, had his principal place of residence, or, if a corporation, had its principal place of business. If there were two or more trustees, then the foregoing sentence shall be applied by reference to the principal places of residence, or of business, of the majority of trustees who had authority to make investment and other management decisions for the trust.
(iii) If, after application of the provisions of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, the State of residence of the trust still cannot be ascertained, then the Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall determine the State of residence of such trust for purposes of qualified taxes. Such determination shall be made by reference to the number of significant contacts each State had with the trust at the time of its creation. Significant contacts shall include the principal place of residence of the principal contributor or contributors to the trust, the principal place of residence or business of the trustee (or trustees), the situs of the assets of which the trust corpus was composed, and the location from which management decisions emanated with respect to the business and investment interests of the trusts.
(5)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A created a trust in 1950 by transferring to it certain stock in a corporation. At the time of such transfer, the stock had a fair market value of $1,000. A at all relevant times had his principal place of residence in State X, and accordingly the trust is treated as a resident of such State for qualified tax purposes. As of January 1, 1977, the stock originally contributed by A, which was at all times the only property in the trust, has a fair market value of $3,000. On such date, B, who has had his principal place of residence in State Y for more than 3 years, contributes to the trust property having a fair market value of $1,200. For purposes of determining the identity of the principal contributor to the trust and the State of residence of the trust, the stock contributed by A in 1950 continues to be valued for such purposes at $1,000. Thus, the trust is treated as being created anew on January 1, 1977, with B as the principal contributor, and with State Y as its State of residence.

# Example 2.
C has his principal place of residence in State X continuously for many years, until August 1, 1978, when he establishes his principal place of residence in State Y. The change of residence is intended to be permanent, and C has no further contact with State X after such change. On January 1, 1980, C creates a nontestamentary trust. During the 3-year period ending on such date C had his principal place of residence in State X for 576 days, and in State Y for 519 days. Therefore, the trust is treated as a resident of State X.
(e)
Liability for tax on change of residence during taxable year
—(1)
In general.
If, under the principles contained in paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, an individual or trust becomes a resident, or ceases to be a resident, of a State, and is also a resident of another jurisdiction outside of such State during the same taxable year, the liability of such individual or trust for the resident tax of such State shall be determined by multiplying the amount which would be his or its liability for tax (computed after allowing the nonrefundable credits (
i.e.
, credits not corresponding to the credits referred to in section 6401(b) available against the tax)) if he or it had been a resident of such State for the entire taxable year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days he or it was a resident of such State during the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the taxable year. The preceding sentence shall not apply by reason of the fact that an individual is born or dies during the taxable year, or by reason of the fact that a trust comes into existence or ceases to exist during the taxable year.
(2)
Residence determined by domicile.
When an individual is treated as a resident of a State by reason of being domiciled in such State, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, then the numerator of the fraction provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (e),
shall be the number of days the individual was domiciled in the State during the taxable year.
(3)
Example.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A, a calendar-year taxpayer, is a resident of State X continuously for many years prior to March 15, 1977. On such date, A retires and establishes a new principal place of residence in State Y. A earns $6,000 in 1977 prior to March 15, but receives no taxable income for the remainder of such year. If A had been a resident of State X for the entire taxable year 1977, his liability with respect to the qualified tax of such State (computed after allowing the nonrefundable credits available against the tax) would be $600. If he had been a resident of State Y for the entire taxable year 1977, his liability with respect to the qualified tax on that State (computed similarly) would be $400. Pursuant to the provisions in paragraph (e) of this section, A's liabilities for State qualified taxes for 1977 are as follows:
Liability for State
X
tax = $600 × 73 / 365 = $120
Liability for State
Y
Tax = $400 × 292 / 365 = $320.
(f)
Current collection of tax.
The State tax laws shall contain provisions for methods of current collection with respect to individuals which correspond to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 with respect to such current collection, including chapter 24 (relating to the collection of income tax at source on wages) and sections 6015, 6073, 6153, and other provisions of the Code relating to declarations (and amendments thereto) and payments of estimated income tax. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statute (see paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) of § 301.6362-7), in applying such provisions of the State tax laws:
(1) In the case of a resident tax, an individual shall be subject to the current collection provisions if either—
(i) He is a resident of the State within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section, or
(ii) He has his principal place of residence (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) within the State,
And it is reasonable to expect him to have it within the State for 30 days or more during the taxable year.
(2) In the case of a nonresident tax, an individual shall be subject to the current collection provisions if he does not meet either description relating to an individual in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (f), if he is not exempt from liability for the tax by reason for a reciprocal agreement between the State of which he is a resident and the State imposing the tax, and if it is reasonable to expect him to receive wage or other business income derived from sources within the State imposing the tax (as defined in paragraph (d) of § 301.6362-5) for services performed on 30 days or more of the taxable year.
For additional rules relating to withholding see paragraph (d) of § 301.6361-1.
[T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59369, Dec. 20, 1978]
§ 301.6362-7
Additional requirements.
A State tax meets the additional requirements of section 6362(f) and this section only if:
(a)
State agreement must be in effect for period concerned.
A State agreement, as defined in paragraph (a) of § 301.6361-4, is in effect with respect to such tax for the taxable period in question.
(b)
State laws must contain certain provisions.
Under the laws of such State, the provisions of subchapter E and the regulations thereunder, as in effect from time to time, are applicable for the entire period for which the State agreement is in effect. Any change made by the State in such tax (other than an adjustment in the State law which is made solely in order to comply with a change in the Federal Law or regulations) shall not apply to taxable years beginning in any calendar year for which the State agreement is in effect unless the change is enacted before November 1 of such year.
(c)
State individual income tax laws can be only of certain kinds.
Such State does not impose any tax on the income of individuals other than (1) a qualified resident tax, and (2) either or both a qualified nonresident tax and a separate tax on income which is not wage and other business income as defined in paragraph (c) of § 301.6362-5 and which is received or accrued by individuals who are domiciled in the State, but who are not residents of the State (as defined in paragraph (b) of § 301.6362-6). For purposes of this paragraph, a tax imposed on the amount taxed under section 56 (as permitted under
§ 301.6362-2(b)(2)) shall be treated as an adjustment to and a part of the qualified resident tax. Also, tax laws which were in effect prior to the effective date of a State agreement and which are not repealed, but which are made inapplicable for the period during which the State agreement is in effect, shall be disregarded.
(d)
Taxable years must coincide.
The taxable years of all individuals, estates, and trusts under such tax are required to coincide with their taxable years used for purposes of the taxes imposed by chapter 1. Accordingly, when subchapter E begins to apply to a State, a taxpayer whose taxable year for purposes of the Federal income tax is different from his taxable year for purposes of the State income tax which precedes the qualified tax may have one short taxable year for purposes of such State income tax, so that thereafter his taxable years for purposes of the qualified tax will coincide with the Federal taxable year.
(e)
Married individuals.
Individuals who are married within the meaning of section 143 of the Code are prohibited from filing (1) a joint return for purposes of such State tax if they file separate Federal income tax returns, or (2) separate returns for purposes for such State tax if they file a joint Federal income tax return.
(f)
Penalties; no double jeopardy.
Under the laws of such State:
(1) Civil and criminal sanctions identical to those provided by subtitle F, and by title 18 of the United States Code (relating to crimes and criminal procedures), with respect to the taxes imposed on the income of individuals by chapter 1 and on the wages of individuals by chapter 24, apply to individuals and their employers who are subject to such State tax (and the collection and administration thereof, including the corresponding withholding tax imposed to implement the current collection of such State tax) as if such tax were imposed by chapter 1 or chapter 24, in the case of the withholding tax), except to the extent that the application of such sanctions is modified by regulations issued under subchapter E; and
(2) No other sanctions or penalties apply with respect to any act or omission to act in respect of such State tax.
See also paragraph (e) of § 301.6361-1 with respect to criminal penalties.
(g)
Partnerships, trusts, subchapter S corporations, and other conduit entities.
Under the laws of such State, the State tax treatment of—
(1) Partnerships and partners,
(2) Trusts and their beneficiaries,
(3) Estate and their beneficiaries,
(4) Electing small business corporations (within the meaning of section 1371(a) and their shareholders, and
