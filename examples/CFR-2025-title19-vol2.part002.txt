(6) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under section 5(1), the transaction value cannot be determined under the provisions of section 2(1). For an illustration of this, a royalty is paid on the basis of the price actually paid or payable in a sale of a liter of a particular good that is produced by using a material that was purchased by the kilogram and made up into a solution. If the royalty is based partially on the purchased material and partially on other factors that have nothing to do with that material, such as when the purchased material is mixed with other ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the seller and the producer, it would be inappropriate to add the royalty and the transaction value of the material could not be determined. However, if the amount of the royalty is based only on the purchased material and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be made and the transaction value can be determined.

# SECTION 3.
(1) In determining whether the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3)(d), the fact that the seller and the producer are related persons shall not in itself be grounds for the customs administration to render the transaction value unacceptable. In such cases, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted provided that the relationship between the seller and the producer did not influence the price actually paid or payable. Where the customs administration has reasonable grounds for considering that the relationship between the seller and the producer influenced the price, the customs administration shall communicate the grounds to the producer, and that producer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the grounds communicated by the customs administration. If that producer so requests, the customs administration shall communicate in writing the grounds on which it considers that the relationship between the seller and the producer influenced the price actually paid or payable.
(2) Subsection (1) provides that, where the seller and the producer are related persons, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the value provided that the relationship between the seller and the producer did not influence the price actually paid or payable. It is not intended under subsection (1) that there should be an examination of the circumstances in all cases where the seller and the producer are related persons. Such an examination will only be required where the customs administration has doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable because of the relationship between the seller and the producer. Where the customs administration does not have doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable, it shall accept that price without requesting further information. For an illustration of this, the customs administration may have previously examined the relationship between the seller and the producer, or it may already have detailed
information concerning the relationship between the seller and the producer, and may already be satisfied from that examination or information that the relationship between them did not influence the price actually paid or payable.
(3) In applying subsection (1), where the seller and the producer are related persons and the customs administration has doubts that the transaction value is acceptable without further inquiry, the customs administration shall give the producer an opportunity to supply such further information as may be necessary to enable it to examine the circumstances surrounding the sale. In such a case, the customs administration shall examine the relevant aspects of the sale, including the way in which the seller and the producer organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price actually paid or payable by that producer for the material being valued was arrived at, in order to determine whether the relationship between the seller and the producer influenced that price actually paid or payable. Where it can be shown that the seller and the producer buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related persons, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between them. For an illustration of this, if the price actually paid or payable for the material had been settled in a manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in question or with the way in which the seller settles prices for sales to unrelated buyers, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the producer and the seller. For another illustration of this, where it is shown that the price actually paid or payable for the material is adequate to ensure recovery of the total cost of producing the material plus a profit that is representative of the seller's overall profit realized over a representative period of time, such as on an annual basis, in sales of materials of the same class or kind, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the seller and the producer.
(4) In a sale between a seller and a producer who are related persons, the transaction value shall be accepted and determined in accordance with section 2(1), wherever the seller or the producer demonstrates that the transaction value of the material in that sale closely approximates one of the following test values that occurs at or about the same time as the sale and is chosen by the seller or the producer:
(a) the transaction value in sales to unrelated buyers of identical materials or similar materials, as determined in accordance with section 2(1);
(b) the value of identical materials or similar materials, as determined in accordance with section 9; or
(c) the value of identical materials or similar materials, as determined in accordance with section 10.
(5) In applying a test value referred to in subsection (4), due account shall be taken of demonstrated differences in commercial levels, quantity levels, the value of the elements specified in section 5(1)(b) and the costs incurred by the seller in sales to unrelated buyers that are not incurred by the seller in sales by the seller to a related person.
(6) The application of a test value referred to in subsection (4) shall be used at the initiative of the seller, or at the initiative of the producer with the consent of the seller, and shall be used only for comparison purposes to determine whether the transaction value of the material is acceptable. The test value shall not be used as the transaction value of that material.
(7) Subsection (4) provides an opportunity for the seller or the producer to demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates a test value previously accepted by the customs administration of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, and is therefore acceptable under subsection (1). Where the application of a test value under subsection (4) demonstrates that the transaction value of the material being valued is acceptable, the customs administration shall not examine the question of influence in regard to the relationship between
the seller and the producer under subsection (1). Where the customs administration already has sufficient information available, without further inquiries, that the transaction value closely approximates one of the test values determined under subsection (4), the seller or the producer is not required to apply a test value to demonstrate that the transaction value is acceptable under that subsection.
(8) A number of factors must be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the transaction value of the identical materials or similar materials closely approximates the transaction value of the material being valued. These factors include the nature of the material, the nature of the industry itself, the season in which the material is sold, and whether the difference in values is commercially significant. Since these factors may vary from case to case, it would be impossible to apply an acceptable standardized difference such as a fixed amount or fixed percentage difference in each case. For an illustration of this, a small difference in value in a case involving one type of material could be unacceptable, while a large difference in a case involving another type of material might be acceptable for the purposes of determining whether the transaction value closely approximates a test value set out in subsection (4).

# SECTION 4.
(1) The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the producer to or for the benefit of the seller of the material. The payment need not necessarily take the form of a transfer of money: it may be made by letters of credit or negotiable instruments. Payment may be made directly or indirectly to the seller. For an illustration of this, the settlement by the producer, whether in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller, is an indirect payment.
(2) Activities undertaken by the producer on the producer's own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in section 5, shall not be considered to be an indirect payment, even though the activities might be regarded as being for the benefit of the seller.
(3) The transaction value shall not include charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance or technical assistance related to the use of the material by the producer, provided that they are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable.
(4) The flow of dividends or other payments from the producer to the seller that do not relate to the purchase of the material are not part of the transaction value.

# SECTION 5.
(1) In determining the transaction value of the material, the following shall be added to the price actually paid or payable:
(a) to the extent that they are incurred by the producer with respect to the material being valued and are not included in the price actually paid or payable,
(i) commissions and brokerage fees, except buying commissions, and
(ii) the costs of containers which, for customs purposes, are classified with the material under the Harmonized System;
(b) the value, reasonably allocated in accordance with subsection (12), of the following elements where they are supplied directly or indirectly to the seller by the producer free of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production and sale of the material, to the extent that the value is not included in the price actually paid or payable:
(i) a material, other than an indirect material, used in the production of the material being valued,
(ii) tools, dies, molds and similar indirect materials used in the production of the material being valued,
(iii) an indirect material, other than those referred to in subparagraph (ii) or in paragraphs (c), (e) or (f) of the definition “indirect material” set out in Article 415 of the Agreement, as implemented by section 2(1) of this appendix, used in the production of the material being valued, and
(iv) engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches performed outside the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located that are necessary for the production of the material being valued;
(c) the royalties related to the material, other than charges with respect to the right to reproduce the material in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located that the producer must pay directly or indirectly as a condition of sale of the material, to the extent that such royalties are not included in the price actually paid or payable; and
(d) the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent disposal or use of the material that accrues directly or indirectly to the seller.
(2) The additions referred to in subsection (1) shall be made to the price actually paid or payable under this section only on the basis of objective and quantifiable data.
(3) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under subsection (1), the transaction value cannot be determined under section 2(1).
(4) No additions shall be made to the price actually paid or payable for the purpose of determining the transaction value except as provided in this section.
(5) The amounts to be added under subsection (1)(a) shall be those amounts that are recorded on the books of the producer.
(6) The value of the elements referred to in subsection (1)(b)(i) shall be
(a) where the elements are imported from outside the territory of the NAFTA country in which the seller is located, the customs value of the elements,
(b) where the producer, or a related person on behalf of the producer, purchases the elements from an unrelated person in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the seller is located, the price actually paid or payable for the elements,
(c) where the producer, or a related person on behalf of the producer, acquires the elements from an unrelated person in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the seller is located other than through a purchase, the value of the consideration related to the acquisition of the elements, based on the cost of the consideration that is recorded on the books of the producer or the related person, or
(d) where the elements are produced by the producer, or by a related person, in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the seller is located, the total cost of the elements, determined in accordance with subsection (7),
and shall include the following costs, that are recorded on the books of the producer or the related person supplying the elements on behalf of the producer, to the extent that such costs are not included under paragraph (a) through (d):
(e) the costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the elements to the location of the seller,
(f) duties and taxes paid or payable with respect to the elements, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable,
(g) customs brokerage fees, including the cost of in-house customs brokerage services, incurred with respect to the elements, and
(h) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the elements in the production of the material, minus the value of reusable scrap or by-product.
(7) For the purposes of subsection (6)(d), the total cost of the elements referred to in subsection (1)(b)(i) shall be
(a) where the elements are produced by the producer, at the choice of the producer,
(i) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the producer, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the producer, that can be reasonably allocated to the elements in accordance with Schedule VII, or
(ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by the producer that forms
part of the total cost incurred with respect to the elements, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the producer, that can be reasonably allocated to the elements in accordance with Schedule VII; and
(b) where the elements are produced by a person who is related to the producer, at the choice of the producer,
(i) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that related person, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of that person, that can be reasonably allocated to the elements in accordance with Schedule VII, or
(ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by that related person that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the elements, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of that person, that can be reasonably allocated to the elements in accordance with Schedule VII.
(8) Except as provided in subsections (10) and (11), the value of the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through (iv) shall be
(a) the cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of the producer; or
(b) where such elements are provided by another person on behalf of the producer and the cost is not recorded on the books of the producer, the cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of that other person.
(9) Where the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through (iv) were previously used by or on behalf of the producer, the value of the elements shall be adjusted downward to reflect that use.
(10) Where the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (iii) were leased by the producer or a person related to the producer, the value of the elements shall be the cost of the lease that is recorded on the books of the producer or that related person.
(11) No addition shall be made to the price actually paid or payable for the elements referred to in subsection (1)(b)(iv) that are available in the public domain, other than the cost of obtaining copies of them.
(12) The producer shall choose the method of allocating to the material the value of the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through (iv), provided that the value is reasonably allocated to the material in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. The methods the producer may choose to allocate the value include allocating the value over the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment or allocating the value over the entire anticipated production where contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. For an illustration of this, a producer provides the seller with a mold to be used in the production of the material and contracts with the seller to buy 10,000 units of that material. By the time the first shipment of 1,000 units arrives, the seller has already produced 4,000 units. In these circumstances, the producer may choose to allocate the value of the mold over 4,000 units or 10,000 units but shall not choose to allocate the value of the elements to the first shipment of 1,000 units. The producer may choose to allocate the entire value of the elements to a single shipment of material only where that single shipment comprises all of the units of the material acquired by the producer under the contract or commitment for that number of units of the material between the seller and the producer.
(13) The addition for the royalties referred to in subsection (1)(c) shall be the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of the producer, or where the payment for the royalties is recorded on the books of another person, the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of that other person.
(14) The value of the proceeds referred to in subsection (1)(d) shall be the amount that is recorded for such proceeds on the books of the producer or the seller.

# SECTION 6.
(1) If there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under section
2(3), the value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be the transaction value of identical materials sold, at or about the same time as the material being valued was shipped to the producer, to a buyer located in the same country as the producer.
(2) In applying this section, the transaction value of identical materials in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity of materials as the material being valued shall be used to determine the value of the material. Where no such sale is found, the transaction value of identical materials sold at a different commercial level or in different quantities, adjusted to take into account the differences attributable to the commercial level or quantity, shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that the adjustment is reasonable and accurate, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.
(3) A condition for adjustment under subsection (2) because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment be made only on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that an adjustment is reasonable and accurate. For an illustration of this, a bona fide price list contains prices for different quantities. If the material being valued consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only identical materials for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's bona fide price list and using the price applicable to a sale of 10 units. This does not require that sales had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective measure, however, the determination of a value under this section is not appropriate.
(4) If more than one transaction value of identical materials is found, the lowest such value shall be used to determine the value of the material under this section.

# SECTION 7.
(1) If there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), and the value of the material cannot be determined under section 6, the value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be the transaction value of similar materials sold, at or about the same time as the material being valued was shipped to the producer, to a buyer located in the same country as the producer.
(2) In applying this section, the transaction value of similar materials in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity of materials as the material being valued shall be used to determine the value of the material. Where no such sale is found, the transaction value of similar materials sold at a different commercial level or in different quantities, adjusted to take into account the differences attributable to the commercial level or quantity, shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that the adjustment is reasonable and accurate, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.
(3) A condition for adjustment under subsection (2) because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment be made only on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that an adjustment is reasonable and accurate. For an illustration of this, a bona fide price list contains prices for different quantities. If the material being valued consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only similar materials for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's bona fide price list and using the price applicable to a sale of 10 units. This does not require that sales had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list
has been established as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective measure, however, the determination of a value under this section is not appropriate.
(4) If more than one transaction value of similar materials is found, the lowest such value shall be used to determine the value of the material under this section.

# SECTION 8.
If there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), and the value of the material cannot be determined under section 6 or 7, the value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be determined under section 9 or, when the value cannot be determined under that section, under section 10 except that, at the request of the producer, the order of application of sections 9 and 10 shall be reversed.

# SECTION 9.
(1) Under this section, if identical materials or similar materials are sold in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, in the same condition as the material was in when received by the producer, the value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be based on the unit price at which those identical materials or similar materials are sold, in the greatest aggregate quantity by the producer or, where the producer does not sell those identical materials or similar materials, by a person at the same trade level as the producer, at or about the same time as the material being valued is received by the producer, to persons located in that territory who are not related to the seller, subject to deductions for the following:
(a) either the amount of commissions usually earned or the amount generally reflected for profit and general expenses, in connection with sales, in the territory of that NAFTA country, of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued; and
(b) taxes, if included in the unit price, payable in the territory of that NAFTA country, which are either waived, refunded or recoverable by way of credit against taxes actually paid or payable.
(2) If neither identical materials nor similar materials are sold at or about the same time the material being valued is received by the producer, the value shall, subject to the deductions provided for under subsection (1), be based on the unit price at which identical materials or similar materials are sold in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, in the same condition as the material was in when received by the producer, at the earliest date within 90 days after the date the material being valued was received by the producer.
(3) The expression “unit price at which those identical materials or similar materials are sold, in the greatest aggregate quantity” in subsection (1) means the price at which the greatest number of units is sold in sales between unrelated persons. For an illustration of this, materials are sold from a price list which grants favorable unit prices for purchases made in larger quantities.
Sale quantity
Unit price
Number of sales
Total quantity sold at each price
1-10 units
100
10 sales of 5 units
65
5 sales of 3 units
11-25 units
95
5 sales of 11 units
55
1 sale of 20 units
Over 25 units
90
1 sale of 30 units
80
1 sale of 50 units
The greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 80; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is 90.
As another illustration of this, two sales occur. In the first sale 500 units are sold at a price of 95 currency units each. In the second sale 400 units are sold at a price of 90 currency units each. In this illustration, the greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 500; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is 95.
(4) Any sale to a person who supplies, directly or indirectly, free of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production of the material, any of the elements specified in section 5(1)(b), shall not be taken into account in establishing the unit price for the purposes of this section.
(5) The amount generally reflected for profit and general expenses referred to in subsection (1)(a) shall be taken as a whole. The figure for the purposes of deducting an amount for profit and general expenses shall be determined on the basis of information supplied by or on behalf of the producer unless the figures provided by the producer are inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales, in the country in which the producer is located, of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued. Where the figures provided by the producer are inconsistent with those figures, the amount for profit and general expenses shall be based on relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer.
(6) For the purposes of this section, general expenses are the direct and indirect costs of marketing the material in question.
(7) In determining either the commissions usually earned or the amount generally reflected for profit and general expenses under this section, the question as to whether certain materials are materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued shall be determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the circumstances involved. Sales in the country in which the producer is located of the narrowest group or range of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, shall be examined. For the purposes of this section, “materials of the same class or kind” includes materials imported from the same country as the material being valued as well as materials imported from other countries or acquired within the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located.
(8) For the purposes of subsection (2), the earliest date shall be the date by which sales of identical materials or similar materials are made, in sufficient quantity to establish the unit price, to other persons in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located.

# SECTION 10.
(1) Under this section, the value of a material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be the sum of
(a) the cost or value of the materials used in the production of the material being valued, as determined on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the producer of the material,
(b) the cost of producing the material being valued, as determined on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the producer of the material, and
(c) an amount for profit and general expenses equal to that usually reflected in sales
(i) where the material being valued is imported by the producer into the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, to persons located in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located by producers of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued who are located in the country in which the material is produced, and
(ii) where the material being valued is acquired by the producer from another person located in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, to persons located in the territory of
the NAFTA country in which the producer is located by producers of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued who are located in the country in which the producer is located,
(d) the value of elements referred to in section 5(1)(b)(i), determined in accordance with section 5(6), and
(e) the value of elements referred to in sections 5(1)(b)(ii) through (iv), determined in accordance with section 5(8) and reasonably allocated to the material in accordance with section 5(12).
(2) For purposes of subsections (1)(a) and (b), where the costs recorded on the books of the producer of the material relate to the production of other goods and materials as well as to the production of the material being valued, the costs referred to in subsections (1)(a) and (b) with respect to the material being valued shall be those costs recorded on the books of the producer of the material that can be reasonably allocated to that material in accordance with Schedule VII.
(3) The amount for profit and general expenses referred to in subsection (1)(c) shall be determined on the basis of information supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material being valued unless the profit and general expenses figures that are supplied with that information are inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales by producers of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued who are located in the country in which the material is produced or the producer is located, as the case may be. The information supplied shall be prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles of the country in which the material being valued is produced. Where the material is produced in the territory of a NAFTA country, the information shall be prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles set out in the authorities listed for that NAFTA country in Schedule XII.
(4) For purposes of subsection (1)(c) and subsection (3), general expenses means the direct and indirect costs of producing and selling the material that are not included under subsections (1)(a) and (b).
(5) For purposes of subsection (3), the amount for profit and general expenses shall be taken as a whole. Where, in the information supplied by or on behalf of the producer of a material, the profit figure is low and the general expenses figure is high, the profit and general expense figures taken together may nevertheless be consistent with those usually reflected in sales of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued. Where the producer of a material can demonstrate that it is taking a nil or low profit on its sales of the material because of particular commercial circumstances, its actual profit and general expense figures shall be taken into account, provided that the producer of the material has valid commercial reasons to justify them and its pricing policy reflects usual pricing policies in the branch of industry concerned. For an illustration of this, such a situation might occur where producers have been forced to lower prices temporarily because of an unforeseeable drop in demand, or where the producers sell the material to complement a range of materials and goods being produced in the country in which the material is sold and accept a low profit to maintain competitiveness. A further illustration is where a material was being launched and the producer accepted a nil or low profit to offset high general expenses associated with the launch.
(6) Where the figures for the profit and general expenses supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material are not consistent with those usually reflected in sales of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued that are made by other producers in the country in which that material is sold, the amount for profit and general expenses may be based on relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material.
(7) Where a customs administration uses information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material for the purposes of determining the value of a material under
this section, the customs administration shall communicate to the producer, if that producer so requests, the source of such information, the data used and the calculations based upon such data, subject to the provisions on confidentiality under Article 507 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country.
(8) Whether certain materials are of the same class or kind as the material being valued shall be determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the circumstances involved. For purposes of determining the amount for profit and general expenses usually reflected under the provisions of this section, sales of the narrowest group or range of materials of the same class or kind, which includes the material being valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, shall be examined. For the purposes of this section, the materials of the same class or kind must be from the same country as the material being valued.

# SECTION 11.
(1) Where there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), and the value of the materials cannot be determined under sections 6 through 10, the value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be determined under this section using reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions of this Schedule and on the basis of data available in the country in which the producer is located.
(2) The value of the material determined under this section shall not be determined on the basis of
(a) a valuation system which provides for the acceptance of the higher of two alternative values;
(b) a cost of production other than the value determined in accordance with section 10;
(c) minimum values;
(d) arbitrary or fictitious values;
(e) where the material is produced in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, the price of the material for export from that territory; or
(f) where the material is imported, the price of the material for export to a country other than to the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located.
(3) To the greatest extent possible, the value of the material determined under this section shall be based on the methods of valuation set out in sections 2 through 10, but a reasonable flexibility in the application of such methods would be in conformity with the aims and provisions of this section. For an illustration of this, under section 6, the requirement that the identical materials should be sold at or about the same time as the time the material being valued is shipped to the producer could be flexibly interpreted. Similarly, identical materials produced in a country other than the country in which the material is produced could be the basis for determining the value of the material, or the value of identical materials already determined under section 9 could be used. For another illustration, under section 7, the requirement that the similar materials should be sold at or about the same time as the material being valued are shipped to the producer could be flexibly interpreted. Likewise, similar materials produced in a country other than the country in which the material is produced could be the basis for determining the value of the material, or the value of similar materials already determined under the provisions of section 9 could be used. For a further illustration, under section 9, the ninety days requirement could be administered flexibly.

Example 2:
LIFO method
By applying the LIFO method:
(1) 500 units of the 1,000 units of Materials A received on 01/05/94 and valued at $1.10 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 500 units of Good A shipped on 01/08/94; therefore, the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $550 (500 units × $1.10);
(2) the remaining 500 units of the 1,000 units of Materials A received on 01/05/94 and valued at $1.10 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 500 units of Good A shipped on 01/09/94; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $550 (500 units × $1.10);
(3) the 1,000 units of Materials A received on 01/10/94 and valued at $1.05 per
unit and 500 units of the 1,000 units of Material A received on 01/03/94 and valued at $1.00 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,500 units of Good A shipped on 01/14/94; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $1,550 [(1,000 units × $1.05) + (500 units × $1.00)]; and
(4) 1,500 units of the 2,000 units of Materials A received on 01/16/94 and valued at $1.10 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,500 units of Good A shipped on 01/18/94; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $1,650 (1,500 units × $1.10).

Example 1:
FIFO method
Good A is subject to a regional value-content requirement. Producer A is using the transaction value method to determine the regional value content of Good A.
By applying the FIFO method:
(1) the 100 units of originating Material A in opening inventory that were received in materials inventory on 12/18/93 are considered to have been used in the production of the 100 units of Good
A shipped on 01/10/94; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $0;
(2) the 100 units of non-originating Material A in opening inventory that were received in materials inventory on 12/27/93 and 600 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/01/94 are considered to have been used in the production of the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/94; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $110 (100 units × $1.10);
(3) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/01/94 and 600 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/05/94 are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/94; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $660 (600 units × $1.10); and
(4) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/05/94 and 500 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/10/94 are considered to have been used in the production of the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/94; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $440 (400 units × $1.10).
Example 2:
LIFO method
Good A is subject to a change in tariff classification requirement and the non-originating Material A used in the production of Good A does not undergo the applicable change in tariff classification. Therefore, where originating Material A is used in the production of Good A, Good A is an originating good and, where non-originating Material A is used in the production of Good A, Good A is a non-originating good.
By applying the LIFO method:
(1) 100 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/05/94 are considered to have been used in the production of the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/94;
(2) 700 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/10/94 are considered to have been used in the production of the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/94;
(3) 1,000 units of the 2,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/16/94 are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/94; and
(4) 900 units of the remaining 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/16/94 are considered to have been used in the production of the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/94.
Example 3:
Average method
Good A is subject to an applicable regional value-content requirement. Producer A is using the transaction value method to determine the regional value content of Good A. Producer A determines the average value of non-originating Material A and the ratio of originating Material A to total value of originating Material A and non-originating Material A in the following table.

By applying the average method:
(1) before the shipment of the 100 units of Material A on 01/10/94, the ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was .50 (1,100 units/2,200 units) and the ratio of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was .50 (1,100 units/2,200 units); based on those ratios, 50 units (100 units × .50) of originating Material A and 50 units (100 units × .50) of non-originating Material A are considered to have been used in the production of the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/94; therefore, the value of non-originating Material A used in the production of those goods is considered to be $52.50 [100 units × $1.05 (average unit value) × .50]; the ratios are applied to the units of Material A remaining in materials inventory after the shipment: 1,050 units (2,100 units × .50) are considered to be originating materials and 1,050 units (2,100 units × .50) are considered to be non-originating materials;
(2) before the shipment of the 700 units of Good A on 01/15/94, the ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 66% (2,050 units/3,100 units) and the ratio of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 34% (1,050 units/3,100 units); based on those ratios, 462 units (700 units × .66) of originating Material A and 238 units (700 units × .34) of non-originating Material A are considered to have been used in the production of the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/94; therefore, the value of non-originating Material A used in the production of those goods is considered to be $249.90 [700 units × $1.05 (average unit value) × 34%]; the ratios are applied to the units of Material A remaining in materials inventory after the shipment: 1,584 units (2,400 units × .66) are considered to be originating materials and 816 units (2,400 units × .34) are considered to be non-originating materials;
(3) before the shipment of the 1,000 units of Material A on 01/20/94, the ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 36% (1,584 units/4,400 units) and the ratio of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 64% (2,816 units/4,400 units); based on those ratios, 360 units (1,000 units × .36)
of originating Material A and 640 units (1,000 units × .64) of non-originating Material A are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/94; therefore, the value of non-originating Material A used in the production of those goods is considered to be $684.80 [1,000 units × $1.07 (average unit value) × 64%]; those ratios are applied to the units of Material A remaining in materials inventory after the shipment: 1,224 units (3,400 units × .36) are considered to be originating materials and 2,176 units (3,400 units × .64) are considered to be non-originating materials;
(4) before the shipment of the 900 units of Good A on 01/23/94, the ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 36% (1,224 units/3,400 units) and the ratio of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 64% (2,176 units/3,400 units; based on those ratios, 324 units (900 units × .36) of originating Material A and 576 units (900 units × .64) of non-originating Material A are considered to have been used in the production of the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/94; therefore, the value of non-originating Material A used in the production of those goods is considered to be $616.32 [900 units × $1.07 (average unit value) × 64%]; those ratios are applied to the units of Material A remaining in materials inventory after the shipment: 900 units (2,500 units × .36) are considered to be originating materials and 1,600 units (2,500 units × .64) are considered to be non-originating materials.
Example 4:
Average method
Good A is subject to an applicable regional value-content requirement. Producer A is using the net cost method and is averaging over a period of one month under section 6(15)(a) of this appendix to determine the regional value content of Good A.
By applying the average method:
the ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory for January 1994 is 40.4% (2,100 units/5,200 units);
based on that ratio, 1,091 units (2,700 units × .404) of originating Material A and 1,609 units (2,700 units-1,091 units) of non-originating Material A are considered to have been used in the production of the 2,700 units of Good A shipped in January 1994; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $0.64 per unit [$5,560 (total value of Material A in materials inventory)/ $5,200 (units of Material A in materials inventory) = $1.07 (average unit value) × (1-.404)] or $1,728 ($0.64 × 2,700 units); and
that ratio is applied to the units of Material A remaining in materials inventory on January 31, 1994: 1,010 units (2,500 units × .404) are considered to be originating materials and 1,490 units (2,500 units-1,010 units) are considered to be non-originating materials.

Example 1:
FIFO method
By applying the FIFO method:
(1) the 100 units of originating Good A in opening inventory that were received in finished goods inventory on 12/18/93 are considered to be the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/94;
(2) the 100 units of non-originating Good A in opening inventory that were received in finished goods inventory on 12/27/93 and 600 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/01/94 are considered to be the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/94;
(3) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/01/94 and 600 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/05/94 are considered to be the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/94; and
(4) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/05/94 and 500 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/10/94 are considered to be the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/94.
Example 2:
LIFO method
By applying the LIFO method:
(1) 100 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/05/94 are considered to be the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/94;
(2) 700 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/10/94 are considered to be the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/94;
(3) 1,000 units of the 2,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/16/94 are considered to be the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/94; and
(4) 900 units of the remaining 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/16/94 are considered to be the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/94.
Example 3:
Average method
Exporter A chooses to determine the origin of Good A on a monthly basis. Exporter A exported 3,000 units of Good A during the month of February 1994. The origin of the units of Good A exported during that month is determined on the basis of the preceding month, that is January 1994.
By applying the average method:
the ratio of originating goods to all goods in finished goods inventory for the month of January 1994 is 40.4% (2,100 units/5,200 units);
based on that ratio, 1,212 units (3,000 units × .404) of Good A shipped in February 1994 are considered to be originating goods and 1,788 units (3,000 units − 1,212 units) of Good A are considered to be non-originating goods; and
that ratio is applied to the units of Good A remaining in finished goods inventory on January 31, 1994: 1,010 units (2,500 units × .404) are considered to be originating goods and 1,490 units (2,500 units − 1,010 units) are considered to be non-originating goods.

The principal balance represents the loan balance at the end of each full year the loan is in effect and is calculated by subtracting the current year's principal payment from the prior year's ending loan balance.
2
Interest payments are calculated by multiplying the prior year's ending loan balance by the contract interest rate of 6 percent.
3
Principal payments are calculated by subtracting the current year's interest payments from the annual payment schedule amount.
4
The weighted principal payment is determined by, for each year of the loan, multiplying that year's principal payment by the number of years the loan had been in effect at the end of that year.
5
The weighted average principal maturity of the contract is calculated by dividing the sum of the weighted principal payments by the original loan amount and rounding the amount determined to the nearest decimal place.
Weighted Average Principal Maturity
$5,977,993.19 / $1,000,000 = 5.977993 or 6 years
5
By applying the above method:
(1) the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the 6 percent contract is 6 years;
(2) the yields on the closest maturities for comparable federal government debt obligations of 5 years and 7 years are 4.7 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively; therefore, using linear interpolation, the yield on a federal government debt obligation that has a maturity equal to the weighted average principal maturity of the contract is 4.85 percent. This number is calculated as follows:
4.7 + [((5.0−4.7) × (6−5)) / (7−5)]
= 4.7 + 0.15
= 4.85%; and
(3) the producer's contract interest rate of 6 percent is within 700 basis points of the 4.85 percent yield on the comparable federal government debt obligation; therefore, none of the producer's interest costs are considered to be non-allowable interest costs for purposes of the definition “non-allowable interest costs.”

# “EXAMPLE” ILLUSTRATING THE APPLICATION OF THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING NON-ALLOWABLE INTEREST COSTS IN THE CASE OF A VARIABLE-RATE CONTRACT
The following example is based on the figures set out in the tables below and on the following assumptions:
(a) a producer in a NAFTA country borrows $1,000,000 from a person of the same NAFTA country under a variable-rate contract;
(b) under the terms of the contract, the loan is payable in 10 years with interest paid at the rate of 6 percent per year for the first two years and 8 percent per year for the next two years on the principal balance, with rates adjusted each two years after that;
(c) the payment schedule calculated by the lender based on the terms of the contract requires the producer to make annual payments of principal and interest of $135,867.96 for the first two years of the loan, and of $146,818.34 for the next two years of the loan;
(d) there are no federal government debt obligations that have maturities
equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity of the first two years of the contract;
(e) there are no federal government debt obligations that have maturities equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity of the third and fourth years of the contract; and
(f) the federal government debt obligations that are nearest in maturity to the weighted average principal maturity of the contract are 1- and 2-year maturities, and the yields on them are 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent respectively.

$1,924,132.04/$1,000,000 = 1.92413204 or 1.9 years
By applying the above method:
(1) the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule of the first two years of the contract is 1.9 years;
(2) the yield on the closest maturities of federal government debt obligations of 1 year and 2 years are 3.0 and 3.5 percent, respectively; therefore, using linear interpolation, the yield on a federal government debt obligation that has a maturity equal to the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule of the first two years of the contract is 3.45 percent. This amount is calculated as follows:
3.0 + [((3.5−3.0) × (1.9−1.0)) / (2.0−1.0)]
= 3.0 + 0.45
= 3.45%; and
(3) the producer's contract rate of 6 percent for the first two years of the loan is within 700 basis points of the 3.45 percent yield on federal government debt obligations that have maturities equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule of the first two years of the producer's loan contract; therefore, none of the producer's interest costs are considered to be non-allowable interest costs for purposes of the definition “non-allowable interest costs”.

By applying the above method:
(1) the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the first two years of the contract is 1.9 years;
(2) the federal government debt obligations that are nearest in maturities to the weighted average principal maturity of the contract are 1- and 2-year maturities, and the yields on them are 3.0 and 3.5 percent, respectively; therefore, using linear interpolation, the yield on a federal government debt obligation that has a maturity equal to the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule of the first two years of the contract is 3.45 percent. This amount is calculated as follows:
3.0 + [((3.5 − 3.0) × (1.9 − 1.0)) / (2.0 − 1.0)]
= 3.0 + 0.45
= 3.45%
(3) the producer's contract interest rate, for the third and fourth years of the loan, of 8 percent is within 700 basis points of the 3.45 percent yield on federal government debt obligations that have maturities equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the third and fourth years of the producer's loan contract; therefore, none of the producer's interest costs are considered to be non-allowable interest costs for purposes of the definition “non-allowable interest costs”.

§ 182.50
Liquidation and payment of drawback claims.
(a)
General.
When the drawback claim has been fully completed by the filing of all required documents, and exportation of the articles has been established and the amount of duties paid to Canada or Mexico has been established, the entry will be liquidated to determine the proper amount of drawback due either in accordance with the limitation on drawback set forth in § 182.44 of this subpart or in accordance with the regular drawback calculation. The liquidation procedures of subpart H of part 190 of this chapter, as appropriate, will control for purposes of this subpart.
(b)
Time for liquidation.
A drawback claim will not be liquidated until either a written waiver of the right to protest under 19 U.S.C. 1514 is filed with CBP or the liquidation of the import entry has become final under U.S. law. In addition, except in the case of goods covered by § 182.45 of this subpart, a drawback claim must not be liquidated for a period of three years after the date of entry of the goods in Canada or Mexico. A drawback claim may be adjusted pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 4534(e)(1) even after liquidation of the U.S. import entry has become final.
(c)
Accelerated payment.
Accelerated drawback payment procedures will apply as set forth in § 190.92 of this chapter, as appropriate. However, a person who receives drawback of duties under this procedure must repay the duties paid if a USMCA drawback claim is adversely affected thereafter by administrative or court action.

(b)
Preparation of Certification of Origin.
The drawback claimant must, within 30 calendar days after the filing of the drawback claim under this subpart, submit to CBP a written statement as to whether the claimant has prepared, or has knowledge that another person has prepared, a certification of origin provided for under § 182.12 and pertaining to the goods which are covered by the claim. If, following such 30-day period, the claimant prepares, or otherwise learns of the existence of, any such certification of origin, the claimant must, within 30 calendar days thereafter, disclose that fact to CBP.

Treatment as entered or withdrawn for consumption
—(i)
General
.
(A) Where a good is imported into the United States pursuant to a duty-deferral program and is subsequently withdrawn from the duty-deferral program for exportation to Canada or Mexico or is used as a material in the production of another good that is subsequently withdrawn from the duty-deferral program for exportation to Canada or Mexico, and provided that the good is a “good subject to USMCA drawback” within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. 4534 and is not described in § 182.45 of this subpart, the documentation required to be filed under this section in connection with the exportation of the good will, for purposes of this chapter, constitute an USMCA entry or withdrawal for consumption and the exported good must be subject to duty which will be assessed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(B) Where a good is imported into the United States pursuant to a duty-deferral program and is subsequently withdrawn from the duty-deferral program and entered into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico or is used as a material in the production of another good that is subsequently withdrawn from the duty-deferral program and entered into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico, and provided that the good is a “good subject to USCMA drawback” within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. 4534 and is not described in § 182.45 of this subpart, the documentation required to be filed under this section in connection with the withdrawal of the good from the U.S. duty-deferral program will, for purposes of this chapter, constitute a USMCA entry or withdrawal for consumption and the withdrawn good must be subject to duty which will be assessed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

in § 182.73(d)(2), within the time period provided in § 182.73(f)(2), unless a postponement is requested in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Postponement of a verification visit
—(1)
Request for postponement by an exporter or producer.
Within 15 days of confirmed receipt of the notification of a verification visit, the exporter or producer may, on a single occasion, using one of the communication means specified in § 182.73(d)(2), request the postponement of the verification visit for a period not to exceed 30 days from the proposed date of the visit.
(2)
Notification of a postponement.
CBP will notify the exporter or producer when a postponement request under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is received and will provide the new date of the verification visit. The Mexican or Canadian customs administration where the verification visit will occur may also, within 15 days of confirmed receipt of the notification of a verification visit, postpone the verification visit for a period not to exceed 60 days from the proposed date of the visit or for a longer period as CBP and the Mexican or Canadian customs administration may decide. CBP will notify the exporter or producer if the verification visit is postponed at the request of the Mexican or Canadian customs administration.
(c)
Availability of records
—(1)
Verification of a good.
The exporter or producer must make the records, which are required to be maintained to demonstrate that the good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA, available for inspection by a CBP official conducting a verification and provide facilities for that inspection during the verification visit. CBP may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment of the good for failure to maintain these records or if a CBP official is denied access to these records.
(2)
Verification of a material.
During the verification of a material, any records in the material producer's possession demonstrating that the material qualifies as originating must be made available for inspection by a CBP official conducting a verification. CBP may consider the material that is the used in the production of the good and is the subject of the verification visit to be non-originating material if a CBP official is denied access to these records.
(d)
Observers.
The exporter or producer may designate up to two observers to be present during the verification visit, if the exporter or producer chooses, provided that:
(1) The observers do not participate in a manner other than as observers;
(2) The failure of the exporter or producer to designate observers does not result in the postponement of the visit; and
(3) The exporter or producer identifies to CBP any observers designated to be present during the visit.

§ 182.83
Verifications of textile and apparel goods.
(a)
Verification of textile and apparel goods.
For textile and apparel goods, CBP has two alternative means of conducting a verification. CBP may conduct a verification for purposes of determining whether a textile and apparel good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment using any of the means described in § 182.72(a) of this part. Alternatively, as described in this section, CBP may conduct a site visit to the premises of the exporter or producer of textile or apparel goods in Mexico or Canada for the purpose of determining:
(1) That a textile or apparel good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment; or
(2) That customs offenses with regard to a textile or apparel good are occurring or have occurred.
(b)
Verification of a material during a site visit.
When conducting a verification of a textile or apparel good imported into the United States, CBP may conduct a verification of the material that is used in the production of that good. A verification of a material producer may be conducted pursuant to the site visit procedures set forth in this section. With the exception of § 182.75, the provisions in this section also apply to the verification of a material and references to the term “producer” apply to a producer of a textile or apparel good or to a material producer.
(c)
Site visit procedures.
(1)
Consent required.
Prior to conducting a site visit in Canada or Mexico pursuant to this section, CBP must obtain the consent of the exporter, producer, or a person having capacity to consent on behalf of the exporter or producer, either prior to the site visit or at the time of the site visit, to access the relevant records or facilities. CBP must, at the time of the request for consent, inform the exporter, producer, or person having the capacity to consent to a site visit of:
(i) The legal authority for the visit;
(ii) The specific purpose of the visit; and
(iii) The names and titles of the U.S. officials performing the visit.
(2)
Failure to receive CBP on initial date.
(i) If the exporter, producer, or a person having the capacity to consent on behalf of the exporter or producer is not able to receive CBP to carry out the site visit, the site visit will be conducted on the following business day unless:
(A) CBP agrees otherwise; or
(B) The exporter, producer, or person having the capacity to consent on behalf of the exporter or producer substantiates a valid reason acceptable to CBP for why the site visit cannot occur on the following business day.
(ii) If the exporter, producer, or person having the capacity to consent on behalf of the exporter or producer, does not have a valid reason acceptable to CBP for why the site visit cannot take place on the following business day, CBP will consider any reasonable alternative proposed dates, taking into account the availability of relevant employees or facilities of the exporter or producer to be visited. After such consideration, CBP may deem consent for the site visit or access to the records or facilities to be denied.
(3)
Availability of records and facilities.
During a site visit, CBP may request access to:
(i) Records and facilities relevant to the claim for preferential tariff treatment; or
(ii) Records and facilities relevant to the customs offenses being verified.
(d)
Right to request report of the site visit.
The exporter or producer may request CBP's written report of the results of the site visit. The exporter or producer must submit this request in writing to CBP. CBP will provide the exporter or producer the portions of the report that pertain to that exporter or producer, including any findings, subject to the confidentiality provisions in § 182.2 of this part.
(e)
Denial of preferential tariff treatment.
CBP may deny preferential tariff
treatment to any textile or apparel good imported or produced by the person that is the subject of the verification if CBP determines any of the following:
(1) CBP determines, pursuant to a site visit conducted under this section, that it has not received sufficient information to determine that the textile or apparel good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment;
(2) CBP determines that the textile or apparel good does not qualify for preferential tariff treatment, including failing to meet the rules of origin requirements in General Note 11, HTSUS, and Appendix A to this part, or the TPL requirements in § 182.82 of this subpart;
(3) CBP is unable to determine, pursuant to a site visit conducted under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that the exporter or producer is complying with applicable customs measures affecting trade in textile or apparel goods;
(4) CBP is unable to conduct a site visit because access to or consent for the site visit is denied by the exporter, producer, or person having the capacity to consent on behalf of the exporter or producer;
(5) The exporter, producer, or a person having the capacity to consent on behalf of the exporter or producer prevents CBP from completing the site visit on the initial date of the site visit and the exporter or producer does not provide an acceptable alternative date for the site visit;
(6) The exporter, producer, or person having the capacity to consent on behalf of the exporter or producer fails to provide CBP with access to relevant documents or facilities during a site visit as required under § 182.83(c)(3) of this section; or
(7) CBP determines that any other reason to deny a claim for preferential tariff treatment as set forth in § 182.75(c)(2) of this part applies.
(f)
Intent to deny and determination of origin.
After CBP conducts a site visit under this section, CBP will issue a determination of origin pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 182.75, with the exception of § 182.75(c)(1). If CBP conducts a site visit under this section and, as a result, intends to deny preferential tariff treatment to a textile or apparel good, it must, prior to issuing a determination of origin, issue an intent to deny pursuant to § 182.75(c)(3).
(g)
Pattern of conduct for textile or apparel goods.
Where the verification of identical textile or apparel goods by CBP indicates a pattern of conduct by an exporter or producer of false or unsupported representations that a textile or apparel good imported into the territory of the United States qualifies for preferential tariff treatment, CBP may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical textile or apparel goods imported, exported, or produced by that person until it is demonstrated to CBP that those identical textile or apparel goods qualify for preferential tariff treatment.

# Part II

# Section 3. Originating Goods
3(1)
Wholly obtained goods.
A good is originating in the territory of a USMCA country if the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations and is:
(a) A mineral good or other naturally occurring substance extracted in or taken from the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries;
(b) a plant, plant good, vegetable, or fungus, grown, harvested, picked, or gathered in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries;
(c) a live animal born and raised in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries;
(d) a good obtained from a live animal in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries;
(e) an animal obtained from hunting, trapping, fishing, gathering or capturing in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries;
(f) a good obtained from aquaculture in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries;
(g) fish, shellfish or other marine life taken from the sea, seabed or subsoil outside the territories of the USMCA countries and, under international law, outside the territorial sea of non-USMCA countries, by vessels that are registered, listed, or recorded with a USMCA country and entitled to fly the flag of that USMCA country;
(h) a good produced from goods referred to in paragraph (g) on board a factory ship where the factory ship is registered, listed, or recorded with a USMCA country and entitled to fly the flag of that USMCA country;
(i) a good, other than fish, shellfish or other marine life, taken by a USMCA country or a person of a USMCA country from the seabed or subsoil outside the territories of the USMCA countries, if that USMCA country has the right to exploit that seabed or subsoil;
(j) waste and scrap derived from:
(i) Production in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries, or
(ii) used goods collected in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries, provided the goods are fit only for the recovery of raw materials; or
(k) a good produced in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries, exclusively from a good referred to in any of paragraphs (a) through (j), or from their derivatives, at any stage of production.
(2)
Goods produced from non-originating materials.
A good, produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries, is originating in the territory of a USMCA country if each of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good satisfies all applicable requirements of Schedule I (PSRO Annex), and the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations.
(3)
Goods produced exclusively from originating materials.
A good is originating in the territory of a USMCA country if the good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries exclusively from originating materials and the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations.
(4)
Exceptions to the change in tariff classification requirement.
Except in the case of a good of any of Chapters 61 through 63, a good is originating in the territory of a USMCA country if:
(a) One or more of the non-originating materials used in the production of that good cannot satisfy the change in tariff classification requirements set out in Schedule I (PSRO Annex) because both the good and its materials are classified in the same subheading or same heading that is not further subdivided into subheadings, and,
(i) the good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries;
(ii) the regional value content of the good, calculated in accordance with section 7 (Regional Value Content), is not less than 60 percent if the transaction value method is used, or not less than 50 percent if the net cost method is used; and
(iii) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations; or
(b) it was imported into the territory of a USMCA country in an unassembled or a disassembled form but classified as an assembled good in accordance with rule 2(a) of the General Rules of Interpretation for the Harmonized System and,
(i) the good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries;
(ii) the regional value content of the good, calculated in accordance with section 7 (Regional Value Content), is not less than 60 percent if the transaction value method is used, or not less than 50 percent if the net cost method is used; and
(iii) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations.
(5)
Interpretation of goods and parts of goods.
For the purposes of paragraph (4)(a),
(a) the determination of whether a heading or subheading provides for a good and its parts is to be made on the basis of the nomenclature of the heading or subheading and the relevant Section or Chapter Notes, in accordance with the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System; and
(b) if, in accordance with the Harmonized System, a heading includes parts of goods by application of a Section Note or Chapter Note of the Harmonized System and the subheadings under that heading do not include a subheading designated “Parts”, a subheading designated “Other” under that heading is to be considered to cover only the goods and parts of the goods that are themselves classified under that subheading.
(6)
Requirement to meet one rule.
For the purposes of subsection (2), if Schedule I (PSRO Annex) sets out two or more alternative rules for the tariff provision under which a good is classified, if the good satisfies the requirements of one of those rules, it need not satisfy the requirements of another of the rules in order to qualify as an originating good.
(7)
Special rule for certain goods.
A good is originating in the territory of a USMCA country if the good is referred to in Schedule II and is imported from the territory of a USMCA country.
(8)
Self-produced material considered as a material.
For the purpose of determining whether non-originating materials undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, a self-produced material may, at the choice of the producer of that material, be considered as a material used in the production of a good into which the self-produced material is incorporated.
(9)
Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in subsection 1(4).
Example 1: Subsection 3(2) Regarding the `component that determines the tariff classification' of a textile or apparel good)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces women´s wool overcoats of subheading 6202.11 from two different fabrics, one for the body and another for the sleeves. Both fabrics are produced using originating and non-originating materials. The overcoat´s body is made of woven wool and silk fabric, and the sleeves are made of knit cotton fabric.
For the purpose of determining if the women´s wool overcoats are originating goods, Producer A must take into account Note 2 of Chapter 62 of Schedule I, which indicates that the applicable rule will apply only to the component that determines the tariff classification of the good and that the component must satisfy the tariff change requirements set out in the rule for that good.
The woven fabric (80% wool and 20% silk) used for the body is the component of the women´s wool overcoat that determines its tariff classification under subheading 6202.11, because it constitutes the predominant material by weight and makes up the largest surface area of the overcoat. This fabric is made by Producer A from originating wool yarn classified in heading 51.06 and non-originating silk yarn classified in heading 50.04.
Since the knit cotton fabric used in the sleeves is not the component that determines the tariff classification of the good, it does not need to meet the requirements set out in the rule for the good.
Producer A must determine whether the non-originating materials used in the production of the component that determines the tariff classification of the women´s wool overcoats (the woven fabric) satisfy the requirements established in the product-specific rule of origin, which requires both a change in tariff classification from any other chapter, except from some headings and chapters under which certain yarns and fabrics are classified, and a requirement that the good be cut or knit to shape and sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries. The non-originating silk yarn of heading 50.04 used by Producer A satisfies the change in tariff classification requirement, since heading 50.04 is not excluded under the product-specific rule of origin. Additionally, the overcoats are cut and sewn in the territory of one of the USMCA countries, and therefore the women´s wool overcoats would be considered to be originating goods.
Example 2: (Subsection 3(2))
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces T-shirts of subheading 6109.10 from knit cotton and polyester fabric (60% cotton and 40% polyester), which is also produced by Producer A using originating cotton yarn of heading 52.05 and polyester yarn made of non-originating filaments of heading 54.02.
As the t-shirt is made of a single fabric and classified under GRI 1 in subheading 6109.10, this fabric is the component that determines tariff classification. Therefore, to be considered originating by application of the tariff-shift rule for subheading 6109.10, each of the non-originating materials used in the production of the t-shirt must undergo the required change in tariff classification.
In this case, the non-originating polyester filaments of heading 54.02 used in the production of the T-shirts do not satisfy the change in
tariff classification set out in the product-specific rule of origin. In addition, the weight of the non-originating polyester is over the “de minimis” allowance. Therefore, the T-shirts do not qualify as originating goods.
Example 3: (subsection 3(2))—Note 2 contained in Section XI—Textiles and Textile Articles (Chapter 50-63)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces fabrics of subheading 5211.42 from originating cotton and polyester yarns, and non-originating rayon filament. For the purpose of determining if the fabrics are originating goods, Producer A must consider Note 2 of Section XI of Schedule I, which indicates a good of Chapter 50 through 63 is considered as originating, regardless of whether the rayon filaments used in its production are non-originating materials, provided that the good meets the requirements of the applicable product-specific rule of origin.
With the exception of the rayon filaments of heading 54.03, that Note 2 of Section XI of Schedule I allows, all of the materials used in the production of the fabrics are originating materials, and since General Interpretative Note (d) of Schedule I provides that a change in tariff classification of a product-specific rule of origin applies only to non-originating materials, the fabrics are considered to be originating goods.
Example 4: Subsection 3(2) Note 2 and 5 of Chapter 62 regarding the interpretation of the component that determines the tariff classification and the requirement for pockets.
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces men´s suits classified in subheading 6203.12, which are made of three fabrics: A non-originating fabric of subheading 5407.61 used to make a visible lining, an originating fabric of 5514.41 used to make the outer part of the suit and a non-originating fabric of subheading 5513.21 used to make pocket bags.
For the purpose of determining if the men´s suits are originating goods, Producer A should take into account Note 2 of Chapter 62 of Schedule I, which indicates that the applicable rule will only apply to the component that determines the tariff classification of the good and that the component must satisfy the tariff change requirements set out in the rule for that good.
The originating fabric used to make the outer part of the suit is the component of the suit that determines the tariff classification under subheading 6203.12, because it constitutes the predominant material by weight and is the largest surface area of the suit. The origin of the fabric used as visible lining is disregarded for the purpose of determining whether the suit is an originating good since that fabric is not considered the component that determines the tariff classification, and there are no Chapter notes related to visible lining for apparel goods.
Additionally, Producer A uses a non-originating fabric of subheading 5513.21 for the pocket bags of the suits, so it should take into account the second paragraph of Note 5 of Chapter 62 of Schedule I, which requires that the pocket bag fabric must be formed and finished in the territory of one or more USMCA countries from yarn wholly formed in one or more USMCA countries.
In this case, for the production of men´s suits, Producer A uses non-originating fabric for the pockets, and such fabric was not formed and finished in the territory of one or more Parties, therefore the suits would be considered to be non-originating goods.
Example 5 (subsection 3(7)): A wholesaler located in USMCA Country A imports non-originating storage units provided for in subheading 8471.70 from outside the territory of the USMCA countries. The wholesaler resells the storage units to a buyer in USMCA Country B. While in the territory of Country A, the storage units do not undergo any production and therefore do not meet the rule in Schedule I for goods of subheading 8471.70 when imported into the territory of USMCA Country B.
Notwithstanding the rule in Schedule I, the storage units of subheading 8471.70 are considered originating goods when they are imported to the territory of USMCA Country B because they are referred to in Schedule II and were imported from the territory of another USMCA country.
The buyer in USMCA Country B subsequently uses the storage units provided for in subheading 8471.70 as a material in the production of another good. For the purpose of determining whether the other good originates, the buyer in USMCA Country B may treat the storage units of subheading 8471.70 as originating materials.
Example 6 subsection 3(8): Self-produced Materials as Materials for the purpose of Determining Whether Non-originating Materials Undergo an Applicable Change in Tariff Classification
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces Good A. In the production process, Producer A uses originating Material X and non-originating Material Y to produce Material Z. Material Z is a self-produced material that will be used to produce Good A.
The rule set out in Schedule I for the heading under which Good A is classified specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading. In this case, both Good A and the non-originating Material Y are of the same heading. However, the self-produced Material Z is of a heading different than that of Good A.
For the purpose of determining whether the non-originating materials that are used in the production of Good A undergo the applicable change in tariff classification, Producer A has the option to consider the self-produced Material Z as the material that must undergo a change in tariff classification. As Material Z is of a heading different than that of Good A, Material Z satisfies the applicable change in tariff classification and Good A would qualify as an originating good.

# Section 4. Treatment of Recovered Materials Used in the Production of a Remanufactured Good
4(1)
Treatment of recovered materials used in the production of remanufactured goods.
A recovered material derived in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries, will be treated as originating, provided that:
(a) It is the result of a disassembly process of a used good into individual parts;
(b) It has undergone certain processing, such as cleaning, inspection, testing or other improvement processing, to sound working condition; and
(c) It is used in the production of, and incorporated into, a remanufactured good.
(2)
Recovered material not used in remanufactured good.
In the case that the recovered material is not used or incorporated in the production of a remanufactured good, it is originating only if it satisfies the requirements established in Section 3, and satisfies all other applicable requirements in these Regulations.
(3)
Requirements of Schedule I (PSRO Annex).
A remanufactured good is originating in the territory of a USMCA country only if it satisfies the applicable requirements established in Schedule I (PSRO Annex), and satisfies all other applicable requirements in these Regulations.
(4) Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in subsection 1(4)
Example 1: (Section 4)
In July 2023, Producer A located in a USMCA country manufactures water pumps of subheading 8413.30 for use in automotive engines. In addition to selling new water pumps, Producer A also sells water pumps that incorporate used parts.
To obtain the used parts, Producer A disassembles used water pumps in a USMCA country and cleans, inspects, and tests the individual parts. Accordingly, these parts qualify as recovered materials.
The water pumps that Producer A manufactures incorporate the recovered materials, have the same life expectancy and performance as new water pumps, and are sold with a warranty that is similar to the warranty for new water pumps. The water pumps therefore qualify as remanufactured goods, and the recovered materials are treated as originating materials when determining whether the good qualifies as an originating good.
In this case, because the water pumps are for use in an automotive good, the provisions of Part VI apply. Because the water pump is a part listed in Table B, the RVC required is 70% under the net cost method or 80% under the transaction value method.
The producer chooses to calculate the RVC using net cost as follows:
Water pump net cost = $1,000
Value of recovered materials = $600
Value other originating materials = $20
Value of non-originating materials = $280
RVC = (NC−VNM)/NC × 100
RVC = (1,000−280)/1,000 × 100 = 72%
The remanufactured water pumps are originating goods because their regional value content exceeds the 70% requirement by net cost method.
Example 2: Section 4
Producer A located in a USMCA country, uses recovered materials derived in the territory of a USMCA country in the production of self-propelled “bulldozers” classified in subheading 8429.11.
In the production of the bulldozers, Producer A uses recovered engines, classified in heading 84.07. The engines are recovered materials because they are disassembled from used bulldozers in a USMCA country and then subject to cleaning, inspecting and technical tests to verify their sound working condition.
In addition to the recovered materials, other non-originating materials, classified in subheading 8413.91, are also used in the production of the bulldozers.
Producer A's bulldozers are considered a “remanufactured good” because they are classified in a tariff provision set out in the definition of a remanufactured good, are partially composed of recovered materials, have a similar life expectancy and perform the same as or similar to new self-propelled bulldozers, and have a factory warranty similar to new self-propelled bulldozers.
Once the recovered engines are used in the production of, and incorporated into, the remanufactured bulldozers, the recovered engines would be treated considered as originating materials for the purpose of determining if the remanufactured bulldozers are originating.
The rule of origin set out in in Schedule I for subheading 8429.11 specifies a change in tariff classification from any other subheading.
In this case, because the recovered engines are treated as originating materials, and the non-originating materials, classified in subheading 8413.91, satisfy the requirements set out in Schedule I, the remanufactured bulldozers are originating goods.

# Section 5. De Minimis
5(1)
De minimis rule for non-originating materials.
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) (Exceptions), a good is originating in the territory of a USMCA country if
(a) the value of all non-originating materials that are used in the production of the good and that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification as a result of production occurring entirely in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries is not more than ten percent
(i) of the transaction value of the good, determined in accordance with Schedule III (Value of Goods), and adjusted to exclude any costs incurred in the international shipment of the good, or
(ii) of the total cost of the good;
(b) if the good is also subject to a regional content requirement under the rule in which the applicable change in tariff classification is specified, the value of those non-originating materials is to be taken into account in calculating the regional value content of the good in accordance with the method set out for that good; and
(c) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations.
(2)
Only one rule to satisfy.
If Schedule I (PSRO Annex) sets out two or more alternative rules for the tariff provision under which the good is classified, and the good is considered an originating good under one of those rules in accordance with subsection (1), it need not satisfy the requirements of any alternative rule to be originating.
(3)
Exceptions.
Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to:
(a) A non-originating material of heading 04.01 through 04.06, or a non-originating material that is a dairy preparation containing over 10 percent by dry weight of milk solids of subheading 1901.90 or 2106.90, used in the production of a good of heading 04.01 through 04.06;
(b) a non-originating material of heading 04.01 through 04.06, or a non-originating material that is a dairy preparation containing over 10 percent by dry weight of milk solids of subheading 1901.90 or 2106.90, used in the production of a good of:
(i) Infant preparations containing over 10 percent by dry weight of milk solids of subheading 1901.10,
(ii) mixes and doughs, containing over 25 percent by dry weight of butterfat, not put up for retail sale of subheading 1901.20,

(iv) goods of heading 21.05,
(v) beverages containing milk of subheading 2202.90, or
(vi) animal feeds containing over 10 percent by dry weight of milk solids of subheading 2309.90;
(c) a non-originating material of any of heading 08.05 and subheadings 2009.11 through 2009.39 that is used in the production of a good of any of subheadings 2009.11 through 2009.39 or a fruit or vegetable juice of any single fruit or vegetable, fortified with minerals or vitamins, concentrated or unconcentrated, of subheading 2106.90 or 2202.90;
(d) a non-originating material of Chapter 9 that is used in the production of instant coffee, not flavored, of subheading 2101.11;
(e) a non-originating material of Chapter 15 that is used in the production of a good of any of headings 15.01 through 15.08, 15.12, 15.14 or 15.15;
(f) a non-originating material of heading 17.01 that is used in the production of a good of any of headings 17.01 through 17.03;
(g) a non-originating material of Chapter 17 or heading 18.05 that is used in the production of a good of subheading 1806.10;
(h) a non-originating material that is pears, peaches or apricots of Chapter 8 or 20 that is used in the production of a good of heading 20.08;
(i) a non-originating material that is a single juice ingredient of heading 20.09 that is used in the production of a good of any of subheading 2009.90, or tariff item 2106.90.cc or 2202.90.bb;
(j) a non-originating material of heading 22.03 through 22.08 that used in the production of a good provided for in any of heading 22.07 or 22.08;
(k) a non-originating material that is used in the production of a good of any of Chapters 1 through 27, unless the non-originating material is of a different subheading than the good for which origin is being determined under this section; or
(l) a non-originating material that is used in the production of a good of any of Chapters 50 through 63.
(4)
De minimis rule for regional value content requirement.
A good that is subject to a regional value content requirement is originating in the territory of a USMCA country and is not required to satisfy that requirement if
(a) the value of all non-originating materials used in the production of the good is not more than ten per cent
(i) of the transaction value of the good, determined in accordance with Schedule III (Value of the Good), and adjusted to exclude any costs incurred in the international shipment of the good, or
(ii) of the total cost of the good, and
(b) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations.
(5)
Value of non-originating materials for subsections (1) and (4).
For the purposes of subsections (1) and (4), the value of non-originating materials is to be determined in accordance with subsections 8(1) through (6).
(6)
De minimis rule for textile goods.
A good of any of Chapters 50 through 60 or heading 96.19, that contains non-originating materials that do not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification requirements, will be considered originating in the territory of a USMCA country if:
(a) The total weight of all those non-originating materials is not more than ten per cent of the total weight of the good, of which the total weight of elastomeric content may not exceed seven per cent of the total weight of the good; and
(b) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations.
(7) A good of any of Chapters 61 through 63, that contains non-originating fibers or yarns
in the component of the good that determines the tariff classification that do not undergo the applicable change in tariff classification requirements, will be considered originating in the territory of a USMCA country if:
(a) The total weight of all those non-originating materials is not more than ten per cent of the total weight of that component, of which the elastomeric content may not exceed seven per cent; and
(b) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations.
(8) For purposes of subsection (7),
(a) the component of a good that determines the tariff classification of that good is identified in accordance with the first of the following General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System under which the identification can be determined, namely, Rule 3(b), Rule 3(c) and Rule 4; and
(b) if the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good is a blend of two or more yarns or fibers, all yarns and fibers used in the production of the component must be taken into account in determining the weight of fibers and yarns in that component.
(9) For the purpose of determining if a good of Chapter 61 through 63 is originating, the requirements set out in Schedule I (PSRO Annex) only apply to the component that determines the tariff classification of the good. Materials that are not part of the component that determines the tariff classification of the good are disregarded when determining if a good is originating. Similarly, for the purposes of Section 5 as applicable to a good of Chapters 61 through 63, only the materials used in the component that determines the tariff classification are taken into account in the de minimis calculation.
(10) Subsection (6) does not apply to sewing thread, narrow elastic bands, and pocket bag fabric subject to the requirements set out in Chapter 61 Notes 2 through 4, Chapter 62 Notes 3 through 5 or for coated fabric as set out in Chapter 63 Note 2 of Schedule I (PSRO Annex).
(11)
Calculation of “Total Cost”, choice of methods.
For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a)(ii) and subparagraph (4)(a)(ii), the total cost of a good is, at the choice of the producer of the good,
(a) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the producer that can be reasonably allocated to that good in accordance with Schedule V; or
(b) the aggregate of each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to that good that can be reasonably allocated to that good in accordance with Schedule V.
(12)
Calculation of total cost.
Total cost under subsection (11) consists of the costs referred to in subsection 1(6), and is calculated in accordance with that subsection and subsection 1(7).
(13)
Value of non-originating materials—other methods.
For the purpose of determining the value under subsection (1) of non-originating materials that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, if an inventory management method either recognized in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of the USMCA country where the production was performed or a method set out in Schedule VIII, is not being used to determine the value of those non-originating materials, the following methods are to be used:
(a) If the value of those non-originating materials is being determined as a percentage of the transaction value of the good and the producer chooses under subsection 7(10) to use one of the methods recognized in the GAAP of the USMCA country where the material was produced, or a method set out in Schedule VII to determine the value of those non-originating materials for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of the good, the value of those non-originating materials must be determined in accordance with that method;
(b) if the following conditions are met and if the value of those non-originating materials is equal to the sum of the values of non-originating materials, determined in accordance with the election under subparagraph (iv), divided by the number of units of the goods with respect to which the election is made
(i) the value of those non-originating materials is being determined as a percentage of the total cost of the good,
(ii) under the rule in which the applicable change in tariff classification is specified, the good is also subject to a regional value content requirement and paragraph (5)(a) does not apply with respect to that good,
(iii) the regional value content of the good is calculated on the basis of the net cost method, and
(iv) the producer elects under subsection 7(15), 16(1) or (10) that the regional value content of the good be calculated over a period;
(c) if the conditions below are met the value of those non-originating materials is the sum of the values of non-originating materials divided by the number of units produced during the period under subparagraph (iii):
(i) The value of those non-originating materials is being determined as a percentage of the total cost of the good,
(ii) under the rule in which the applicable change in tariff classification is specified, the good is not also subject to a regional value content requirement or paragraph (6)(a) applies with respect to that good, and
(iii) the producer elects under paragraph 1(7)(b) that, for the purposes of subsection
5(11), the total cost of the good be calculated over a period; and
(d) in any other case, the value of those non-originating materials may, at the choice of the producer, be determined in accordance with an inventory management method recognized in the GAAP of the USMCA country where the production was performed or one of the methods set out in Schedule VII.
(14)
Value of non-originating materials—production of the good.
For the purposes of subsection (4), the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good may, at the choice of the producer, be determined in accordance with an inventory management method recognized in the GAAP of the USMCA country where the production was performed or one of the methods set out in Schedule VII
(15)
Examples illustrating de minimis rules.
Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in subsection 1(4).
Example 1: Subsection 5(1)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of aluminum powder of heading 76.03. The product-specific rule of origin set out in Schedule I for heading 76.03 specifies a change in tariff classification from any other chapter. There is no applicable regional value content requirement for this heading. Therefore, in order for the aluminum powder to qualify as an originating good under the rule set out in Schedule I, Producer A may not use any non-originating material of Chapter 76 in the production of the aluminum powder.
All of the materials used in the production of the aluminum powder are originating materials, with the exception of a small amount of aluminum scrap of heading 76.02, that is in the same chapter as the aluminum powder. Under subsection 5(1), if the value of the non-originating aluminum scrap does not exceed ten per cent of the transaction value of the aluminum powder or the total cost of the aluminum powder, whichever is applicable, the aluminum powder would be considered an originating good.
Example 2: Subsection 5(2)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of fans of subheading 8414.59. There are two alternative rules set out in Schedule I for subheading 8414.59, one of which specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading. The other rule specifies both a change in tariff classification from the subheading under which parts of the fans are classified and a regional value content requirement. In order for the fan to qualify as an originating good under the first of the alternative rules, all of the materials that are classified under the subheading for parts of fans and used in the production of the completed fan must be originating materials.
In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the fan satisfy the change in tariff classification set out in the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading, with the exception of one non-originating material that is classified under the subheading for parts of fans. Under subsection 5(1), if the value of the non-originating material that does not satisfy the change in tariff classification specified in the first rule does not exceed ten per cent of the transaction value of the fan or the total cost of the fan, whichever is applicable, the fan would be considered an originating good. Therefore, under subsection 5(2), the fan would not be required to satisfy the alternative rule that specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value content requirement.
Example 3: Subsection 5(2)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of copper anodes of heading 74.02. The product-specific rule of origin set out in Schedule I for heading 74.02 specifies both a change in tariff classification from any other heading, except from heading 74.04, under which certain copper materials are classified, and a regional value content requirement. With respect to that part of the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the copper anode to qualify as an originating good, any copper materials that are classified under heading 74.02 or 74.04 and that are used in the production of the copper anode must be originating materials.
In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the copper anode satisfy the specified change in tariff classification, with the exception of a small amount of copper materials classified under heading 74.04. Subsection 5(1) provides that the copper anode can be considered an originating good if the value of the non-originating copper materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification does not exceed ten per cent of the transaction value of the copper anode or the total cost of the copper anode, whichever is applicable. In this case, the value of those non-originating materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification does not exceed the ten per cent limit.
However, the rule set out in Schedule I for heading 74.02 specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value content requirement. Under paragraph 5(1)(b), in order to be considered an originating good, the copper anode must also, except as otherwise provided in subsection 5(4), satisfy the regional value content requirement specified in that rule. As provided in paragraph 5(1)(b), the value of the non-originating materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification, together with the value of all other non-originating materials used in the production of the copper anode, will be taken into account in calculating the regional value content of the copper anode.
Example 4: Subsection 5(4)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, primarily uses originating materials in the production of shoes of heading 64.05. The product-specific rule of origin set out in Schedule I for heading 64.05 specifies both a change in tariff classification from any heading other than headings 64.01 through 64.05 or subheading 6406.10 and a regional value content requirement.
With the exception of a small amount of materials of Chapter 39, all of the materials used in the production of the shoes are originating materials.
Under subsection 5(4), if the value of all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the shoes does not exceed ten per cent of the transaction value of the shoes or the total cost of the shoes, whichever is applicable, the shoes are not required to satisfy the regional value content requirement specified in the rule set out in Schedule I in order to be considered originating goods.
Example 5: Subsection 5(4)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces barbers' chairs of subheading 9402.10. The product-specific rule of origin set out in Schedule I for goods of subheading 9402.10 specifies a change in tariff classification from any other subheading. All of the materials used in the production of these chairs are originating materials, with the exception of a small quantity of non-originating materials that are classified as parts of barbers' chairs. These parts undergo no change in tariff classification because subheading 9402.10 provides for both barbers' chairs and their parts.
Although Producer A's barbers' chairs do not qualify as originating goods under the rule set out in Schedule I, paragraph 3(4)(a) provides, among other things, that, if there is no change in tariff classification from the non-originating materials to the goods because the subheading under which the goods are classified provides for both the goods and their parts, the goods will qualify as originating goods if they satisfy a specified regional value content requirement.
However, under subsection 5(4), if the value of the non-originating materials does not exceed ten per cent of the transaction value of the barbers' chairs or the total cost of the barbers' chairs, whichever is applicable, the barbers' chairs will be considered originating goods and are not required to satisfy the regional value content requirement set out in subparagraph 3(4)(a)(ii).
Example 6: Subsection 5(6):
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, manufactures an infant diaper, classified in heading 96.19, consisting of an outer shell of 94 percent nylon and 6 percent elastomeric fabric, by weight, and a terry knit cotton absorbent crotch. All materials used are produced in a USMCA country, except for the elastomeric fabric, which is from a non-USMCA country. The elastomeric fabric is only 6 percent of the total weight of the diaper. The product otherwise satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations. Therefore, the product is considered originating from a USMCA country as per subsection (6).
Example 7: Subsection 5(6)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces cotton fabric of subheading 5209.11 from cotton yarn of subheading 5205.11. This cotton yarn is also produced by Producer A.
The product-specific rule of origin set out in Schedule I for subheading 5209.11, under which the fabric is classified, specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading outside 52.08 through 52.12, except from certain headings under which certain yarns are classified, including cotton yarn of subheading 5205.11.
Therefore, with respect to that part of the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the fabric to qualify as an originating good, the cotton yarn that is used by Producer A in the production of the fabric must be an originating material.
At one point Producer A uses a small quantity of non-originating cotton yarn in the production of the cotton fabric. Under subsection 5(6), if the total weight of the non-originating cotton yarn does not exceed ten per cent of the total weight of the cotton fabric, it would be considered an originating good.
Example 8: Subsections 5(7) and (8)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces women's dresses of subheading 6204.41 from fine wool fabric of heading 51.12. This fine wool fabric, also produced by Producer A, is the component of the dress that determines its tariff classification under subheading 6204.41.
The product-specific rule of origin set out in Schedule I for subheading 6204.41, under which the dress is classified, specifies both a change in tariff classification from any other chapter, except from those headings and chapters under which certain yarns and fabrics, including combed wool yarn and wool fabric, are classified, and a requirement that the good be cut and sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries. In addition, narrow elastics classified in subheading 5806.20 or heading 60.02 and sewing thread classified in heading 52.04, 54.01 or 55.08 or yarn classified in heading 54.02 that is used as sewing thread, must be formed and finished in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries for the dress to be originating. Furthermore, if the dress has a pocket, the pocket bag fabric must be formed and finished in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries for the dress to be originating.
Therefore, with respect to that part of the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the dress to qualify as an originating good, the combed wool yarn and the fine wool fabric made therefrom that are used by Producer A in the production of the dress must be originating materials. In addition, the sewing thread, narrow elastics and pocket bags that are used by Producer A in the production of the
dress must also be formed and finished in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries.
At one point Producer A uses a small quantity of non-originating combed wool yarn in the production of the fine wool fabric. Under subsection 5(7), if the total weight of the non-originating combed wool yarn does not exceed ten per cent of the total weight of all the yarn used in the production of the component of the dress that determines its tariff classification, that is, the wool fabric, the dress would be considered an originating good.
Example 9: Subsection 5(7)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, manufactures women's knit sweaters, which have knit bodies and woven sleeves. The knit body is composed of 95 percent polyester and 5 percent spandex, by weight. The sleeves are made of non-USMCA woven fabric that is 100 percent polyester. All materials of the knit body are from a USMCA country, except for the spandex, which is from a non-USMCA country. The sweater is cut and sewn in a USMCA country. Since the knit body gives the garment its essential character, the sweater is classified in subheading 6110.30. The product-specific rule of origin set out in Schedule I for subheading 6110.30 is that the product is both cut (or knit to shape) and sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries. The sleeves are disregarded in determining whether the sweater originates in a USMCA country because only the component that determines the tariff classification of the good must be originating and the de minimis provision is applied to that component. Moreover, the total weight of the spandex is less than 10 percent of the total weight of the knit body fabric, which is the component that determines the tariff classification of the sweater, and the spandex does not exceed seven percent of the total weight of good. Assuming that the women's knit sweater satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations, the women's knit sweater is originating from the USMCA country.
Example 10: Subsection 5(9)
A men's shirt of Chapter 61 is made using two different fabrics; one for the body and another for the sleeves. The component that determines the tariff classification of the men's shirt would be the fabric used for the body, as it constitutes the material that predominates by weight and makes up the largest surface area of the shirt`s exterior. If this fabric is produced using non-originating fibers and yarns that do not satisfy a tariff change rule, the de minimis provision would be calculated on the basis of the total weight of the non-originating fibers or yarns used in the production of the fabric that makes up the body of the shirt. The weight of these non-originating fibers or yarns must be ten percent or less of the total weight of that fabric and any elastomeric content must be seven per cent or less of the total weight of that fabric.
Alternatively, if the shirt is made entirely of the same fabric, the component that determines the tariff classification of that shirt would be that fabric, as the shirt is made out of the same material throughout. Therefore, under this second scenario, the total weight of all non-originating fibers and yarns used in the production of the shirt that do not satisfy a tariff change rule, must be ten percent or less of the total weight of the shirt, and any elastomeric content must be seven per cent or less of the total weight of that shirt, for the shirt to be considered as an originating good.
Example 11: Subsection 5(9)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces women´s blouses of subheading 6206.40 from a fabric also produced by Producer A using 90% by weight originating polyester yarns of subheading 5402.33, 3% by weight non-originating lyocell yarn of subheading 5403.49 and 7% by weight non-originating elastomeric filament yarn of subheading 5402.44. This fabric is the component of the women´s blouses that determines its tariff classification under subheading 6206.40.
The product-specific rule of origin of Schedule I applicable to the women´s blouses of subheading 6206.40 requires a change in tariff classification from any other chapter, except from those headings and chapters under which certain yarns and fabrics, including polyester, lyocell and elastomeric filament yarns, are classified and a requirement that the good is cut and sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries.
In this case, the non-originating lyocell yarns of subheading 5403.49 and the non-originating elastomeric filament yarn of subheading 5402.44 do not satisfy the change in tariff classification required by the product-specific rule of origin of Schedule I, because the product specific rule of origin for heading 62.06 excludes a change from Chapter 54 to heading 62.06.
”
However, according to subsection (7), a textile or apparel good classified in Chapters 61 through 63 of the Harmonized System that contains non-originating fibers or yarns in the component of the good that determines its tariff classification that do not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification, will nonetheless be considered an originating good if the total weight of all those fibers or yarns is not more than 10 percent of the total weight of that component, of which the total weight of elastomeric content may not exceed 7 percent of the total weight of the component, and such good meets all the other applicable requirements of these Regulations.
Since the weight of the non-originating materials used by Producer A does not exceed 10 percent of the total weight of the component that determines the tariff classification of the women´s blouses, and the weight of elastomeric content also does not exceed 7 percent of such total weight, the women´s blouses qualify as originating goods.
Example 12: Subsection 5(10)
A producer located in a USMCA country manufactures boys' swimwear of subheading 6211.11 from fabric that has been woven in a USMCA country from yarn spun in a USMCA country; however, the producer uses non-originating narrow elastic of heading 60.02 in the waist-band of the swimwear. As a result of the use of non-originating narrow elastic of heading 60.02 in the waistband, and provided the garment is imported into a USMCA country at least 18 months after the Agreement enters into force, the swimwear is considered non-originating because it does not satisfy the requirement set out in Note 3 of Chapter 62. In addition, subsection 5(7) is not applicable regarding the narrow elastic of 60.02 and the good is therefore a non-originating good.

# Section 6. Sets of Goods, Kits or Composite Goods
6 (1) This section applies to a good that is classified as a set as a result of the application of rule 3 of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System.
(2)
Requirements.
Except as otherwise provided in Schedule I (PSRO Annex), a set is originating in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries only if each good in the set is originating and both the set and the goods meet the other applicable requirements of these Regulations.
(3)
Exceptions.
Notwithstanding, subsection 2, a set is only originating if the value of all the non-originating goods included in the set does not exceed 10 percent of the value of the set.
(4)
Value.
For the purposes of subsection 3, the value of non-originating goods in the set and the value of the set is to be calculated in the same manner as the value of non-originating materials determined in accordance with section 8 and the value of the good determined in accordance with section 7.
(5)
Examples. Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in subsection 1(4).
Example 1 (paint set)
Producer A assembles a paint set for arts and crafts. The set includes tubes of paint, paint brushes, and paper all presented in a reusable wooden box. The paint set for arts and crafts is classified in subheading 3210.00 as a result of the application of Rule 3 of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System and, as a result, Section 6 will apply with respect to such set. The paint, paper and wooden box are all originating as they each undergo the changes required in the product-specific rules of origin in Schedule I. The paint brushes, which represent four percent of the value of the set, are produced in the territory of a non-USMCA country and are therefore non-originating. The set is nonetheless originating.
Example 2: Subsection 6(2)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials to assemble a manicure set of subheading 8214.20. The set includes a nail nipper, cuticle scissors, a nail clipper and a nail file with cardboard support, all presented in a plastic case with zipper. The items are not classified as a set as a result of the application of rule 3 of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System. The Harmonized System specifies that manicure sets are classified in subheading 8214.20. This means that the specific rule of origin set out in Schedule I is applied. This rule requires a change in tariff classification from any other chapter. In order for the manicure set to qualify as an originating good under the rule set out in Schedule I, Producer A may not use any non-originating material of Chapter 82 in the assembly of the manicure set.
In this case, Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces the nail nipper, the cuticle scissors and the nail clipper included in the set, and all qualify as originating. Despite being classified in the same chapter as the manicure set (chapter 82), the originating nail nipper, the cuticle scissors and the nail clipper satisfy the change in tariff classification applicable to the manicure set. The nail file with cardboard support (6805.20) and the plastic case with zipper (4202.12) are imported from outside the territories of the USMCA countries; however, these items are not classified in chapter 82, so they satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification. Therefore, the manicure set is an originating good.
Example 3: Pants set Section 6(2)
Producer A makes a pants set, containing men's cotton denim trousers and a polyester belt, packed together for a retail sale. The trousers are made of cotton fabric formed and finished from yarn in a USMCA country. The sewing thread is formed and finished in a USMCA country. The pocket bag fabric is formed and finished in a USMCA country, of yarn wholly formed in a USMCA country. The trousers are cut and sewn in USMCA country A. A polyester webbing belt with a metal buckle is made in a non-USMCA country and shipped to USMCA country A, where it is threaded through the belt loops of the trousers. The value of the belt is 8% of the value of the trousers and belt combined.
The men's trousers are classified under subheading 6203.42. The rule of origin set out in Schedule I for subheading 6203.42 requires that the trousers be made from fabric produced in a USMCA country from yarn produced in a USMCA country. The trousers satisfy the product-specific rules provided in Schedule I and are considered originating. However, the belt does not satisfy the rules and would not be considered originating. The set is nonetheless an originating good if the belt value is 10% or less of the value of the set. Since the value of the belt is 8% of the value of the set, the men's trousers and belt set would be treated as an originating good under the USMCA.
Example 4: Shirt and Tie Set Section 6(2)
Producer A makes a boys' shirt and tie set in a USMCA country. The shirt is constructed from 55% cotton, 45% polyester, solid color, dyed, woven fabric, classified in subheading 5210.31. The fabric contains 73.2 total yarns per square centimeter and 76 metric yarns. The shirt is packaged in a retail polybag with a coordinating color, 100% polyester, woven fabric tie. The yarns used in the shirt fabric are spun in non-USMCA country and the fabric is woven and dyed in the same non-USMCA country. The shirt fabric is sent to the USMCA country where it is cut and sewn into finished garments. The coordinating tie is made in a non-USMCA country from fabric that is woven in that country from yarns that are spun in that country. The value of the coordinating tie is approximately 13% of the value of the set.
The shirt is classified under heading 62.05. The shirt satisfies the product-specific rule for subheading 62.05 set out in Schedule I and is considered originating because it is wholly made from fabric of heading 5210.31 (not of square construction, containing more than 70 warp ends and filling picks per square centimeter, of average yarn number exceeding 70 metric) and cut and sewn into finished garments in the USMCA country. On the other hand, the tie does not satisfy the product specific rule for heading 62.15 and would not be considered originating. For purposes of the sets rule, provided the tie is valued at 10% or less of the value of the set, the set will be treated as originating. However, since the value of the coordinating tie is approximately 13% of the value of the set, the shirt and tie set would not be treated as an originating good under the USMCA.
Example 5: Chef set Section 6(2)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces a chef set for retail sale using originating and non-originating materials. This set includes an apron, cooking gloves and a chef hat. The chef set is classified in heading 62.11 as a result of the application of rule 3 of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System. For this reason, subsection (3) applies to this set. Both the apron and cooking gloves meet the product-specific rules of origin for their respective product categories and are therefore considered to be originating. The chef hat, which represents 9.7 percent of the value of the set, is produced in the territory of a non-USMCA country and is therefore non-originating. The set is nonetheless an originating good because less than ten percent of the value of the set is non-originating.

# Part III

# Section 7. Regional Value Content
7 (1)
Calculation.
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), the regional value content of a good is to be calculated, at the choice of the importer, exporter or producer of the good, on the basis of either the transaction value method or the net cost method.
(2)
Transaction value method.
The transaction value method for calculating the regional value content of a good is as follows:
RVC = (TV−VNM)/TV * 100
Where
RVC is the regional value content of the good, expressed as a percentage;
TV is the transaction value of the good, determined in accordance with Schedule III with respect to the transaction in which the producer of the good sold the good, adjusted to exclude any costs incurred in the international shipment of the good; and
VNM is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good, determined in accordance with section 8.
(3)
Net cost method.
The net cost method for calculating the regional value content of a good is as follows:
RVC = (NC−VNM)/NC * 100
Where
RVC is the regional value content of the good, expressed as a percentage;
NC is the net cost of the good, calculated in accordance with subsection (11); and
VNM is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good, determined, except as otherwise provided in sections 14 and 15 and, in accordance with section 8.
(4)
Non-originating materials—values not included.
For the purpose of calculating the regional value content of a good under subsection (2) or (3), the value of non-originating materials used by a producer in the production of the good must not include
(a) the value of any non-originating materials used by another producer in the production of originating materials that are subsequently acquired and used by the producer of the good in the production of that good; or
(b) the value of any non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of a self-produced material that is an originating material and is designated as an intermediate material.
(5)
Self-produced material.
For the purposes of subsection (4),
(a) in the case of any self-produced material that is not designated as an intermediate material, only the value of any non-originating materials used in the production of the self-produced material is to be included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the good; and
(b) if a self-produced material that is designated as an intermediate material and is an originating material is used by the producer of the good with non-originating materials (whether or not those non-originating materials are produced by that producer) in the production of the good, the value of
those non-originating materials is to be included in the value of non-originating materials.
(6)
Net cost method—when required.
The regional value content of a good is to be calculated only on the basis of the net cost method if the rule set in Schedule I (PSRO Annex) does not provide a rule based on the transaction value method;
(7)
Net cost method—when change permitted.
If the importer, exporter or producer of a good calculates the regional value content of the good on the basis of the transaction value method and the customs administration of a USMCA country subsequently notifies that importer, exporter or producer in writing, during the course of a verification of origin, that
(a) the transaction value of the good, as determined by the importer, exporter or producer, is required to be adjusted under section 4 of Schedule III, or
(b) the value of any material used in the production of the good, as determined by the importer, exporter or producer, is required to be adjusted under section 5 of Schedule VI, the importer, exporter or producer may choose that the regional value content of the good be calculated on the basis of the net cost method, in which case the calculation must be made within 30 days after receiving the notification, or such longer period as that customs administration specifies.
(8)
Net cost method—no change permitted.
If the importer, exporter or producer of a good chooses that the regional value content of the good be calculated on the basis of the net cost method and the customs administration of a USMCA country subsequently notifies that importer, exporter or producer in writing, during the course of a verification of origin, that the good does not satisfy the applicable regional value content requirement, the importer, exporter or producer of the good may not recalculate the regional value content on the basis of the transaction value method.
(9)
Clarification.
Nothing in subsection (7) is to be construed as preventing any review and appeal under Article 5.15 of the Agreement, as implemented in each USMCA country, of an adjustment to or a rejection of
(a) the transaction value of the good; or
(b) the value of any material used in the production of the good.
(10)
Value of identical non-originating materials.
For the purposes of the transaction value method, if non-originating materials that are the same as one another in all respects, including physical characteristics, quality and reputation but excluding minor differences in appearance, are used in the production of a good, the value of those non-originating materials may, at the choice of the producer of the good, be determined in accordance with one of the methods set out in Schedule VII.
(11)
Calculating the net cost of a good.
For the purposes of subsection (3), the net cost of a good may be calculated, at the choice of the producer of the good, by
(a) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, subtracting any excluded costs that are included in that total cost, and reasonably allocating, in accordance with Schedule V, the remainder to the good;
(b) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, reasonably allocating, in accordance with Schedule V, that total cost to the good, and subtracting any excluded costs that are included in the amount allocated to that good; or
(c) reasonably allocating, in accordance with Schedule V, each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the good so that the aggregate of those costs does not include any excluded costs.
(12)
Calculation of total cost.
Total cost under subsection (11) consists of the costs referred to in subsection 1(6), and is calculated in accordance with that subsection and subsection 1(7).
(13)
Calculation of net cost of a good.
For the purpose of calculating the net cost under subsection (11),
(a) excluded costs must be the excluded costs that are recorded on the books of the producer of the good;
(b) excluded costs that are included in the value of a material that is used in the production of the good must not be subtracted from or otherwise excluded from the total cost; and
(c) excluded costs do not include any amount paid for research and development services performed in the territory of a USMCA country.
(14)
Non-allowable interest.
For the purpose of calculating non-allowable interest costs, the determination of whether interest costs incurred by a producer are more than 700 basis points above the interest rate of comparable maturities issued by the federal government of the country in which the producer is located is to be made in accordance with Schedule IX.
(15)
Use of “averaging” over a period.
For the purposes of the net cost method, the regional value content of the good, other than a good with respect to which an election to average may be made under subsection 16(1) or (10), may be calculated, if the producer elects to do so, by
(a) calculating the sum of the net costs incurred and the sum of the values of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the good and identical goods or similar goods, or any combination thereof, produced in a single plant by the producer over
(i) a one-month period,
(ii) any consecutive three-month or six-month period that falls within and is evenly divisible into the number of months of the producer's fiscal year remaining at the beginning of that period, or
(iii) the producer's fiscal year; and
(b) using the sums referred to in paragraph (a) as the net cost and the value of non-originating materials, respectively.
(16)
Application.
The calculation made under subsection (15) applies with respect to all units of the good produced during the period chosen by the producer under paragraph (15)(a).
(17)
No change to the goods or period.
An election made under subsection (15) may not be rescinded or modified with respect to the goods or the period with respect to which the election is made.
(18)
Period considered to be chosen.
If a producer chooses a one, three or six-month period under subsection (15) with respect to a good, the producer will be considered to have chosen under that subsection a period or periods of the same duration for the remainder of the producer's fiscal year with respect to this good.
(19)
Method and period for remainder of fiscal year.
If the net cost method is required to be used or has been chosen and an election has been made under subsection (15), the regional value content of the good is to be calculated on the basis of the net cost method over the period chosen under that subsection and for the remainder of the producer's fiscal year.
(20)
Analysis of actual costs.
Except as otherwise provided in subsections 16(9), if the producer of a good has calculated the regional value content of the good under the net cost method on the basis of estimated costs, including standard costs, budgeted forecasts or other similar estimating procedures, before or during the period chosen under paragraph (15)(a), the producer must conduct an analysis at the end of the producer's fiscal year of the actual costs incurred over the period with respect to the production of the good.
(21)
Option to treat any material as non-originating.
For the purpose of calculating the regional value content of a good, the producer of that good may choose to treat any material used in the production of that good as a non-originating material.
(22)
Examples.
Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in subsection 1(4).
Example 1: Example of point of direct shipment (with respect to adjusted to exclude any costs incurred in the international shipment of the good)
A producer has only one factory, at which the producer manufactures finished office chairs. Because the factory is located close to transportation facilities, all units of the finished good are stored in a factory warehouse 200 meters from the end of the production line. Goods are shipped worldwide from this warehouse. The point of direct shipment is the warehouse.
Example 2: Examples of point of direct shipment (with respect to adjusted to exclude any costs incurred in the international shipment of the good)
A producer has six factories, all located within the territory of one of the USMCA countries, at which the producer produces garden tools of various types. These tools are shipped worldwide, and orders usually consist of bulk orders of various types of tools. Because different tools are manufactured at different factories, the producer decided to consolidate storage and shipping facilities and ships all finished products to a large warehouse located near the seaport, from which all orders are shipped. The distance from the factories to the warehouse varies from 3 km to 130 km. The point of direct shipment for each of the goods is the warehouse.
Example 3: Examples of point of direct shipment (with respect to adjusted to exclude any costs incurred in the international shipment of the good)
A producer has only one factory, located near the center of one of the USMCA countries, at which the producer manufactures finished office chairs. The office chairs are shipped from that factory to three warehouses leased by the producer, one on the west coast, one near the factory and one on the east coast. The office chairs are shipped to buyers from these warehouses, the shipping location depending on the shipping distance from the buyer. Buyers closest to the west coast warehouse are normally supplied by the west coast warehouse, buyers closest to the east coast are normally supplied by the warehouse located on the east coast and buyers closest to the warehouse near the factory are normally supplied by that warehouse. In this case, the point of direct shipment is the location of the warehouse from which the office chairs are normally shipped to customers in the location in which the buyer is located.
Example 4: Subsection 7(3), net cost method
A producer located in USMCA country A sells Good A that is subject to a regional value content requirement to a buyer located in USMCA country B. The producer of Good A chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. All applicable requirements of these Regulations, other than the regional value content requirement, have been met. The applicable regional value content requirement is 50 per cent.
In order to calculate the regional value content of Good A, the producer first calculates the net cost of Good A. Under paragraph 6(11)(a), the net cost is the total cost of Good A (the aggregate of the product costs, period costs and other costs) per unit, minus the excluded costs (the aggregate of the sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs and non-allowable interest costs) per unit. The producer uses the following figures to calculate the net cost:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials $30.00
Value of non-originating materials 40.00
Other product costs 20.00
Period costs 10.00
Other costs 0.00
Total cost of Good A, per unit $100.00
Excluded costs:
Sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service cost $5.00
Royalties 2.50
Shipping and packing costs 3.00
Non-allowable interest costs 1.50
Total excluded costs $12.00
The net cost is the total cost of Good A, per unit, minus the excluded costs.
Total cost of Good A, per unit: $100.00
Excluded costs:—12.00
Net cost of Good A, per unit: $ 88.00
The value for net cost ($88) and the value of non-originating materials ($40) are needed in order to calculate the regional value content. The producer calculates the regional value content of Good A under the net cost method in the following manner:
RVC = (NC−VNM)/NC*100
= (88-40)/88*100
= 54.5%
Therefore, under the net cost method, Good A qualifies as an originating good, with a regional value content of 54.5 per cent.
Example 5: Paragraph 7(11)(a)
A producer in a USMCA country produces Good A and Good B during the producer's fiscal year.
The producer uses the following figures, which are recorded on the producer's books and represent all of the costs incurred with respect to both Good A and Good B, to calculate the net cost of those goods:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials $2,000
Value of non-originating materials 1,000
Other product costs 2,400
Period costs: (including $1,200 in excluded costs) 3,200
Other costs: 400
Total cost of Good A and Good B: $9,000
The net cost is the total cost of Good A and Good B, minus the excluded costs incurred with respect to those goods.
Total cost of Good A and Good B: $9,000
Excluded costs:—1,200
Net cost of Good A and Good B: $7,800
The net cost must then be reasonably allocated, in accordance with Schedule V, to Good A and Good B.
Example 6: Paragraph 7(11)(b))
A producer located in a USMCA country produces Good A and Good B during the producer's fiscal year. In order to calculate the regional value content of Good A and Good B, the producer uses the following figures that are recorded on the producer's books and incurred with respect to those goods:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials $2,000
Value of non-originating materials 1,000
Other product costs 2,400
Period costs: (including $1,200 in excluded costs) 3,200
Other costs: 400
Total cost of Good A and Good B: $9,000
Under paragraph 6(11)(b), the total cost of Good A and Good B is then reasonably allocated, in accordance with Schedule VII, to those goods. The costs are allocated in the following manner:
Allocated to Good A 5,220
Allocated to Good B 3,780
Total cost ($9,000 for both Good A and Good B)
The excluded costs ($1,200) that are included in total cost allocated to Good A and Good B, in accordance with Schedule VII, are subtracted from that amount.
Total Excluded costs:
Sales promotion, marketing and after-sale service costs 500
Royalties 200
Shipping and packing costs 500
Excluded Cost Allocated to Good A:
Sales promotion, marketing and after-sale service costs 290
Royalties 116
Shipping and packing costs 290
Net cost (total cost minus excluded costs): $4,524
Excluded Cost Allocated to Good B:
Sales promotion, marketing and after-sale service costs 210
Royalties 84
Shipping and packing costs 210
Net cost (total cost minus excluded costs): $3,276
The net cost of Good A is thus $4,524, and the net cost of Good B is $3,276.
Example 7: Paragraph 7(11)(c)
A producer located in a USMCA country produces Good C and Good D. The following costs are recorded on the producer's books for the months of January, February and March, and each cost that forms part of the total cost are reasonably allocated, in accordance with Schedule VII, to Good C and Good D.
Total cost: Good C and Good D (in thousands of dollars)
Product costs:
Value of originating materials 100
Value of non-originating materials 900
Other product costs 500
Period costs: (including $420 in excluded costs) 5,679
Minus Excluded costs 420
Other costs: 0
Total cost (aggregate of product costs, period costs and other costs): 6,759
Allocated to Good C (in thousands of dollars):
Product costs:
Value of originating materials 0
Value of non-originating materials 800
Other product costs 300
Period costs: (including $420 in excluded costs) 3,036
Minus Excluded costs 300
Other costs: 0
Total cost (aggregate of product costs, period costs and other costs): 3,836
Allocated to Good D (in thousands of dollars):
Product costs:
Value of originating materials 100
Value of non-originating materials 100
Other product costs 200
Period costs: (including $420 in excluded costs) 2,643
Minus Excluded costs 120
Other costs: 0
Total cost (aggregate of product costs, period costs and other costs): 2,923
Example 8: Subsection 7(12)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. Producer A buys Material X from Producer B, located in a USMCA country. Material X is a non-originating material and is used in the production of Good A. Producer A provides Producer B, at no charge, with molds to be used in the production of Material X. The cost of the molds that is recorded on the books of Producer A has been expensed in the current year. Pursuant to subparagraph 4(1)(b)(ii) of Schedule VI, the value of the molds is included in the value of Material X. Therefore, the cost of the molds that is recorded on the books of Producer A and that has been expensed in the current year cannot be included as a separate cost in the net cost of Good A because it has already been included in the value of Material X.
Example 9: Subsection 7(12)
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method and averages the calculation over the producer's fiscal year under subsection 7(15). Producer A determines that during that fiscal year Producer A incurred a gain on foreign currency conversion of $10,000 and a loss on foreign currency conversion of $8,000, resulting in a net gain of $2,000. Producer A also determines that $7,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $6,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is related to the purchase of non-originating materials used in the production of Good A, and $3,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $2,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is not related to the production of Good A. The producer determines that the total cost of Good A is $45,000 before deducting the $1,000 net gain on foreign currency conversion related to the production of Good A. The total cost of Good A is therefore $44,000. That $1,000 net gain is not included in the value of non-originating materials under subsection 8(1).
Example 10: Subsection 7(12)
Given the same facts as in example 9, except that Producer A determines that $6,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $7,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is related to the purchase of non-originating materials used in the production of Good A. The total cost of Good A is $45,000, which includes the $1,000 net loss on foreign currency conversion related to the production of Good A. That $1,000 net loss is not included in the value of non-originating materials under subsection 8(1).

# Part IV

# Section 8. Materials
8 (1)
Value of material used in production.
Except as otherwise provided for non-originating materials used in the production of a good referred to in section 14 or subsection 15(1), and except in the case of indirect materials, intermediate materials and packing materials and containers, for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of a good and for the purposes of subsection 5(1) and (4), the value of a material that is used in the production of the good is to be
(a) except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), if the material is imported by the producer of the good into the territory of the USMCA country in which the good is produced, the transaction value of the material at the time of importation, including the costs incurred in the international shipment of the material,
(b) if the material is acquired by the producer of the good from another person located in the territory of the USMCA country in which the good is produced
(i) the price paid or payable by the producer in the USMCA country where the producer is located,

(c) for a material that is self-produced
(i) all the costs incurred in the production of the material, which includes general expenses, and
(ii) an amount equivalent to the profit added in the normal course of trade, or equal to the profit that is usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the self-produced material that is being valued provided that no self-produced material that has been used in its production has been valued including the amount equivalent or equal to the profit according to this paragraph.
(2)
Adjustments to the value of materials.
The following costs may be deducted from the value of a non-originating material or material of undetermined origin, if they are included under subsection (1):
(a) the costs of freight, insurance and packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer;
(b) duties and taxes paid or payable with respect to the material in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable,
(c) customs brokerage fees, including the cost of in-house customs brokerage services, incurred with respect to the material in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries, and
(d) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, minus the value of any reusable scrap or by-product.
(3)
Documentary evidence required.
If the cost or expense listed in subsection (2) is unknown or documentary evidence of the amount of the adjustment is not available, then no adjustment is allowed for that particular cost or expense.
(4)
Transaction value not acceptable.
For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), if the transaction value of the material referred to in that paragraph is not acceptable or if there is no transaction value in accordance with Schedule IV (Unacceptable Transaction Value), the value of the material must be determined in accordance with Schedule VI (Value of Materials) and, if the costs referred to in subsection (2) are included in that value, those costs may be deducted from that value.
(5)
Costs recorded on books.
For the purposes of subsection (1), the costs referred to in paragraph (1)(c) are to be the costs referred to in those paragraphs that are recorded on the books of the producer of the good.
(6)
Designation of self-produced material as an intermediate material.
For the purpose of calculating the regional value content of a good the producer of the good may designate as an intermediate material any self-produced material that is used in the production of the good, provided that if an intermediate material is subject to a regional value content requirement, no other self-produced material that is subject to a regional value content requirement and is incorporated into that intermediate material is also designated by the producer as an intermediate material.
(7)
Particulars.
For the purposes of subsection (6),
(a) in order to qualify as an originating material, a self-produced material that is designated as an intermediate material must qualify as an originating material under these Regulations;
(b) the designation of a self-produced material as an intermediate material is to be made solely at the choice of the producer of that self-produced material; and
(c) except as otherwise provided in subsection 9(4), the proviso set out in subsection (6) does not apply with respect to an intermediate material used by another producer in the production of a material that is subsequently acquired and used in the production of a good by the producer referred to in subsection (6).
(8)
Value of an intermediate material.
The value of an intermediate material will be, at the choice of the producer of the good,
(a) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the producer that can be reasonably allocated to that intermediate material in accordance with Schedule V; or
(b) the aggregate of each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to that intermediate material that can be reasonably allocated to that intermediate material in accordance with Schedule V.
(9)
Calculation of total cost.
Total cost under subsection (8) consists of the costs referred to in subsection 1(6), and is calculated in accordance with that subsection and subsection 1(7).
(10)
Rescission of a designation.
If a producer of a good designates a self-produced material as an intermediate material under subsection (6) and the customs administration of a USMCA country into which the good is imported determines during a verification of origin of the good that the intermediate material is a non-originating material and notifies the producer of this in writing before the written determination of whether the good qualifies as an originating good, the producer may rescind the designation, and the regional value content of the good must be calculated as though the self-produced material were not so designated.
(11)
Effect of a rescission.
A producer of a good who rescinds a designation under subsection (10) may, not later than 30 days after the customs administration referred to in subsection (10) notifies the producer in writing that the self-produced material referred to in paragraph (a) is a non-originating material, designate as an intermediate material another self-produced material that is incorporated into the good, subject to the provision set out in subsection (6).
(12)
Second rescission.
If a producer of a good designates another self-produced material as an intermediate material under subsection (6) and the customs administration referred to in subsection (10) determines during the verification of origin of the good that that self-produced material is a non-originating material,
(a) the producer may rescind the designation, and the regional value content of the good will be calculated as though the self-produced material were not so designated; and,
(b) the producer may not designate another self-produced material that is incorporated into the good as an intermediate material.
(13)
Indirect materials.
For the purpose of determining whether a good is an originating good, an indirect material that is used in the production of the good
(a) will be considered to be an originating material, regardless of where that indirect material is produced; and
(b) if the good is subject to a regional value content requirement, for the purpose of calculating the net cost under the net cost method, the value of the indirect material is to be the costs of that material that are recorded on the books of the producer of the good.
(14)
Packaging materials and containers.
Packaging materials and containers, if classified under the Harmonized System with the good that is packaged therein, will be disregarded for the purpose of
(a) determining whether all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification;
(b) determining whether a good is wholly obtained or produced; and
(c) determining under subsection 5(1) the value of non-originating materials that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification.
(15)
Value of packaging materials and containers—cases where taken into account.
If packaging materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale are classified under the Harmonized System with the good that is packaged therein and that good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of those packaging materials and containers will be taken into account as originating materials or non-originating materials, as the case may be, for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of the good.
(16)
Packaging materials and containers—self-produced.
For the purposes of subsection (15), if packaging materials and containers are self-produced materials, the producer may choose to designate those materials as intermediate materials under subsection (6).
(17)
Packing materials and containers.
For the purpose of determining whether a good is an originating good, packing materials and containers are disregarded.
(18)
Fungible materials and fungible goods.
A fungible material or good is originating if:
(a) when originating and non-originating fungible materials
(i) are withdrawn from an inventory in one location and used in the production of the good, or
(ii) are withdrawn from inventories in more than one location in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries and used in the production of the good at the same production facility, the determination of whether the materials are originating is made on the basis of an inventory management method recognized in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of, or otherwise accepted by, the USMCA country in which the production is performed or an inventory management method set out in Schedule VIII; or
(b) when originating and non-originating fungible goods are commingled and exported in the same form, the determination of whether the goods are originating is made on the basis of an inventory management method recognized in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of, or otherwise accepted by, the USMCA country from which the good is exported or an inventory management method set out in Schedule VIII.
(19) The inventory management method selected under subsection 18 must be used throughout the fiscal year of the producer or the person that selected the inventory management method.
(20) An importer may claim that a fungible material or good is originating if the importer, producer, or exporter has physically segregated each fungible material or good as to allow their specific identification.
(21)
Choice of inventory management method.
If fungible materials referred to in paragraph (18)(a) and fungible goods referred to in paragraph (18)(b) are withdrawn from the same inventory, the inventory management method used for the materials must be the same as the inventory management method used for the goods, and if the averaging method is used, the respective averaging periods for fungible materials and fungible goods are to be used.
(22)
Written notice.
A choice of inventory management methods under subsection (18) will be considered to have been made when the customs administration of the USMCA country into which the good is imported is informed in writing of the choice during the course of a verification of origin of the good.
(23)
Accessories, spare parts, tools or instructional or other information materials.
For the purposes of subsections (24) through (27), “accessories, spare parts, tools, or instructional or other information materials” are covered when
(a) they are classified with, delivered with, but not invoiced separately from the good, and
(b) their type, quantity and value are customary for the good, within the industry that produces the good.
(24)
Exclusion.
Accessories, spare parts, tools, or instructional or other information materials are to be disregarded for the purpose of determining
(a) whether a good is wholly obtained;
(b) whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the good satisfy a process or applicable change in tariff
classification requirement established in Schedule I (PSRO Annex); or,
(c) under subsection 5(1), the value of non-originating materials that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification.
(25)
Value for regional value content requirement.
If a good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of accessories, spare parts, tools, or instructional or other information materials is to be taken into account as originating materials or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good.
(26)
Designation.
For the purposes of subsection (25), if accessories, spare parts, tools, or instructional or other information materials are self-produced materials, the producer may choose to designate those materials as intermediate materials under subsection (6).
(27)
Originating status.
A good's accessories, spare parts, tools, or instructional or other information materials have the originating status of the good with which they are delivered.
(28)
Examples illustrating the provisions on materials.
Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in subsection 1(4).
Example 1: Subsection 8(4), Transaction Value not Determined in a Manner Consistent with Schedule VI
Producer A, located in USMCA country A, imports a bicycle chainring into USMCA country A. Producer A purchased the chainring from a middleman located in country B. The middleman purchased the chainring from a manufacturer located in country B. Under the laws in USMCA country A that implement the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the customs value of the chainring was based on the price actually paid or payable by the middleman to the manufacturer. Producer A uses the chainring to produce a bicycle, and exports the bicycle to USMCA country C. The bicycle is subject to a regional value content requirement.
Under subsection 3(1) of Schedule VI (Value of Materials), the price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the producer to or for the benefit of the seller of the material. Section 1 of that Schedule defines producer and seller for the purposes of the Schedule. A producer is the person who uses the material in the production of a good that is subject to a regional value content requirement. A seller is the person who sells the material being valued to the producer.
The transaction value of the chainring was not determined in a manner consistent with Schedule VI because it was based on the price actually paid or payable by the middleman to the manufacturer, rather than on the price actually paid or payable by Producer A to the middleman. Thus, subsection 8(4) applies and the chainring is valued in accordance with Schedule IV.
Example 2: Subsection 8(7), Value of Intermediate Materials
A producer located in a USMCA country produces a bicycle, which is subject to a regional value content requirement under section 3(2). The producer also produces a chain ring, which is used in the production of the bicycle. Both originating materials and non-originating materials are used in the production of the chainring. The chainring is subject to a change in tariff classification requirement under section 3(2). The costs to produce the chainring are the following:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials $ 1.00
Value of non-originating materials 7.50
Other product costs 1.50
Period costs (including $0.30 in royalties): 0.50
Other costs: 0.10
Total cost of the chainring: $10.60
The producer designates the chainring as an intermediate material and determines that, because all of the non-originating materials that are used in the production of the chainring undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Schedule I, the chainring would, under section 3(2) qualify as an originating material. The cost of the non-originating materials used in the production of the chainring is therefore not included in the value of non-originating materials that are used in the production of the bicycle for the purpose of determining its regional value content of the bicycle. Because the chainring has been designated as an intermediate material, the total cost of the chainring, which is $10.60, is treated as the cost of originating materials for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of the bicycle. The total cost of the bicycle is determined in accordance with the following figures:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
—intermediate materials $10.60
—other materials 3.00
Value of non-originating materials 5.50
Other product costs 6.50
Period costs: 2.50
Other costs: 0.10
Total cost of the bicycle: $28.20
Example 3: Subsection 8(7), Effects of the Designation of Self-produced Materials on Net Cost
The ability to designate intermediate materials helps to put the vertically integrated producer who is self-producing materials that are used in the production of a good on par with a producer who is purchasing materials and valuing those materials in accordance with subsection 8(1). The following situations demonstrate how this is achieved:

# Situation 1
A producer located in a USMCA country produces a bicycle, which is subject to a regional
value content requirement of 50 per cent under the net cost method. The bicycle satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations. The producer purchases a bicycle frame, which is used in the production of the bicycle, from a supplier located in a USMCA country. The value of the frame determined in accordance with subsection 8(1) is $11.00. The frame is an originating material. All other materials used in the production of the bicycle are non-originating materials.
The net cost of the bicycle is determined as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials (bicycle frame) $11.00
Value of non-originating materials 5.50
Other product costs 6.50
Period costs: (including $0.20 in excluded costs) 0.50
Other costs: 0.10
Total cost of the bicycle: $23.60
Excluded costs: (included in period costs) 0.20
Net cost of the bicycle: $23.40
The regional value content of the bicycle is calculated as follows:
RVC = (NC−VNM)/NC*100
= ($23.40−$5.50)/$23.50*100
= 76.5%
The regional value content of the bicycle is 76.5 per cent, and the bicycle, therefore, qualifies as an originating good.

# Situation 2
A producer located in a USMCA country produces a bicycle, which is subject to a regional value content requirement of 50 per cent under the net cost method. The bicycle satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations. The producer self-produces the bicycle frame which is used in the production of the bicycle. The costs to produce the frame are the following:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials $ 1.00
Value of non-originating materials 7.50
Other product costs 1.50
Period costs: (including $0.20 in excluded costs) 0.50
Other costs: 0.10
Total cost of the bicycle frame: $10.60
Additional costs to produce the bicycle are the following:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials $ 0.00
Value of non-originating materials 5.50
Other product costs 6.50
Period costs: (Including $0.20 in excluded costs) 0.50
Other costs: 0.10
Total additional costs: $12.60
The producer does not designate the bicycle frame as an intermediate material under subsection 8(4). The net cost of the bicycle is calculated as follows:
Costs of the bicycle frame (not designated as an intermediate material)
Additional costs to produce the bicycle

The regional value content of the bicycle is calculated as follows:
RVC = (NC−VNM)/NC*100
=
($22.80−$13.00)/$22.80*100
= 42.9%
The regional value content of the bicycle is 42.9 per cent, and the bicycle, therefore, does not qualify as an originating good.

# Situation 3
A producer located in a USMCA country produces the bicycle, which is subject to a regional value content requirement of 50 per cent under the net cost method. The bicycle satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations. The producer self-produces the bicycle frame, which is used in the production of the bicycle. The costs to produce the frame are the following:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials $ 1.00
Value of non-originating materials 7.50
Other product costs 1.50
Period costs: (Including $0.20 in excluded costs) 0.50
Other costs: 0.10
Total cost of the bicycle frame: $10.60
Additional costs to produce the bicycle are the following: Product costs:
0.10
Product costs:
Value of originating materials $ 0.00
Value of non-originating materials 5.50
Other product costs 6.50
Period costs: (including $0.20 in excluded costs) 0.50
Other costs: 0.10
Total additional costs: $12.60
The producer designates the frame as an intermediate material under subsection 8(6). The frame qualifies as an originating material under section 3(2). Therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the frame is not included in the value of non-originating materials for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of the bicycle. The net cost of the bicycle is calculated as follows:
Costs of the bicycle frame (not designated as an intermediate material)
Additional costs to produce the bicycle

The regional value content of the bicycle is calculated as follows:
RVC = (NC−VNM)/NC*100
= ($23.00−$5.50)/$23.00*100
= 76.1%
The regional value content of the bicycle is 76.1 per cent, and the bicycle, therefore, qualifies as an originating good.
Example 4: Originating Materials Acquired from a Producer Who Produced Them Using Intermediate Materials
Producer A, located in USMCA country A, produces switches. In order for the switches to qualify as originating goods, Producer A designates subassemblies of the switches as intermediate materials. The subassemblies are subject to a regional value content requirement. They satisfy that requirement, and qualify as originating materials. The switches are also subject to a regional value content requirement, and, with the subassemblies designated as intermediate materials, are determined to have a regional value content of 65 per cent.
Producer A sells the switches to Producer B, located in USMCA country B, who uses them to produce switch assemblies that are used in the production of Good B. The switch assemblies are subject to a regional value content requirement. Producers A and B are not accumulating their production within the meaning of section 9. Producer B is therefore able, under subsection 8(6), to designate the switch assemblies as intermediate materials.
If Producers A and B were accumulating their production within the meaning of section 9, Producer B would be unable to designate the switch assemblies as intermediate materials, because the production of both producers would be considered to be the production of one producer.
Example 5: Single Producer and Successive Designations of Materials Subject to a Regional Value Content Requirement as Intermediate Materials
Producer A, located in USMCA country, produces Material X and uses Material X in the production of Good B. Material X qualifies as an originating material because it satisfies the applicable regional value content requirement. Producer A designates Material X as an intermediate material.
Producer A uses Material X in the production of Material Y, which is also used in the production of Good B. Material Y is also subject to a regional value content requirement. Under the proviso set out in subsection 8(6), Producer A cannot designate Material Y as an intermediate material, even if Material Y satisfies the applicable regional value content requirement, because Material X was already designated by Producer A as an intermediate material.
Example 6: Single Producer and Multiple Designations of Materials as Intermediate Materials
Producer X, who is located in USMCA country X, uses non-originating materials in the production of self-produced materials A, B and C. None of the self-produced materials are used in the production of any of the other self-produced materials.
Producer X uses the self-produced materials in the production of Good O, which is exported to USMCA country Y. Materials A, B and C qualify as originating materials because they satisfy the applicable regional value content requirements.
Because none of the self-produced materials are used in the production of any of the other self-produced materials, then even though each self-produced material is subject to a regional value content requirement, Producer X may, under subsection 8(6), designate all of the self-produced materials as intermediate materials. The proviso set out in subsection 8(6) only applies if self-produced materials are used in the production of other self-produced materials and both are subject to a regional value content requirement.
Example 7: Subsection 8(23) Accessories, Spare Parts, Tools, Instruction or Other Information Materials
The following are examples of accessories, spare parts, tools, instructional or other information materials that are delivered with a good and form part of the good's standard accessories, spare parts, tools, instructional or other information materials:
(a) Consumables that must be replaced at regular intervals, such as dust collectors for an air-conditioning system,
(b) a carrying case for equipment,
(c) a dust cover for a machine,
(d) an operational manual for a vehicle,
(e) brackets to attach equipment to a wall,
(f) a bicycle tool kit or a car jack,
(g) a set of wrenches to change the bit on a chuck,
(h) a brush or other tool to clean out a machine, and
(i) electrical cords and power bars for use with electronic goods.
Example 8: Value of Indirect Materials that are Assists
Producer A, located in a USMCA country, produces a well-water pump that is subject to a regional value content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. Producer A buys a mold-injected plastic water flow sensor from Producer B, located in the same USMCA country, and uses it in the production of the well-water pump. Producer A provides to Producer B, at no charge, molds to be used in the production of the water flow sensor. The molds have a value of $100 which is expensed in the current year by Producer A.
The water flow sensor is subject to a regional value content requirement which Producer B chooses to calculate using the net cost method. For the purpose of determining the value of non-originating materials in order to calculate the regional value content of the water flow sensor, the molds are considered to be an originating material because they are an indirect material. However, pursuant to subsection 8(13) they have a value of nil because the cost of the molds with respect to the water flow sensor is not recorded on the books of Producer B.
It is determined that the water flow sensor is a non-originating material. The cost of the molds that is recorded on the books of producer A is expensed in the current year. Pursuant to section 4 of Schedule VI (Value of Materials), the value of the molds (see subparagraph 4(1)(b)(ii) of Schedule VI) must be included in the value of the water flow sensor by Producer A when calculating the regional value content of the well-water pump. The cost of the molds, although recorded on the books of producer A, cannot be included as a separate cost in the net cost of the well-water pump because it is already included in the value of the water flow sensor. The entire cost of the water flow sensor, which includes the cost of the molds, is included in the value of non-originating materials for the purposes of the regional value content of the well-water pump.

# Part V General Provisions

# Section 9. Accumulation
(9) (1) Subject to subsections (2) through (5)
(a) a good is originating if the good is produced in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries by one or more producers, provided that the good satisfies the requirements of section 3 and all other applicable requirements of these Regulations;
(b) an originating good or material of one or more of the USMCA countries is considered as originating in the territory of another USMCA country when used as a material in the production of a good in the territory of another USMCA country; and
(c) production undertaken on a non-originating material in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries may contribute toward the originating status of a good, regardless of whether that production was sufficient to confer originating status to the material itself.
(2)
Accumulation using the net cost method.
If a good is subject to a regional value content requirement based on the net cost method and an exporter or producer of the good has a statement signed by a producer of a material that is used in the production of the good that states

(i) net cost incurred by the producer of the good with respect to the material is to be the net cost incurred by the producer of the material plus, if not included in the net cost incurred by the producer of the material, the costs referred to in paragraphs 8(2)(a) through (c), and
(ii) the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the material is to be the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the material; or
(b) any amount, other than an amount that includes any of the value of non-originating materials, that is part of the net cost incurred by the producer of the material in the production of that material,
(i) the net cost incurred by the producer of the good with respect to the material is to be the value of the material, determined in accordance with subsection 8(1), and
(ii) the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the material is to be the value of the material, determined in accordance with subsection 8(1), minus the amount stated in the statement.
(3)
Accumulation using the transaction value method.
If a good is subject to a regional value content requirement based on the transaction value method and an exporter or producer of the good has a statement signed by a producer of a material that is used in the production of the good that states the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the material in the production of that material, the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the material is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the material.
(4)
Averaging of costs—net cost method.
If a good is subject to a regional value content requirement based on the net cost method and an exporter or producer of the good does not have a statement described in subsection (2) but has a statement signed by a producer of a material that is used in the production of the good that
(a) states the sum of the net costs incurred and the sum of the values of non-originating materials used by the producer of the material in the production of that material and identical materials or similar materials, or any combination thereof, produced in a single plant by the producer of the material over a month or any consecutive three, six or twelve month period that falls within the fiscal year of the producer of the good, divided by the number of units of materials with respect to which the statement is made,
(i) the net cost incurred by the producer of the good with respect to the material is to be the sum of the net costs incurred by the producer of the material with respect to that material and the identical materials or similar materials, divided by the number of units of materials with respect to which the statement is made, plus, if not included in the net costs incurred by the producer of the material, the costs referred to in paragraphs 8(2)(a) through (c), and
(ii) the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the material is to be the sum of the values of non-originating materials used by the producer of the material with respect to that material and the identical materials or similar materials divided by the number of units of materials with respect to which the statement is made; or
(b) states any amount, other than an amount that includes any of the values of non-originating materials, that is part of the sum of the net costs incurred by the producer of the material in the production of that material and identical materials or similar materials, or any combination thereof, produced in a single plant by the producer of the material over a month or any consecutive three, six or twelve month period that falls within the fiscal year of the producer of the good, divided by the number of units of materials with respect to which the statement is made,
(i) the net cost incurred by the producer of the good with respect to the material is to be the value of the material, determined in accordance with subsection 8(1), and
(ii) the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the material is to be the value of the material, determined in accordance with subsection 8(1), minus the amount stated in the statement.
(5)
Averaging of costs—transaction value method.
If a good is subject to a regional value content requirement based on the transaction value method and an exporter or producer of the good does not have a statement described in subsection (3) but has a statement signed by a producer of a material that is used in the production of the good that states the sum of the values of non-originating materials used by the producer of the material in the production of that material and identical materials or similar materials, or any combination thereof, produced in a single plant by the producer of the material over a month or any consecutive three, six or twelve month period that falls within the fiscal year of the producer of the good, divided by the number of units of materials with respect to which the statement is made, the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the material is the sum of the values of non-originating materials used by the producer of the material with respect to that material and the identical materials or similar materials divided by the number of units of materials with respect to which the statement is made.
(6)
Single producer.
For the purposes of subsection 8(6), if a producer of the good chooses to accumulate the production of materials under subsection (1), that production will be considered to be the production of the producer of the good.
(7)
Particulars.
For the purposes of this section,
(a) in order to accumulate the production of a material,
(i) if the good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the producer of the good must have a statement described in subsection (2) through (5) that is signed by the producer of the material, and
(ii) if an applicable change in tariff classification is applied to determine whether the good is an originating good, the producer of
the good must have a statement signed by the producer of the material that states the tariff classification of all non-originating materials used by that producer in the production of that material and that the production of the material took place entirely in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries;
(b) a producer of a good who chooses to accumulate is not required to accumulate the production of all materials that are incorporated into the good; and
(c) any information set out in a statement referred to in subsection (2) through (5) that concerns the value of materials or costs is to be in the same currency as the currency of the country in which the person who provided the statement is located.
(8)
Examples of accumulation of production.
Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in subsection 1(4).
Example 1: Subsection 9(1)
Producer A, located in USMCA country A, imports unfinished bearing rings provided for in subheading 8482.99 into USMCA country A from a non-USMCA territory. Producer A further processes the unfinished bearing rings into finished bearing rings, which are of the same subheading. The finished bearing rings of Producer A do not satisfy an applicable change in tariff classification and therefore do not qualify as originating goods.
The net cost of the finished bearing rings (per unit) is calculated as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$0.15
Value of non-originating materials
0.75
Other product costs
0.35
Period costs: (including $0.05 in excluded costs)
0.15
Other costs:
0.05
Total cost of the finished bearing rings, per unit:
1.45
Excluded costs: (included in period costs)
0.05
Net cost of the finished bearing rings, per unit:
1.40
Producer A sells the finished bearing rings to Producer B who is located in USMCA country A for $1.50 each. Producer B further processes them into bearings, and intends to export the bearings to USMCA country B. Although the bearings satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification, the bearings are subject to a regional value content requirement.
Situation A:
Producer B does not choose to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$0.45
Value of non-originating materials (value, per unit, of the bearing rings purchased from Producer A)
1.50
Other product costs
0.75
Period costs: (Including $0.05 in excluded costs)
0.15
Other costs
0.05
Total cost of the bearings, per unit:
2.90
Excluded costs: (Included in period costs)
0.05
Net cost of the bearings, per unit:
2.85
Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is
ER01JY20.000
Therefore, the bearings are non-originating goods.
Situation B:
Producer B chooses to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. Producer A provides a statement described in paragraph 9(2)(a) to Producer B. The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials ($0.45 + $0.15)
$0.60
Value of non-originating materials (value, per unit, of the unfinished bearing rings imported by Producer A)
0.75
Other product costs ($0.75 + $0.35)
1.10
Period costs: (($0.15 + $0.15), including $0.10 in excluded costs)
0.30
Other costs: ($0.05 + $0.05)
0.10
Total cost of the bearings, per unit:
2.85
Excluded costs: (Included in period costs)
0.10
Net cost of the bearings, per unit:
2.75
Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is
ER01JY20.001
Therefore, the bearings are originating goods.
Situation C:
Producer B chooses to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. Producer A provides to Producer B a statement described in paragraph 9(2)(b) that specifies an amount equal to the net cost minus the value of non-originating materials used to produce the finished bearing rings ($1.40−0.75 = $0.65). The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials ($0.45 + $0.65)
$1.10
Value of non-originating materials ($1.50 − $0.65)
0.85
Other product costs
0.75
Period costs: (Including $0.05 in excluded costs)
0.15
Other costs
0.05
Total cost of the bearings, per unit:
2.90
Excluded costs: (Included in period costs)
0.05
Net cost of the bearings, per unit:
2.85
Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is
ER01JY20.002
Therefore, the bearings are originating goods.
Situation D:
Producer B chooses to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. Producer A provides to Producer B a statement described in paragraph 9(2)(b) that specifies an amount equal to the value of other product costs used in the production of the finished bearing rings ($0.35). The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$0.45
Value of non-originating materials ($1.50 − $0.35)
1.15
Other product costs ($0.75 + $0.35)
1.10
Period costs: (Including $0.05 in excluded costs)
0.15
Other costs
0.05
Total cost of the bearings, per unit:
2.90
Excluded costs: (Included in period costs)
0.05
Net cost of the bearings, per unit:
2.85
Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is
ER01JY20.003
Therefore, the bearings are originating goods.
Example 2: Section 9(1)
Producer A, located in USMCA country A, imports non-originating cotton, carded or combed, provided for in heading 52.03 for use in the production of cotton yarn provided for in heading 52.05. Because the change from cotton, carded or combed, to cotton yarn is a change within the same chapter, the cotton does not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification for heading 52.05, which is a change from any other chapter, with certain exceptions. Therefore, the cotton yarn that Producer A produces from non-originating cotton is a non-originating good.
Producer A then sells the non-originating cotton yarn to Producer B, also located in USMCA country A, who uses the cotton yarn in the production of woven fabric of cotton provided for in heading 52.08. The change from non-originating cotton yarn to woven fabric of cotton is insufficient to satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification for heading 52.08, which is a change from any heading outside headings 52.08 through 52.12, except from certain headings, under which various yarns, including cotton yarn provided for in heading 52.05, are classified.
Therefore, the woven fabric of cotton that Producer B produces from non-originating cotton yarn produced by Producer A is a non-originating good.
However, Producer B can choose to accumulate the production of Producer A. The rule for heading 52.08, under which the cotton fabric is classified, does not exclude a change from heading 52.03, under which carded or combed cotton is classified. Therefore, under section 15(1), the change from carded or combed cotton provided for in heading 52.03 to the woven fabric of cotton provided for in heading 52.08 would satisfy the applicable change of tariff classification for heading 52.08. The woven fabric of cotton would be considered as an originating good.
Producer B, in order to choose to accumulate Producer A's production, must have a statement described in subsection 9(7).
Situation E:
Producer B chooses to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. Producer A provides to Producer B a signed statement described in subsection 9(3) that specifies the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the finished bearing rings ($0.75). Producer B chooses to calculate the regional value content of the bearings under the transaction value method. The regional value content of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:
Transaction value of the bearings, per unit
$3.15
Costs incurred, per unit, in the international shipment of the good (included in transaction value of the bearings)
0.15
Transaction value, per unit, adjusted to exclude any costs incurred in the international shipment of the good
3.00
Value of non-originating materials (value, per unit, of the unfinished bearing rings imported by Producer A)
0.75
Under the transaction value method, the regional value content of the bearings is
RVC = (TV−VNM)/TV × 100
= ($3.00−$0.75)/$3.00 × 100
= 75%
Therefore, because the bearings have a regional value content of at least 60 percent under transaction value method, the bearings are originating goods.

# Section 10. Transshipment
10 (1)
Transport requirements to retain originating status.
If an originating good is transported outside the territories of the USMCA countries, the good retains its originating status if
(a) the good remains under customs control outside the territories of the USMCA countries; and
(b) the good does not undergo further production or any other operation outside the
territories of the USMCA countries, other than unloading; reloading; separation from a bulk shipment; storing; labeling or other marking required by the importing USMCA country; or any other operation necessary to transport the good to the territory of the importing USMCA country or to preserve the good in good condition, including:
(i) Inspection;
(ii) removal of dust that accumulates during shipment;
(iii) ventilation;
(iv) spreading out or drying;

# Part VI Automotive Goods

# Section 12. Definitions and Interpretation
(1) For purposes of this part,
aftermarket part
means a good that is not for use as original equipment in the production of passenger vehicles, light trucks or heavy trucks as defined in these Regulations;
all-terrain vehicle
means a vehicle that does not meet United States federal safety and emissions standards permitting unrestricted on-road use or the equivalent Mexican and Canadian on-road standards;
annual purchase value (APV)
means the sum of the values of high-wage materials purchased annually by a producer for use in the production of passenger vehicles, light trucks or heavy trucks in a plant located in the territory of a USMCA country;
average base hourly wage rate
means the average hourly rate of pay based on all the hours performed on direct production work at a plant or facility, even if such workers performing that work are paid on a salary, piece-rate, or day-rate basis. This includes all hours performed by full-time, part time, temporary, and seasonal workers. The rate of pay does not include benefits, bonuses or shift-premiums, or premium pay for overtime, holidays or weekends. If a worker is paid by a third party, such as a temporary employment agency, only the wages received by the worker are included in the average base hourly wage rate calculation.
For direct production workers, the average base hourly wage rate of pay is calculated based on all their working hours. For other workers performing direct production work, the average base hourly rate is calculated based on the number of hours performing direct production work. The rate also does not include any hours worked by interns, trainees, students, or any worker that does not have an express or implied compensation agreement with the employer.
If any direct production worker or worker performing direct production work is compensated by a method other than hourly, such as a salary, piece-rate, or day-rate basis, the worker's hourly base wage rate-is calculated by converting the salary, piece-rate, or day-rate to an hourly equivalent. This hourly equivalent is then multiplied by the number of hours worked in direct production for purposes of calculating the average base hourly wage rate.

# Section 14: Further Requirements Related to the Regional Value Content for Passenger Vehicles, Light Trucks, and Parts Thereof

# Roll-Up of Originating Materials
(1) The value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of a passenger vehicle, light truck and parts thereof must not, for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of the good, include the value of non-originating materials used to produce originating materials that are subsequently used in the production of the good. For greater certainty, if the production undertaken on non-originating materials results in the production of a good that qualifies as originating, no account is to be taken of the non-originating material contained therein if that good is used in the subsequent production of another good.

# Requirements Related to Core Parts Listed in Table A.1
(2) A part listed in Table A.1 that is for use as original equipment in the production of a passenger vehicle or light truck, except for batteries of subheading 8507.60 that are used as the primary source of electrical power for the propulsion of an electric passenger vehicle or an electric light truck, is originating only if it satisfies the regional value content requirement in sections 13 or 14 or Schedule I (PSRO Annex).
(3) A battery of subheading 8507.60 that is used as the primary source of electrical power for the propulsion of an electric passenger vehicle or an electric light truck is originating if it meets the applicable requirements set out in section 14 or Schedule I (PSRO Annex).

# Parts Listed in Column 1 of Table A.2 Must Be Originating for Passenger Vehicle or Light Truck To Be Originating
(4) In addition to other applicable requirements set out in these Regulations, a passenger vehicle or light truck is only originating if the parts listed in column 1 of Table A.2 used in its production are originating. The value of non-originating materials (VNM) for such parts must be calculated in accordance with subsections 14(7) through 14(8), or, at the choice of the vehicle producer or exporter, subsections 14(9) through 14(11). The net cost of a part must be calculated in accordance with section 7 (Regional Value Content), without regard to the VNM calculation method chosen.

# Parts Listed in Column 1 of Table A.2 Must Meet an RVC Requirement; Advanced Batteries May Meet an RVC or Tariff Shift Requirement
(5) Except for an advanced battery of subheading 8507.60, a part listed in column 1 of Table A.2, that is for use in a passenger vehicle or light truck, must meet the regional value content requirement of section 13 or Schedule I (PSRO Annex) to be considered originating.
(6) An advanced battery of subheading 8507.60, that is for use in a passenger vehicle or light truck, is originating if it meets the applicable change in tariff classification or regional value content requirements set out in Schedule I (PSRO Annex).

# VNM for Core Parts May Include All Non-Originating Materials, or Only Materials Listed in Column 2 of Table A.2
(7) For the purpose of satisfying the requirement specified in subsections (4) through (6), the regional value content of a part listed in column 1 of Table A.2, the value of non-originating materials (VNM) may be determined, at the choice of the vehicle producer or exporter, taking into consideration:
(a) The value of all non-originating materials used in the production of the part; or
(b) the value of non-originating components that are listed in column 2 of Table A.2 that are used in the production of the part.
(8) For the purposes of a regional value content calculation for a good listed in column 1 of Table A.2, based on paragraph (7)(b), any non-originating materials used in the production of the good that are not listed in column 2 of Table A.2 may be disregarded. For greater certainty, any non-originating parts listed in column 2 of Table A.2 must be included in the VNM calculation. Any parts not listed in column 2 of Table A.2 or materials or components used to produce such parts should also not be part of the VNM calculation.
(9) Subsections (7) and (8) do not apply when calculating the regional value content of a part listed in Column 1 of Table A.2 traded on its own. The rules for such parts are listed in section 13 or Schedule I of these Regulations.

# Parts Listed in Column 1 of Table A.2 May Be Treated as a Single, Super-Core Part
(10) For the purpose of satisfying the requirement specified in subsections (4) through (6) and as an alternative to determining the VNM based on the method in subsection (7), the regional value content of the parts listed in column 1 of Table A.2 of these Regulations may be determined, at the choice of the vehicle producer or exporter, by treating these parts as a single part, which may be referred to as a super-core part,
using the sum of the net cost of each part listed under column 1 of Table A.2 of these Regulations, and when calculating the VNM taking into consideration:
(a) The sum of the value of all non-originating materials used in the production of the parts listed under column 1 of table A.2; or
(b) the sum of the value of the non-originating components that are listed in column 2 of Table A.2 that are used in the production of the parts listed in column 1 of Table A.2.
(11) If a non-originating material used in the production of a component listed in column 2 of Table A.2 undergoes further production such that it satisfies the requirements of these Regulations, the component is treated as originating when determining the originating status of the subsequently produced part listed in column 1 of Table A.2, regardless of whether that component was produced by the producer of the part.
(12) The regional value content requirement for the parts listed in column 1 of Table A.2 may be averaged in accordance with the provisions in Section 16. Such an average may be calculated using the average regional value content for each individual parts category in the left hand column of Table A.2, or by calculating the average regional value content for all parts in the left hand column of Table A by treating them as a single part, defined as a super-core. Once this average, by either methodology, exceeds the required thresholds listed in subsection (13), all parts used to calculate this average are considered originating.

# RVC Requirements Related to Parts Listed in Tables A.1 and A.2
(13) Further to subsections (2), (7) and (10), the following regional value content thresholds apply to parts for use as original equipment listed under Table A.1 and column 1 of Table A.2:

(9) If the producer of a passenger vehicle, light truck, heavy truck or other vehicle has calculated the regional value content of the motor vehicle on the basis of estimated costs, including standard costs, budgeted forecasts or other similar estimating procedures, before or during the producer's fiscal year, the producer must conduct an analysis at the end of the producer's fiscal year of the actual costs incurred over the period with respect to the production of the motor vehicle, and, if the passenger vehicle, light truck, or heavy truck does not satisfy the regional value content requirement on the basis of the actual costs, immediately inform any person to whom the producer has provided a Certificate of Origin for the motor vehicle, or a written statement that the motor vehicle is an originating good, that the motor vehicle is a non-originating good.
(10) For the purpose of calculating the regional value content for an automotive good listed in Tables A.1, B, C, D, or E, produced in the same plant, a core part listed in Table A.2, or when treating the parts listed in column 1 of Table A.2 as a super-core, for use in a passenger vehicle or light truck, the calculation may be averaged:
(a) Over the fiscal year of the motor vehicle producer to whom the good is sold;
(b) over any quarter or month;
(c) over the fiscal year of the producer of the automotive material; or
(d) over any of the categories in paragraph (1)(a) through (d), provided that the good was produced during the fiscal year, quarter, or month forming the basis for the calculation, in which:
(i) The average in paragraph (9)(a) is calculated separately for those goods sold to one or more passenger vehicle, light truck, or heavy truck producer, or
(ii) the average in paragraph (9)(a) or (d) is calculated separately for those goods that are exported to the territory of another USMCA country.

# Calculation of LVC Requirement
(3) For purposes of an LVC calculation for a passenger vehicle, light truck or heavy truck, a producer may include:
(a) An amount for high-wage materials used in production;
(b) an amount for high-wage labor costs incurred in the assembly of the vehicle;
(c) an amount for high-wage transportation or related costs for shipping materials to the location of the vehicle producer, if not included in the amount for high-wage materials;
(d) a credit for technology expenditures; and
(e) a credit for high-wage assembly expenditures.
(4)
High wage materials.
The amount that may be included for high-wage materials used in production is the net cost or the annual purchase value of materials that undergo production in a qualifying-wage-rate production plant and that are used in the production of passenger vehicles, light trucks or heavy trucks in a plant located in the territory of a USMCA country.
(5) A plant engaged in the production of vehicles or parts may be certified as a qualifying wage-rate vehicle assembly plant or a qualifying-wage-rate production plant based on the average wage paid to direct production workers at the plant for July 1 to December 31, 2020, or for July 1 to June 30, 2021. In subsequent periods, the certification of a qualifying-wage-rate production plant based on period less than 12 months is valid for the following period of the same length. The certification of a qualifying-wage-rate production plant based on a 12-month period is valid for the following 12 months.
(6) For the purpose of meeting the Labor Value Content requirement a producer may use one of the following formulas:
(a) Formula based on net cost
ER01JY20.004
(b) Formula based on total annual purchase value
ER01JY20.005
*HWLC is included in the numerator at the choice of the producer and, if included, must also be included in the denominator
Where:
APV is the annual purchase value of high-wage material expenditures
HWAC is the credit for high-wage assembly expenditures;
HWLC is the sum of the high-wage labor costs incurred in the assembly of the vehicle;
HWM is the sum or the high-wage material expenditures used in production;
HWTC is the credit for high-wage technology expenditures;
HWT is the high-wage transportation or related costs for shipping materials used in production, if not included in the amount for HWM;
NC is the net cost of the vehicle, and
TAPV is the total vehicle plant assembly annual purchase value of parts and materials for use in the production of the vehicle

# High Wage Material Expenditures
(7) The high wage material expenditures may be calculated as sum of the following values:
(a) The annual purchase value (APV) or net cost, depending on the formula used, of a self-produced high-wage material used in the production of a vehicle;
(b) the APV or net cost, depending on the formula used, of an imported or acquired high-wage material used in the production of a vehicle;
(c) the APV or net cost, depending on the formula used, of a high-wage material used in the production of a part or material that is used in the production of an intermediate or self-produced part that is subsequently used in the production of a vehicle; and
(d) the APV or net cost depending on the formula used of a high wage material used in the production of a part or material that is subsequently used in the production of a vehicle.
(8) It is suggested, but not required, that the vehicle producer calculate the high-wage material and labor expenditures in the order described in paragraph (7). A vehicle producer need not calculate the elements in paragraphs 7(b) to (d) if the previous element or elements is sufficient to meet the LVC requirement.

# High-Wage Technology Expenditures Credit
(9) The high-wage technology expenditures credit (HWTC) is based on annual vehicle producer expenditures at the corporate level in one or more USMCA countries on wages paid by the producer for research and development (R
D) or information technology (IT), calculated as a percentage of total annual vehicle producer expenditures on wages paid to direct production workers in one or more USMCA countries. Expenditures on capital or other non-wage costs for R
D or IT are not included.
(10) To determine the high-wage technology expenditures credit (HWTC), the following formula may be used:
ER01JY20.006
Where
HWTC is the credit for high-wage technology expenditures, expressed as a percentage;
(11) For the purposes of subsection 14(10), expenditures on wages for R
D include wage expenditures on research and development including prototype development, design, engineering, testing, or certifying operations.

# High-Wage Assembly Credit
(12) A high-wage assembly credit of five percentage points may be included in the LVC for passenger vehicles or light trucks produced by a producer that operates a high-wage assembly plant for passenger vehicle or light truck parts or has a long-term supply contract for those parts (
i.e.
a contract with a minimum of three years) with such a plant.
(13) A high-wage assembly credit of five percentage points may be included in the LVC for heavy trucks produced by a producer that operates a high-wage assembly plant for heavy truck parts or has a long-term supply contract (
i.e.,
a contract with a minimum of three years) for those parts with such a plant.
(14) A high-wage assembly plant for passenger vehicle, light truck, or heavy truck parts need only have the capacity to produce the minimum amount of originating parts specified in the definition. There is no need to maintain or provide records or other documents that certify such parts are originating, as long as information demonstrating the capacity to produce these minimum amounts is maintained and can be provided.

# Averaging for LVC Requirement
(15) For the purpose of calculating the LVC of a passenger vehicle, light truck or heavy truck, the producer may elect to average the calculation using any one of the following categories, on the basis of either all vehicles in the category or only those vehicles in the category that are exported to the territory of one or more of the other USMCA countries:
(a) The same model line of vehicles in the same class of vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory of a USMCA country;
(b) the same class of vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory of a USMCA country;
(c) the same model line of vehicles or same class of vehicles produced in the territory of a USMCA country;
(d) any other category as the USMCA countries may decide.
(16) An election made under subsection (15) must
(a) state the category chosen by the producer, and
(i) if the category referred to in paragraph (15)(a) is chosen, state the model line, model name, class of vehicle and tariff classification of the vehicles in that category, and the location of the plant at which the vehicles are produced,
(ii) if the category referred to in paragraph (15)(b) is chosen, state the model name, class of vehicle and tariff classification of the vehicles in that category, and the location of the plant at which the vehicles are produced, and
(iii) if the category referred to in paragraph (15)(c) is chosen, state the model line, model name, class of vehicle and tariff classification of the vehicles in that category, and the locations of the plants at which the vehicles are produced;
(b) state whether the basis of the calculation is all vehicles in the category or only those vehicles in the category that are exported to the territory of one or more of the other USMCA countries;
(c) state the producer's name and address;
(d) state the period with respect to which the election is made, including the starting and ending dates;
(e) state the estimated labor value content of vehicles in the category on the basis stated under paragraph (b);
(f) be dated and signed by an authorized officer of the producer; and
(g) be filed with the customs administration of each USMCA country to which vehicles in that category are to be exported during the period covered by the election, by July 31, 2020, and subsequently at least 10 days before the first day of the producer's fiscal year, or such shorter period as that customs administration may accept.
(17) An election filed for the vehicles referred to in subsection (16) may not be
(a) rescinded; or
(b) modified with respect to the category or basis of calculation.
(18) For purposes of this section, if a producer files an election under paragraph (16)(a), it must include the labor value content and the net cost of the producer's passenger vehicles, light trucks or heavy trucks, calculated under one of the categories set out in subsection (15), with respect to
(a) all vehicles that fall within the category chosen by the producer, or
(b) those vehicles to be exported to the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries that fall within the category chosen by the producer.

# LVC Periods
(19) For the purposes of determining the LVC in this section, the producer may base the calculation on the following periods:
(a) The previous fiscal year of the producer;
(b) the previous calendar year;
(c) the quarter or month to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported;
(d) the producer's fiscal year to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported; or
(e) the calendar year to date in which the vehicle is produced or exported.

# Transportation and Related Costs
(20) High-wage transportation or related costs for shipping may be included in a producer's LVC calculation, if not included in the amount for high-wage materials. Alternatively, a producer may aggregate such costs within the territories of one or more of the USMCA countries. Based on this aggregate amount, the producer may attribute an amount for transportation or related costs for shipping for purposes of the LVC calculation. Transportation or related costs for shipping incurred in transporting a material from outside the territories of the USMCA countries to the territory of a USMCA country are not included in this calculation.

# Value of Materials for LVC Purposes
(21) The value of both originating and non-originating materials must be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the labor value content of a good. For greater certainty, the full value of a non-originating material that has undergone production in a qualifying-wage-rate production plant may be included in the HWM described in subsection 6.

# Excess LVC May Be Used Towards RVC Requirement for Heavy Trucks
(22) For the period ending July 1, 2027, if a producer certifies a Labor Value Content for a heavy truck that is higher than 45 percent by increasing the amount of high wage material and manufacturing expenditures above 30 percentage points, the producer may use the points above 30 percentage points as a credit towards the regional value content percentages under section 13, provided that the regional value content percentage is not below 60 percent.

# Section 19: Alternative Staging Regime
(1) For the purposes of this section, eligible vehicles means passenger vehicles or light trucks for which an alternative staging regime has been approved by the USMCA countries.
(2) Notwithstanding sections 13 through 18, eligible vehicles are subject to the requirements set forth in subsection (4) from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2025, or any other period provided for in the producer's approved alternative staging regime.

1. This schedule is deemed to be the contents of Sections A, B and C of Annex 4-B of the Agreement, as implemented in General Note 11 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States,
3
except that the following rules of interpretation apply:
3
The language “in General Note 11 of the Harmonized Tariff Scheduled of the United States” differs from the trilaterally agreed upon uniform regulations because the Parties contemplated that the language “by each USMCA country” would be replaced with the specific Party's reference to the location of the rules of origin under domestic law.
(a) For the purpose of Chapter 61, Note 2 or Chapter 62, Note 3 of Annex 4-B, a fabric of subheading 5806.20 or heading 60.02 is considered formed from yarn and finished in the territory of one or more Parties if all production processes and finishing operations, starting with the weaving, knitting, needling, tufting, or other process, and ending with the fabric ready for cutting or assembly without further processing, took place in the territories of one or more of the USMCA countries, even if non-originating yarn is used in the production of the fabric of subheading 5806.20 or heading 60.02;
(b) for the purposes of Chapter 61, Note 3 and Chapter 62, Note 4 of Annex 4-B, sewing thread is considered formed and finished in the territory of one or more Parties if all production processes and finishing operations, starting with the extrusion of filaments, strips, film or sheet, and including slitting a film or sheet into strip, or the spinning of all fibers into yarn, or both, and ending with the finished single or plied thread ready for use for sewing without further processing, took place in the territories of one or more of the USMCA countries even if non-originating fibre is used in the production of sewing thread of heading 52.04, 54.01 or 55.08, or yarn of heading 54.02 used as sewing thread referred to in the Notes;
(c) for the purpose of Chapter 61, Note 4 or Chapter 62, Note 5 of Annex 4-B, pocket bag fabric is considered formed and finished in the territory of one or more of the Parties if all production processes and finishing operations, starting with the weaving, knitting, needling, tufting, felting, entangling, or other process, and ending with the fabric ready for cutting or assembly without further processing, took place in the territories of one or more of the USMCA countries, even if non-originating fiber is used in the production of the yarn used to produce the pocket bag fabric;
(d) for the purpose of Chapter 61, Note 4 or Chapter 62, Note 5 of Annex 4-B, pocket bag fabric is considered a pocket or pockets if the pockets in which fabric is shaped to form a bag is not visible as the pocket is in the interior of the garment (
i.e.
pockets consisting of “bags” in the interior of the garment). Visible pockets such as patch pockets, cargo pockets, or typical shirt pockets are not subject to these notes;
(e) for the purpose of Chapter 61, Note 4 or Chapter 62, Note 5 of Annex 4-B, yarn is considered wholly formed in the territory of one
or more Parties if all the production processes and finishing operations, starting with the extrusion of filaments, strips, film, or sheet, and including slitting a film or sheet into strip, or the spinning of all fibers into yarn, or both, and ending with a finished single or plied yarn, took place in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries, even if non-originating fiber is used in the production of the yarn used to produce the pocket bag fabric; and,
(f) for the purpose of Chapter 63, Note 2 of Annex 4-B, a fabric of heading 59.03 is considered formed and finished in the territory of one or more Parties if all production processes and finishing operations, starting with the weaving, knitting, needling, tufting, felting, entangling, or other process, including coating, covering, laminating, or impregnating, and ending with the fabric ready for cutting or assembly without further processing, took place in the territories of one or more of the USMCA countries, even if non-originating fiber or yarn is used in the production of the fabric of heading 5903;

# Schedule III (Value of Goods)
1 Unless otherwise stated, the following definitions apply in this Schedule.
buyer
refers to a person who purchases a good from the producer;
buying commissions
means fees paid by a buyer to that buyer's agent for the agent's services in representing the buyer in the purchase of a good;
producer
refers to the producer of the good being valued.
2 For purposes of subsection 7(2) of these Regulations, the transaction value of a good is the price actually paid or payable for the good, determined in accordance with section 3 and adjusted in accordance with section 4.
3 (1) The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the buyer to or for the benefit of the producer. The payment need not necessarily take the form of a transfer of money. It may be made by letters of credit or negotiable instruments. The payment may be made directly or indirectly to the producer. For an illustration of this, the settlement by the buyer, whether in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the producer is an indirect payment.
(2) Activities undertaken by the buyer on the buyer's own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in section 4, must not be considered to be an indirect payment, even though the activities may be regarded as being for the benefit of the producer. For an illustration of this, the buyer, by agreement with the producer, undertakes activities relating to the marketing of the good. The costs of such activities must not be added to the price actually paid or payable.
(3) The transaction value must not include the following charges or costs, provided that they are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable:
(a) Charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance or technical assistance related to the good undertaken after the good is sold to the buyer; or
(b) duties and taxes paid in the country in which the buyer is located with respect to the good.
(4) The flow of dividends or other payments from the buyer to the producer that do not relate to the purchase of the good are not part of the transaction value.
4 (1) In determining the transaction value of a good, the following must be added to the price actually paid or payable:
(a) To the extent that they are incurred by the buyer, or by a related person on behalf of the buyer, with respect to the good being valued and are not included in the price actually paid or payable
(i) commissions and brokerage fees, except buying commissions,
(ii) the costs of transporting the good to the producer's point of direct shipment and the costs of loading, unloading, handling and insurance that are associated with that transportation, and
(iii) where the packaging materials and containers are classified with the good under the Harmonized System, the value of the packaging materials and containers;
(b) the value, reasonably allocated in accordance with subsection (13), of the following elements if they are supplied directly or indirectly to the producer by the buyer, free of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production and sale of the good, to the extent that the value is not included in the price actually paid or payable:
(i) A material, other than an indirect material, used in the production of the good,
(ii) tools, dies, molds and similar indirect materials used in the production of the good,
(iii) an indirect material, other than those referred to in subparagraph (ii) or in paragraphs (c), (e) or (f) of the definition indirect material set out in subsection 1(1) of these Regulations, used in the production of the good, and
(iv) engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches necessary
for the production of the good, regardless of where performed;
(c) the royalties related to the good, other than charges with respect to the right to reproduce the good in the territory of one or more of the USMCA countries, that the buyer must pay directly or indirectly as a condition of sale of the good, to the extent that such royalties are not included in the price actually paid or payable; and
(d) the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the good that accrues directly or indirectly to the producer.
(2) The additions referred to in subsection (1) must be made to the price actually paid or payable under this section only on the basis of objective and quantifiable data.
(3) If objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under subsection (1), the transaction value cannot be determined under section 2.
(4) Additions must not be made to the price actually paid or payable for the purpose of determining the transaction value except as provided in this section.
(5) The amounts to be added under subparagraphs (1)(a)(i) and (ii) are:
(a) Those amounts that are recorded on the books of the buyer; or
(b) if those amounts are costs incurred by a related person on behalf of the buyer and are not recorded on the books of the buyer, those amounts that are recorded on the books of that related person.
(6) The value of the packaging materials and containers referred to in subparagraph (1)(a)(iii) and the value of the elements referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) are
(a) if the packaging materials and containers or the elements are imported from outside the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located, the customs value of the packaging materials and containers or the elements,
(b) if the buyer, or a related person on behalf of the buyer, purchases the packaging materials and containers or the elements from a person who is not a related person in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located, the price actually paid or payable for the packaging materials and containers or the elements,
(c) if the buyer, or a related person on behalf of the buyer, acquires the packaging materials and containers or the elements from a person who is not a related person in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located other than through a purchase, the value of the consideration related to the acquisition of the packaging materials and containers or the elements, based on the cost of the consideration that is recorded on the books of the buyer or the related person, or
(d) if the packaging materials and containers or the elements are produced by the buyer, or by a related person, in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located, the total cost of the packaging materials and containers or the elements, determined in accordance with subsection (8),
(7) The value referred to in subsection (6), to the extent that such costs are not included under paragraphs 6(a) through (d), must include the following costs that are recorded on the books of the buyer or the related person supplying the packaging materials and containers or the elements on behalf of the buyer:
(a) The costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the packaging materials and containers or the elements to the location of the producer,
(b) duties and taxes paid or payable with respect to the packaging materials and containers or the elements, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable,
(c) customs brokerage fees, including the cost of in-house customs brokerage services, incurred with respect to the packaging materials and containers or the elements, and
(d) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the packaging materials and containers or the elements in the production of the good, less the value of renewable scrap or by-product.
(8) For purposes of paragraph (6)(d), the total cost of the packaging materials and containers referred to in subparagraph (1)(a)(iii) or the elements referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) are
(a) if the packaging materials and containers or the elements are produced by the buyer, at the choice of the buyer:
(i) The total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the buyer, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the buyer, that can be reasonably allocated to the packaging materials and containers or the elements in accordance with Schedule V, or
(ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by the buyer that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the packaging materials and containers or the elements, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the buyer, that can be reasonably allocated to the packaging materials and containers or the elements in accordance with Schedule V; and
(b) if the packaging materials and containers or the elements are produced by a person who is related to the buyer, at the choice of the buyer:
(i) The total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that related person, calculated on the basis of the costs that are
recorded on the books of that person, that can be reasonably allocated to the packaging materials and containers or the elements in accordance with Schedule V, or
(ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by that related person that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the packaging materials and containers or the elements, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of that person, that can be reasonably allocated to the packaging materials and containers or the elements in accordance with Schedule V.
(9) Except as provided in subsections (11) and (12), the value of the elements referred to in subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) through (iv) are
(a) the cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of the buyer; or
(b) if such elements are provided by another person on behalf of the buyer and the cost is not recorded on the books of the buyer, the cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of that other person.
(10) If the elements referred to in subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) through (iv) were previously used by or on behalf of the buyer, the value of the elements must be adjusted downward to reflect that use.
(11) Where the elements referred to in subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) and (iii) were leased by the buyer or a person related to the buyer, the value of the elements are the cost of the lease as recorded on the books of the buyer or that related person.
(12) An addition must not be made to the price actually paid or payable for the elements referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) that are available in the public domain, other than the cost of obtaining copies of them.
(13) The producer must choose the method of allocating to the good the value of the elements referred to in subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) through (iv), provided that the value is reasonably allocated to the good. The methods the producer may choose to allocate the value include allocating the value over the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment or allocating the value over the entire anticipated production where contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. For an illustration of this, a buyer provides the producer with a mold to be used in the production of the good and contracts with the producer to buy 10,000 units of that good. By the time the first shipment of 1,000 units arrives, the producer has already produced 4,000 units. In these circumstances, the producer may choose to allocate the value of the mold over 4,000 units or 10,000 units but must not choose to allocate the value of the elements to the first shipment of 1,000 units. The producer may choose to allocate the entire value of the elements to a single shipment of a good only if that single shipment comprises all of the units of the good acquired by the buyer under the contract or commitment for that number of units of the good between the producer and the buyer.
(14) The addition for the royalties referred to in paragraph (1)(c) is the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of the buyer, or if the payment for the royalties is recorded on the books of another person, the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of that other person.
(15) The value of the proceeds referred to in paragraph (1)(d) is the amount that is recorded for such proceeds on the books of the buyer or the producer.

# Schedule IV Unacceptable Transaction Value
1 Unless otherwise stated, the following definitions apply in this Schedule.
buyer
refers to a person who purchases a good from the producer;
producer
refers to the producer of the good being valued.
2 (1) There is no transaction value for a good if the good is not the subject of a sale.
(2) The transaction value of a good is unacceptable if:
(a) There are restrictions on the disposition or use of the good by the buyer, other than restrictions that
(i) are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in the territory of the USMCA country in which the buyer is located,
(ii) limit the geographical area in which the good may be resold, or
(iii) do not substantially affect the value of the good;
(b) the sale or price actually paid or payable is subject to a condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the good;
(c) part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the good by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the producer, and an appropriate addition to the price actually paid or payable cannot be made in accordance with paragraph 4(1)(d) of Schedule III; or
(d) the producer and the buyer are related persons and the relationship between them influenced the price actually paid or payable for the good.
(3) The cases or considerations referred to in paragraph (2)(b) include the following:
(a) The producer establishes the price actually paid or payable for the good on condition that the buyer will also buy other goods in specified quantities;
(b) the price actually paid or payable for the good is dependent on the price or prices at which the buyer sells other goods to the producer of the good; and
(c) the price actually paid or payable is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the good, such as where the good is a semi-finished good that is provided
by the producer to the buyer on condition that the producer will receive a specified quantity of the finished good from the buyer.
(4) For purposes of paragraph (2)(b), conditions or considerations relating to the production or marketing of the good must not render the transaction value unacceptable, such as if the buyer undertakes on the buyer's own account, even though by agreement with the producer, activities relating to the marketing of the good.
(5) If objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under subsection 4(1) of Schedule III, the transaction value cannot be determined under the provisions of section 2 of that Schedule. For an illustration of this, a royalty is paid on the basis of the price actually paid or payable in a sale of a litre of a particular good that was purchased by the kilogram and made up into a solution. If the royalty is based partially on the purchased good and partially on other factors that have nothing to do with that good, such as when the purchased good is mixed with other ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the producer and the buyer, it would be inappropriate to add the royalty and the transaction value of the good could not be determined. However, if the amount of the royalty is based only on the purchased good and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be made and the transaction value can be determined.

# Schedule V (Reasonable Allocation of Costs)

# Definitions and Interpretation
1 of the following definitions apply in this Schedule,
costs
means any costs that are included in total cost and that can or need to be allocated in a reasonable manner under to subsections 5(11), 7(11) and 8(8) of these Regulations, subsection 4(8) of Schedule III and subsections 4(8) and 9(3) of Schedule VI;
discontinued operation,
in the case of a producer located in a USMCA country, has the meaning set out in that USMCA country's Generally Accepted Accounting Principles;
indirect overhead
means period costs and other costs;
internal management purpose
means any purpose relating to tax reporting, financial reporting, financial planning, decision-making, pricing, cost recovery, cost control management or performance measurement;
overhead
means costs, other than direct material costs and direct labor costs.
2 (1) In this Schedule, reference to “producer”, for purposes of subsection 4(8) of Schedule III, is to be read as a reference to “buyer”.
(2) In this Schedule, a reference to “good”,
(a) for purposes of subsection 7(15) of these Regulations, is to be read as a reference to “identical goods or similar goods, or any combination thereof”;
(b) for purposes of subsection 8(8) of these Regulations, is to be read as a reference to “intermediate material”;
(c) for purposes of section 16 of these Regulations, is to be read as a reference to “category of vehicles that is chosen pursuant to subsection 16(1) of these Regulations”;
(d) for purposes of subsection 4(8) of Schedule III, be read as a reference to “packaging materials and containers or the elements”; and
(e) for purposes of subsection 4(8) of Schedule VI, be read as a reference to “elements”.

# Methods to Reasonably Allocate Costs
3 (1) If a producer of a good is using, for an internal management purpose, a cost allocation method to allocate to the good direct material costs, or part thereof, and that method reasonably reflects the direct material used in the production of the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear, that method must be used to reasonably allocate the costs to the good.
(2) If a producer of a good is using, for an internal management purpose, a cost allocation method to allocate to the good direct labor costs, or part thereof, and that method reasonably reflects the direct labor used in the production of the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear, that method must be used to reasonably allocate the costs to the good.
(3) If a producer of a good is using, for an internal management purpose, a cost allocation method to allocate to the good overhead, or part thereof, and that method is based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear, that method must be used to reasonably allocate the costs to the good.
4 If costs are not reasonably allocated to a good under section 3, those costs are reasonably allocated to the good if they are allocated:
(a) With respect to direct material costs, on the basis of any method that reasonably reflects the direct material used in the production of the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear;
(b) with respect to direct labor costs, on the basis of any method that reasonably reflects the direct labor used in the production of the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear; and
(c) with respect to overhead, on the basis of any of the following methods:
(i) The method set out in Appendix A, B or C,
(ii) a method based on a combination of the methods set out in Appendices A and B or Appendices A and C, and
(iii) a cost allocation method based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear.
5 Notwithstanding sections 3 and 8, if a producer allocates, for an internal management purpose, costs to a good that is not produced in the period in which the costs are expensed on the books of the producer (such as costs with respect to research and development, and obsolete materials), those costs must be considered reasonably allocated if:
(a) For purposes of subsection 7(11) of these Regulations, they are allocated to a good that is produced in the period in which the costs are expensed, and
(b) the good produced in that period is within a group or range of goods, including identical goods or similar goods, that is produced by the same industry or industry sector as the goods to which the costs are expensed.
6 Any cost allocation method referred to in section 3, 4 or 5 that is used by a producer for the purposes of these Regulations must be used throughout the producer's fiscal year.

# Costs Not Reasonably Allocated
7 The allocation to a good of any of the following is considered not to be reasonably allocated to the good:
(a) Costs of a service provided by a producer of a good to another person where the service is not related to the good;
(b) gains or losses resulting from the disposition of a discontinued operation, except gains or losses related to the production of the good;
(c) cumulative effects of accounting changes reported in accordance with a specific requirement of the applicable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; and
(d) gains or losses resulting from the sale of a capital asset of the producer.
8 Any costs allocated under section 3 on the basis of a cost allocation method that is used for an internal management purpose that is solely for the purpose of qualifying a good as an originating good are considered not to be reasonably allocated.

# Appendix A—Cost Ratio Method

# Calculation of Cost Ratio
For the overhead to be allocated, the producer may choose one or more allocation bases that reflect a relationship between the overhead and the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear.
With respect to each allocation base that is chosen by the producer for allocating overhead, a cost ratio is calculated for each good produced by the producer as determined by the formula:
CR = AB ÷ TAB
where
CR is the cost ratio with respect to the good;
AB is the allocation base for the good; and
TAB is the total allocation base for all the goods produced by the producer.

# Allocation to a Good of Costs Included in Overhead
The costs with respect to which an allocation base is chosen are allocated to a good in accordance with the following formula:
CAG = CA × CR
where
CAG is the costs allocated to the good;
CA is the costs to be allocated; and
CR is the cost ratio with respect to the good.

# Excluded Costs
Under paragraph 7(11)(b) of these Regulations, where excluded costs are included in costs to be allocated to a good, the cost ratio used to allocate that cost to the good is used to determine the amount of excluded costs to be subtracted from the costs allocated to the good.

# Allocation Bases for Costs
The following is a non-exhaustive list of allocation bases that may be used by the producer to calculate cost ratios:
• Direct labor hours
• Direct labor costs
• Units produced
• Machine-hours
• Sales dollars or pesos
• Floor space

# “Examples”
The following examples illustrate the application of the cost ratio method to costs included in overhead.

# Example 1: Direct Labor Hours
A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of direct labor hours spent to produce Good A and Good B. A total of 8,000 direct labor hours have been spent to produce Good A and Good B: 5,000 hours with respect to Good A and 3,000 hours with respect to Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Calculation of the ratios:
Good A: 5,000 hours/8,000 hours = .625
Good B: 3,000 hours/8,000 hours = .375
Allocation of overhead to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .625 = $3,750,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .375 = $2,250,000

# Example 2: Direct Labor Costs
A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of direct labour costs incurred in the production of Good
A and Good B. The total direct labor costs incurred in the production of Good A and Good B is $60,000: $50,000 with respect to Good A and $10,000 with respect to Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Calculation of the ratios:
Good A: $50,000/$60,000 = .833
Good B: $10,000/$60,000 = .167
Allocation of Overhead to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .833 = $4,998,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .167 = $1,002,000

# Example 3: Units Produced
A producer of Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of units produced. The total units of Good A and Good B produced is 150,000: 100,000 units of Good A and 50,000 units of Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Calculation of the ratios:
Good A: 100,000 units/150,000 units = .667
Good B: 50,000 units/150,000 units = .333
Allocation of Overhead to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .667 = $4,002,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .333 = $1,998,000

# Example 4: Machine-Hours
A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate machine-related overhead on the basis of machine-hours utilized in the production of Good A and Good B. The total machine-hours utilized for the production of Good A and Good B is 3,000 hours: 1,200 hours with respect to Good A and 1,800 hours with respect to Good B. The amount of machine-related overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Calculation of the ratios:
Good A: 1,200 machine-hours/3,000 machine-hours = .40
Good B: 1,800 machine-hours/3,000 machine-hours = .60
Allocation of machine-related overhead to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .40 = $2,400,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .60 = $3,600,000

# Example 5: Sales Dollars or Pesos
A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of sales dollars. The producer sold 2,000 units of Good A at $4,000 and 200 units of Good B at $3,000. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Total sales dollars for Good A and Good B:
Good A: $4,000 × 2,000 units = $8,000,000
Good B: $3,000 × 200 units = $600,000
Total sales dollars: $8,000,000 + $600,000 = $8,600,000
Calculation of the ratios:
Good A: $8,000,000/$8,600,000 = .93
Good B: $600,000/$8,600,000 = .07
Allocation of Overhead to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .93 = $5,580,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .07 = $420,000

# Example 6: Floor Space
A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead relating to utilities (heat, water and electricity) on the basis of floor space used in the production and storage of Good A and Good B. The total floor space used in the production and storage of Good A and Good B is 100,000 square feet: 40,000 square feet with respect to Good A and 60,000 square feet with respect to Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Calculation of the Ratios:
Good A: 40,000 square feet/100,000 square feet = .40
Good B: 60,000 square feet/100,000 square feet = .60
Allocation of overhead (utilities) to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .40 = $2,400,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .60 = $3,600,000

# Appendix B—Direct Labor and Direct Material Ratio Method

# Calculation of Direct Labor and Direct Material Ratio
For each good produced by the producer, a direct labor and direct material ratio is calculated by the formula:
DLDMR = (DLC + DMC) ÷ (TDLC + TDMC)
where
DLDMR is the direct labor and direct material ratio for the good;
DLC is the direct labor costs of the good;
DMC is the direct material costs of the good;
TDLC is the total direct labor costs of all goods produced by the producer; and
TDMC is the total direct material costs of all goods produced by the producer.

# Allocation of Overhead to a Good
Overhead is allocated to a good by the formula:
OAG = O × DLDMR
where
OAG is the overhead allocated to the good;
O is the overhead to be allocated; and
DLDMR is the direct labor and direct material ratio for the good.

# Excluded Costs
Under paragraph 7(11)(b) of these Regulations, if excluded costs are included in overhead to be allocated to a good, the direct
labor and direct material ratio used to allocate overhead to the good is used to determine the amount of excluded costs to be subtracted from the overhead allocated to the good.

# “Examples”

# Example 1
The following example illustrates the application of the direct labor and direct material ratio method used by a producer of a good to allocate overhead where the producer chooses to calculate the net cost of the good in accordance with paragraph 7(11)(a) of these Regulations. A producer produces Good A and Good B. Overhead (O) minus excluded costs (EC) is $30 and the other relevant costs are set out in the following table:

# Overhead Allocated to Good B
OAG (Good B) = O ($30) × DLDMR ($10/$25)
OAG (Good B) = $12.00

# Example 2
The following example illustrates the application of the direct labor and direct material ratio method used by a producer of a good to allocate overhead where the producer chooses to calculate the net cost of the good in accordance with paragraph 7(11)(b) of these Regulations and where excluded costs are included in overhead.
A producer produces Good A and Good B. Overhead (O) is $50 (including excluded costs (EC) of $20). The other relevant costs are set out in the table to Example 1.

# Overhead Allocated to Good A
OAG (Good A) = [O ($50) × DLDMR ($15/$25)]−[EC ($20) × DLDMR ($15/$25)]
OAG (Good A) = $18.00

# Overhead Allocated to Good B
OAG (Good B) = [O ($50) × DLDMR ($10/$25)]−[EC ($20) × DLDMR ($10/$25)]
OAG (Good B) = $12.00

# Appendix C—Direct Cost Ratio Method

# Direct Overhead
Direct overhead is allocated to a good on the basis of a method based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear.

# Indirect Overhead
Indirect overhead is allocated on the basis of a direct cost ratio.

# Calculation of Direct Cost Ratio
For each good produced by the producer, a direct cost ratio is calculated by the formula:
DCR = (DLC + DMC + DO) ÷ (TDLC + TDMC + TDO)
where
DCR is the direct cost ratio for the good;
DLC is the direct labor costs of the good;
DMC is the direct material costs of the good;
DO is the direct overhead of the good;
TDLC is the total direct labor costs of all goods produced by the producer;
TDMC is the total direct material costs of all goods produced by the producer; and
TDO is the total direct overhead of all goods produced by the producer.

# Allocation of Indirect Overhead to a Good
Indirect overhead is allocated to a good by the formula:
IOAG = IO × DCR
where
IOAG is the indirect overhead allocated to the good;
IO is the indirect overhead of all goods produced by the producer; and
DCR is the direct cost ratio of the good.

# Excluded Costs
Under paragraph 7(11)(b) of these Regulations, if excluded costs are included in
(a) direct overhead to be allocated to a good, those excluded costs are subtracted from the direct overhead allocated to the good; and
(b) indirect overhead to be allocated to a good, the direct cost ratio used to allocate indirect overhead to the good is used to determine the amount of excluded costs to be subtracted from the indirect overhead allocated to the good.

# “Examples”

# Example 1
The following example illustrates the application of the direct cost ratio method used by a producer of a good to allocate indirect overhead where the producer chooses to calculate the net cost of the good in accordance with paragraph 7(11)(a) of these Regulations.

IOAG (Good B) = $10.29

# Example 2
The following example illustrates the application of the direct cost ratio method used by a producer of a good to allocate indirect overhead if the producer has chosen to calculate the net cost of the good in accordance with paragraph 7(11)(b) of these Regulations and where excluded costs are included in indirect overhead.
A producer produces Good A and Good B. The indirect overhead (IO) is $50 (including excluded costs (EC) of $20). The other relevant costs are set out in the table to Example 1.

# Schedule VI Value of Materials
1 (1) Unless otherwise stated, the following definitions apply in this Schedule.
buying commissions
means fees paid by a producer to that producer's agent for the agent's services in representing the producer in the purchase of a material;
materials of the same class or kind
means, with respect to materials being valued, materials that are within a group or range of materials that
(a) is produced by a particular industry or industry sector, and
(b) includes identical materials or similar materials;
producer
refers to the producer who used the material in the production of a good that is subject to a regional value-content requirement;
seller
refers to a person who sells the material being valued to the producer.
2 (1) Except as provided under subsection (2), the transaction value of a material under paragraph 8(1)(b) of these Regulations is the price actually paid or payable for the material determined in accordance with section 3 and adjusted in accordance with section 4.
(2) There is no transaction value for a material if the material is not the subject of a sale.
(3) The transaction value of a material is unacceptable if:
(a) there are restrictions on the disposition or use of the material by the producer, other than restrictions that
(i) are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer of the good or the seller of the material is located,
(ii) limit the geographical area in which the material may be used, or
(iii) do not substantially affect the value of the material;
(b) the sale or price actually paid or payable is subject to a condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the material;
(c) part of the proceeds of any subsequent disposal or use of the material by the producer will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, and an appropriate addition to the price actually paid or payable cannot be made in accordance with paragraph 4(1)(d); or
(d) the producer and the seller are related persons and the relationship between them influenced the price actually paid or payable for the material.
(4) The cases or considerations referred to in paragraph (3)(b) include the following:
(a) the seller establishes the price actually paid or payable for the material on condition that the producer will also buy other materials or goods in specified quantities;
(b) the price actually paid or payable for the material is dependent on the price or prices at which the producer sells other materials or goods to the seller of the material; and
(c) the price actually paid or payable is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the material, such as where the material is a semi-finished material that is provided by the seller to the producer on condition that the seller will receive a specified quantity of the finished material from the producer.
(5) For purposes of paragraph (3)(b), conditions or considerations relating to the use of the material will not render the transaction value unacceptable, such as where the producer undertakes on the producer's own account, even though by agreement with the seller, activities relating to the warranty of the material used in the production of a good.
(6) If objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under subsection 4(1), the transaction value cannot be determined under the provisions of subsection 2(1). For an illustration of this, a royalty is paid on the basis of the price actually paid or payable in a sale of a litre of a particular good that is produced by using a material that was purchased by the kilogram and made up into a solution. If the royalty is based partially on the purchased material and partially on other factors that have nothing to do with that material, such as when the purchased material is mixed with other ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the seller and the producer, it would be inappropriate to add the royalty and the transaction value of the material could not be determined. However, if the amount of the royalty is based only on the purchased material and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be made and the transaction value can be determined.
3 (1) The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the producer to or for the benefit of the seller of the material. The payment need not necessarily take the form of a transfer of money. It may be made by letters of credit or negotiable instruments. Payment may be made directly or indirectly to the seller. For an illustration of this, the settlement by the producer, whether in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller, is an indirect payment.
(2) Activities undertaken by the producer on the producer's own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in section 4, must not be considered to be an indirect payment, even though the activities might be regarded as being for the benefit of the seller.
(3) The transaction value must not include charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance or technical assistance related to the use of the material by the producer, provided that they are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable.
(4) The flow of dividends or other payments from the producer to the seller that do not relate to the purchase of the material are not part of the transaction value.
4 (1) In determining the transaction value of the material, the following must be added to the price actually paid or payable:
(a) To the extent that they are incurred by the producer with respect to the material being valued and are not included in the price actually paid or payable,
(i) commissions and brokerage fees, except buying commissions, and
(ii) the costs of containers which, for customs purposes, are classified with the material under the Harmonized System;
(b) the value, reasonably allocated in accordance with subsection (13), of the following elements if they are supplied directly or indirectly to the seller by the producer free of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production and sale of the material, to the extent that the value is not included in the price actually paid or payable:
(i) A material, other than an indirect material, used in the production of the material being valued,
(ii) tools, dies, mold and similar indirect materials used in the production of the material being valued,
(iii) an indirect material, other than those referred to in subparagraph (ii) or in paragraphs (c), (e) or (f) of the definition
indirect material
in subsection 1(1) of these Regulations, used in the production of the material being valued, and
(iv) engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches made outside the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located that are necessary for the production of the material being valued;
(c) the royalties related to the material, other than charges with respect to the right to reproduce the material in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located that the producer must pay directly or indirectly as a condition of sale of the material, to the extent that such royalties are not included in the price actually paid or payable; and
(d) the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent disposal or use of the material that accrues directly or indirectly to the seller.
(2) The additions referred to in subsection (1) must be made to the price actually paid or payable under this section only on the basis of objective and quantifiable data.
(3) If objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under subsection (1), the transaction value cannot be determined under subsection 2(1).
(4) Additions must not be made to the price actually paid or payable for the purpose of determining the transaction value except as provided in this section.
(5) The amounts to be added under paragraph (1)(a) must be those amounts that are recorded on the books of the producer.
(6) The value of the elements referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) must be:
(a) Where the elements are imported from outside the territory of the USMCA country in which the seller is located, the customs value of the elements,
(b) where the producer, or a related person on behalf of the producer, purchases the elements from a person who is not a related person in the territory of the USMCA country in which the seller is located, the price actually paid or payable for the elements,
(c) where the producer, or a related person on behalf of the producer, acquires the elements from a person who is not a related person in the territory of the USMCA country in which the seller is located other than through a purchase, the value of the consideration related to the acquisition of the elements, based on the cost of the consideration that is recorded on the books of the producer or the related person, or
(d) where the elements are produced by the producer, or by a related person, in the territory of the USMCA country in which the seller is located, the total cost of the elements, determined in accordance with subsection (8),
(7) Those elements must include the following costs, that are recorded on the books of the producer or the related person supplying the elements on behalf of the producer, to the extent that such costs are not included under paragraphs (6)(a) through (d):
(a) The costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the elements to the location of the seller,
(b) duties and taxes paid or payable with respect to the elements, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable,
(c) customs brokerage fees, including the cost of in-house customs brokerage services, incurred with respect to the elements, and
(d) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the elements in the production of the material, minus the value of reusable scrap or by-product.
(8) For the purposes of paragraph (6)(d), the total cost of the elements referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) are:
(a) Where the elements are produced by the producer, at the choice of the producer,
(i) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the producer, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the producer, that can be reasonably allocated to the elements in accordance with Schedule V, or
(ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by the producer that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the elements, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the producer, that can be reasonably allocated to the elements in accordance with Schedule V; and
(b) if the elements are produced by a person who is related to the producer, at the choice of the producer:
(i) The total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that related person, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of that person, that can be reasonably allocated to the elements in accordance with Schedule V, or
(ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by that related person that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the elements, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of that person, that can be reasonably allocated to the elements in accordance with Schedule V.
(9) Except as provided in subsections (11) and (12), the value of the elements referred to in subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) through (iv) are:
(a) The cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of the producer; or
(b) if such elements are provided by another person on behalf of the producer and the cost is not recorded on the books of the producer, the cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of that other person.
(10) If the elements referred to in subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) through (iv) were previously used by or on behalf of the producer, the value of the elements must be adjusted downward to reflect that use.
(11) If the elements referred to in subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) and (iii) were leased by the producer or a person related to the producer, the value of the elements are the cost of the lease that is recorded on the books of the producer or that related person.
(12) An addition must not be made to the price actually paid or payable for the elements referred to in subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) that are available in the public domain, other than the cost of obtaining copies of them.
(13) The producer must choose the method of allocating to the material the value of the elements referred to in subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) through (iv), provided that the value is reasonably allocated. The methods the producer may choose to allocate the value include allocating the value over the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment or allocating the value over the entire anticipated production where contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. For an illustration of this, a producer provides the seller with a mold to be used in the production of the material and
contracts with the seller to buy 10,000 units of that material. By the time the first shipment of 1,000 units arrives, the seller has already produced 4,000 units. In these circumstances, the producer may choose to allocate the value of the mold over 4,000 units or 10,000 units but must not choose to allocate the value of the elements to the first shipment of 1,000 units. The producer may choose to allocate the entire value of the elements to a single shipment of material only where that single shipment comprises all of the units of the material acquired by the producer under the contract or commitment for that number of units of the material between the seller and the producer.
(14) The addition for the royalties referred to in paragraph (1)(c) is the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of the producer, or where the payment for the royalties is recorded on the books of another person, the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of that other person.
(15) The value of the proceeds referred to in paragraph (1)(d) is the amount that is recorded for those proceeds on the books of the producer or the seller.
5 (1) If there is no transaction value under subsection 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under subsection 2(3), the value of the material, referred to in subparagraph 8(1)(b)(ii) of these Regulations, is the transaction value of identical materials sold, at or about the same time as the material being valued was shipped to the producer, to a buyer located in the same country as the producer.
(2) In applying this section, the transaction value of identical materials in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity of materials as the material being valued shall be used to determine the value of the material. If no such sale is found, the transaction value of identical materials sold at a different commercial level or in different quantities, adjusted to take into account the differences attributable to the commercial level or quantity, must be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that the adjustment is reasonable and accurate, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.
(3) A condition for adjustment under subsection (2) because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment be made only on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that an adjustment is reasonable and accurate. For an illustration of this, a bona fide price list contains prices for different quantities. If the material being valued consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only identical materials for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's bona fide price list and using the price applicable to a sale of 10 units. This does not require that sales had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective measure, however, the determination of a value under this section is not appropriate.
(4) If more than one transaction value of identical materials is found, the lowest such value must be used to determine the value of the material under this section.
6 (1) If there is no transaction value under subsection 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under subsection 2(3), and the value of the material cannot be determined under section 5, the value of the material, referred to in subparagraph 8(1)(b)(ii) of these Regulations, is the transaction value of similar materials sold, at or about the same time as the material being valued was shipped to the producer, to a buyer located in the same country as the producer.
(2) In applying this section, the transaction value of similar materials in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity of materials as the material being valued must be used to determine the value of the material. Where no such sale is found, the transaction value of similar materials sold at a different commercial level or in different quantities, adjusted to take into account the differences attributable to the commercial level or quantity, must be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that the adjustment is reasonable and accurate, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.
(3) A condition for adjustment under subsection (2) because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment be made only on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that an adjustment is reasonable and accurate. For an illustration of this, a bona fide price list contains prices for different quantities. If the material being valued consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only similar materials for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's bona fide price list and using the price applicable to a sale of 10 units. This does not require that sales had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective measure, however, the determination of a value under this section is not appropriate.
(4) If more than one transaction value of similar materials is found, the lowest of
those values must be used to determine the value of the material under this section.
7 If there is no transaction value under subsection 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under subsection 2(3), and the value of the material cannot be determined under section 5 or 6, the value of the material, referred to in subparagraph 8(1)(b)(ii) of these Regulations, must be determined under section 8 or, when the value cannot be determined under that section, under section 9 except that, at the request of the producer, the order of application of sections 8 and 9 must be reversed.
8 (1) Under this section, if identical materials or similar materials are sold in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located, in the same condition as the material was in when received by the producer, the value of the material, referred to in subparagraph 8(1)(b)(ii) of these Regulations, must be based on the unit price at which those identical materials or similar materials are sold, in the greatest aggregate quantity by the producer or, where the producer does not sell those identical materials or similar materials, by a person at the same trade level as the producer, at or about the same time as the material being valued is received by the producer, to persons located in that territory who are not related to the seller, subject to deductions for the following:
(a) Either the amount of commissions usually earned or the amount generally reflected for profit and general expenses, in connection with sales, in the territory of that USMCA country, of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued; and
(b) taxes, if included in the unit price, payable in the territory of that USMCA country, which are either waived, refunded or recoverable by way of credit against taxes actually paid or payable.
(2) If neither identical materials nor similar materials are sold at or about the same time the material being valued is received by the producer, the value must, subject to the deductions provided for under subsection (1), be based on the unit price at which identical materials or similar materials are sold in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located, in the same condition as the material was in when received by the producer, at the earliest date within 90 days after the day on which the material being valued was received by the producer.
(3) The expression “unit price at which those identical materials or similar materials are sold, in the greatest aggregate quantity” in subsection (1) means the price at which the greatest number of units is sold in sales between persons who are not related persons. For an illustration of this, materials are sold from a price list which grants favourable unit prices for purchases made in larger quantities.

The greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 80; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is 90.
As another illustration of this, two sales occur. In the first sale 500 units are sold at a price of 95 currency units each. In the second sale 400 units are sold at a price of 90 currency units each. In this illustration, the greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 500; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is 95.
(4) Any sale to a person who supplies, directly or indirectly, free of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production of the material, any of the elements specified in paragraph 4(1)(b), must not be taken into account in establishing the unit price for the purposes of this section.
(5) The amount generally reflected for profit and general expenses referred to in paragraph (1)(a) must be taken as a whole. The figure for the purpose of deducting an amount for profit and general expenses must be determined on the basis of information supplied by or on behalf of the producer unless the figures provided by the producer are inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales, in the country in which the producer is located, of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued. If the figures provided by the producer are inconsistent with those figures, the amount for profit and general expenses must be based on relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer.
(6) For the purposes of this section, general expenses are the direct and indirect costs of marketing the material in question.
(7) In determining either the commissions usually earned or the amount generally reflected for profit and general expenses under this section, the question as to whether certain materials are materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued must be determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the circumstances involved. Sales in the country in which the producer is located of the narrowest group or range of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, must be examined. For the purposes of this section, “materials of the same class or kind” includes materials imported from the same country as the material being valued as well as materials imported from other countries or acquired within the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located.
(8) For the purposes of subsection (2), the earliest date is the date by which sales of identical materials or similar materials are made, in sufficient quantity to establish the unit price, to other persons in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located.
9 (1) Under this section, the value of a material, referred to in subparagraph 8(1)(b)(ii) of these Regulations, is the sum of:
(a) The cost or value of the materials used in the production of the material being valued, as determined on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the producer of the material,
(b) the cost of producing the material being valued, as determined on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the producer of the material, and
(c) an amount for profit and general expenses equal to that usually reflected in sales
(i) where the material being valued is imported by the producer into the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located, to persons located in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located by producers of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued who are located in the country in which the material is produced, and
(ii) where the material being valued is acquired by the producer from another person located in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located, to persons located in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located by producers of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued who are located in the country in which the producer is located.
(2) This value of a material, to the extent it is not are not already included under paragraph (a) or (b) must include the following costs and where the elements are supplied directly or indirectly to the producer of the material being valued by the producer free of charge or at a reduced cost for use in the production of that material,
(a) the value of elements referred to in subparagraph 4(1)(b)(i), determined in accordance with subsections 4(6) and (7), and
(b) the value of elements referred to in subparagraphs 4(1)(b)(ii) through (iv), determined in accordance with subsection 4(9) and reasonably allocated to the material in accordance with subsection 4(13).
(3) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(a) and (b), if the costs recorded on the books of the producer of the material relate to the production of other goods and materials as well as to the production of the material being valued, the costs referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) with respect to the material being valued must be those costs recorded on the books of the producer of the material that can be reasonably allocated to that material in accordance with Schedule V.
(4) The amount for profit and general expenses referred to in paragraph (1)(c) must be determined on the basis of information supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material being valued unless the profit and general expenses figures that are supplied with that information are inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales by producers of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued who are located in the country in which the material is produced or the producer is located, as the case may be. The information supplied must be prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles of the country in which the material being valued is produced. If the material is produced in the territory of a USMCA country, the information must be prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles set out in the authorities listed for that USMCA country in Schedule X.
(5) For purposes of paragraph (1)(c) and subsection (4), general expenses means the direct and indirect costs of producing and selling the material that are not included under paragraphs (1)(a) and (b).
(6) For purposes of subsection (4), the amount for profit and general expenses must be taken as a whole. If, in the information supplied by or on behalf of the producer of a material, the profit figure is low and the general expenses figure is high, the profit and general expense figures taken together may nevertheless be consistent with those usually reflected in sales of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued. If the producer of a material can demonstrate that it is taking a nil or low profit on its sales of the material because of particular commercial circumstances, its actual profit and general expense figures must be taken into account, provided that the producer of the material has valid commercial reasons to justify them and its pricing policy
reflects usual pricing policies in the branch of industry concerned. For an illustration of this, such a situation might occur if producers have been forced to lower prices temporarily because of an unforeseeable drop in demand, or if the producers sell the material to complement a range of materials and goods being produced in the country in which the material is sold and accept a low profit to maintain competitiveness. A further illustration is if a material was being launched and the producer accepted a nil or low profit to offset high general expenses associated with the launch.
(7) If the figures for the profit and general expenses supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material are not consistent with those usually reflected in sales of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued that are made by other producers in the country in which that material is sold, the amount for profit and general expenses may be based on relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material.
(8) Whether certain materials are of the same class or kind as the material being valued will be determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the circumstances involved. For purposes of determining the amount for profit and general expenses usually reflected under the provisions of this section, sales of the narrowest group or range of materials of the same class or kind, which includes the material being valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, shall be examined. For the purposes of this section, the materials of the same class or kind must be from the same country as the material being valued.
10 (1) If there is no transaction value under subsection 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under subsection 2(3), and the value of the material cannot be determined under sections 5 through 9, the value of the material, referred to in subparagraph 8(1)(b)(ii) of these Regulations, must be determined under this section using reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions of this Schedule and on the basis of data available in the country in which the producer is located.
(2) The value of the material determined under this section must not be determined on the basis of
(a) a valuation system which provides for the acceptance of the higher of two alternative values;
(b) a cost of production other than the value determined in accordance with section 9;
(c) minimum values;
(d) arbitrary or fictitious values;
(e) if the material is produced in the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located, the price of the material for export from that territory; or
(f) if the material is imported, the price of the material for export to a country other than to the territory of the USMCA country in which the producer is located.
(3) To the greatest extent possible, the value of the material determined under this section must be based on the methods of valuation set out in sections 2 through 9, but a reasonable flexibility in the application of such methods would be in conformity with the aims and provisions of this section. For an illustration of this, under section 5, the requirement that the identical materials should be sold at or about the same time as the time the material being valued is shipped to the producer could be flexibly interpreted. Similarly, identical materials produced in a country other than the country in which the material is produced could be the basis for determining the value of the material, or the value of identical materials already determined under section 8 could be used. For another illustration, under section 6, the requirement that the similar materials should be sold at or about the same time as the material being valued are shipped to the producer could be flexibly interpreted. Likewise, similar materials produced in a country other than the country in which the material is produced could be the basis for determining the value of the material, or the value of similar materials already determined under the provisions of section 8 could be used. For a further illustration, under section 8, the ninety days requirement could be administered flexibly.

# Example 1: FIFO method
By applying the FIFO Method:
(1) The 200 units of Materials A received on 01/01/21 and valued at $1.05 per unit and 300 units of the 1,000 units of Material A received on 01/03/21 and valued at $1.00 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 500 units of Good A shipped on 01/08/21; therefore, the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $510 [(200 units × $1.05) + (300 units × $1.00)];
(2) 500 units of the remaining 700 units of Materials A received on 01/03/21 and valued at $1.00 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 500 units of Good A shipped
on 01/09/21; therefore, the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $500 (500 units × $1.00);
(3) the remaining 200 units of the 1,000 units of Materials A received on 01/03/21 and valued at $1.00 per unit, the 1,000 units of Materials A received on 01/05/21 and valued at $1.10 per unit, and 300 units of the 1,000 units of Materials A received on 01/10/21 and valued at $1.05 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,500 units of Good A shipped on 01/14/21; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $1,615 [(200 units × $1.00) + (1,000 units × $1.10) + (300 units x $1.05)]; and
(4) the remaining 700 units of the 1,000 units of Materials A received on 01/10/21 and valued at $1.05 per unit and 800 units of the 2,000 units of Materials A received on 01/16/21 and valued at $1.10 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,500 units of Good A shipped on 01/18/21; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $1,615 [(700 units × $1.05) + (800 units × $1.10)].

# Example 2: LIFO Method
By applying the LIFO method:
(1) 500 units of the 1,000 units of Materials A received on 01/05/21 and valued at $1.10 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 500 units of Good A shipped on 01/08/21; therefore, the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $550 (500 units × $1.10);
(2) the remaining 500 units of the 1,000 units of Materials A received on 01/05/21 and valued at $1.10 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 500 units of Good A shipped on 01/09/21; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $550 (500 units × $1.10);
(3) the 1,000 units of Materials A received on 01/10/21 and valued at $1.05 per unit and 500 units of the 1,000 units of Material A received on 01/03/21 and valued at $1.00 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,500 units of Good A shipped on 01/14/21; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $1,550 [(1,000 units × $1.05) + (500 units × $1.00)]; and
(4) 1,500 units of the 2,000 units of Materials A received on 01/16/21 and valued at $1.10 per unit are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,500 units of Good A shipped on 01/18/21; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $1,650 (1,500 units × $1.10).

# Example 3: Rolling Average Method
The following table identifies the average value of non-originating Materials A as determined under the rolling average method. For purposes of this example, a new average value of non-originating Materials A is calculated after each receipt.

# Schedule VIII (Inventory Management Methods)

# Part I Fungible Materials

# Definitions
1 The following definitions apply in this Part,
average method
means the method by which the origin of fungible materials withdrawn from materials inventory is based on the ratio, calculated under section 5, of originating materials and non-originating materials in materials inventory;
FIFO method
means the method by which the origin of fungible materials first received in materials inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible materials first withdrawn from materials inventory;
LIFO method
means the method by which the origin of fungible materials last received in materials inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible materials first withdrawn from materials inventory;
materials inventory
means,
(a) with respect to a producer of a good, an inventory of fungible materials that are used in the production of the good, and
(b) with respect to a person from whom the producer of the good acquired those fungible materials, an inventory from which fungible materials are sold or otherwise transferred to the producer of the good;
opening inventory
means the materials inventory at the time an inventory management method is chosen;
origin identifier
means any mark that identifies fungible materials as originating materials or non-originating materials.

# General
2 The following inventory management methods may be used for determining whether fungible materials referred to in paragraph 8(18)(a) of these Regulations are:
(a) Specific identification method;
(b) FIFO method;
(c) LIFO method; and
(d) average method.
3 A producer of a good, or a person from whom the producer acquired the fungible materials that are used in the production of the good, may choose only one of the inventory management methods referred to in section 2, and, if the averaging method is chosen, only one averaging period in each fiscal year of that producer or person for the materials inventory.

# Specific Identification Method
4 (1) Except as otherwise provided under subsection (2), if the producer or person referred to in section 3 chooses the specific identification method, the producer or person must physically segregate, in materials inventory, originating materials that are fungible materials from non-originating materials that are fungible materials.
(2) If originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials are marked with an origin identifier, the producer or person need not physically segregate those materials under subsection (1) if the origin identifier remains visible throughout the production of the good.

# Average Method
5 If the producer or person referred to in section 3 chooses the average method, the origin of fungible materials withdrawn from materials inventory is determined on the basis of the ratio of originating materials and non-originating materials in materials inventory that is calculated under sections 6 through 8.
6 (1) Except as otherwise provided in sections 7 and 8, the ratio is calculated with respect to a month or three-month period, at the choice of the producer or person, by dividing
(a) the sum of
(i) the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and
(ii) the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period, by
(b) the sum of
(i) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and
(ii) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period.
(2) The ratio calculated with respect to a preceding month or three-month period under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible materials remaining in materials inventory at the end of the preceding month or three-month period.
7 (1) If the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement and the regional value content is calculated under the net cost method and the producer or person chooses to average over a period under subsections 7(15), 16(1) or (10) of these Regulations, the ratio is calculated with respect to that period by dividing
(a) the sum of
(i) the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the period, and
(ii) the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that period, by
(b) the sum of
(i) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the period, and
(ii) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that period.
(2) The ratio calculated with respect to a period under subsection (1) is applied to the
fungible materials remaining in materials inventory at the end of the period.
8 (1) If the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement and the regional value content of that good is calculated under the transaction value method or the net cost method, the ratio is calculated with respect to each shipment of the good by dividing
(a) the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory prior to the shipment, by
(b) the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory prior to the shipment.
(2) The ratio calculated with respect to a shipment of a good under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible materials remaining in materials inventory after the shipment.

# Manner of Dealing With Opening Inventory
9 (1) Except as otherwise provided under subsections (2) and (3), if the producer or person referred to in section 3 has fungible materials in opening inventory, the origin of those fungible materials is determined by
(a) identifying, in the books of the producer or person, the latest receipts of fungible materials that add up to the amount of fungible materials in opening inventory;
(b) identifying the origin of the fungible materials that make up those receipts; and
(c) considering the origin of those fungible materials to be the origin of the fungible materials in opening inventory.
(2) If the producer or person chooses the specific identification method and has, in opening inventory, originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that are marked with an origin identifier, the origin of those fungible materials is determined on the basis of the origin identifier.
(3) The producer or person may consider all fungible materials in opening inventory to be non-originating materials.

# Part II Fungible Goods

# Definitions
10 The following definitions apply in this Part,
average method
means the method by which the origin of fungible goods withdrawn from finished goods inventory is based on the ratio, calculated under section 14, of originating goods and non-originating goods in finished goods inventory;
FIFO method
means the method by which the origin of fungible goods first received in finished goods inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible goods first withdrawn from finished goods inventory;
finished goods inventory
means an inventory from which fungible goods are sold or otherwise transferred to another person;
LIFO method
means the method by which the origin of fungible goods last received in finished goods inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible goods first withdrawn from finished goods inventory;
opening inventory
means the finished goods inventory at the time an inventory management method is chosen;
origin identifier
means any mark that identifies fungible goods as originating goods or non-originating goods.

# General
11 The following inventory management methods may be used for determining whether fungible goods referred to in paragraph 8(18)(b) of these Regulations are originating goods:
(a) Specific identification method;
(b) FIFO method;
(c) LIFO method; and
(d) average method.
12 An exporter of a good, or a person from whom the exporter acquired the fungible good, may choose only one of the inventory management methods referred to in section 11, including only one averaging period in the case of the average method, in each fiscal year of that exporter or person for each finished goods inventory of the exporter or person.

# Specific Identification Method
13 (1) Except as provided under subsection (2), if the exporter or person referred to in section 12 chooses the specific identification method, the exporter or person must physically segregate, in finished goods inventory, originating goods that are fungible goods from non-originating goods that are fungible goods.
(2) If originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods are marked with an origin identifier, the exporter or person need not physically segregate those goods under subsection (1) if the origin identifier is visible on the fungible goods.

# Average Method
14 (1) If the exporter or person referred to in section 12 chooses the average method, the origin of each shipment of fungible goods withdrawn from finished goods inventory during a month or three-month period, at the choice of the exporter or person, is determined on the basis of the ratio of originating goods and non-originating goods in finished goods inventory for the preceding one-month or three-month period that is calculated by dividing
(a) the sum of
(i) the total units of originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible
goods and that were in finished goods inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and
(ii) the total units of originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that were received in finished goods inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period, by
(b) the sum of
(i) the total units of originating goods and non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that were in finished goods inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and
(ii) the total units of originating goods and non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that were received in finished goods inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period.
(2) The ratio calculated with respect to a preceding month or three-month period under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible goods remaining in finished goods inventory at the end of the preceding month or three-month period.

# Manner of Dealing With Opening Inventory
15 (1) Except as otherwise provided under subsections (2) and (3), if the exporter or person referred to in section 12 has fungible goods in opening inventory, the origin of those fungible goods is determined by
(a) identifying, in the books of the exporter or person, the latest receipts of fungible goods that add up to the amount of fungible goods in opening inventory;
(b) determining the origin of the fungible goods that make up those receipts; and
(c) considering the origin of those fungible goods to be the origin of the fungible goods in opening inventory.
(2) If the exporter or person chooses the specific identification method and has, in opening inventory, originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that are marked with an origin identifier, the origin of those fungible goods is determined on the basis of the origin identifier.
(3) The exporter or person may consider all fungible goods in opening inventory to be non-originating goods.

# Example 1: FIFO Method
Good A is subject to a regional value-content requirement. Producer A is using the transaction value method to determine the regional value content of Good A.
By applying the FIFO method:
(1) The 100 units of originating Material A in opening inventory that were received in materials inventory on 12/18/20 are considered to have been used in the production of the 100
units of Good A shipped on 01/10/21; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $0;
(2) the 100 units of non-originating Material A in opening inventory that were received in materials inventory on 12/27/20 and 600 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/01/21 are considered to have been used in the production of the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/21; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $110 (100 units × $1.10);
(3) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/01/21 and 600 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/05/21 are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/21; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $660 (600 units × $1.10); and
(4) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/05/21 and 500 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/10/21 are considered to have been used in the production of the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/21; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $440 (400 units × $1.10).

# Example 2: LIFO Method
Good A is subject to a change in tariff classification requirement and the non-originating Material A used in the production of Good A does not undergo the applicable change in tariff classification. Therefore, if originating Material A is used in the production of Good A, Good A is an originating good and, if non-originating Material A is used in the production of Good A, Good A is a non-originating good.
By applying the LIFO method:
(1) 100 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/05/21 are considered to have been used in the production of the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/21;
(2) 700 units of the 1,000 units of originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/10/21 are considered to have been used in the production of the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/21;
(3) 1,000 units of the 2,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/16/21 are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/21; and
(4) 900 units of the remaining 1,000 units of non-originating Material A that were received in materials inventory on 01/16/21 are considered to have been used in the production of the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/21.

# Example 3: Average Method
Good A is subject to an applicable regional value-content requirement. Producer A is using the transaction value method to determine the regional value content of Good A. Producer A determines the average value of non-originating Material A and the ratio of originating Material A to total value of originating Material A and non-originating Material A in the following table.

By applying the average method:
(1) Before the shipment of the 100 units of Material A on 01/10/21, the ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was .50 (1,100 units/2,200 units) and the ratio of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was .50 (1,100 units/2,200 units);
based on those ratios, 50 units (100 units × .50) of originating Material A and 50 units (100 units × .50) of non-originating Material A are considered to have been used in the production of the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/21; therefore, the value of non-originating Material A used in the production of those goods is considered to be $52.50 [100 units × $1.05 (average unit value) × .50];
the ratios are applied to the units of Material A remaining in materials inventory after the shipment: 1,050 units (2,100 units × .50) are considered to be originating materials and 1,050 units (2,100 units × .50) are considered to be non-originating materials;
(2) before the shipment of the 700 units of Good A on 01/15/21, the ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 66% (2,050 units/3,100 units) and the ratio of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 34% (1,050 units/3,100 units);
based on those ratios, 462 units (700 units × .66) of originating Material A and 238 units (700 units × .34) of non-originating Material A are considered to have been used in the production of the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/21; therefore, the value of non-originating Material A used in the production of those goods is considered to be $249.90 [700 units × $1.05 (average unit value) × 34%];
the ratios are applied to the units of Material A remaining in materials inventory after the shipment: 1,584 units (2,400 units × .66) are considered to be originating materials and 816 units (2,400 units × .34) are considered to be non-originating materials;
(3) before the shipment of the 1,000 units of Material A on 01/20/21, the ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 36% (1,584 units/4,400 units) and the ratio of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 64% (2,816 units/4,400 units);
based on those ratios, 360 units (1,000 units × .36) of originating Material A and 640 units (1,000 units × .64) of non-originating Material A are considered to have been used in the production of the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/21; therefore, the value of non-originating Material A used in the production of those goods is considered to be $684.80 [1,000 units × $1.07 (average unit value) × 64%];
those ratios are applied to the units of Material A remaining in materials inventory after the shipment: 1,224 units (3,400 units × .36) are considered to be originating materials and 2,176 units (3,400 units × .64) are considered to be non-originating materials;
(4) before the shipment of the 900 units of Good A on 01/23/21, the ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 36% (1,224 units/3,400 units) and the ratio of units of non-originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory was 64% (2,176 units/3,400 units);
based on those ratios, 324 units (900 units × .36) of originating Material A and 576 units (900 units × .64) of non-originating Material A are considered to have been used in the production of the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/21; therefore, the value of non-originating Material A used in the production of those goods is considered to be $616.32 [900 units × $1.07 (average unit value) × 64%];
those ratios are applied to the units of Material A remaining in materials inventory after the shipment: 900 units (2,500 units × .36) are considered to be originating materials and 1,600 units (2,500 units × .64) are considered to be non-originating materials.

# Example 4: Average Method
Good A is subject to an applicable regional value-content requirement. Producer A is using the net cost method and is averaging over a period of one month under paragraph 7(15)(a) of these Regulations to determine the regional value content of Good A.
By applying the average method:
The ratio of units of originating Material A to total units of Material A in materials inventory for January 2021 is 40.4% (2,100 units/5,200 units);
based on that ratio, 1,091 units (2,700 units × .404) of originating Material A and 1,609 units (2,700 units—1,091 units) of non-originating Material A are considered to have been used in the production of the 2,700 units of Good A shipped in January 2021; therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of those goods is considered to be $0.64 per unit [$5,560 (total value of Material A in materials inventory)/5,200 (units of Material A in materials inventory) = $1.07 (average unit value) × (1−.404)] or $1,728 ($0.64 × 2,700 units); and
that ratio is applied to the units of Material A remaining in materials inventory on January 31, 2021: 1,010 units (2,500 units × .404) are considered to be originating materials and 1,490 units (2,500 units−1,010 units) are considered to be non-originating materials.

# Example 1: FIFO Method
By applying the FIFO method:
(1) The 100 units of originating Good A in opening inventory that were received in finished goods inventory on 12/18/20 are considered to be the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/21;
(2) the 100 units of non-originating Good A in opening inventory that were received in finished goods inventory on 12/27/20 and 600 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/01/21 are considered to be the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/21;
(3) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/01/21 and 600 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/05/21 are considered to be the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/21; and
(4) the remaining 400 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/05/21 and 500 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/10/21 are considered to be the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/21.

# Example 2: LIFO Method
By applying the LIFO method:
(1) 100 units of the 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/05/21 are considered to be the 100 units of Good A shipped on 01/10/21;
(2) 700 units of the 1,000 units of originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/10/21 are considered to be the 700 units of Good A shipped on 01/15/21;
(3) 1,000 units of the 2,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/16/21 are considered to be the 1,000 units of Good A shipped on 01/20/21; and
(4) 900 units of the remaining 1,000 units of non-originating Good A that were received in finished goods inventory on 01/16/21 are considered to be the 900 units of Good A shipped on 01/23/21.

# Example 3: Average Method
Exporter A chooses to determine the origin of Good A on a monthly basis. Exporter A exported 3,000 units of Good A during the month of February 2021. The origin of the units of Good A exported during that month is determined on the basis of the preceding month, that is January 2021.
By applying the average method:
The ratio of originating goods to all goods in finished goods inventory for the month of January 2021 is 40.4% (2,100 units/5,200 units);
based on that ratio, 1,212 units (3,000 units × .404) of Good A shipped in February 2021 are considered to be originating goods and 1,788 units (3,000 units−1,212 units) of Good A are considered to be non-originating goods; and
that ratio is applied to the units of Good A remaining in finished goods inventory on January 31, 2021: 1,010 units (2,500 units × .404) are considered to be originating goods and 1,490 units (2,500 units−1,010 units) are considered to be non-originating goods.

linear interpolation
means, with respect to the interest rate issued by the federal government, the application of the following mathematical formula:
A + [((B−A) × (E−D))/(C−D)]
where
A is the interest rate issued by the federal government debt obligations that are nearest in maturity but of shorter maturity than the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the fixed-rate contract or variable-rate contract to which they are being compared,
B is the interest rate issued by the federal government debt obligations that are nearest in maturity but of greater maturity than the weighted average principal maturity of that payment schedule,
C is the maturity of federal government debt obligations that are nearest in maturity but of greater maturity than the weighted average principal maturity of that payment schedule,
D is the maturity of federal government debt obligations that are nearest in maturity but of shorter maturity than the weighted average principal maturity of that payment schedule, and
E is the weighted average principal maturity of that payment schedule;
payment schedule
means the schedule of payments, whether on a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, yearly or other basis, of principal and interest, or any combination thereof, made by a producer to a lender in accordance with the terms of a fixed-rate contract or variable-rate contract;
variable-rate contract
means a loan contract, instalment purchase contract or other financing agreement in which the interest rate is adjusted at intervals during the life of the contract or agreement in accordance with its terms;
weighted average principal maturity
means, with respect to fixed-rate contracts and variable-rate contracts, the numbers of years, or portion thereof, that is equal to the number obtained by
(a) dividing the sum of the weighted principal payments,
(i) in the case of a fixed-rate contract, by the original amount of the loan, and
(ii) in the case of a variable-rate contract, by the principal balance at the beginning of the interest rate period for which the weighted principal payments were calculated, and
(b) rounding the amount determined under paragraph (a) to the nearest single decimal place and, if that amount is the midpoint between two such numbers, to the greater of those two numbers;
weighted principal payment
means,
(a) with respect to fixed-rate contracts, the amount determined by multiplying each principal payment under the contract by the number of years, or portion thereof, between the date the producer entered into the contract and the date of that principal payment, and
(b) with respect to variable-rate contracts
(i) the amount determined by multiplying each principal payment made during the current interest rate period by the number of years, or portion thereof, between the beginning of that interest rate period and the date of that payment, and
(ii) the amount equal to the outstanding principal owing, but not necessarily due, at the end of the current interest rate period, multiplied by the number of years, or portion thereof, between the beginning and the end of that interest rate period;
interest rate issued by the federal government
means
(a) in the case of a producer located in Canada, the weekly average of the yield for federal government debt obligations set out in the Bank of Canada's
Daily Digest
(i) if the interest rate is adjusted at intervals of less than one year, under the title “Treasury Bills—1 Month”, and
(ii) in any other case, under the title “Government of Canada benchmark bond yields—3 Year”, for the week that the producer entered into the contract or the week of the most recent interest rate adjustment date, if any, under the contract,
(b) in the case of a producer located in Mexico, the yield for federal government debt obligations set out in
La Seccion de Indicadores Monetarios, Financieros, y de Finanzas Publicas, de los Indicadores Economicos,
published by the Banco de Mexico under the title “
Certificados de la Tesoreria de la Federacion”
for the week that the producer entered into the contract or the week of the most recent interest rate adjustment date, if any, under the contract, and
(c) in the case of a producer located in the United States, the yield for federal government debt obligations set out in the Federal Reserve statistical release (H.15)
Selected Interest Rates
(i) if the interest rate is adjusted at intervals of less than one year, under the title “U.S. government securities, Treasury bills, Secondary market”, and
(ii) in any other case, under the title “U.S. Government Securities, Treasury constant maturities”, for the week that the producer entered into the contract or the week of the most recent interest rate adjustment date, if any, under the contract.

# General
2. For purposes of calculating non-allowable interest costs
(a) with respect to a fixed-rate contract, the interest rate under that contract must be compared with the interest rate issued by the federal government debt obligations that have maturities of the same length as the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the contract (that yield determined by linear interpolation, if necessary);
(b) with respect to a variable-rate contract
(i) in which the interest rate is adjusted at intervals of less than or equal to one year, the interest rate under that contract must be compared with the interest rate issued by the federal government on debt obligations that have maturities closest in length to the interest rate adjustment period of the contract, and
(ii) in which the interest rate is adjusted at intervals of greater than one year, the interest rate under the contract must be compared with the interest rate issued by the federal government on debt obligations that have maturities of the same length as the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the contract (that yield determined by linear interpolation, if necessary); and
(c) with respect to a fixed-rate or variable-rate contract in which the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the contract is greater than the maturities offered on federal government debt obligations, the interest rate under the contract must be compared to the interest rate issued by the federal government on debt obligations that have maturities closest in length to the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the contract.

# Appendix “Example” Illustrating the Application of the Method for Calculating Non-Allowable Interest Costs in the Case of a Fixed-Rate Contract
The following example is based on the figures set out in the table below and on the following assumptions:
(a)
A producer in a USMCA country borrows $1,000,000 from a person of the same USMCA country under a fixed-rate contract;
(b)
under the terms of the contract, the loan is payable in 10 years with interest paid at the rate of 6 per cent per year on the declining principal balance;
(c)
the payment schedule calculated by the lender based on the terms of the contract requires the producer to make annual payments of principal and interest of $135,867.36 over the life of the contract;
(d)
there are no federal government debt obligations that have maturities equal to the 6-year weighted average principal maturity of the contract; and
(e)
the federal government debt obligations that are nearest in maturity to the weighted average principal maturity of the contract are of 5- and 7-year maturities, and the yields on them are 4.7 per cent and 5.0 per cent, respectively.

The principal balance represents the loan balance at the end of each full year the loan is in effect and is calculated by subtracting the current year's principal payment from the prior year's ending loan balance.
2
Interest payments are calculated by multiplying the prior year's ending loan balance by the contract interest rate of 6 per cent.
3
Principal payments are calculated by subtracting the current year's interest payments from the annual payment schedule amount.
4
The weighted principal payment is determined by, for each year of the loan, multiplying that year's principal payment by the number of years the loan had been in effect at the end of that year.
5
The weighted average principal maturity of the contract is calculated by dividing the sum of the weighted principal payments by the original loan amount and rounding the amount determined to the nearest decimal place.

# Weighted Average Principal Maturity
$5,977,993.19/$1,000,000 = 5.977993 or 6 years
5
By applying the above method,
(1) the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the 6 per cent contract is 6 years;
(2) the yields on the closest maturities for comparable federal government debt obligations of 5 years and 7 years are 4.7 per cent and 5.0 per cent, respectively; therefore, using linear interpolation, the yield on a federal government debt obligation that has a maturity equal to the weighted average principal maturity of the contract is 4.85 per cent. This number is calculated as follows:
4.7 + [((5.0−4.7) × (6−5))/(7−5)]
= 4.7 + 0.15
= 4.85%; and
(3) the producer's contract interest rate of 6 per cent is within 700 basis points of the 4.85 per cent yield on the comparable federal government debt obligation; therefore, none of the producer's interest costs are considered to be non-
allowable interest costs for purposes of the definition non-allowable interest costs in subsection 1(1) of these Regulations.

# “Example” Illustrating the Application of the Method for Calculating Non-allowable Interest Costs in the Case of a Variable-Rate Contract
The following example is based on the figures set out in the tables below and on the following assumptions:
(a)
a producer in a USMCA country borrows $1,000,000 from a person of the same USMCA country under a variable-rate contract;
(b)
under the terms of the contract, the loan is payable in 10 years with interest paid at the rate of 6 per cent per year for the first two years and 8 per cent per year for the next two years on the principal balance, with rates adjusted each two years after that;
(c)
the payment schedule calculated by the lender based on the terms of the contract requires the producer to make annual payments of principal and interest of $135,867.96 for the first two years of the loan, and of $146,818.34 for the next two years of the loan;
(d)
there are no federal government debt obligations that have maturities equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity of the first two years of the contract;
(e)
there are no federal government debt obligations that have maturities equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity of the third and fourth years of the contract; and
(f)
the federal government debt obligations that are nearest in maturity to the weighted average principal maturity of the contract are 1- and 2-year maturities, and the yields on them are 3.0 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively.

# Weighted Average Principal Maturity
$1,924,132.04/$1,000,000 = 1.92413204 or 1.9 years
By applying the above method:
(1) The weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule of the first two years of the contract is 1.9 years;
(2) the yield on the closest maturities of federal government debt obligations of 1 year and 2 years are 3.0 and 3.5 per cent, respectively; therefore, using linear interpolation, the yield on a federal government debt obligation that has a maturity equal to the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule of the first two years of the contract is 3.45 per cent. This amount is calculated as follows:
3.0 + [((3.5−3.0) × (1.9−1.0))/(2.0−1.0)];
= 3.0 + 0.45
= 3.45%; and
(3) the producer's contract rate of 6 per cent for the first two years of the loan is within 700 basis points of the 3.45 per cent interest rate issued by the federal government on debt obligations that have maturities equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule of the first two years of the producer's loan contract; therefore, none of the producer's interest costs are considered to be non-allowable interest costs for purposes of the definition non-allowable interest costs in subsection 1(1) of these Regulations.

# Weighted Average Principal Maturity
$1,608,102.62/$843,712.01 = 1.905985 or 1.9 years
By applying the above method:
(1) The weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the first two years of the contract is 1.9 years;
(2) the federal government debt obligations that are nearest in maturities to the weighted average principal maturity of the contract are 1- and 2-year maturities, and the yields on them are 3.0 and 3.5 per cent, respectively; therefore, using linear interpolation, the yield on a federal government debt obligation that has a maturity
equal to the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule of the first two years of the contract is 3.45 per cent. This amount is calculated as follows:
3.0 + [((3.5−3.0) × (1.9−1.0))/(2.0−1.0)];
= 3.0 + 0.45
= 3.45%
(3) the producer's contract interest rate, for the third and fourth years of the loan, of 8 per cent is within 700 basis points of the 3.45 per cent interest rate issued by the federal government on debt obligations that have maturities equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the third and fourth years of the producer's loan contract; therefore, none of the producer's interest costs are considered to be non-allowable interest costs for purposes of the definition non-allowable interest costs in subsection 1(1) of these Regulations.

Per unit averaging. Per unit averaging
means the equal apportionment of the amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback for all units covered by a single line item on an entry summary to each unit of merchandise. This method of refund calculation is required for certain substitution drawback claims (
see
§ 190.51(b)(ii)), which may also be subject to additional limitations under the “lesser of” rules, if applicable (
see
§ 190.22(a)(1)(ii) and 190.32(b)).
Possession. Possession,
for purposes of substitution unused merchandise drawback (19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2)), means physical or operational control of the merchandise, including ownership while in bailment, in leased facilities, in transit to, or in any other manner under the operational control of, the party claiming drawback.

see
19 U.S.C. 1508).
Relative value. Relative value
means, except for purposes of § 190.51(b), the value of a product divided by the total value of all products which are necessarily manufactured or produced concurrently in the same operation. Relative value is based on the market value, or other value approved by CBP, of each such product determined as of
the time it is first separated in the manufacturing or production process. Market value is generally measured by the selling price, not including any packaging, transportation, or other identifiable costs, which accrue after the product itself is processed. Drawback must be apportioned to each such product based on its relative value at the time of separation.
Schedule.
A
schedule
means a document filed by a drawback claimant, under section 313(a) or (b), as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or (b)), showing the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise used in or appearing in each article exported or destroyed that justifies a claim for drawback.

means a letter of approval (or its electronic equivalent) issued by CBP Headquarters in response to an application filed by a manufacturer or producer for a ruling on a specific manufacturing or production operation for drawback, as described in the format in Appendix B of this part. Specific manufacturing drawback rulings are subject to the provisions in part 177 of this chapter.
Substituted merchandise or articles. Substituted merchandise or articles
means merchandise or articles that may be substituted as follows:
(1) For manufacturing drawback pursuant to section 1313(b), substituted merchandise must be classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as the designated imported merchandise;
(2) For rejected merchandise drawback pursuant to section 1313(c)(2), substituted merchandise must be classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number and have the same specific product identifier (such as part number, SKU, or product code) as the designated imported merchandise;
(3) For unused merchandise drawback pursuant to section 1313(j)(2), substituted merchandise must be classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as the designated imported merchandise except for wine which may also qualify pursuant to § 190.32(d), but when the 8-digit HTSUS subheading number under which the imported merchandise is classified begins with the term “other,” then the other merchandise may be substituted for imported merchandise for drawback purposes if the other merchandise and such imported merchandise are classifiable under the same 10-digit HTSUS statistical reporting number and the article description for that 10-digit HTSUS statistical reporting number does not begin with the term “other”; but when the first 8 digits of the 10-digit Schedule B number applicable to the exported merchandise are the same as the first 8 digits of the HTSUS subheading number under which the imported merchandise is classified, the merchandise may be substituted (without regard to whether the Schedule B number corresponds to more than one 8-digit HTSUS subheading number); and
(4) For substitution drawback of finished petroleum derivatives pursuant to section 1313(p), a substituted article must be of the same kind and quality as the qualified article for which it is substituted, that is, the articles must be commercially interchangeable or described in the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number (
see
§ 190.172(b)).
Unused merchandise. Unused merchandise
means, for purposes of unused merchandise drawback claims, imported merchandise or other merchandise upon which either no operations have been performed or upon which any operation or combination of operations has been performed (including, but not limited to, testing, cleaning, repacking, inspecting, sorting, refurbishing,
freezing, blending, repairing, reworking, cutting, slitting, adjusting, replacing components, relabeling, disassembling, and unpacking), but which does not amount to a manufacture or production for drawback purposes under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or (b).
Verification. Verification
means the examination of any and all records, maintained by the claimant, or any party involved in the drawback process, which are required by the appropriate CBP officer to render a meaningful recommendation concerning the drawback claimant's conformity to the law and regulations and the determination of supportability, correctness, and validity of the specific claim or groups of claims being verified.

General manufacturing drawback ruling.
(a)
Purpose; eligibility.
General manufacturing drawback rulings are designed to simplify drawback for certain common manufacturing operations but do not preclude or limit the use of applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings (
see
§ 190.8). A manufacturer or producer engaged in an operation that falls within a published general manufacturing drawback ruling may submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under that general ruling. Where a separately-incorporated subsidiary of a parent corporation is engaged in manufacture or production for drawback, the subsidiary is the proper party to submit the letter of
notification, and cannot operate under a letter of notification submitted by the parent corporation.
(b)
Procedures
—(1)
Publication.
General manufacturing drawback rulings are contained in Appendix A to this part. As deemed necessary by CBP, new general manufacturing drawback rulings will be issued as CBP Decisions and added to the appendix thereafter.
(2)
Submission.
Letters of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling must be submitted to any drawback office where drawback entries will be filed, concurrent with or prior to filing a claim, provided that the general manufacturing drawback ruling will be followed without variation. If there is any variation from the general manufacturing drawback ruling, the manufacturer or producer must apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling under § 190.8.
(3)
Information required.
Each manufacturer or producer submitting a letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under this section must provide the following specific detailed information:
(i) Name and address of manufacturer or producer (if the manufacturer or producer is a separately-incorporated subsidiary of a corporation, the subsidiary corporation must submit a letter of notification in its own name);
(ii) In the case of a business entity, the names of the persons listed in § 190.6(a)(1) through (6) who will sign drawback documents;
(iii) Locations of the factories which will operate under the letter of notification;
(iv) Identity (by T.D. or CBP Decision number and title) of the general manufacturing drawback ruling under which the manufacturer or producer will operate;
(v) Description of the merchandise and articles, unless specifically described in the general manufacturing drawback ruling, and the applicable 8-digit HTSUS subheading number(s) for imported merchandise that will be designated as part of substitution manufacturing drawback claims;
(vi) Description of the manufacturing or production process, unless specifically described in the general manufacturing drawback ruling;
(vii) Basis of claim used for calculating drawback; and

§ 190.9
Agency.
(a)
General.
An owner of the identified merchandise, the designated imported merchandise and/or the substituted merchandise that is used to produce the exported articles may employ another person to do part, or all, of the manufacture or production under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or (b) and as defined in § 190.2. For purposes of this section, such owner is the principal and such other person is the agent. Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), the principal will be treated as the manufacturer or producer of merchandise used in manufacture or production by the agent. The principal must be able to establish by its manufacturing records, the manufacturing records of its agent(s), or the manufacturing records of both (or all) parties, compliance with all requirements of this part (
see,
in particular, § 190.26).
(b)
Requirements
—(1)
Contract.
The manufacturer must establish that it is the principal in a contract between it and its agent who actually does the work on either the designated or substituted merchandise, or both, for the principal. The contract must include:
(i) Terms of compensation to show that the relationship is an agency rather than a sale;
(ii) How transfers of merchandise and articles will be recorded by the principal and its agent;
(iii) The work to be performed on the merchandise by the agent for the principal;
(iv) The degree of control that is to be exercised by the principal over the agent's performance of work;
(v) The party who is to bear the risk of loss on the merchandise while it is in the agent's custody; and
(vi) The period that the contract is in effect.
(2)
Ownership of the merchandise by the principal.
The records of the principal and/or the agent must establish that the principal had legal and equitable title to the merchandise before receipt by the agent. The right of the agent to assert a lien on the merchandise for work performed does not derogate the principal's ownership interest under this section.
(3)
Sales prohibited.
The relationship between the principal and agent must not be that of a seller and buyer. If the parties' records show that, with respect to the merchandise that is the subject of the principal-agent contract, the merchandise is sold to the agent by the principal, or the articles manufactured by the agent are sold to the principal by the agent, those records are inadequate to establish existence of a principal-agency relationship under this section.
(c)
Specific manufacturing drawback rulings; general manufacturing drawback rulings
—(1)
Owner.
An owner who intends to operate under the principal-agent procedures of this section must state that intent in any letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling filed under § 190.7 or in any application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling filed under § 190.8.
(2)
Agent.
Each agent operating under this section must have filed a letter of notification of intent to operate under
a general manufacturing drawback ruling (
see
§ 190.7), for an agent, covering the articles manufactured or produced, or have obtained a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (
see
§ 190.8), as appropriate.
(d)
Certificate
—(1)
Contents of certificate.
The principal for whom processing is conducted under this section must file, with any drawback claim, a certificate, subject to the recordkeeping requirements of §§ 190.15 and 190.26, certifying that upon request by CBP it can establish the following:
(i) Quantity of merchandise transferred from the principal to the agent;

(c)
Line item designation for partial transfers of merchandise.
Regardless of any agreement between the transferor and the transferee, the method used for the first filed claim relating to merchandise reported on that entry summary line item will be the exclusive basis for the calculation of refunds (either using per unit averaging or not) for any subsequent claims for any other merchandise reported on that
same entry summary line item.
See
§ 190.51(a)(3).
(d)
Retention period.
The records listed in paragraph (b) of this section must be retained by the issuing party for 3 years from the date of liquidation of the related claim or longer period if required by law (

If the records required under paragraph (b) of this section or additional records requested by CBP are not provided by the claimant upon request by CBP, the part of the drawback claim dependent on those records will be denied.
(f)
Warehouse transfer and withdrawals.
The person in whose name merchandise is withdrawn from a bonded warehouse will be considered the importer for drawback purposes. No records are required to document prior transfers of merchandise while in a bonded warehouse.
§ 190.11
Valuation of merchandise.
The values declared to CBP as part of a complete drawback claim pursuant to § 190.51 must be established as provided below. If the drawback eligible merchandise or articles are destroyed, then the value of the imported merchandise and any substituted merchandise must be reduced by the value of materials recovered during destruction in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1313(x).
(a)
Designated imported merchandise.
The value of the imported merchandise is determined as follows:
(1)
Direct identification claims.
The value of the imported merchandise is the customs value of the imported merchandise upon entry into the United States (see subpart E of part 152 of this chapter); or, if the merchandise is identified pursuant to an approved accounting method, then the value of the imported merchandise is the customs value that is properly attributable to the imported merchandise as identified by the appropriate recordkeeping (see § 190.14, varies by accounting method).
(2)
Substitution claims.
The value of the designated imported merchandise is the per unit average value, which is the entered value for the applicable entry summary line item apportioned equally over each unit covered by the line item.
(b)
Exported merchandise or articles.
The value of the exported merchandise or articles eligible for drawback is the selling price as declared for the Electronic Export Information (EEI), including any adjustments and exclusions required by 15 CFR 30.6(a). If there is no selling price for the EEI, then the value is the other value as declared for the EEI including any adjustments and exclusions required by 15 CFR 30.6(a) (e.g., the market price, if the goods are shipped on consignment). (For special types of transactions where certain unusual conditions are involved, the value for the EEI is determined pursuant to 15 CFR part 30 subpart C.) If no EEI is required (
see,
15 CFR part 30 subpart D for a complete list of exemptions), then the claimant must provide the value that would have been set forth on the EEI when the exportation took place, but for the exemption from the requirement for an EEI.
(c)
Destroyed merchandise or articles.
The value of the destroyed merchandise or articles eligible for drawback is the value at the time of destruction, determined as if the merchandise had been exported in its condition at the time of its destruction and an EEI had been required.
(d)
Substituted merchandise for manufacturing drawback claims.
The value of the substituted merchandise for manufacturing drawback claims pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) is the cost of acquisition or production for the manufacturer or producer who used the substituted merchandise in manufacturing or production. These costs must be based on records kept in the ordinary course of business and may be determined on the basis of any of the inventory accounting methods recognized in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Any inventory management method which is used by a manufacturer or producer for valuation of the substituted merchandise for manufacturing drawback claims under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) must be used without variation with other methods for a period of at least 1 year.
§ 190.12
Claim filed under incorrect provision.
A drawback claim filed under this part and pursuant to any provision of section 313 of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313), may be deemed filed pursuant to any other provision thereof should the drawback office determine that drawback is not allowable under the provision as originally filed, but that it is allowable under such other provision. To be allowable under such other provision, the claim must meet each of the requirements of such provision. The claimant may raise alternative provisions prior to liquidation and by protest (
see
part 174 of this chapter).
§ 190.13
Packaging materials.
(a)
Imported packaging material.
Drawback is provided for in section 313(q)(1) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(q)(1)), on imported packaging material used to package or repackage merchandise or articles exported or destroyed pursuant to section 313(a), (b), (c), or (j) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(a), (b), (c), or (j)). The amount of drawback payable on the packaging material is determined pursuant to the particular drawback provision to which the packaged goods themselves are subject. The packaging material must be separately identified on the claim, and all other information and documents required for the particular drawback provision under which the claim is made must be provided for the packaging material.
(b)
Packaging material manufactured in United States from imported materials.
Drawback is provided for in section 313(q)(2) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(q)(2)), on packaging material that is manufactured or produced in the United States from imported materials and used to package or repackage articles that are exported or destroyed under section 313(a) or (b) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or (b)). The packaging material and the imported merchandise used in the manufacture or production of the packaging material must be separately identified on the claim, and all other information and documents required for the particular drawback provision under which the claim is made must be provided for the packaging material as well as the imported merchandise used in its manufacture or production, for purposes of determining the applicable drawback payable. Drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(q)(2) is allowed, regardless of whether or not any of the articles or merchandise the packaging contains are actually eligible for drawback.
§ 190.14
Identification of merchandise or articles by accounting method.
(a)
General.
This section provides for the identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes by the use of accounting methods. This section applies to identification of merchandise or articles in inventory or storage, as well as identification of merchandise used in manufacture or production, as defined in § 190.2. This section is not applicable to situations in which the drawback law authorizes substitution (substitution is allowed in specified situations under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), 1313(j)(2), 1313(k), and 1313(p); this section does apply to situations in these subsections in which substitution is not allowed, as well as to the subsections of the drawback law under which no substitution is allowed). When substitution is authorized, merchandise or articles may be substituted without reference to this section, under the criteria and conditions specifically authorized in the statutory and regulatory provisions providing for the substitution.
(b)
Conditions and criteria for identification by accounting method.
Manufacturers, producers, claimants, or other appropriate persons may identify for drawback purposes lots of merchandise or articles under this section, subject to each of the following conditions and criteria:
(1) The lots of merchandise or articles to be so identified must be fungible as defined in § 190.2;
(2) The person using the identification method must be able to establish that inventory records (for example, material control records), prepared and used in the ordinary course of business, account for the lots of merchandise or articles to be identified as being received into and withdrawn from the same inventory. Even if merchandise or articles are received or withdrawn
at different geographical locations, if such inventory records treat receipts or withdrawals as being from the same inventory, those inventory records may be used to identify the merchandise or articles under this section, subject to the conditions of this section. If any such inventory records (that is, inventory records prepared and used in the ordinary course of business) treat receipts and withdrawals as being from different inventories, those inventory records must be used and receipts into or withdrawals from the different inventories may not be accounted for together. If units of merchandise or articles can be specifically identified (for example, by serial number), the merchandise or articles must be specifically identified and may not be identified by accounting method, unless it is established that inventory records, prepared and used in the ordinary course of business, treat the merchandise or articles to be identified as being received into and withdrawn from the same inventory (subject to the above conditions);
(3) Unless otherwise provided in this section or specifically approved by CBP (by a binding ruling under part 177 of this chapter), all receipts (or inputs) into and all withdrawals from the inventory must be recorded in the accounting record;
(4) The records which support any identification method under this section are subject to verification by CBP (
see
§ 190.61). If CBP requests such verification, the person using the identification method must be able to demonstrate how, under generally accepted accounting procedures, the records which support the identification method used account for all merchandise or articles in, and all receipts into and withdrawals from, the inventory, and the drawback per unit for each receipt and withdrawal; and
(5) Any accounting method which is used by a person for drawback purposes under this section must be used exclusively, without using other methods for a period of at least 1 year, unless approval is given by CBP for a shorter period.
(c)
Approved accounting methods.
The following accounting methods are approved for use in the identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes under this section. If a claim is eligible for the use of any accounting method, the claimant must indicate on the drawback entry whether an accounting method was used, and if so, which accounting method was used, to identify the merchandise as part of the complete claim (see § 190.51).
(1)
First-in, first-out
(
FIFO
)—(i)
General.
The FIFO method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the first merchandise or articles received into the inventory. Under this method, withdrawals are from the oldest (first-in) merchandise or articles in the inventory at the time of withdrawal.
(ii)
Example.
If the beginning inventory is zero, 100 units with $1 drawback attributable per unit are received in inventory on the 2nd of the month, 50 units with no drawback attributable per unit are received into inventory on the 5th of the month, 75 units are withdrawn for domestic (non-export) shipment on the 10th of the month, 75 units with $2 drawback attributable per unit are received in inventory on the 15th of the month, 100 units are withdrawn for export on the 20th of the month, and no other receipts or withdrawals occurred in the month, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $75 (25 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit, 50 units from the receipt on the 5th with no drawback attributable per unit, and 25 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 75 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (25 with $1 drawback/
unit, 50 with $0 drawback/unit, and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit, 50 with $0 drawback/unit, and 25 with $2 drawback unit) results in a balance of 50 units (all 50 with $2 drawback/unit).
(2)
Last-in, first out
(
LIFO
)—(i)
General.
The LIFO method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the last merchandise or articles received into the inventory. Under this method, withdrawals are from the newest (last-in) merchandise or articles in the inventory at the time of withdrawal.
(ii)
Example.
In the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $175 (75 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit and 25 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units (50 with $0 drawback/unit and 25 with $1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 75 units (all with $1 drawback/unit); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (75 with $1 drawback/unit and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (75 with $2 drawback/unit and 25 with $1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 50 units (all 50 with $1 drawback/unit).
(3)
Low-to-high
—(i)
General.
The low-to-high method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per unit of the merchandise or articles in inventory. Merchandise or articles with no drawback attributable to them (for example, domestic merchandise or duty-free merchandise) must be accounted for and are treated as having the lowest drawback attributable to them. Under this method, withdrawals are from the merchandise or articles with the least amount of drawback attributable to them, then those with the next higher amount, and so forth. If the same amount of drawback is attributable to more than one lot of merchandise or articles, withdrawals are from the oldest (first-in) merchandise or articles among those lots with the same amount of drawback attributable. Drawback requirements are applicable to withdrawn merchandise or articles as identified (for example, if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import more than 5 years before the claimed export, no drawback could be granted).
(ii)
Ordinary low-to-high
—(A)
Method.
Under the ordinary low-to-high method, all receipts into and all withdrawals from the inventory are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal, whether for export or domestic shipment, is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per unit of the merchandise or articles available in the inventory.
(B)
Example.
In this example, the beginning inventory is zero, and receipts into and withdrawals from the inventory are as follows:
Date
Receipt
($ per unit)
Withdrawals
Jan. 2
100 (zero)
Jan. 5
50 ($1.00)
Jan. 15
50 (export).

# Note to paragraph (
c

# )(3)(
ii

# )(B):
The drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt with the lowest drawback amount per unit is the January 2 receipt), the drawback attributable to the January 28 withdrawal
for domestic shipment (no drawback) is zero (the remainder of the January 2 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $100.50 (the January 5 and January 20 receipts), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 23 withdrawal for domestic shipment (no drawback) is zero (the February 20 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $102.50 (the January 25 and January 31 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the March 21 withdrawal for domestic shipment (no drawback) is $52.50 (the February 25 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $98.00 (the March 25 and March 5 receipts). Remaining in inventory is the March 20 receipt of 50 units ($1.08 drawback/unit). Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $391.00.
(iii)
Low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period
—(A)
Method.
Under the low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period, all receipts into and all withdrawals for export are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per available unit of the merchandise or articles received into the inventory in the established average inventory turn-over period preceding the withdrawal.
(B)
Accounting for withdrawals
(
for domestic shipments and for export
). Under the low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period, domestic withdrawals (withdrawals for domestic shipment) are not accounted for and do not affect the available units of merchandise or articles. All withdrawals for export must be accounted for whether or not drawback is available or claimed on the withdrawals. Once a withdrawal for export is made and accounted for under this method, the merchandise or articles withdrawn are no longer available for identification.
(C)
Establishment of inventory turn-over period.
For purposes of the low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period, the average inventory turn-over period is based on the rate of withdrawal from inventory and represents the time in which all of the merchandise or articles in the inventory at a given time must have been withdrawn based on that rate. To establish an average of this time, at least 1 year, or 3 turn-over periods (if inventory turns over fewer than 3 times per year), must be averaged. The inventory turn-over period must be that for the merchandise or articles to be identified, except that if the person using the method has more than one kind of merchandise or articles with different inventory turn-over periods, the longest average turn-over period established under this section may be used (instead of using a different inventory turn-over period for each kind of merchandise or article).
(D)
Example.
In the example in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but, as required for this method, without accounting for domestic withdrawals, and with an established average inventory turn-over period of 30 days), the drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt in the preceding 30 days with the lowest amount of drawback is the January 2 receipt, of which 50 units will remain after the withdrawal), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $101.50 (the January 20 and January 25 receipts), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $51.50 (the February 20 and January 31 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $98.00 (the March 25 and March 5 receipts). No drawback may be claimed on the basis of the January 5 receipt or the February 25 receipt because in the case of each, there were insufficient withdrawals for export within the established average inventory turn-over period; the 50 units remaining from the January 2 receipt after the January 15 withdrawal are
not identified for a withdrawal for export because there is no other withdrawal for export (other than the January 15 withdrawal) within the established average inventory turn-over period; the March 20 receipt (50 units at $1.08) is not yet attributed to withdrawals for export. Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $341.00.
(iv)
Low-to-high blanket method
—(A)
Method.
Under the low-to-high blanket method, all receipts into and all withdrawals for export are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for. Each withdrawal is identified on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per available unit of the merchandise or articles received into inventory in the applicable statutory period for export preceding the withdrawal (e.g., 180 days under 19 U.S.C. 1313(p) and 5 years for other types of drawback claims pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(r)). Drawback requirements are applicable to withdrawn merchandise or articles as identified (for example, no drawback could be granted generally if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import made more than 5 years before the claimed export; and, for claims pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(p), no drawback could be granted if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import that was entered more than 180 days after the date of the claimed export or if the claimed export was more than 180 days after the close of the manufacturing period attributable to an import).
(B)
Accounting for withdrawals
(
for domestic shipments and for export
). Under the low-to-high blanket method, domestic withdrawals (withdrawals for domestic shipment) are not accounted for and do not affect the available units of merchandise or articles. All withdrawals for export must be accounted for whether or not drawback is available or claimed on the withdrawals. Once a withdrawal for export is made and accounted for under this method, the merchandise or articles withdrawn are no longer available for identification.
(C)
Example.
In the example in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but, as required for this method, without accounting for domestic withdrawals), the drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt in the inventory with the lowest amount of drawback is the January 2 receipt, of which 50 units will remain after the withdrawal), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $50.00 (the remainder of the January 2 receipt and the January 5 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $50.50 (the February 20 and January 20 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $96.00 (the March 25 and January 25 receipts). Receipts not attributed to withdrawals for export are the January 31 (50 units at $1.03), February 25 (50 units at $1.05), March 5 (50 units at $1.06), and March 20 (50 units at $1.08) receipts. Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $286.50.
(4)
Average
—(i)
General.
The average method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified on the basis of the calculation by recordkeeping of the amount of drawback that may be attributed to each unit of merchandise or articles in the inventory. In this method, the ratio of:
(A) The total units of a particular receipt of the fungible merchandise in the inventory at the time of a withdrawal to;
(B) The total units of all receipts of the fungible merchandise (including each receipt into inventory) at the time of the withdrawal;
(C) Is applied to the withdrawal, so that the withdrawal consists of a proportionate quantity of units from each particular receipt and each receipt is correspondingly decreased. Withdrawals and corresponding decreases to receipts are rounded to the nearest whole number.
(ii)
Example.
In the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $133 (50 units from the receipt
on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit, 33 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit, and 17 units from the receipt on the 5th with $0 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units (50 with $1 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of 100 units from the receipt on the 2nd to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal) and 25 with $0 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of 50 units from the receipt on the 5th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal)) results in a balance of 75 units (with 50 with $1 drawback/unit and 25 with $0 drawback/unit, on the basis of the same ratios); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (50 with $1 drawback/unit, 25 with $0 drawback/unit, and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (50 with $2 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 75 units from the receipt on the 15th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal), 33 with $1 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 50 units remaining from the receipt on the 2nd to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal, and 17 with $0 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 25 units remaining from the receipt on the 5th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal)) results in a balance of 50 units (25 with $2 drawback/unit, 17 with $1 drawback/unit, and 8 with $0 drawback/unit, on the basis of the same ratios).
(5)
Inventory turn-over for limited purposes.
A properly established average inventory turn-over period, as provided for in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, may be used to determine:
(i) The fact and date(s) of use in manufacture or production of the designated imported merchandise and other (substituted) merchandise (
see
19 U.S.C. 1313(b)); or
(ii) The fact and date(s) of manufacture or production of the exported or destroyed articles (
see
19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and (b)).
(d)
Approval of other accounting methods.
(1) Persons proposing to use an accounting method for identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes which has not been previously approved for such use (
see
paragraph (c) of this section), or which includes modifications from the methods listed in paragraph (c) of this section, may seek approval by CBP of the proposed accounting method under the provisions for obtaining an administrative ruling (
see
part 177 of this chapter). The conditions applied and the criteria used by CBP in approving such an alternative accounting method, or a modification of one of the approved accounting methods, will be the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, as well as those in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2) In order for a proposed accounting method to be approved by CBP for purposes of this section, it must meet the following criteria:
(i) For purposes of calculations of drawback, the proposed accounting method must be either revenue neutral or favorable to the Government; and
(ii) The proposed accounting method should be:
(A) Generally consistent with commercial accounting procedures, as applicable for purposes of drawback;
(B) Consistent with inventory or material control records used in the ordinary course of business by the person proposing the method; and
(C) Easily administered by CBP.
§ 190.15
Recordkeeping.
Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3), all records which pertain to the filing of a drawback claim or to the information contained in the records required by 19 U.S.C. 1313 in connection with the filing of a drawback claim must be retained for 3 years after liquidation of such claims or longer period if required by law (under 19 U.S.C. 1508, the same records may be subject to a different period for different purposes).

# Subpart B—Manufacturing Drawback
§ 190.21
Direct identification manufacturing drawback.
Section 313(a) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(a)), provides for drawback upon the exportation, or destruction under CBP supervision, of articles manufactured or produced in the United States with the use of imported merchandise, provided that those articles have not been used in the United States prior to such exportation or destruction. The amount of drawback allowable will not exceed 99 percent of the amount of duties, taxes, and fees paid with respect to the imported merchandise. However, duties may not be refunded upon the exportation or destruction of flour or by-products produced from imported wheat. Where two or more products result, drawback must be distributed among the products in accordance with their relative values, as defined in § 190.2, at the time of separation. Merchandise may be identified for drawback purposes under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) in the manner provided for and prescribed in § 190.14.
§ 190.22
Substitution drawback.
(a)(1)
General
—(i)
Substitution standard.
If imported, duty-paid merchandise or merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as the imported merchandise is used in the manufacture or production of articles within a period not to exceed 5 years from the date of importation of such imported merchandise, then upon the exportation, or destruction under CBP supervision, of any such articles, without their having been used in the United States prior to such exportation or destruction, drawback is provided for in section 313(b) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(b)). Drawback is allowable even though none of the imported, duty-paid merchandise may actually have been used in the manufacture or production of the exported or destroyed articles. The amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback is determined by per unit averaging, as defined in § 190.2, for any drawback claim based on 19 U.S.C. 1313(b).
(ii)
Allowable refund
—(A)
Exportation.
In the case of an article that is exported, the amount of drawback allowable will not exceed 99 percent of the lesser of:

(2)
Special rule for sought chemical elements
—(i)
Substitution standard.
A sought chemical element, as defined in § 190.2, may be considered imported merchandise, or merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as such imported merchandise, used in the manufacture or production of an article as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, and it may be substituted for source material containing that sought chemical element, without regard to whether the sought chemical element and the source material are classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading
number, and apportioned quantitatively, as appropriate (
see
§ 190.26(b)(4)).
(ii)
Allowable refund.
The amount of drawback allowable will be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The value of the substituted source material must be determined based on the quantity of the sought chemical element present in the source material, as calculated per § 190.26(b)(4).
(b)
Use by same manufacturer or producer at different factory.
Duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used at one factory of a manufacturer or producer within 5 years after the date on which the material was imported may be designated as the basis for drawback on articles manufactured or produced in accordance with these regulations at other factories of the same manufacturer or producer.
(c)

(2)
Claims covering a manufacturing period.
Where the claim covers a manufacturing period rather than a manufacturing lot, the entire period covered by the claim is the time of separation of the products and the value per unit of product is the market value for the period (as provided for in the definition of relative value in § 190.2). Manufacturing periods in excess of one month may not be used without specific approval of CBP.
(3)
Recordkeeping.
Records must be maintained showing the relative value of each product at the time of separation.
§ 190.23
Methods and requirements for claiming drawback.
Claims must be based on one or more of the methods specified in paragraph (a) of this section and comply with all other requirements specified in this section.
(a)
Method of claiming drawback.
—(1)
Used in.
Drawback may be paid based on the amount of the imported or substituted merchandise used in the manufacture of the exported article, where there is no waste or the waste is valueless or unrecoverable. This method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and there is no valuable waste (
see
paragraph (a)(2) of this section).
(2)
Used in less valuable waste.
Drawback is allowable under this method based on the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to manufacture the exported or destroyed article, reduced by an amount equal to the quantity of this merchandise that the value of the waste would replace. This method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and there is valuable waste.
(3)
Relative value.
Drawback is also allowable under this method when two or more products result from manufacturing or production. The relative value method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and drawback must be distributed among the products in accordance with their relative values (as defined in § 190.2) at the time of separation.
(4)
Appearing in.
Drawback is allowable under this method based only on the amount of imported or substituted merchandise that appears in (is contained in) the exported articles. The appearing in method may not be used if there are multiple products also necessarily and concurrently resulting from the manufacturing process.
(b)
Abstract or schedule.
A drawback claimant may use either the abstract or schedule method to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported or destroyed article. An abstract is the summary of records which shows the total quantity used in or appearing in all articles produced during the period covered by the abstract. A schedule shows the quantity of material actually used in producing, or appearing in, each unit of product. Manufacturers or producers submitting letters of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling (
see
§ 190.7) and applicants for approval of specific manufacturing drawback rulings (
see
§ 190.8) must state whether the abstract or schedule method is used; if no such statement is made, drawback claims must be based upon the abstract method.
(c)
Claim for waste.
—(1)
Valuable waste.
When the waste has a value and the drawback claim is not limited to the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise or drawback products appearing in the exported or destroyed articles claimed for drawback, the manufacturer or producer must keep records to show the market value of the merchandise or drawback products used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed articles, as well as the market value of the resulting waste, under the used in less valuable waste method (as provided for in the definition of relative value in § 190.2).
(2)
If claim for waste is waived.
If claim for waste is waived, only the “appearing in” basis may be used (
see
paragraph (a)(4) of this section). Waste records need not be kept unless required to establish the quantity of imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback products appearing in the exported or destroyed articles claimed for drawback.
§ 190.24
Transfer of merchandise.
Evidence of any transfers of merchandise (
see
§ 190.10) must be evidenced by records, as defined in § 190.2.
§ 190.25
Destruction under CBP supervision.
A claimant may destroy merchandise and obtain drawback by complying with the procedures set forth in § 190.71 relating to destruction.
§ 190.26
Recordkeeping.
(a)
Direct identification.
(1)
Records required.
Each manufacturer or producer under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) must keep
records to allow the verifying CBP official to trace all articles manufactured or produced for exportation or destruction with drawback, from importation, through manufacture or production, to exportation or destruction. To this end, these records must specifically establish:
(i) The date or inclusive dates of manufacture or production;
(ii) The quantity, identity, and 8-digit HTSUS subheading number(s) of the imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used in or appearing in (
see
§ 190.23) the articles manufactured or produced;
(iii) The quantity, if any, of the non-drawback merchandise used, when these records are necessary to determine the quantity of imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback product used in the manufacture or production of the exported or destroyed articles or appearing in them;
(iv) The quantity and description of the articles manufactured or produced;
(v) The quantity of waste incurred, if applicable; and
(vi) That the articles on which drawback is claimed were exported or destroyed within 5 years after the importation of the duty-paid merchandise, without having been used in the United States prior to such exportation or destruction. (If the articles were commingled after manufacture or production, their identity may be maintained in the manner prescribed in § 190.14.)
(2)
Accounting.
The merchandise and articles to be exported or destroyed will be accounted for in a manner which will enable the manufacturer, producer, or claimant:
(i) To determine, and the CBP official to verify, the applicable import entry and any transfers of the merchandise associated with the claim; and
(ii) To identify with respect to that import entry, and any transfers of the merchandise, the imported merchandise or drawback products used in manufacture or production.
(b)
Substitution.
The records of the manufacturer or producer of articles manufactured or produced in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) must establish the facts in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (iv) through (vi) of this section, and:
(1) The quantity, identity, and specifications of the merchandise designated (imported duty-paid, or drawback product);
(2) The quantity, identity, and specifications of the substituted merchandise before its use to manufacture or produce (or appearing in) the exported or destroyed articles;
(3) That, within 5 years after the date of importation of the imported duty-paid merchandise, the manufacturer or producer used the designated merchandise in manufacturing or production and that during the same5-year period it manufactured or produced the exported or destroyed articles; and
(4) If the designated merchandise is a sought chemical element, as defined in § 190.2, that was contained in imported material and a substitution drawback claim is made based on that chemical element:
(i) The duties, taxes, and fees paid on the imported material must be apportioned among its constituent components. The claim on the chemical element that is the designated merchandise must be limited to the duty apportioned to that element on a unit-for-unit attribution using the unit of measure set forth in the HTSUS that is applicable to the imported material. If the material is a compound with other constituents, including impurities, and the purity of the compound in the imported material is shown by satisfactory analysis, that purity, converted to a decimal equivalent of the percentage, is multiplied against the entered amount of the material to establish the amount of pure compound. The amount of the element in the pure compound is to be determined by use of the atomic weights of the constituent elements and converting to the decimal equivalent of their respective percentages and multiplying that decimal equivalent against the above-determined amount of pure compound.
(ii) The amount claimed as drawback based on the sought chemical element must be deducted from the amounts paid on the imported material that may be claimed on any other drawback claim.
Example to paragraph (b)(4):
Synthetic rutile that is shown by appropriate analysis in the entry papers to be 91.7%
pure titanium dioxide is imported and dutiable at a 5% ad valorem duty rate. The amount of imported synthetic rutile is 30,000 pounds with an entered value of $12,000. The total duty paid is $600. Titanium in the synthetic rutile is designated as the basis for a drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b). The amount of titanium dioxide in the synthetic rutile is determined by converting the purity percentage (91.7%) to its decimal equivalent (.917) and multiplying the entered amount of synthetic rutile (30,000 pounds) by that decimal equivalent (.917 × 30,000 = 27,510 pounds of titanium dioxide contained in the 30,000 pounds of imported synthetic rutile). The titanium, based on atomic weight, represents 59.93% of the constituents in titanium dioxide. Multiplying that percentage, converted to its decimal equivalent, by the amount of titanium dioxide determines the titanium content of the imported synthetic rutile (.5993 × 27,510 pounds of titanium dioxide = 16,486.7 pounds of titanium contained in the imported synthetic rutile). Therefore, up to 16,486.7 pounds of titanium is available to be designated as the basis for drawback. As the per unit duty paid on the synthetic rutile is calculated by dividing the duty paid ($600) by the amount of imported synthetic rutile (30,000 pounds), the per unit duty is two cents of duty per pound of the imported synthetic rutile ($600 ÷ 30,000 = $0.02). The duty on the titanium is calculated by multiplying the amount of titanium contained in the imported synthetic rutile by two cents of duty per pound (16,486.7 × $0.02 = $329.73 duty apportioned to the titanium). The product is then multiplied by 99% to determine the maximum amount of drawback available ($329.73 × .99 = $326.44). If an exported titanium alloy ingot weighs 17,000 pounds, in which 16,000 pounds of titanium was used to make the ingot, drawback is determined by multiplying the duty per pound ($0.02) by the weight of the titanium contained in the ingot (16,000 pounds) to calculate the duty available for drawback ($0.02 × 16,000 = $320.00). Because only 99% of the duty can be claimed, drawback is determined by multiplying this available duty amount by 99% (.99 × $320.00 = $316.80). As the oxygen content of the titanium dioxide is 45% of the synthetic rutile, if oxygen is the designated merchandise on another drawback claim, 45% of the duty claimed on the synthetic rutile would be available for drawback based on the substitution of oxygen.
(c)
Valuable waste records.
When waste has a value and the manufacturer, producer, or claimant, has not limited the claims based on the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise appearing in the articles exported or destroyed, the manufacturer or producer must keep records to show the market value of the merchandise used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed article, as well as the quantity and market value of the waste incurred (as provided for in the definition of relative value in § 190.2). In such records, the quantity of merchandise identified or designated for drawback, under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or 1313(b), respectively, must be based on the quantity of merchandise actually used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed articles. The waste replacement reduction will be determined by reducing from the quantity of merchandise actually used by the amount of merchandise which the value of the waste would replace.
(d)
Purchase of manufactured or produced articles for exportation or destruction.
Where the claimant purchases articles from the manufacturer or producer and exports or destroys them, the claimant must maintain records to document the transfer of articles received.
(e)
Multiple claimants
—(1)
General.
Multiple claimants may file for drawback with respect to the same export or destruction (for example, if an automobile is exported, where different parts of the automobile have been produced by different manufacturers under drawback conditions and the exporter waives the right to claim drawback and assigns such right to the manufacturers under § 190.82).
(2)
Procedures
—(i)
Submission of letter.
Each drawback claimant must file a separate letter, as part of the claim, describing the component article to which each claim will relate. Each letter must show the name of the claimant and bear a statement that the
claim will be limited to its respective component article. The exporter or destroyer must endorse the letters, as required, to show the respective interests of the claimants.
(ii)
Blanket waivers and assignments of drawback rights.
Exporters may waive and assign their drawback rights for all, or any portion, of their exportations with respect to a particular commodity for a given period to a drawback claimant.
(f)
Retention of records.
Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3), all records required to be kept by the manufacturer, producer, or claimant with respect to drawback claims, and records kept by others to complement the records of the manufacturer, producer, or claimant with respect to drawback claims must be retained for 3 years after the date of liquidation of the related claims (under 19 U.S.C. 1508, the same records may be subject to a different retention period for different purposes).
§ 190.27
Time limitations for manufacturing drawback.
(a)
Direct identification.
Drawback will be allowed on imported merchandise used to manufacture or produce articles that are exported or destroyed under CBP supervision within 5 years after importation of the merchandise identified to support the claim.
(b)
Substitution.
Drawback will be allowed on the imported merchandise if the following conditions are met:
(1) The designated merchandise is used in manufacture or production within 5 years after importation;
(2) Within the 5-year period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the exported or destroyed articles, or drawback products, were manufactured or produced; and
(3) The completed articles must be exported or destroyed under CBP supervision within 5 years of the date of importation of the designated merchandise, or within 5 years of the earliest date of importation associated with a drawback product.
(c)
Drawback claims filed before specific or general manufacturing drawback ruling approved or acknowledged.
Drawback claims may be filed before the letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling covering the claims is acknowledged (§ 190.7), or before the specific manufacturing drawback ruling covering the claims is approved (§ 190.8), but no drawback will be paid until such acknowledgement or approval, as appropriate.
§ 190.28
Person entitled to claim manufacturing drawback.
The exporter (or destroyer) will be entitled to claim drawback, unless the exporter (or destroyer), by means of a certification, assigns the right to claim drawback to the manufacturer, producer, importer, or intermediate party. Such certification must accompany each claim and also affirm that the exporter (or destroyer) has not claimed and will not itself claim drawback or assign the right to claim drawback on the particular exportation or destruction to any other party. The certification provided for under this section may be a blanket certification for a stated period. Drawback is paid to the claimant, who may be the manufacturer, producer, intermediate party, importer, or exporter (or destroyer).
§ 190.29
Certification of bill of materials or formula.
At the time of filing a claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or (b), the claimant must certify the following:
(a) The claimant is in possession of the applicable bill of materials or formula for the exported or destroyed article(s), which will be promptly provided upon request;
(b) The bill of materials or formula identifies the imported and/or substituted merchandise and the exported or destroyed article(s) by their 8-digit HTSUS subheading numbers; and
(c) The bill of materials or formula identifies the manufactured quantities of the imported and/or substituted merchandise and the exported or destroyed article(s).

§ 190.42
Procedures and supporting documentation.
(a)
Time limit for exportation or destruction.
Drawback will be denied on merchandise that is exported or destroyed after the statutory 5-year time period.
(b)
Required documentation.
The claimant must submit documentation to CBP as part of the complete drawback claim (
see
§ 190.51) to establish that the merchandise did not conform to sample or specification, was shipped without the consent of the consignee, or was defective as of the time of importation (
see
§ 190.45 for additional requirements for claims made on rejected retail merchandise under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c)(1)(C)(ii)). If the claimant was not the importer, the claimant must also:
(1) Submit a statement signed by the importer and every other person, other than the ultimate purchaser, that owned the goods, that no other claim for drawback was made on the goods by any other person; and
(2) Certify that records are available to support the statement required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Notice.
A notice of intent to export or destroy merchandise which may be the subject of a rejected merchandise drawback claim (19 U.S.C. 1313(c)) must be provided to CBP to give CBP the opportunity to examine the merchandise. The claimant, or the exporter (for destruction under CBP supervision, see § 190.71), must file at the port of intended redelivery to CBP custody a Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on CBP Form 7553 at least 5 working days prior to the date of intended return to CBP custody, unless the claimant has been granted a waiver of prior notice (
see
§ 190.91) or complies with the procedures for 1-time waiver in § 190.36.
(d)
Required information.
The notice must provide the bill of lading number, if known, the name and telephone number, mailing address, and, if available, fax number and email address of a contact person, and the location of the merchandise.
(e)

see
paragraph (c) of this section), CBP will notify, in writing, the party designated on the Notice of CBP's decision to either examine the merchandise to be exported or destroyed, or to waive examination. If CBP timely notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to examine the merchandise (
see
paragraph (f) of this section), but the merchandise
is exported or destroyed without having been presented to CBP for such examination, any drawback claim, or part thereof, based on the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback, must be denied. If CBP notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to waive examination of the merchandise, or, if timely notification of a decision by CBP to examine or to waive examination is absent, the merchandise may be exported or destroyed without delay and will be deemed to have been returned to CBP custody.
(f)
Time and place of examination.
If CBP gives timely notice of its decision to examine the merchandise to be exported or destroyed, the merchandise to be examined must be promptly presented to CBP. CBP must examine the merchandise within 5 working days after presentation of the merchandise. The merchandise may be exported or destroyed without examination if CBP fails to timely examine the merchandise after presentation to CBP, and in such case the merchandise will be deemed to have been returned to CBP custody. If the examination is to be completed at a port other than the port of actual exportation or destruction, the merchandise must be transported in-bond to the port of exportation or destruction.
(g)
Extent of examination.
The appropriate CBP office may permit release of merchandise without examination, or may examine, to the extent determined to be necessary, the items exported or destroyed.
(h)

The information to be provided will include, but is not limited to: summary document specifying the lines used and unused on the import entry; the import entry summary, corresponding commercial invoices, and copies of all drawback claims that previously designated the import entry summary; and post summary/liquidation changes (for imports or drawback claims, if applicable).
(b)
Drawback due
—(1)
Claimant required to calculate drawback.
Drawback claimants are required to correctly calculate the amount of drawback due. The amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry is generally to be 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback. (For example, if $1,000 in import duties are eligible for drawback less 1 percent ($10), the amount claimed on the drawback entry should be for $990.) Claims exceeding 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will not be paid until the calculations have been corrected by the claimant. Claims for less than 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will be paid as filed, unless the claimant amends the claim in accordance with § 190.52(c). The amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback is determined by whether a claim is based upon direct identification or substitution, as provided for below:
(i)
Direct identification.
The amounts eligible for drawback for a unit of merchandise consists of those duties, taxes, and fees that were paid for that unit of the designated imported merchandise. This may be the amount of duties, taxes, and fees actually tendered on that unit or those attributable to that unit, if identified pursuant to an approved accounting method (
see
19 CFR 190.14).
(ii)
Substitution.
The amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) or 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2) is determined by per unit averaging, as defined in § 190.2. The amount that may be refunded is also subject to the limitations set forth in § 190.22(a)(1)(ii) (manufacturing claims) and § 190.32(b) (unused merchandise claims), as applicable.
(2)
Merchandise processing fee apportionment calculation.
Where a drawback claimant requests a refund of a merchandise processing fee paid pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(9)(A), the claimant is required to correctly apportion the fee to that imported merchandise for which drawback is claimed when calculating the amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry. This is determined as follows:
(i) Relative value ratio for each line item. The value of each line item of entered merchandise subject to a merchandise processing fee is calculated (to four decimal places) by dividing the value of the line item subject to the fee by the total value of entered merchandise subject to the fee. The result is the relative value ratio.
(ii) Merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item. To apportion the merchandise processing fee to each line item, the relative value ratio for each line item is multiplied by the merchandise processing fee paid.
(iii) Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per line item. The amount of merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item is multiplied by 99 percent to calculate that portion of the fee attributable to each line item that is eligible for drawback.
(iv) Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per
unit of merchandise. To calculate the amount of a merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise, the line item amount that is eligible for drawback is divided by the number of units covered by that line item (to two decimal places).
(v) Limitation on amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback for substitution claims. The amount of a merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise for drawback claims based upon substitution is subject to the limitations set forth in §§ 190.22(a)(1)(ii) (manufacturing claims) and 190.32(b) (unused merchandise claims), as applicable.

# Example 1:
Line item 1—5,000 articles valued at $10 each total $50,000
Line item 2—6,000 articles valued at $15 each total $90,000
Line item 3—10,000 articles valued at $20 each total $200,000
Total units = 21,000
Total value = $340,000
Merchandise processing fee = $485 (for purposes of this example, the fee cap of $485 is assumed; see 19 CFR 24.23 for the current amount consistent with 19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(9)(B)(i)).
Line item relative value ratios.
The relative value ratio for line item 1 is calculated by dividing the value of that line item by the total value ($50,000 ÷ 340,000 = .1471). The relative value ratio for line item 2 is .2647. The relative value ratio for line item 3 is .5882.
Merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item.
The amount of fee attributable to each line item is calculated by multiplying $485 by the applicable relative value ratio. The amount of the $485 fee attributable to line item 1 is $71.3435 (.1471 × $485 = $71.3435). The amount of the fee attributable to line item 2 is $128.3795 (.2647 × $485 = $128.3795). The amount of the fee attributable to line item 3 is $285.2770 (.5882 × $485 = $285.2770).
Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per line item.
The amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback for line item 1 is $70.6301 (.99 × $71.3435). The amount of fee eligible for drawback for line item 2 is $127.0957 (.99 × $128.3795). The amount of fee eligible for drawback for line item 3 is $282.4242 (.99 × $285.2770).
Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise.
The amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise is calculated by dividing the amount of fee eligible for drawback for the line item by the number of units in the line item. For line item 1, the amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit is $.0141 ($70.6301 ÷ 5,000 = $.0141). If 1,000 widgets form the basis of a claim for drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j), the total amount of drawback attributable to the merchandise processing fee is $14.10 (1,000 × .0141 = $14.10). For line item 2, the amount of fee eligible for drawback per unit is $.0212 ($127.0957 ÷ 6,000 = $.0212). For line item 3, the amount of fee eligible for drawback per unit is $.0282 ($282.4242 ÷ 10,000 = $.0282).

# Example 2.
This example illustrates the treatment of dutiable merchandise that is exempt from the merchandise processing fee and duty-free merchandise that is subject to the merchandise processing fee.
Line item 1—700 meters of printed cloth valued at $10 per meter (total value $7,000) that is exempt from the merchandise processing fee under 19 U.S.C. 58c(b)(8)(B)(iii)
Line item 2—15,000 articles valued at $100 each (total value $1,500,000)
Line item 3—10,000 duty-free articles valued at $50 each (total value $500,000)
The relative value ratios are calculated using line items 2 and 3 only, as there is no merchandise processing fee imposed by reason of importation on line item 1.
Line item 2—1,500,000 ÷ 2,000,000 = .75 (line items 2 and 3 form the total value of the merchandise subject to the merchandise processing fee).
Line item 3—500,000 ÷ 2,000,000 = .25.
If the total merchandise processing fee paid was $485, the amount of the fee attributable to line item 2 is $363.75 (.75 × $485 = $363.75). The amount of the fee attributable to line item 3 is $121.25 (.25 × $485 = $121.25).
The amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback for line item 2 is $360.1125 (.99 × $363.75). The amount of fee eligible for line item 3 is $120.0375 (.99 × $121.25).
The amount of drawback on the merchandise processing fee attributable to each unit of line item 2 is $.0240 ($360.1125 ÷ 15,000 = $.0240). The amount of drawback on the merchandise processing fee attributable to each unit of line item 3 is $.0120 ($120.0375 ÷ 10,000 = $.0120).
If 1,000 units of line item 2 were exported, the drawback attributable to the merchandise processing fee is $24.00 ($.0240 × 1,000 = $24.00).
(3)
Calculations for all other duties, taxes, and fees
—(i)
General.
Where a drawback claimant requests a refund of any other duties, taxes, and fees allowable in accordance with § 190.3, the claimant is required to accurately calculate (including apportionment using
per unit averaging or inventory management methods, as appropriate) the duties, taxes, and fees attributable to the designated imported merchandise for which drawback is being claimed when calculating the amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry (generally 99% of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the imported merchandise).
(ii)
Examples.
As illustrated in the examples in this paragraph, in the case of customs duties, the type of calculation required to determine the amount of duties available for refund (generally 99% of the duties paid on the imported merchandise) will vary depending on whether the duty involved is ad valorem, specific, or compound.

# Example 1: Ad valorem duty rate.
Apportionment of the duties paid (and available for refund) will be based on the application of the duty rates to the per unit values of the imported merchandise. The per unit values are based on the invoice values unless the method of refund calculation is per unit averaging, which would require equal apportionment of the duties paid over the quantity of imported merchandise covered by the line item upon which the imported merchandise was reported on the import entry summary. As a result, the amount of duties available for refund will vary depending on the method used to calculate refunds.

# Example 2: Specific duty rate.
No apportionment of the duties paid is required to determine the amount available for refund. A fixed duty rate is applicable to each unit of the imported merchandise based on quantity. This fixed rate will not vary based on the per unit values of the imported merchandise and, as a result, there is no impact on the amount of duties available for refunds (regardless of whether the refunds are calculated based on invoice values or per unit averaging).

# Example 3: Compound duty rate.
A compound duty rate is a combination of an ad valorem duty rate and a specific duty rate, with both rates applied to the same imported merchandise. As a result, a combination of the calculations discussed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will apply when calculating the amount of duties paid that are available for refund.
(4)
Limitation.
The amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise for drawback claims based upon substituted merchandise is subject to the limitations set forth in § 190.22(a)(1)(ii) (manufacturing claims) and § 190.32(b) (unused merchandise claims), as applicable.
(c)
HTSUS classification or Schedule B commodity number
(
s)
—(1)
General.
Drawback claimants are required to provide, on all drawback claims they submit, the 10-digit HTSUS classification or the Schedule B commodity number(s), for the following:
(i)
Designated imported merchandise.
For imported merchandise designated on drawback claims, the HTSUS classification applicable at the time of entry (e.g., as required to be reported on the applicable entry summary(s) and other entry documentation).
(ii)
Substituted merchandise on manufacturing claims.
For merchandise substituted on manufacturing drawback claims, and consistent with the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or the specific manufacturing drawback ruling, the applicable HTSUS classification numbers must be the same as either—
(A) If the substituted merchandise was imported, the HTSUS classification applicable at the time of entry (e.g., as required to be reported on the applicable entry summary(s) and other entry documentation); or,
(B) If the substituted merchandise was not imported, the HTSUS classification that would have been reported to CBP for the applicable entry summary(s) and other entry documentation, for the domestically produced substituted merchandise, at the time of entry of the designated imported merchandise.
(iii)
Exported merchandise or articles.
For exported merchandise or articles, the HTSUS classification or Schedule B commodity number(s) must be from the Electronic Export Information (EEI), when required. If no EEI is required (
see,

For destroyed merchandise or articles, the HTSUS classification or Schedule B commodity number(s) must be reported, subject to the following:
(A) if the HTSUS classification is reported, then it must be the HTSUS classification that would have been applicable to the destroyed merchandise or articles if they had been entered for consumption at the time of destruction; or
(B) if the Schedule B commodity number is reported, then it must be the Schedule B commodity number that would have been reported for the destroyed merchandise or articles if the EEI had been required for an exportation at the time of destruction.
(2)
Changes to classification.
If the 10-digit HTSUS classification or the Schedule B commodity number(s) reported to CBP for the drawback claim are determined to be incorrect or otherwise in controversy after the filing of the drawback entry, then the claimant must notify the drawback office where the drawback claim was filed of the correct HTSUS classification or Schedule B commodity number or the nature of the controversy before the liquidation of the drawback entry.

If CBP determines that
the claim is complete according to the requirements of § 190.51(a)(1), but that additional evidence or information is required, CBP will notify the filer. The claimant must furnish, or have the appropriate party furnish, the evidence or information requested within 30 days of the date of notification by CBP. CBP may extend this 30-day period if the claimant files a written request for such extension within the 30-day period and provides good cause. The evidence or information required under this paragraph may be filed more than 5 years after the date of importation of the merchandise designated as the basis for the drawback claim (or within 3 years after the date of exportation of the articles upon which drawback is claimed for drawback pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(d)). Such additional evidence or information may include, but is not limited to:

# Subpart G—Exportation and Destruction
§ 190.71
Drawback on articles destroyed under CBP supervision.
(a)
Procedure.
At least 7 working days before the intended date of destruction of merchandise or articles upon which drawback is intended to be claimed, a Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on CBP Form 7553 must be filed by the claimant with the CBP port where the destruction is to take place, giving notification of the date
and specific location where the destruction is to occur. Within 4 working days after receipt of the CBP Form 7553, CBP will advise the filer in writing of its determination to witness or not to witness the destruction. If the filer of the notice is not so notified within 4 working days, the merchandise may be destroyed without delay and will be deemed to have been destroyed under CBP supervision. Unless CBP determines to witness the destruction, the destruction of the articles following timely notification on CBP Form 7553 will be deemed to have occurred under CBP supervision. If CBP attends the destruction, CBP will certify on CBP Form 7553.
(b)
Evidence of destruction.
When CBP does not attend the destruction, the claimant must submit evidence that destruction took place in accordance with the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on CBP Form 7553. The evidence must be issued by a disinterested third party (for example, a landfill operator). The type of evidence depends on the method and place of destruction, but must establish that the merchandise was, in fact, destroyed within the meaning of “destruction” in § 190.2.
(c)
Completion of drawback entry.
After destruction, the claimant must provide CBP Form 7553, certified by the CBP official witnessing the destruction in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, to CBP as part of the complete drawback claim based on the destruction (
see
§ 190.51(a)). If CBP has not attended the destruction, the claimant must provide the evidence that destruction took place in accordance with the approved CBP Form 7553, as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, as part of the complete drawback claim based on the destruction (
see
§ 190.51(a)).
(d)
Deduction for value of recovered materials.
Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(x), a destruction may include a process by which materials are recovered from imported merchandise or from an article manufactured from imported merchandise for drawback claims made pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(a), (b), (c), and (j). In determining the amount of duties to be refunded as drawback to a claimant, the value of recovered materials (including the value of any tax benefit or royalty payment) that accrues to the drawback claimant must be deducted from the value of the imported merchandise that is destroyed, or from the value of the merchandise used, or designated as used, in the manufacture of the article.
§ 190.72
Proof of exportation.
(a)
Required export data.
Proof of exportation of articles for drawback purposes must establish fully the date and fact of exportation and the identity of the exporter by providing the following summary data as part of a complete claim (

(2) Name of exporter;
(3) Description of the goods;
(4) Quantity and unit of measure;
(5) Schedule B number or HTSUS number; and
(6) Country of ultimate destination.

(2) Records from a CBP-approved electronic export system of the United States Government (§ 190.73);
(3) Official postal records (originals or copies) which evidence exportation by mail (§ 190.74);
(4) Notice of lading for supplies on certain vessels or aircraft (§ 190.112); or
(5) Notice of transfer for articles manufactured or produced in the United States which are transferred to a foreign trade zone (§ 190.183).
§ 190.73
Electronic proof of exportation.
Records kept through an electronic export system of the United States Government may be presented as actual proof of exportation only if CBP has officially approved the use of that electronic export system as proof of
compliance for drawback claims. Official approval will be published as a general notice in the Customs Bulletin.
§ 190.74
Exportation by mail.
If the merchandise on which drawback is to be claimed is exported by mail or parcel post, the official postal records (original or copies) which describe the mail shipment will be sufficient to prove exportation. The postal record must be identified on the drawback entry, and must be retained by the claimant in their records and made available to CBP upon request (
see
§ 190.51(a)).
§ 190.75
Exportation by the Government.

Drawback entries may be liquidated after:
(1) Liquidation of the designated import entry or entries becomes final pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section; or
(2) Deposit of estimated duties on the imported merchandise and before liquidation of the designated import entry or entries.
(b)
Claims based on estimated duties.
(1) Drawback may be paid upon liquidation of a claim based on estimated duties if one or more of the designated import entries have not been liquidated, or the liquidation has not become final (because of a protest being filed) (
see
also § 173.4(c) of this chapter), only if the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the payment of liquidated import duties each files a written request for payment of each drawback claim, waiving any right to payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the estimated duties on the unliquidated import entry are included in the drawback claim for which drawback on estimated duties is requested under this paragraph. The drawback claimant must, to the best of its knowledge, identify each import entry that has been protested and that is included in the drawback claim. A drawback entry, once finally liquidated on the basis of estimated duties pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, will not be adjusted by reason of a subsequent final liquidation of the import entry.
(2) However, if final liquidation of the import entry discloses that the total amount of import duty is different from the total estimated duties deposited, except in those cases when drawback is 100% of the duty, the party responsible for the payment of liquidated duties, as applicable, will:
(i) Be liable for 1 percent of all increased duties found to be due on that portion of merchandise recorded on the drawback entry; or
(ii) Be entitled to a refund of 1 percent of all excess duties found to have been paid as estimated duties on that portion of the merchandise recorded on the drawback entry.
(c)
Claims based on voluntary tenders or other payments of duties

see
§ 190.3(a)(1)(iii)), provided that:
(i) The tender or payment is specifically identified as duty on a specifically identified entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption;
(ii) Liquidation of the specifically identified entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption became final prior to such tender or payment; and
(iii) Liquidation of the drawback entry in which that specifically identified import entry, or withdrawal from
warehouse, for consumption is designated has not become final.
(2)
Written request and waiver.
Drawback may be paid on claims based on voluntary tenders or other payments of duties under this subsection only if the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the payment of the voluntary tenders or other payments of duties each files a written request for payment of each drawback claim based on such voluntary tenders or other payments of duties, waiving any claim to payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the voluntary tenders or other payment of duties under this paragraph are included in the drawback claim for which drawback on the voluntary tenders or other payment of duties is requested under this paragraph.
(d)
Claims based on liquidated duties.
Drawback will be based on the final liquidated duties paid that have been made final by operation of law (except in the case of the written request for payment of drawback on the basis of estimated duties, voluntary tender of duties, and other payments of duty, and waiver, provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section).
(e)
Liquidation procedure.
(1)
General.
When the drawback claim has been completed by the filing of the entry and other required documents, and exportation (or destruction) of the merchandise or articles has been established, CBP will determine drawback due on the basis of the complete drawback claim, the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or specific manufacturing drawback ruling, and any other relevant evidence or information. Notice of liquidation will be given electronically as provided in §§ 159.9 and 159.10(c)(3) of this chapter.

(i)
Liquidated import entries.
A drawback claim that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d) that is not liquidated within 1 year from the date of the drawback claim (
see
§ 190.51(e)(1)(i)) will be deemed liquidated for the purpose of the drawback claim at the drawback amount asserted by the claimant or claim, unless the time for liquidation is extended in accordance with § 159.12 or if liquidation is suspended as required by statute or court order.
(ii)
Unliquidated import entries.
A drawback claim that satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section will be deemed liquidated upon the deposit of estimated duties on the unliquidated imported merchandise (
see
§ 190.81(b)).
(f)
Relative value; multiple products
—(1)
Distribution.
Where two or more products result from the manufacture or production of merchandise, drawback will be distributed to the several products in accordance with their relative values at the time of separation.
(2)
Values.
The values to be used in computing the distribution of drawback where two or more products result from the manufacture or production of merchandise under drawback conditions must be the market value (as provided for in the definition of relative value in § 190.2), unless other values are approved by CBP.
(g)
Payment.
CBP will authorize the amount of the refund due as drawback to the claimant.

see
§§ 190.42(b), 190.162, 190.175(a), 190.186), the exporter (or destroyer) will be entitled to claim drawback, unless the exporter (or destroyer), by means of a certification, waives the right to claim drawback and assigns such right to the manufacturer, producer, importer, or intermediate party (in the case of drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) and (2), see § 190.33(a) and (b)). Such certification must also affirm that the exporter (or destroyer) has not assigned and will not assign the right to claim drawback on the particular exportation or destruction to any other party. The certification provided for in this section may be a blanket certification for a stated period.
§ 190.83
Person entitled to receive payment.
Drawback is paid to the claimant (
see
§ 190.82).
§ 190.84
Protests.
Procedures to protest the denial, in whole or in part, of a drawback entry must be in accordance with part 174 of this chapter (19 CFR part 174).

(2)
Effective date for claimants with existing approval.
For claimants approved for waiver of prior notice before February 24, 2019, and under 19 CFR part 191, such approval of waiver of prior notice will remain in effect, but only if the claimant provides the following certification as part of each complete claim filed on or after that date, pursuant to § 190.51(a)(2)(xvi): “The undersigned acknowledges the current statutory requirements under 19 U.S.C. 1313 and the regulatory requirements in 19 CFR part 190, and hereby certifies continuing eligibility for the waiver of prior notice (granted prior to February 24, 2019) in compliance therewith.” This certification may only be made for waiver of prior notice for the specific type of drawback claim for which the application was previously approved under 19 CFR 191, except that applications approved under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) will also be applicable to claims for the same type of merchandise if made under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2).
(3)
Limited successorship for waiver of prior notice.
When a claimant (predecessor) is approved for waiver of prior notice under this section and all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties and liabilities of the claimant are transferred by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution to a successor, such approval of waiver of prior notice will remain in effect for a period of 1 year after such transfer. The approval of waiver of prior notice will terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the successor applies for waiver of prior notice under this section. If such successor applies for waiver of prior notice under this section within such 1-year period, the successor may continue to operate under the predecessor's waiver of prior notice until CBP approves or denies the successor's application for waiver of prior notice under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (

Scope.
Accelerated payment of drawback is available under this section on drawback claims under this part, unless specifically excepted from such accelerated payment. Accelerated payment of drawback consists of the payment of estimated drawback before liquidation of the drawback entry. Accelerated payment of drawback is only available when CBP's review of the request for accelerated payment of drawback does not find omissions from, or inconsistencies with
the requirements of the drawback law and part 190 (
see,
especially, subpart E of this part). Accelerated payment of a drawback claim does not constitute liquidation of the drawback entry.
(2)
Effective date for claimants with existing approval.
For claimants approved for accelerated payment of drawback before February 24, 2019, and under 19 CFR part 191, such approval of accelerated payment will remain in effect, but only if the claimant provides the following certification as part of each complete claim filed after that date, pursuant to § 190.51(a)(2)(xvi): “The undersigned acknowledges the current statutory requirements under 19 U.S.C. 1313 and the regulatory requirements in 19 CFR part 190, and hereby certifies continuing eligibility for accelerated payment (granted prior to February 24, 2019) in compliance therewith.” This certification may only be made for accelerated payment for the specific type of drawback claim for which the application was previously approved under 19 CFR 191, except that applications approved under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) will also be applicable to claims for the same type of merchandise if made under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2).

When a claimant (predecessor) is approved for accelerated payment of drawback under this section and all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties and liabilities of the claimant are transferred by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution to a successor, such approval of accelerated payment will remain in effect for a period of 1 year after such transfer. The approval of accelerated payment of drawback will terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section. If such successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section within such 1-year period, the successor may continue to operate under the predecessor's approval of accelerated payment until CBP approves or denies the successor's application for accelerated payment under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (

General.
A party may be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program after meeting the core requirements established under the program, or after negotiating an alternative drawback compliance program suited to the needs of both the party and CBP. Certification requirements will take into account the size and nature of the party's drawback program, the type of drawback claims filed, and the volume of claims filed. Whether the party is a drawback claimant, a broker, or one that provides data and documentation on which a drawback claim is based, will also be considered.
(b)
Core requirements of program.
In order to be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program or negotiated alternative drawback compliance program, the party must demonstrate that it:

The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (
see
§ 190.9).

# E. Process of Manufacture or Production
Heated crude oil is charged to an atmospheric distillation tower where it is subjected to fractionation. The charge to the distillation tower consists of a single crude oil, or of commingled crudes which are fed to the tower simultaneously or after blending in a tank. During fractionation, components of different boiling ranges are separated.

# F. Multiple Products

# 1. Relative Values
Fractionation results in 17 products. In order to insure proper distribution of drawback to each of these products, the manufacturer or producer agrees to record the relative values at the time of separation. The entire period covered by an abstract is to be treated as the time of separation. The value per unit of each product will be the average market value for the abstract period.

# 2. Producibility
The manufacturer or producer can vary the proportionate quantity of each product. The manufacturer or producer understands that drawback is payable on exported products only to the extent that these products could have been produced from the designated merchandise. The records of the manufacturer or producer must show that all of the products exported, for which drawback will be claimed under this general manufacturing drawback ruling could, have been produced concurrently on a practical operating basis from the designated merchandise.
The manufacturer or producer agrees to establish the amount to be designated by reference to the Industry Standards of Potential Production published in T.D. 66-16.
2
2
A manufacturer who proposes to use standards other than those in T.D. 66-16 must state the proposed standards and provide sufficient information to CBP in order for those proposed standards to be verified in accordance with T.D. 84-49.
There are no valuable wastes as a result of the processing.

# G. Loss or Gain
Because the manufacturer or producer keeps records on a volume basis rather than a weight basis, it is anticipated that the material balance will show a volume gain. For the same reason, it is possible that occasionally the material balance will show a volume loss. Fluctuations in type of crude used, together with the type of finished product desired make an estimate of an average volume gain meaningless. However, records will be kept to show the amount of loss or gain with respect to the production of export products.

# H. Exchange
The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the Parallel Columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise.

# I. Procedures and Records Maintained
Records, which may include records kept in the normal course of business, will be maintained to establish:
1. The identity, and 8-digit HTSUS classification of the merchandise designated;
2. The quantity of merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS classification as the designated merchandise used to produce the exported articles.
3. That, within 5 years after importation, the manufacturer or producer used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 5-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced the exported articles.
4(a). The manufacturer or producer agrees to use a 28-31 day period (monthly) abstract period for each refinery covered by this general manufacturing drawback ruling, or
(b). The manufacturer or producer agrees to use an abstract period (not to exceed 1 year) for each refinery covered by this general manufacturing drawback ruling. The manufacturer or producer certifies that if it were to file abstracts covering each manufacturing period, of not less than 28 days and not more than 31 days (monthly) within the longer period, in no such monthly abstract would the quantity of designated merchandise exceed the material introduced into the manufacturing process during that monthly period. (Select (a) or (b), and state which is selected in the application, and, if (b) is selected, specify the length of the particular abstract period chosen (not to exceed 1 year (
see
General Instruction I.A.7.)).)
5. On each abstract of production the manufacturer or producer agrees to show the value per barrel to five decimal places.
6. The manufacturer or producer agrees to file claims in the format set forth in exhibits A through F which are attached to this general manufacturing drawback ruling. The manufacturer or producer realizes that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. It is understood that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance. Records will be kept in accordance with T.D. 84-49, as amended by T.D. 95-61.

# J. Residual Rights
It is understood that the refiner can reserve as the basis for future payment the right to drawback only on the number of barrels of raw material computed by subtracting from Line E the larger of Lines A or B, of a given Exhibit E. It is further understood that this right to future payment can be claimed only against products concurrently producible with the products listed in Column 21, in the quantities shown in Column 22 of such Exhibit E. Such residual right can be transferred to another refinery of the same refiner only when Line B of Exhibit E is larger than Line A. Unless the number of residual barrels is specifically computed, and rights thereto are expressly reserved on Exhibit E, such residual rights will be deemed waived. The procedure the manufacturer or producer must follow in preparing drawback entries claiming this residual right is illustrated in the attached sample Exhibit E-1. It is understood that claims involving residual rights must be
filed only at the port where the Exhibit E reserving such right was filed.

# K. Inventory Procedures
The manufacturer or producer realizes that inventory control is of major importance. In accordance with the normal accounting procedures of the manufacturer or producer, each refinery prepares a monthly stock and yield report, which accounts for inventories, production, and disposals, from time of receipt to time of disposition. This provides an audit trail of all products.
The above-noted records will provide the required audit trail from the initial source documents to the drawback claims of the manufacturer or producer and will support adherence with the requirements discussed under the heading Procedures and Records Maintained.

# L. Basis of Claim for Drawback
