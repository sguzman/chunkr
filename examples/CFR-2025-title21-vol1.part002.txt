(a) If a certificate is obtained through fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact, such certificate shall not be effective, and a color additive from the batch on which such certificate was issued shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with the regulations in this part. Whenever, the Commissioner learns that any certificate has been obtained through fraud or material misrepresentation, he shall notify the holder of the certificate that it is of no effect.
(b) If between the time a sample of color additive accompanying a request for certification is taken and the time a certificate covering the batch of such color additive is received by the person to whom it is issued, any such color additive becomes changed in composition, such certificates shall not be effective with respect to such changed color additive and such changed color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with the regulations in this part.
(c) If at any time after a certificate is received by the person to whom it is issued any color additive from the batch covered by such certificate becomes changed in composition, such certificate shall expire with respect to such changed color additive. After such expiration, such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with this part; except that such color additive shall not be so considered when
used for coloring a food, drug, or cosmetic, or for the purpose of certifying a batch of a mixture in which such color additive was used as an ingredient, or for use in preparing a batch of a mixture for which exemption from certification has been authorized, if such change resulted solely from such use.
(d) A certificate shall expire with respect to any color additive covered thereby if the package in which such color additive was closed for shipment or delivery is opened. After such expiration such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified, except that such color additive shall not be so considered when the package is opened;
(1) and such color additive is used, subject to the restrictions prescribed by paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section, in coloring a food, drug, or cosmetic;
(2) for the purpose of certifying a batch made by repacking such color;
(3) for the purpose of certifying a batch of a mixture in which such color is used as an ingredient; or
(4) for the purpose of preparing a batch of a mixture for which exemption from certification has been authorized; or
(5) when the package is reopened solely for repackaging by the person to whom such certificate was issued.
(e) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if such package is shipped or delivered under a label which does not bear all words, statements, and other information required by § 70.25 of this chapter to appear thereon.
(f) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive, and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if:
(1) Such package has not been sealed in accordance with § 70.20 of this chapter.
(2) Such package has been sealed in accordance with § 70.20 of this chapter and the seal has been broken, intentionally or accidentally, unless such seal has been broken for the purpose of using color additive in accordance with § 80.38, or, such package has been opened by a duly authorized representative of the Administration or Department in the performance of his official duties, and he has immediately resealed the package in conformance with § 70.20 of this chapter.
(g) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if such color additive is used in any manner other than that for which it was certified.
(h) When the listing or the specifications for a color additive are revoked or amended, the final order effecting the revocation or amendment may specify, in addition to its own effective date, a date on which all certificates for existing batches and portions of batches of such a color additive theretofore issued under such revoked or amended regulations shall cease to be effective; and any such lots of the color additive shall be regarded as uncertified after the date specified unless a new certificate can be and is obtained in conformance with the new regulations. When a certificate thus ceases to be effective for a color additive, any certificates previously issued for a color additive mixture containing that color additive shall cease to be effective on the same date. Use of such color additive or color additive mixture after such specified date without the new certificate in preparing foods, drugs, or cosmetics will result in such food, drugs, or cosmetics being adulterated. When a certified color additive has been used in food, drugs, or cosmetics and the status of the color additive is thereafter changed by amendment or revocation of its listing or specification regulations, such food, drugs, and cosmetics will not be regarded as adulterated by reason of the use of such color additive, unless the hazard to health is such that existing stocks of the foods, drugs, or cosmetics cannot be safely used, in which cases findings to that effect will be made and regulations appropriate for such special cases will be issued.
§ 80.34
Authority to refuse certification service.
(a) When it appears to the Commissioner that a person has:
(1) Obtained, or attempted to obtain, a certificate through fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact.
(2) Falsified the records required to be kept by § 80.39; or
(3) Failed to keep such records, or to make them available, or to accord full opportunity to make inventory of stocks on hand or otherwise to check the correctness of such records, as required by § 80.39; or
(4) Refused to permit duly authorized employees of the Food and Drug Administration free access to all manufacturing facilities, processes, and formulae involved in the manufacture of color additives and intermediates from which such color additives are derived; he may immediately suspend certification service to such person and may continue such suspension until adequate corrective action has been taken.
(b) Any person who contests suspension of service shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of this chapter.
§ 80.35
Color additive mixtures; certification and exemption from certification.
(a)
Color additive mixtures to be certified.
Any color additive mixture that contains one or more straight colors listed in part 74 of this chapter, together with any diluents listed in such subparts for use with such straight colors, shall be certified if intended for use in foods, drugs, or cosmetics, or in coloring the human body, as the case may be, subject to any restriction prescribed in parts 70 and 71 of this chapter.
(b)
Color additive mixtures exempted from certification.
A color additive mixture prepared from a previously certified batch of one or more straight colors, with or without any diluent that has been listed in part 73 of this chapter for use in mixtures, shall be exempt from batch certification if the straight color used has not changed in composition in any manner whatsoever since its certification and if it is simply mixed with the approved diluents for exempt mixtures. The label of such color additive mixtures shall not bear the lot number assigned by the Food and Drug Administration to the certified straight color components, but shall bear the manufacturer's control number through which the history of the straight color can be determined.
(c)
Additions to the list of diluents.
A person requesting additions to the list of diluents authorized for the purposes described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall submit a petition in accordance with the provisions of § 71.1 of this chapter. Each such petition shall be accompanied by the fee prescribed in § 70.19 of this chapter, unless there is an advance deposit to be used for prepayment of such fees.

# Note:
The provisions of § 80.35 with respect only to diluents for use in cosmetic color additive mixtures were stayed, until a regulation is effected listing safe diluents for cosmetic use, including cosmetics which color the human body, 29 FR 18495, Dec. 29, 1964.
§ 80.37
Treatment of batch pending certification.
Immediately after the sample that is to accompany a request for certification of a batch of color additive is taken, the batch shall be:
(a) Stored in containers of such kind as to prevent change in composition.
(b) Held under the control of the person requesting certification until certified.
(c) Marked, by labeling or otherwise, in a manner such that there can be no question as to the identity of the batch and no question that it is not to be used until the requested certificate has been issued.
§ 80.38
Treatment of batch after certification.
(a) Immediately upon notification that a batch of color additive has been certified, the person requesting certification thereof shall identify such batch, by labeling, with the certified lot number.
(b) The person requesting certification shall maintain storage in such manner as to prevent change in composition until such batch has been packaged and labeled as required by §§ 70.20 and 70.25 of this chapter, except
that the person requesting certification may use such color additive for the purpose of coloring a food, drug, or cosmetic.
§ 80.39
Records of distribution.
(a) The person to whom a certificate is issued shall keep complete records showing the disposal of all the color additive from the batch covered by such certificate.

§ 81.1
Provisional lists of color additives.
The Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds that the following lists of color additives are provisionally listed under section 203(b) of the Color Additive Amendments of 1960 (sec. 203(b), 74 Stat. 405 (21 U.S.C. 379e note)). Except for color additives for which petitions have been filed, progress reports are required by January 1, 1968, and at 6-month intervals thereafter. Specifications for color additives listed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section appear in the respective designated sections. The listing of color additives in this section is not to be construed as a listing for surgical suture use unless color additive petitions have been submitted for such use or the Commissioner has been notified of studies underway to establish the safety of the color additive for such use. The color additives listed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section may not be used in products which are intended to be used in the area of the eye. The color additives listed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section are provisionally listed until the closing dates set forth therein.

§ 81.10
Termination of provisional listings of color additives.
(a)
Ext. D
C Yellow Nos. 9 and 10.
These colors cannot be produced with any assurance that they do not contain β-naphthylamine as an impurity. While it has been asserted that the two colors can be produced without the impurity named, no method of analysis has been suggested to establish the fact. β-Naphthylamine is a known carcinogen; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in products to be used in contact with the skin. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, having concluded that such action is necessary to protect the public health, hereby terminated the provisional listing of Ext. D
C Yellow No. 9 and Ext. D
C Yellow No. 10.
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
FD
C Red No. 1.
Results of recent feeding tests of this color additive have demonstrated it to be toxic upon ingestion:
(1) Groups of 50 rats are being fed diets containing FD
C Red No. 1 at levels of 5 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.5 percent, and 0 percent. At this stage of the tests, which have now been in progress for from 15 months to 18 months, 116 animals from the 250 being fed FD
C Red No. 1 at various levels and 27 of the 100 controls have died. Of these, 11 being fed at the 5 percent level, 16 being fed at the 2 percent level, 11 being fed at the 1 percent level, and 2 being fed at the 0.5 percent level, have shown liver damage. None of the controls that have died have shown liver damage.
(2) Groups of 100 mice are being fed diets containing 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.5 percent, and 0.1 percent FD
C Red No. 1, with 400 mice as controls. All mice on dosage levels of 2 percent and 1 percent died before the seventieth week. Gross liver damage has been observed in all groups fed at the 0.5 percent diet and above.
(3) Groups of 4 dogs are being fed diets containing 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.25 percent, and 0 percent FD
C Red No. 1. Three of the dogs on the 2 percent dosage level died before 32 weeks; the other is living. Three of the dogs on the 1 percent dosage level died or were sacrificed within 13 months. All deceased or sacrificed dogs have shown liver damage grossly and/or microscopically. Deceased dogs on the 1 percent and 2 percent dosage level showed poor physical condition.
The Commissioner of Food and Drugs having concluded that ingestion of this color additive over a long period of time would be unsafe, and in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD
C Red No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.
(d)
FD
C Red No. 4.
Feeding tests of this color additive have been conducted with three species:
(1) Rats of the Osborne-Mendel and Sprague-Dawley strains were fed FD
C Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 5 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, and 0.5 percent of the diet. No effect was found.
(2) Mice of the C3Hf and C57BL strains were fed FD
C Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 2 percent and 1 percent of the diet. No effect was found.
(3) Dogs were fed FD
C Red No. 4 at levels of 2 percent and 1 percent of the diet. Adverse effects were found at both levels in the urinary bladder and in the adrenals. Three dogs of five fed on the 2-percent level died after 6 months, 9 months, and 5
1/2
years on the test. Two of the dogs on the 2-percent level and all five of the dogs on the 1-percent level survived to the completion of the 7 year study.
The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that available data do not permit the establishment of a safe level of use of this color additive in food, ingested drugs and ingested cosmetics. In order to protect the public health, the Commissioner hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD
C Red No. 4 for use in food and ingested drugs. The Commissioner has previously terminated the provisional listing of FD
C Red No. 4 for use in ingested cosmetics. FD
C Red No. 4 is listed for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics by §§ 74.1304 and 74.2304 of this chapter, respectively. Section 82.304 of this chapter is retained in part 82 of this chapter to permit the use of lakes of FD
C Red No.
4 in externally applied drugs and cosmetics.
(e)
FD
C Violet No. 1.
The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD
C Violet No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.
(f)
FD
C Red No. 2.
The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD
C Red No. 2 for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics.
(g)
Carbon black
(
prepared by the “impingement” or “channel” process
). The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of carbon black (prepared by the
impingement
or
channel
process) for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics.
(h)
D
C Red Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13.
The petition for these color additives was withdrawn so that there no longer exists a basis for their continued provisional listing. In addition, the Commissioner has learned of the possible contamination of D
C Red No. 10, D
C Red No. 11, D
C Red No. 12, and D
C Red No. 13 with β-naphthyl-amine. The Commissioner concludes that these colors cannot be produced with any reasonable assurance that they will not contain β-naphthylamine as an impurity or not yield β-naphthylamine from the metabolism of subsidiary colors present in them. β-Naphthylamine is a known carcinogen; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, upon withdrawal of the petition for their use and in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of D
C Red No. 10, D
C Red No. 11, D
C Red No. 12, and D
C Red No. 13 for use in drugs and cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977.
(i)
Ext. D
C Yellow No. 1.
The Commissioner has learned of the contamination of Ext. D
C Yellow No. 1 with 4-aminobiphenyl. The Commissioner concludes that this color cannot be produced with any reasonable assurance that it will not contain 4-aminobiphenyl as an impurity or not yield benzidine from the decomposition of a subsidiary reaction product that might be present in the color. 4-Aminobiphenyl and benzidine are known carcinogens; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in drugs or cosmetics. In addition, insufficient data have been submitted to permit establishment of appropriate specifications for the batch certification of the color. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of Ext. D
C Yellow No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977.
(j)
Graphite.
Data have been developed that show the contamination of graphite with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNA's). There is no reasonable assurance this color can be produced so that it will not contain PNA's as an impurity. The presence of certain PNA's in graphite would indicate that PNA's known to be carcinogenic to animals and humans may also be present. Therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for this color in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of graphite for use in externally applied cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977.
(k)
Ext. D
C Green No. 1.
The Commissioner concludes that there are inadequate analytical methods to permit certification of the color additive Ext. D
C Green No. 1. In addition, the Commissioner has found that there was a failure to comply with the conditions attached to the postponement of the closing date in accordance with section 203(a)(2) of the transitional provisions of the Color Additive Amendments of 1960. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional listing of Ext. D
C Green No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977.
(l) [Reserved]
(m)
D
C Orange Nos. 10 and 11.
In the absense of a petition to list D
C Orange No. 10 and D
C Orange No. 11 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, there no longer exists a basis for provisional listing for such uses. Therefore, FDA is terminating the provisional
listing of D
C Orange No. 10 and D
C Orange No. 11 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, effective April 28, 1981.
(n)
D
C Blue No. 6.
The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, having concluded that unresolved questions remain concerning the chemistry of unidentified minor components, hereby terminates the provisional listing of D
C Blue No. 6 for use in drugs and cosmetics.
(o)
D
C Green No. 6.
In the absence of a petition to list D
C Green No. 6 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, there no longer exists a basis for provisional listing for such uses. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional listing of D
C Green No. 6 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, effective March 27, 1981.
(p) [Reserved]
(q)(1)
D
C Red No. 19 and D
C Red No. 37.
Having concluded that, when ingested, D
C Red No. 19 causes cancer in rats and mice, the agency hereby terminates the provisional listings of D
C Red No. 19 and chemically related D
C Red No. 37 for use in ingested drugs and ingested cosmetics, effective February 4, 1983.
(2)
D
C Red No. 37.
In the absence of a petition to list D
C Red No. 37 for external uses, there no longer exists a basis for provisional listing for such uses. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional listings of D
C Red No. 37 for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective June 6, 1986.
(r) [Reserved]
(s)
D
C Orange No. 17.
Having concluded that, when ingested, D
C Orange No. 17 causes cancer in rats and mice, the agency has terminated the provisional listing of D
C Orange No. 17 for use in ingested drugs and ingested cosmetics, effective March 31, 1983.
(t)
D
C Red No. 8 and D
C Red No. 9.
In the absence of a petition to list D
C Red No. 8 and D
C Red No. 9 for mouthwash, dentifrices, and ingested drugs, except ingested drug lip products, there no longer exists a basis for provisional listing for such uses. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional listings of D
C Red No. 8 and D
C Red No. 9 for use in mouthwash, dentifrices, and ingested drugs, except ingested drug lip products, effective January 6, 1987.
(u)
FD
C Red No. 3.
Having concluded that FD
C Red No. 3 causes cancer in rats, the agency hereby terminates the provisional listing of FD
C Red No. 3 for use in cosmetics and externally applied drugs and the provisional listing of the lakes of FD
C Red No. 3 for use in food, drug, and cosmetic products, effective January 29, 1990.

(5) Not be derived from clinical research conducted by another manufacturer unless the manufacturer disseminating the information has the permission of such other manufacturer to make the dissemination.
(b) For purposes of this part:
(1) FDA will find that all journal articles and reference publications (as those terms are defined in § 99.3) are scientifically sound except:
(i) Letters to the editor;
(ii) Abstracts of a publication;
(iii) Those regarding Phase 1 trials in healthy people;
(iv) Flagged reference publications that contain little or no substantive discussion of the relevant clinical investigation; and
(v) Those regarding observations in four or fewer people that do not reflect any systematic attempt to collect data, unless the manufacturer demonstrates to FDA that such reports could help guide a physician in his/her medical practice.
(2) A reprint or copy of an article or reference publication is “unabridged” only if it retains the same appearance, form, format, content, or configuration as the original article or publication. Such reprint, copy of an article, or reference publication shall not be disseminated with any information that is promotional in nature. A manufacturer may cite a particular discussion about a new use in a reference publication in the explanatory or other information attached to or otherwise accompanying the reference publication under § 99.103.
§ 99.103
Mandatory statements and information.
(a) Any information disseminated under this part shall include:
(1) A prominently displayed statement disclosing:
(i) For a drug, “This information concerns a use that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.” For devices, the statement shall read, “This information concerns a use that has not been approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.” If the information to be disseminated includes both an approved and unapproved use or uses or a cleared and uncleared use or uses, the manufacturer shall modify the statement to identify the unapproved or uncleared new use or uses. The manufacturer shall permanently affix the statement to the front of each reprint or copy of an article from a scientific or medical journal and to the front of each reference publication disseminated under this part;
(ii) If applicable, the information is being disseminated at the expense of the manufacturer;
(iii) If applicable, the names of any authors of the information who were employees of, or consultants to, or received compensation from the manufacturer, or who had a significant financial interest in the manufacturer during the time that the study that is the subject of the dissemination was conducted up through 1 year after the time the article/reference publication was written and published;
(iv) If applicable, a statement that there are products or treatments that have been approved or cleared for the use that is the subject of the information being disseminated; and
(v) The identification of any person that has provided funding for the conduct of a study relating to the new use of a drug or device for which such information is being disseminated; and
(2) The official labeling for the drug or device;
(3) A bibliography of other articles (that concern reports of clinical investigations both supporting and not supporting the new use) from a scientific reference publication or scientific or medical journal that have been previously published about the new use of the drug or device covered by the information that is being disseminated, unless the disseminated information already includes such a bibliography; and
(4) Any additional information required by FDA under § 99.301(a)(2). Such information shall be attached to the front of the disseminated information or, if attached to the back of the disseminated information, its presence shall be made known to the reader by a sticker or notation on the front of the disseminated information and may consist of:
(i) Objective and scientifically sound information pertaining to the safety or effectiveness of the new use of the drug or device and which FDA determines is
necessary to provide objectivity and balance. This may include information that the manufacturer has submitted to FDA or, where appropriate, a summary of such information and any other information that can be made publicly available; and
(ii) An objective statement prepared by FDA, based on data or other scientifically sound information, bearing on the safety or effectiveness of the new use of the drug or device.
(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(4) of this section, the statements, bibliography, and other information required by this section shall be attached to such disseminated information.
(c) For purposes of this section, factors to be considered in determining whether a statement is “prominently displayed” may include, but are not limited to, type size, font, layout, contrast, graphic design, headlines, spacing, and any other technique to achieve emphasis or notice. The required statements shall be outlined, boxed, highlighted, or otherwise graphically designed and presented in a manner that achieves emphasis or notice and is distinct from the other information being disseminated.
§ 99.105
Recipients of information.
A manufacturer disseminating information on a new use under this part may only disseminate that information to a health care practitioner, a pharmacy benefit manager, a health insurance issuer, a group health plan, or a Federal or State Government agency.

[63 FR 64581, Nov. 20, 1998, as amended at 70 FR 14980, Mar. 24, 2005; 80 FR 18090, Apr. 3, 2015]
§ 99.203
Request to extend the time for completing planned studies.
(a) A manufacturer may request, prior to or at the time of making a submission to FDA under § 99.201, that FDA extend the 36-month time period for completing the studies and submitting a supplemental application for the new use that is the subject of the information to be disseminated. Such request must set forth the reasons that such studies cannot be completed and
submitted in a supplemental application within 36 months.
(b) A manufacturer who has certified that it will complete the studies necessary to submit a supplemental application for a new use within a specified period of time from the date that dissemination of information under this part can begin under § 99.201(a)(4)(ii), but later finds that it will be unable to complete such studies and submit a supplemental application within that time period may request an extension of time from FDA. The manufacturer, in its request for extension, shall identify the product, the new use, and shall:
(1) Describe the study or studies that cannot be completed on time and explain why the study or studies cannot be completed on time;
(2) Describe the current status of the incomplete study or studies and summarize the work conducted, including the dates on which principal events concerning the study or studies occurred; and
(3) Estimate the additional time needed to complete the studies and submit a supplemental application. The requested extension shall not exceed an additional 24 months.
(c) The manufacturer shall send three copies of the request for extension to the same FDA office that received the manufacturer's initial submission and certification statement. The outside of the envelope shall be marked as “Request for Time Extension—Dissemination of Information on an Unapproved Use.”
§ 99.205
Application for exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application.
(a) In certain circumstances, described in paragraph (b) of this section, a manufacturer may submit an application for an exemption from the requirement to submit a supplemental application for a new use for purposes of disseminating information on that use.
(b) The manufacturer's application for an exemption shall identify the basis for the proposed exemption and shall include materials demonstrating that it would be economically prohibitive or that it would be unethical to conduct the studies necessary to submit a supplemental application for the new use.
(1) If the basis for the manufacturer's application for exemption is that it would be economically prohibitive to incur the costs necessary to submit a supplemental application for a new use, the manufacturer shall, at a minimum, provide:
(i) Evidence explaining why existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated, are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use. Such evidence shall include an analysis of all data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the use, a summary of those data, and any documentation resulting from prior discussions with the agency concerning the adequacy of the existing data; and
(ii) Evidence demonstrating that the cost of the study or studies for the new use reasonably exceeds the expected revenue from the new use minus the costs of goods sold and marketing and administrative expenses attributable to the new use of the product. Such evidence shall include:
(A) A description of the additional studies that the manufacturer believes are necessary to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, including documentation from prior discussions, if any, with the agency concerning the studies that would be needed, and an estimate of the projected costs for such studies;
(B) The expected patient population for the new use;
(C) The expected revenue for the new use, including an explanation of the price at which the drug or device will be sold;
(D) Any exclusivity for the drug or device for the new use; and
(E) Any other information that the manufacturer has showing that conducting the studies on the new use would be economically prohibitive; and
(iii) An attestation by a responsible individual of the manufacturer or an individual acting on the manufacturer's behalf verifying that the estimates included with the submission are accurate and were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
procedures. The data underlying and supporting the estimates shall be made available to FDA upon request. Alternatively, a manufacturer may submit a report of an independent certified public accountant in accordance with the Statement of Standards for Attestation established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and agreed upon procedures performed with respect to the estimates submitted under this section.
(2) If the basis for the manufacturer's application for exemption is that it would be unethical to conduct the studies necessary for the supplemental application for a new use, the manufacturer shall provide evidence:
(i) Explaining why existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated, are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use. Such evidence shall include an analysis of all data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the new use, a summary of those data, and any documentation resulting from prior discussions with the agency concerning the adequacy of the existing data; and
(ii) Explaining why it would be unethical to conduct the further studies that would be necessary for the approval of the new use. Such evidence shall establish that, notwithstanding the insufficiency of available data to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, the data are persuasive to the extent that withholding the drug or device in a controlled study (e.g., by providing no therapy, a placebo, an alternative therapy, or an alternative dose) would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to human subjects. In assessing the appropriateness of conducting studies to support the new use, the manufacturer may provide evidence showing that the new use is broadly accepted as current standard medical treatment or therapy. The manufacturer shall also address the possibility of conducting studies in different populations or of modified design (e.g., adding the new therapy to existing treatments or using an alternative dose if monotherapy studies could not be conducted).

# Subpart D—FDA Action on Submissions, Requests, and Applications
§ 99.301
Agency action on a submission.
(a)
Submissions.
Within 60 days after receiving a submission under this part, FDA may:
(1) Determine that the manufacturer does not comply with the requirements under this part and that, as a result, the manufacturer shall not disseminate any information under this part;
(2) After providing the manufacturer notice and an opportunity for a meeting, determine that the information submitted regarding a new use fails to provide data, analyses, or other written matter that is objective and balanced and:
(i) Require the manufacturer to disseminate additional information, including information that the manufacturer has submitted to FDA or, where appropriate, a summary of such information or any other information that can be made publicly available, which, in the agency's opinion:
(A) Is objective and scientifically sound;
(B) Pertains to the safety or effectiveness of the new use; and
(C) Is necessary to provide objectivity and balance; and
(ii) Require the manufacturer to disseminate an objective statement prepared by FDA that is based on data or other scientifically sound information available to the agency and bears on the safety or effectiveness of the drug or device for the new use; and
(3) Require the manufacturer to maintain records that will identify individual recipients of the information that is to be disseminated when such individual records are warranted due to special safety considerations associated with the new use.
(b)
Protocols/Studies.
Within 60 days after receiving a submission under this part, FDA shall:
(1) If the manufacturer has planned studies that will be needed for the submission of a supplemental application
for the new use, review the manufacturer's proposed protocols and schedule for completing such studies and determine whether the proposed protocols are adequate and whether the proposed schedule for completing the studies is reasonable. FDA shall notify the manufacturer of its determination; or
(2) If the manufacturer has completed studies that the manufacturer believes would be an adequate basis for the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, conduct a review of the protocols submitted for such studies to determine whether they are adequate. FDA shall notify the manufacturer of its determination.
§ 99.303
Extension of time for completing planned studies.
(a) Upon review of a drug or device manufacturer's proposed protocols and schedules for conducting studies needed for the submission of a supplemental application for a new use, FDA may, with or without a request for an extension from the manufacturer, determine that such studies cannot be completed and submitted within 36 months. The agency may exercise its discretion in extending the time period for completing the studies and submitting a supplemental application. Extensions under this paragraph are not subject to any time limit, but shall be made before the manufacturer begins the studies needed for the submission of a supplemental application for the new use.
(b) The manufacturer may, after beginning the studies needed for the submission of a supplemental application for a new use, request in writing that FDA extend the time period for conducting studies needed for the submission of a supplemental application for a new use and submitting a supplemental application to FDA. FDA may grant or deny the request or, after consulting the manufacturer, grant an extension different from that requested by the manufacturer. FDA may grant a manufacturer's request for an extension if FDA determines that the manufacturer has acted with due diligence to conduct the studies needed for the submission of a supplemental application for a new use and to submit such a supplemental application to FDA in a timely manner and that, despite such actions, the manufacturer needs additional time to complete the studies and submit the supplemental application. Extensions under this paragraph shall not exceed 24 months.
(c) If FDA extends the time period for completing the studies and submitting a supplemental application under paragraph (a) of this section after the manufacturer has submitted a certification under § 99.201(a)(4)(ii)(B), or if FDA grants a manufacturer's request for an extension under paragraph (b) of this section, the manufacturer shall submit a new certification under § 99.201(a)(4)(ii)(B) that sets forth the timeframe within which clinical studies will be completed and a supplemental application will be submitted to FDA.
§ 99.305
Exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application.
(a) Within 60 days after receipt of an application for an exemption from the requirement of a supplemental application, FDA shall approve or deny the application.
(1) If FDA does not act on the application for an exemption within the 60-day period, the application for an exemption shall be deemed to be approved.
(2) If an application for an exemption is deemed to be approved, FDA may, at any time, terminate such approval if it determines that the requirements for granting an exemption have not been met. FDA shall notify the manufacturer if the approval is terminated.
(b) In reviewing an application for an exemption, FDA shall consider the materials submitted by the manufacturer and may consider any other appropriate information, including, but not limited to, any pending or previously approved applications for exemption submitted by the manufacturer.
(c) FDA may grant an application for an exemption if FDA determines that:
(1) It would be economically prohibitive for the manufacturer to incur the costs necessary to submit a supplemental application for a new use, which at a minimum requires:
(i) That existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the
study described in the information to be disseminated are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use; and
(ii) That the cost of the study or studies for the new use reasonably exceeds the expected revenue from the new use minus the cost of goods sold and marketing and administrative expenses attributable to the new use of the product, and there are not less expensive ways to obtain the needed information; or
(2) It would be unethical to conduct clinical studies needed to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use because:
(i) Existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use; and
(ii) Although available evidence would not support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, the data are persuasive to the extent that withholding the drug or device in a controlled study would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to human subjects and no studies in different populations or of modified design can be utilized. In determining whether it would be unethical to conduct clinical studies, the agency shall consider, in addition to the persuasiveness of available evidence of effectiveness, whether the new use of the drug or device is broadly accepted as current standard medical treatment or therapy.

# Subpart E—Corrective Actions and Cessation of Dissemination
§ 99.401
Corrective actions and cessation of dissemination of information.
(a)
FDA actions based on post dissemination data.
If FDA receives data after a manufacturer has begun disseminating information on a new use and, based on that data, determines that the new use that is the subject of information disseminated under this part may not be effective or may present a significant risk to public health, FDA shall consult the manufacturer and, after such consultation, take appropriate action to protect the public health. Such action may include ordering the manufacturer to cease disseminating information on the new use and to take appropriate corrective action.
(b)
FDA actions based on information disseminated by a manufacturer.
If FDA determines that a manufacturer is disseminating information that does not comply with the requirements under this part, FDA may:
(1) Provide to the manufacturer an opportunity to bring itself into compliance with the requirements under this part if the manufacturer's noncompliance constitutes a minor violation of these requirements; or
(2) Order the manufacturer to cease dissemination of information and to take corrective action. FDA shall issue such an order only after it has:
(i) Provided notice to the manufacturer regarding FDA's intent to issue an order to cease dissemination; and
(ii) Provided to the manufacturer an opportunity for a meeting. FDA need not provide an opportunity for a meeting if the manufacturer certified that it will submit a supplemental application for the new use within 6 months of the date that dissemination can begin and the noncompliance involves a failure to submit such supplemental application.
(c)
FDA actions based on a manufacturer's supplemental application.
FDA may order a manufacturer to cease disseminating information under this part and to take corrective action if:
(1) In the case of a manufacturer that has submitted a supplemental application for the new use, FDA determines that the supplemental application does not contain adequate information for approval of the new use;
(2) In the case of a manufacturer that has certified that it will submit a supplemental application for the new use within 6 months, the manufacturer has not, within the 6-month period, submitted a supplemental application for the new use;
(3) In the case of a manufacturer that has certified that it will submit a supplemental application for the new use within 36 months or within such time
as FDA has determined to be appropriate under § 99.303(a) or (b), such manufacturer has not submitted the supplemental application within the certified time, or FDA, after an informal hearing, has determined that the manufacturer is not acting with due diligence to initiate or complete the studies necessary to support a supplemental application for the new use; or
(4) In the case of a manufacturer that has certified that it will submit a supplemental application for the new use within 36 months or within such time as FDA has determined to be appropriate under § 99.303(a) or (b), the manufacturer has discontinued or terminated the clinical studies that would be necessary to support a supplemental application for a new use.
(d)
Effective date of orders to cease dissemination.
An order to cease dissemination of information shall be effective upon date of receipt by the manufacturer, unless otherwise stated in such order.
(e)
Cessation of dissemination by a noncomplying manufacturer.
A manufacturer that begins to disseminate information in compliance with this part, but subsequently fails to comply with this part, shall immediately cease disseminating information under this part. A manufacturer that discontinues, terminates, or fails to conduct with due diligence clinical studies that it certified it would complete under § 99.201(a)(4)(ii) shall be deemed not in compliance with this part. A manufacturer shall notify FDA immediately if it ceases dissemination under this paragraph.
§ 99.403
Termination of approvals of applications for exemption.
(a) FDA may, at any time, terminate the approval of an application for an exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application if:
(1) The application for an exemption had been deemed to be approved because the agency had not acted on the application within 60 days after its receipt by FDA;
(2) The manufacturer is disseminating written information on the new use; and
(3) FDA determines that it would be economically and ethically possible for the manufacturer to conduct the clinical studies needed to submit a supplemental application for the new use.
(b) If FDA terminates a deemed approval of an application for an exemption under paragraph (a) of this section, FDA also may:
(1) Order the manufacturer to cease disseminating information; and
(2) Order the manufacturer to take action to correct the information that has been disseminated if FDA determines that the new use described in the disseminated information would pose a significant risk to public health.
(c) FDA shall notify the manufacturer if it terminates the deemed approval of an application for an exemption under paragraph (a) of this section. If FDA also issues an order to cease dissemination of information, the manufacturer shall comply with the order no later than 60 days after its receipt.
(d) FDA may, at any time, terminate the approval of an application for an exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application for a new use if, after consulting with the manufacturer that was granted such exemption, FDA determines that the manufacturer no longer meets the requirements for an exemption on the basis that it is economically prohibitive or unethical to conduct the studies needed to submit a supplemental application for the new use.
(e) If FDA terminates an approval of an application for an exemption under paragraph (d) of this section, the manufacturer must, within 60 days of being notified by FDA that its exemption approval has been terminated, file a supplemental application for the new use that is the subject of the information being disseminated under the exemption, certify, under § 99.201(a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(ii) that it will file a supplemental application for the new use, or cease disseminating the information on the new use. FDA may require a manufacturer that ceases dissemination of information on the new use to undertake corrective action.
§ 99.405
Applicability of labeling, adulteration, and misbranding authority.
The dissemination of information relating to a new use for a drug or device may constitute labeling, evidence of a new intended use, adulteration, or misbranding of the drug or device if such dissemination fails to comply with section 551 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360aaa) and the requirements of this part. A manufacturer's failure to exercise due diligence in submitting the clinical studies that are necessary for the approval of a new use that is the subject of information disseminated under this part or in beginning or completing such clinical studies shall be deemed a failure to comply with section 551 of the act and the requirements of this part.

# Subpart F—Recordkeeping and Reports
§ 99.501
Recordkeeping and reports.
(a) A manufacturer disseminating information under this part shall:
(1) Maintain records sufficient to allow the manufacturer to take corrective action as required by FDA. The manufacturer shall make such records available to FDA, upon request, for inspection and copying. Such records shall either:
(i) Identify, by name, those persons receiving the disseminated information; or
(ii) Identify, by category, the recipients of the disseminated information, unless FDA requires the manufacturer to retain records identifying individual recipients of the disseminated information. Manufacturers whose records identify recipients by category only shall:
(A) Identify subcategories of recipients where appropriate (e.g., oncologists, pediatricians, obstetricians, etc.); and
(B) Ensure that any corrective action to be taken will be sufficiently conspicuous to individuals within that category of recipients;
(2) Maintain an identical copy of the information disseminated under this part; and
(3) Upon the submission of a supplemental application to FDA, notify the appropriate office identified in § 99.201(c) of this part.
(b) A manufacturer disseminating information on a new use for a drug or device shall, on a semiannual basis, submit to the FDA office identified in § 99.201(c) of this part:
(1) A list containing the titles of articles and reference publications relating to the new use of drugs or devices that the manufacturer disseminated to a health care practitioner, pharmacy benefit manager, health insurance issuer, group health plan, or Federal or State Government agency. The list shall cover articles and reference publications disseminated in the 6-month period preceding the date on which the manufacturer provides the list to FDA;
(2) A list identifying the categories of health care practitioners, pharmacy benefit managers, health insurance issuers, group health plans, or Federal or State Government agencies that received the articles and reference publications in the 6-month period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The list shall also identify which category of recipients received a particular article or reference publication;
(3) A notice and summary of any additional clinical research or other data relating to the safety or effectiveness of the new use, and, if the manufacturer possesses such clinical research or other data, a copy of the research or data. Such other data may include, but is not limited to, new articles published in scientific or medical journals, reference publications, and summaries of adverse effects that are or may be associated with the new use;
(4) If the manufacturer is conducting studies necessary for the submission of a supplemental application, the manufacturer shall submit periodic progress reports on these studies to FDA. Such reports shall describe the studies' current status (i.e., progress on patient enrollment, any significant problems that could affect the manufacturer's ability to complete the studies, and expected completion dates). If the manufacturer discontinues or terminates a study before completing it, the manufacturer shall, as part of the next periodic progress report, state the reasons
for such discontinuation or termination; and
(5) If the manufacturer was granted an exemption from the requirements to submit a supplemental application for the new use, any new or additional information that relates to whether the manufacturer continues to meet the requirements for such exemption. This information may include, but is not limited to, new or additional information regarding revenues from the product that is the subject of the dissemination and new or additional information regarding the persuasiveness of the data on the new use, including information regarding whether the new use is broadly accepted as current standard medical treatment or therapy.
(c) A manufacturer shall maintain a copy of all information, lists, records, and reports required or disseminated under this part for 3 years after it has ceased dissemination of such information and make such documents available to FDA for inspection and copying.
