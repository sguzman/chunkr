A shareholder that makes the deemed dividend election increases its adjusted basis of the stock of the PFIC owned directly by the shareholder by the amount of the deemed dividend. If the shareholder makes the deemed dividend election with respect to a PFIC of which it is an indirect shareholder, the shareholder's adjusted basis of the stock or other property owned directly by the shareholder, through which ownership of the PFIC is attributed to the shareholder, is increased by the amount of the deemed dividend. In addition, solely for purposes of determining the subsequent treatment under the Code and regulations of a shareholder of the stock of the PFIC, the adjusted basis of the direct owner of the stock of the PFIC is increased by the amount of the deemed dividend.
(g)
Treatment of holding period.
For purposes of applying sections 1291 through 1297 to the shareholder after the deemed dividend, the shareholder's holding period of the stock of the PFIC begins on the qualification date. For other purposes of the Code and regulations, this holding period rule does not apply.
(h)
Coordination with section 959(e).
For purposes of section 959(e), the entire deemed dividend is treated as included in gross income under section 1248(a).
(i)
Election inapplicable to shareholder of a former PFIC or of a section 1297(e) PFIC.
A shareholder may not make the section 1295 and deemed dividend elections if the foreign corporation is a former PFIC (as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(iv) of this section) or a section 1297(e) PFIC (as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(v) of this section) with respect to the shareholder. For the rules regarding the election by a shareholder of a former PFIC, see § 1.1298-3. For the rules regarding the election by a shareholder of a section 1297(e) PFIC, see § 1.1297-3.

Definitions
—(1)
Passive foreign investment company (PFIC).
A passive foreign investment company (PFIC) is a foreign corporation that satisfies either the income test of section 1296(a)(1) or the asset test of section 1296(a)(2). A corporation will not be treated as a PFIC with respect to a shareholder for those days included in the shareholder's holding period when the shareholder, or a person whose holding period of the stock is included in the shareholder's holding period, was not a United States person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30).
(2)
Types of PFICs
—(i)
Qualified electing fund (QEF).
A PFIC is a qualified electing fund (QEF) with respect to a shareholder that has elected, under section 1295, to be taxed currently on its share of the PFIC's earnings and profits pursuant to section 1293.
(ii)
Pedigreed QEF.
A PFIC is a pedigreed QEF with respect to a shareholder if the PFIC has been a QEF with respect to the shareholder for all taxable years during which the corporation was a PFIC that are included wholly or partly in the shareholder's holding period of the PFIC stock.
(iii)
Unpedigreed QEF.
A PFIC is an unpedigreed QEF for a taxable year if—
(A) An election under section 1295 is in effect for that year;
(B) The PFIC has been a QEF with respect to the shareholder for at least one, but not all, of the taxable years during which the corporation was a PFIC that are included wholly or partly in the shareholder's holding period of the PFIC stock; and
(C) The shareholder has not made an election under section 1291(d)(2) and this section or § 1.1291-10 with respect to the PFIC to purge the nonQEF years from the shareholder's holding period.
(iv)
Former PFIC.
A foreign corporation is a former PFIC with respect to a shareholder if the corporation satisfies neither the income test of section 1297(a)(1) nor the asset test of section 1297(a)(2), but its stock, held by that shareholder, is treated as stock of a
PFIC, pursuant to section 1298(b)(1), because the corporation was a PFIC that was not a QEF at some time during the shareholder's holding period of the stock.
(v)
Section 1297(e) PFIC.
A foreign corporation is a section 1297(e) PFIC with respect to a shareholder (as defined in paragraph (j)(3) of this section) if—
(A) The foreign corporation qualifies as a PFIC under section 1297(a) on the first day on which the qualified portion of the shareholder's holding period in the foreign corporation begins, as determined under section 1297(e)(2); and
(B) The stock of the foreign corporation held by the shareholder is treated as stock of a PFIC, pursuant to section 1298(b)(1), because, at any time during the shareholder's holding period of the stock, other than the qualified portion, the corporation was a PFIC that was not a QEF.
(3) A shareholder is a United States person that is a shareholder as defined in § 1.1291-1(b)(7) or an indirect shareholder as defined in § 1.1291-1(b)(8), except as provided in § 1.1291-1(e).

§ 1.1291-10
Deemed sale election.
(a)
Deemed sale election.
This section provides rules for making the election under section 1291(d)(2)(A) (deemed sale election). Under that section, a shareholder (as defined in § 1.1291-9(j)(3)) of a PFIC that is an unpedigreed QEF may elect to recognize gain with respect to the stock of the unpedigreed QEF held on the qualification date (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section). If the shareholder makes the deemed sale election, the PFIC will become a pedigreed QEF with respect to the shareholder. A shareholder that makes the deemed sale election is treated as having sold, for its fair market value, the stock of the PFIC that the shareholder held on the qualification date. The gain recognized on the deemed sale is taxed under section 1291 as an excess distribution received on the qualification date. In the case of an election made by an indirect shareholder, the amount of gain to be recognized and taxed as an excess distribution is the amount of gain that the direct owner of the stock of the PFIC would have realized on an actual sale or other disposition of the stock of the PFIC indirectly owned by the shareholder. Any loss realized on the deemed sale is not recognized. For the definitions of PFIC, QEF, unpedigreed QEF, and pedigreed QEF, see § 1.1291-9(j) (1) and (2).
(b)
Who may make the election.
A shareholder of an unpedigreed QEF may make the deemed sale election provided the shareholder held stock of that PFIC on the qualification date. A shareholder is treated as holding stock of the PFIC on the qualification date if its holding period with respect to that stock under section 1223 includes the qualification date. A deemed sale election may be made by a shareholder that would realize a loss on the deemed sale.
(c)
Time for making the election.
The shareholder makes the deemed sale election in the shareholder's return for the taxable year that includes the qualification date. If the shareholder and the PFIC have the same taxable year, the shareholder makes the deemed sale election in either the original return for the taxable year for which the shareholder makes the section 1295 election, or in an amended return for that year. If the shareholder and the PFIC have different taxable years, the deemed sale election must be made in an amended return for the taxable year that includes the qualification date. If the deemed sale election is made in an amended return, the amended return must be filed by a date that is within three years of the due date, as extended under section 6081, of the original return for the taxable year that includes the qualification date.
(d)
Manner of making the election.
A shareholder makes the deemed sale
election by filing Form 8621 with the return for the taxable year of the shareholder that includes the qualification date, reporting the gain as an excess distribution pursuant to section 1291(a), and paying the tax and interest due on the excess distribution. A shareholder that makes the deemed sale election after the due date of the return (determined without regard to extensions) for the taxable year that includes the qualification date must pay additional interest, pursuant to section 6601, on the amount of the underpayment of tax for that year. A shareholder that realizes a loss on the deemed sale reports the loss on Form 8621, but does not recognize the loss.
(e)
Qualification date
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), the qualification date is the first day of the PFIC's first taxable year as a QEF (first QEF year).
(2)
Elections made after March 31, 1995, and before January 27, 1997
—(i)
In general.
The qualification date for deemed sale elections made after March 31, 1995, and before January 27, 1997, is the first day of the shareholder's election year. The shareholder's election year is the taxable year of the shareholder for which it made the section 1295 election.
(ii)
Exception.
A shareholder who made the deemed sale election after May 1, 1992, and before January 27, 1997, may elect to change its qualification date to the first day of the first QEF year, provided the periods of limitations on assessment for the taxable year that includes that date and for the shareholder's election year have not expired. A shareholder changes the qualification date by filing amended returns, with revised Forms 8621, for the shareholder's election year and the shareholder's taxable year that includes the first day of the first QEF year, and making all appropriate adjustments and payments.
(f)
Adjustments to basis
—(1)
In general.
A shareholder that makes the deemed sale election increases its adjusted basis of the PFIC stock owned directly by the amount of gain recognized on the deemed sale. If the shareholder makes the deemed sale election with respect to a PFIC of which it is an indirect shareholder, the shareholder's adjusted basis of the stock or other property owned directly by the shareholder, through which ownership of the PFIC is attributed to the shareholder, is increased by the amount of gain recognized by the shareholder. In addition, solely for purposes of determining the subsequent treatment under the Code and regulations of a shareholder of the stock of the PFIC, the adjusted basis of the direct owner of the stock of the PFIC is increased by the amount of gain recognized on the deemed sale. A shareholder shall not adjust the basis of any stock with respect to which the shareholder realized a loss on the deemed sale.
(2)
Adjustment of basis for section 1293 inclusion with respect to deemed sale election made after March 31, 1995, and before January 27, 1997.
For purposes of determining the amount of gain recognized with respect to a deemed sale election made after March 31, 1995, and before January 27, 1997, by a shareholder that treats the first day of the shareholder's election year as the qualification date, the adjusted basis of the stock deemed sold includes the shareholder's section 1293(a) inclusion attributable to the period beginning with the first day of the PFIC's first QEF year and ending on the day before the qualification date.
(g)
Treatment of holding period.
For purposes of applying sections 1291 through 1297 to the shareholder after the deemed sale, the shareholder's holding period of the stock of the PFIC begins on the qualification date, without regard to whether the shareholder recognized gain on the deemed sale. For other purposes of the Code and regulations, this holding period rule does not apply.
(h)
Election inapplicable to shareholder of former PFIC.
A shareholder may not make the section 1295 and deemed sale elections if the foreign corporation is a former PFIC (as defined in § 1.1291-9(j)(2)(iv)) with respect to the shareholder. For the rules regarding the election by a shareholder of a former PFIC, see § 1.1297-3T.
(i)
Effective date.
The rules of this section are applicable as of April 1, 1995.

Net capital gain defined
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (a)(2) defines the term net capital gain for purposes of sections 1293 and 1295 and the regulations under those sections. The QEF, as defined in § 1.1291-9(j)(2)(i), in determining its net capital gain for a taxable year, may either—
(A) Calculate and report the amount of each category of long-term capital gain provided in section 1(h) that was recognized by the PFIC in the taxable year;
(B) Calculate and report the amount of net capital gain recognized by the PFIC in the taxable year, stating that that amount is subject to the highest capital gain rate of tax applicable to the shareholder; or
(C) Calculate its earnings and profits for the taxable year and report the entire amount as ordinary earnings.

(c)
Application of rules of inclusion with respect to stock held by a pass through entity
—(1)
In general.
If a domestic pass through entity makes a section 1295 election, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, with respect to the PFIC shares that it owns, directly or indirectly, the domestic pass through entity takes into account its pro rata share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain attributable to the QEF shares held by the pass through entity. A U.S. person that indirectly owns QEF shares through the domestic pass through entity accounts for its pro rata shares of ordinary earnings and net capital gain attributable to the QEF shares according to the general rules applicable to inclusions of income from the domestic pass through entity. For the definition of pass through entity, see § 1.1295-1(j).
(2)
QEF stock transferred to a pass through entity
—(i)
Pass through entity makes a section 1295 election.
If a shareholder transfers stock subject to a section 1295 election to a domestic pass through entity of which it is an interest holder and the pass through entity makes a section 1295 election with respect to that stock, as provided in § 1.1295-1(d)(2), the shareholder takes into account its pro rata shares of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain attributable to the QEF shares under the rules applicable to inclusions of income from the pass through entity.
(ii)
Pass through entity does not make a section 1295 election.
If the pass through entity does not make a section 1295 election with respect to the PFIC, the shares of which were transferred to the pass through entity subject to the 1295 election of the shareholder, the shareholder continues to be subject, in its capacity as an indirect shareholder, to the income inclusion rules of section 1293 and reporting rules required of shareholders of QEFs. Proper adjustments to reflect an inclusion in income under section 1293 by the indirect shareholder must be made, under the principles of § 1.1291-9(f), to the basis of the indirect shareholder's interest in the pass through entity.
(3)
Effective date.
Paragraph (c) of this section is applicable to taxable years of shareholders beginning after December 31, 1997.

§ 1.1294-1T
Election to extend the time for payment of tax on undistributed earnings of a qualified electing fund (temporary).
(a)
Purpose and scope.
This section provides rules for making the annual election under section 1294. Under that section, a U.S. person that is a shareholder in a qualified electing fund (QEF) may elect to extend the time for payment of its tax liability which is attributable to its share of the undistributed earnings of the QEF. In general, a QEF is a passive foreign investment company (PFIC), as defined in section 1296, that makes the election under section 1295. Under section 1293, a U.S. person that owns, or is treated as owning, stock of a QEF at any time during the taxable year of the QEF shall include in gross income, as ordinary income, its pro rata share of the ordinary earnings of the QEF for the taxable year and, as long-term capital gain, its pro rata share of the net capital gain of the QEF for the taxable year. The shareholder's share of the earnings shall be included in the shareholder's taxable year in which or with which the taxable year of the QEF ends.
(b)
Election to extend time for payment
—(1)
In general.
A U.S. person that is a shareholder of a QEF on the last day of the QEF's taxable year may elect under section 1294 to extend the time for payment of that portion of its tax liability which is attributable to the inclusion in income pursuant to section 1293 of the shareholder's share of the QEF's undistributed earnings. The election under section 1294 may be made only with respect to undistributed earnings, and interest is imposed under section 6601 on the amount of the tax liability which is subject to the extension. This interest must be paid on the termination of the election.
(2)
Exception.
An election under this § 1.1294-1T cannot be made for a taxable year of the shareholder if any portion of the QEF's earning is includible in the gross income of the shareholder for such year under either section 551 (relating to foreign personal holding companies) or section 951 (relating to controlled foreign corporations).
(3)
Undistributed earnings
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this § 1.1294-1T the term
undistributed earnings
means the excess, if any, of the amount includible in gross income by reason of section 1293(a) for the shareholder's taxable year (the includible amount) over the sum of (A) the amount of any distribution to the shareholder during the QEF's taxable year and (B) the portion of the includible amount that is attributable to stock in the QEF that the shareholder transferred or otherwise disposed of before the end of the QEF's year. For purposes of this paragraph, a distribution will be treated as made from the most recently accumulated earnings and profits.
(ii)
Effect of a loan, pledge or guarantee.
A loan, pledge, or guarantee described in § 1.1294-1T(e) (2) or (4) will be treated as a distribution of earnings for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A). If earnings are treated as distributed in a taxable year by reason of a loan, pledge or guarantee described in § 1.1294-1T(e) (2) or (4), but the amount of the deemed distribution resulting therefrom was less than the amount of the actual loan by the QEF (or the amount of the loan secured by the pledge or guarantee), earnings derived by the QEF in a subsequent taxable year will be treated as distributed in such subsequent year to the shareholder for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) by virtue of such
loan, but only to the extent of the difference between the outstanding principal balance on the loan in such subsequent year and the prior years' deemed distributions resulting from the loan. For this purpose, the outstanding principal balance on a loan in a taxable year shall be treated as equal to the greatest amount of the outstanding balance at any time during such year.

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts. FC
is a PFIC that made the election under section 1295 to be a QEF for its taxable year beginning January 1, 1987.
S
owned 500 shares, or 50 percent, of
FC
throughout the first six months of 1987, but on June 30, 1987 sold 10 percent, or 50 shares, of the
FC
stock that it held.
FC
had $100,000
x
of ordinary earnings but no net capital gain in 1987. No part of
FC
's earnings is includible in
S
's income under either section 551 or 951.
FC
made no distributions to its shareholders in 1987.
S's
pro rata share of income is determined by attributing
FC's
income ratably to each day in
FC
's year. Accordingly, FC's daily earnings are $274
x
($100,000
x
/365).
S
's share of the earnings of
FC
is $47,484
x,
determined as follows.
FC
's daily earnings × number of days percentage held by
S
× percentage of ownership in
FC.
Accordingly,
S
's pro rata share of
FC
's earnings for the first six months of
FC
's year deemed earned while
S
held 50 percent of
FC
's stock is $24,797
x
($274
x
× 181 days × 50%).
S
's pro rata share of
FC
's earnings for remainder of
FC
's year deemed earned while
S
held 45 percent of
FC
's stock is $22,687
x
($274
x
× 184 days × 45%). Therefore,
S
's total share of
FC
's earnings to be included in income under section 1293 is $47,484
x
($24,797
x
+ $22,687
x
).
(ii)
Election. S
intends to make the election under section 1294 to defer the payment of its tax liability that is attributable to the undistributed earnings of
FC.
The amount of current year undistributed earnings as defined in § 1.1294-1T(b)(3) with respect to which
S
can make the election is the excess of
S
's inclusion in gross income under section 1293(a) for the taxable year over the sum of (1) the cash and other property distributed to
S
during
FC
's tax year out of earnings included in income pursuant to section 1293(a), and (2) the earnings attributable to stock disposed of during
FC
's tax year. Because
S
sold 10 percent, or 50 shares, of the
FC
stock that it held during the first six months of the year, 10 percent of its share of the earnings for that part of the year, which is $2,480
x
($24,797
x
× 10%), is attributable to the shares sold.
S
therefore cannot make the election under section 1294 to extend the time for payment of its tax liability on that amount. Accordingly,
S
can make the election under section 1294 with respect to its tax on $45,004
x
($47,484
x
less $2,480
x
), which is its pro rata share of
FC
's earnings, reduced by the earnings attributable to the stock disposed of during the year.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in Example 1 with the following exceptions.
S
did not sell any
FC
stock during 1987. Therefore, because
S
held 50 percent of the
FC
stock throughout 1987,
S
's pro rata share of
FC
's ordinary earnings was $50,000
x,
no part of which was includible in
S
's income under either section 551 or 951. There were no actual distributions of earnings to
S
in 1988. On December 31, 1987,
S
pledged the FC stock as security for a bank loan of $75,000
x.
The pledge is treated as a disposition of the
FC
stock and therefore a distribution of
S
's share of the undistributed earnings of
FC
up to the amount of the loan principal.
S
's entire share of the undistributed earnings of
FC
are deemed distributed as a result of the pledge of the
FC
stock.
S
therefore cannot make the election under section 1294 to extend the time for payment of its tax liability on its share of
FC
's earnings for 1987.
(ii)
Deemed distribution.
In 1988,
FC
has ordinary earnings of $100,000
x
but no net capital gain.
S
's pro rata share of
FC
's 1988 ordinary earnings was $50,000
x. S
's loan remained outstanding throughout 1988; the highest loan balance during 1988 was $74,000
x.
Of
S
's share of the ordinary earnings of FC of $50,000
x,
$24,000
x
is deemed distributed to
S.
This is the amount by which the highest loan balance for the year ($74,000
x
) exceeds the portion of the undistributed earnings of
FC
deemed distributed to
S
in 1987 by reason of the pledge ($50,000
x
).
S
may make the election under section 1294 to extend the time for payment of its tax liability on $26,000
x,
which is the amount by which
S
's includible amount for 1988 exceeds the amount deemed distributed to
S
during 1988.
(c)
Time for making the election
—(1)
In general.
An election under this § 1.1294-1T may be made for any taxable year in which a shareholder reports income pursuant to section 1293. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2), the election shall be made by the due date, as extended, of the tax return for the shareholder's taxable year for which the election is made.
(2)
Exception.
An election under this section may be made within 60 days of receipt of notification from the QEF of the shareholder's pro rata share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain if notification is received after the time for filing the election provided in paragraph (c)(1) (and requires the filing of an amended return to report income
pursuant to section 1293). If the notification reports an increase in the shareholder's pro rata share of the earnings previously reported to the shareholder by the QEF, the shareholder may make the election under this paragraph (c)(2) only with respect to the amount of such increase.
(d)
Manner of making the election
—(1)
In general.
A shareholder shall make the election by (i) attaching to its return for the year of the election Form 8621 or a statement containing the information and representations required by this section and (ii) filing a copy of Form 8621 or the statement with the Internal Revenue Service Center, P.O. Box 21086, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19114.
(2)
Information to be included in the election statement.
If a statement is used in lieu of Form 8621, the statement should be identified, in a heading, as an election under section 1294 of the Code. The statement must include the following information and representations:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the electing shareholder and the taxable year of the shareholder for which the election is being made;
(ii) The name, address and taxpayer identification number of the QEF if provided to the shareholder;
(iii) A statement that the shareholder is making the election under section 1294 of the Code;

(A) The ordinary earnings and net capital gain for the current year included in the shareholder's income under section 1293;
(B) The amount of cash and other property distributed by the QEF during its taxable year with respect to stock held directly or indirectly by the shareholder during that year, identifying the amount of such distributions that is paid out of current earnings and profits and the amount paid out of each prior year's earnings and profits; and
(C) The undistributed PFIC earnings tax liability (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) for the taxable year, payment of which is being deferred by reason of the election under section 1294;
(v) The number of shares of stock held in the QEF during the QEF's taxable year which gave rise to the section 1293 inclusion and the number of such shares transferred, deemed transferred or otherwise disposed of by the electing shareholder before the end of the QEF's taxable year, and the data of transfer; and
(vi) The representations of the electing shareholder that—
(A) No part of the QEF's earnings for the taxable year is includible in the electing shareholder's gross income under either section 551 or 951 of the Code;
(B) The election is made only with respect to the shareholder's pro rata share of the undistributed earnings of the QEF; and
(C) The electing shareholder, upon termination of the election to extend the date for payment, shall pay the undistributed PFIC earnings tax liability attributable to those earnings to which the termination applies as well as interest on such tax liability pursuant to section 6601. Payment of this tax and interest must be made by the due date (determined without extensions) of the tax return for the taxable year in which the termination occurs.
(e)
Termination of the extension.
The election to extend the date for payment of tax will be terminated in whole or in part upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
(1) The QEF's distribution of earnings to which the section 1294 extension to pay tax is attributable; the extension will terminate only with respect to the tax attributable to the earnings that were distributed.
(2) The electing shareholder's transfer of stock in the QEF (or use thereof as security for a loan) with respect to which an election under this § 1.1294-1T was made. The election will be terminated with respect to the undistributed earnings attributable to the shares of the stock transferred. In the case of a pledge of the stock, the election will be terminated with respect to undistributed earnings equal to the amount of the loan for which the stock is pledged.
(3) Revocation of the QEF's election as a QEF or cessation of the QEF's status as a PFIC. A revocation of the QEF election or cessation of PFIC status
will result in the complete termination of the extension.
(4) A loan of property by the QEF directly or indirectly to the electing shareholder or related person, or a pledge or guarantee by the QEF with respect to a loan made by another party to the electing shareholder or related person. The election will be terminated with respect to undistributed earnings in an amount equal to the amount of the loan, pledge, or guarantee.
(5) A determination by the District Director pursuant to section 1294(c)(3) that collection of the tax is in jeopardy. The amount of undistributed earnings with respect to which the extension is terminated under this paragraph (d)(5) will be left to the discretion of the District Director.
(f)
Undistributed PFIC earnings tax liability.
The electing shareholder's tax liability attributable to the ordinary earnings and net capital gain included in gross income under section 1293 shall be the excess of the tax imposed under chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year over the tax that would be imposed for the taxable year without regard to the inclusion in income under section 1293 of the undistributed earnings as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

# Example:
The facts are the same as in § 1.1294-1T (b)(3),
Example 1,
with the following exceptions.
S,
a domestic corporation, did not dispose of any
FC
stock in 1987. Therefore, because
S
held 50 percent of the
FC
stock throughout 1987,
S
's pro rata share of
FC
's ordinary earnings was $50,000
x.
In addition to $50,000
x
of ordinary earnings from
FC, S
had $12,500
x
of domestic source income and $6,000
x
of expenses (other than interest expense) not definitely related to any gross income. These expenses are apportioned, pursuant to § 1.861-8(c)(2), on a pro rata basis between the domestic and foreign source income—$1,200
x
of expenses, or one-fifth, to domestic source income, and $4,800
x
of expenses, or four-fifths, to the section 1293 inclusion.
FC
paid foreign taxes of $25,000
x
in 1987. Accordingly,
S
is entitled to claim as an indirect foreign tax credit pursuant to section 1293(f) a proportionate amount of the foreign taxes paid by
FC,
which is $12,500

Authority to require a bond.
Pursuant to the authority granted in section 6165 and in the manner provided therein, and subject to notification, the District Director may require the electing shareholder to furnish a bond to secure payment of the tax, the time for payment of which is extended under this section. If the electing shareholder does not furnish the bond within 60 days after receiving a request from the District Director, the election will be revoked.
(h)
Annual reporting requirement.
The electing shareholder must attach Form 8621 or a statement to its income tax return for each year during which an election under this section is outstanding. The statement must contain the following information:
(1) The total amount of undistributed earnings as of the end of the taxable year to which the outstanding elections apply;
(2) The total amount of the undistributed PFIC earnings tax liability and
accrued interest charge as of the end of the year;
(3) The total amount of distributions received during the taxable year; and
(4) A description of the occurrence of any other termination event described in paragraph (e) of this section that occurred during the taxable year.
The electing shareholder also shall file by the due date, as extended, for its return a copy of Form 8621 or the statement with the Philadelphia Service Center, P.O. Box 21086, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19114.

(3)
Application of general rules to stock held by a pass through entity
—(i)
Stock subject to a section 1295 election transferred to a pass through entity.
A shareholder's section 1295 election will not apply to a domestic pass through entity to which the shareholder transfers stock subject to section 1295 election, or to any other U.S. person that is an interest holder or beneficiary of the domestic pass through entity. However, as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section (relating to a transfer to a domestic pass through entity of stock subject to a section 1295 election), a shareholder that transfers stock subject to a section 1295 election to a pass through entity will continue to be subject to the section 1295 election with respect to the stock indirectly owned through the pass through entity and any other stock of that PFIC owned by the shareholder.
(ii)
Limitation on application of pass through entity's section 1295 election.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, a section 1295 election made by a domestic pass through entity does not apply to other stock of the PFIC held directly or indirectly by the interest holder or beneficiary.
(iii)
Effect of partnership termination on section 1295 election.
Termination of a section 1295 election made by a domestic partnership by reason of the termination of the partnership under section 708(b) will not terminate the section 1295 election with respect to partners of the terminated partnership that are partners of the new partnership. Except as otherwise provided, the stock of the PFIC of which the new partners are indirect shareholders will be treated as stock of a QEF only if the new domestic partnership makes a section 1295 election with respect to that stock.
(iv)
Characterization of stock held through a pass through entity.
Stock of a PFIC held through a pass through entity will be treated as stock of a pedigreed QEF with respect to an interest holder or beneficiary only if—
(A) In the case of PFIC stock acquired (other than in a transaction in which gain is not recognized pursuant to regulations under section 1291(f) with respect to that stock) and held by a domestic pass through entity, the pass through entity makes the section 1295 election and the PFIC has been a QEF with respect to the pass through entity for all taxable years that are included wholly or partly in the pass through entity's holding period of the PFIC stock and during which the foreign corporation was a PFIC within the meaning of § 1.1291-9(j)(1); or
(B) In the case of PFIC stock transferred by an interest holder or beneficiary to a pass through entity in a transaction in which gain is not fully recognized (including pursuant to regulations under section 1291(f)), the pass through entity makes the section 1295 election with respect to the PFIC stock transferred for the taxable year in which the transfer was made. The PFIC stock transferred will be treated as stock of a pedigreed QEF by the pass through entity, however, only if that stock was treated as stock of a pedigreed QEF with respect to the interest holder or beneficiary at the time of the transfer, and the PFIC has been a QEF with respect to the pass through entity for all taxable years of the PFIC that are included wholly or partly in the pass through entity's holding period of the PFIC stock during which the foreign corporation was a PFIC within the meaning of § 1.1291-9(j).
(v)
Characterization of stock distributed by a partnership.
In the case of PFIC stock distributed by a partnership to a partner in a transaction in which gain is not fully recognized, the PFIC stock will be treated as stock of a pedigreed QEF by the partners only if that stock was treated as stock of a pedigreed QEF with respect to the partnership for all taxable years of the PFIC that are included wholly or partly in the partnership's holding period of the PFIC stock during which the foreign corporation was a PFIC within the meaning of § 1.1291-9(j), and the partner has a section 1295 election in effect with respect to the distributed PFIC stock for the partner's taxable year in which the distribution was made. If the partner does not have a section 1295 election in effect, the stock shall be treated as stock in a section 1291 fund. See paragraph (k) of this section for special applicability date of paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section.
(4)
Application of general rules to a taxpayer filing a joint return under section 6013.
A section 1295 election made by a taxpayer in a joint return, within the meaning of section 6013, will be treated as also made by the spouse that joins in the filing of that return. See paragraph (k) of this section for special applicability date of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(c)
Effect of section 1295 election
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), the effect of a shareholder's section 1295 election is to treat the foreign corporation as a QEF with respect to the shareholder for each taxable year of the foreign corporation ending with or within a taxable year of the shareholder for which the election is effective. A section 1295 election is effective for the shareholder's election year and all subsequent taxable years of the shareholder
unless invalidated, terminated or revoked as provided in paragraph (i) of this section. The terms shareholder and shareholder's election year are defined in paragraph (j) of this section.
(2)
Years to which section 1295 election applies
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a foreign corporation with respect to which a section 1295 election is made will be treated as a QEF for its taxable year ending with or within the shareholder's election year and all subsequent taxable years of the foreign corporation that are included wholly or partly in the shareholder's holding period (or periods) of stock of the foreign corporation.
(ii)
Effect of PFIC status on election.
A foreign corporation will not be treated as a QEF for any taxable year of the foreign corporation that the foreign corporation is not a PFIC under section 1297(a) and is not treated as a PFIC under section 1298(b)(1). Therefore, a shareholder shall not be required to include pursuant to section 1293 the shareholder's pro rata share of ordinary earnings and net capital gain for such year and shall not be required to satisfy the section 1295 annual reporting requirement of paragraph (f)(2) of this section for such year. Cessation of a foreign corporation's status as a PFIC will not, however, terminate a section 1295 election. Thus, if the foreign corporation is a PFIC in any taxable year after a year in which it is not treated as a PFIC, the shareholder's original election under section 1295 continues to apply and the shareholder must take into account its pro rata share of ordinary earnings and net capital gain for such year and comply with the section 1295 annual reporting requirement.
(iii)
Effect on election of complete termination of a shareholder's interest in the PFIC.
Complete termination of a shareholder's direct and indirect interest in stock of a foreign corporation will not terminate a shareholder's section 1295 election with respect to the foreign corporation. Therefore, if a shareholder reacquires a direct or indirect interest in any stock of the foreign corporation, that stock is considered to be stock for which an election under section 1295 has been made and the shareholder is subject to the income inclusion and reporting rules required of a shareholder of a QEF.
(iv)
Effect on section 1295 election of transfer of stock to a domestic pass through entity.
The transfer of a shareholder's direct or indirect interest in stock of a foreign corporation to a domestic pass through entity (as defined in paragraph (j) of this section) will not terminate the shareholder's section 1295 election with respect to the foreign corporation, whether or not the pass through entity makes a section 1295 election. For the rules concerning the application of section 1293 to stock transferred to a domestic pass through entity, see § 1.1293-1(c).
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c)(2).

# Example 1.
In 1998, C, a U.S. person, purchased stock of FC, a foreign corporation that is a PFIC. Both FC and C are calendar year taxpayers. C made a timely section 1295 election to treat FC as a QEF in C's 1998 return, and FC was therefore a pedigreed QEF. C included its shares of FC's 1998 ordinary earnings and net capital gain in C's 1998 Income and did not make a section 1294 election to defer the time for payment of tax on that income. In 1999, 2000, and 2001, FC did not satisfy either the income or asset test of section 1296(a), and therefore was neither a PFIC nor a QEF. C therefore did not have to include its pro rata shares of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of FC pursuant to section 1293, or satisfy the section 1295 annual reporting requirements for any of those years. FC qualified as a PFIC again in 2002. Because C had made a section 1295 election in 1998, and the election had not been invalidated, terminated, or revoked, within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section, C's section 1295 election remains in effect for 2002. C therefore is subject in 2002 to the income inclusion and reporting rules required of shareholders of QEFs.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that FC did not lose PFIC status in any year and C sold all the FC stock in 1999 and repurchased stock of FC in 2002. Because C had made a section 1295 election in 1998 with respect to stock of FC, and the election had not been invalidated, terminated, or revoked, within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section, C's section 1295 election remained in effect and therefore applies to the stock of FC purchased by C in 2002. C therefore is subject in 2002 to the income inclusion and reporting rules required of shareholders of QEFs.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in Example (2) except that C is a partner in domestic partnership P and C transferred its FC stock to P in 1999. Because C had made a section 1295 election in 1998 with respect to stock of FC, and the election had not been invalidated, terminated, or revoked, within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section, C's section 1295 election remains in effect with respect to its indirect interest in the stock of FC. If P does not make the section 1295 election with respect to the FC stock, C will continue to be subject, in C's capacity as an indirect shareholder of FC, to the income inclusion and reporting rules required of shareholders of QEFs in 1999 and subsequent years for that portion of the FC stock C is treated as owning indirectly through the partnership. If P makes the section 1295 election, C will take into account its pro rata shares of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the FC under the rules applicable to inclusions of income from P.
(d)
Who may make a section 1295 election
—(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), any U.S. person that is a shareholder (as defined in paragraph (j) of this section) of a PFIC, including a shareholder that holds stock of a PFIC in bearer form, may make a section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. The shareholder need not own directly or indirectly any stock of the PFIC at the time the shareholder makes the section 1295 election provided the shareholder is a shareholder of the PFIC during the taxable year of the PFIC that ends with or within the taxable year of the shareholder for which the section 1295 election is made. Except in the case of a shareholder that is an exempt organization that may not make a section 1295 election, as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, in a chain of ownership only the first U.S. person that is a shareholder of the PFIC may make the section 1295 election.
(2)
Application of general rule to pass through entities
—(i)
Partnerships
—(A)
Domestic partnership.
A domestic partnership that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with request to that PFIC. The partnership election applies only to the stock of the PFIC held directly or indirectly by the partnership and not to any other stock held directly or indirectly by any partner. As provided in § 1.1293-1(c)(1), shareholders owning stock of a QEF by reason of an interest in the partnership take into account the section 1293 inclusions with respect to the QEF shares owned by the partnership under the rules applicable to inclusions of income from the partnership.
(B)
Foreign partnership.
A U.S. person that holds an interest in a foreign partnership that, in turn, holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. A partner's election applies to the stock of the PFIC owned directly or indirectly by the foreign partnership and to any other stock of the PFIC owned by that partner. A section 1295 election by a partner applies only to that partner.
(ii)
S corporation.
An S corporation that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. The S corporation election applies only to the stock of the PFIC held directly or indirectly by the S corporation and not to any other stock held directly or indirectly by any S corporation shareholder. As provided in § 1.1293-1(c)(1), shareholders owning stock of a QEF by reason of an interest in the S corporation take into account the section 1293 inclusions with respect to the QEF shares under the rules applicable to inclusions of income from the S corporation.
(iii)
Trust or estate
—(A)
Domestic trust or estate
—(
1
)
Nongrantor trust or estate.
A domestic nongrantor trust or a domestic estate that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. The trust or estate's election applies only to the stock of the PFIC held directly or indirectly by the trust or estate and not to any other stock held directly or indirectly by any beneficiary. As provided in § 1.1293-1(c)(1), shareholders owning stock of a QEF by reason of an interest in a domestic trust or estate take into account the section 1293 inclusions with respect to the QEF shares under the rules applicable to inclusions of income from the trust or estate.
(
2
)
Grantor trust.
A U.S. person that is treated under sections 671 through 678 as the owner of the portion of a domestic trust that owns an interest in stock
of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. If that person ceases to be treated as the owner of the portion of the trust that owns an interest in the PFIC stock and is a beneficiary of the trust, that person's section 1295 election will continue to apply to the PFIC stock indirectly owned by that person under the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section as if the person had transferred its interest in the PFIC stock to the trust. However, the stock will be treated as stock of a PFIC that is not a QEF with respect to other beneficiaries of the trust, unless the trust makes the section 1295 election as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section.
(B)
Foreign trust or estate
—(
1
)
Nongrantor trust or estate.
A U.S. person that is a beneficiary of a foreign nongrantor trust or estate that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. A beneficiary's section 1295 election applies to all the PFIC stock owned directly and indirectly by the trust or estate and to the other PFIC stock owned directly or indirectly by the beneficiary. A section 1295 election by a beneficiary applies only to that beneficiary.

A U.S. person that is treated under sections 671 through 679 as the owner of the portion of a foreign trust that owns an interest in stock of a PFIC stock makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. If that person ceases to be treated as the owner of the portion of the trust that owns an interest in the PFIC stock and is a beneficiary of the trust, that person's section 1295 election will continue to apply to the PFIC stock indirectly owned by that person under the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section. However, as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, any other shareholder that is a beneficiary of the trust and that wishes to treat the PFIC as a QEF must make the section 1295 election.
(iv)
Indirect ownership of the pass through entity or the PFIC.
The rules of this paragraph (d)(2) apply whether or not the shareholder holds its interest in the pass through entity directly or indirectly and whether or not the pass through entity holds its interest in the PFIC directly or indirectly.
(3)
Indirect ownership of a PFIC through other PFIC
s—(i)
In general.
An election under section 1295 shall apply only to the foreign corporation for which an election is made. Therefore, if a shareholder makes an election under section 1295 to treat a PFIC as a QEF, that election applies only to stock in that foreign corporation and not to the stock in any other corporation which the shareholder is treated as owning by virtue of its ownership of stock in the QEF.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section:

# Example.
In 1988, T, a U.S. person, purchased stock of FC, a foreign corporation that is a PFIC. FC also owns the stock of SC, a foreign corporation that is a PFIC. T makes an election under section 1295 to treat FC as a QEF. T's section 1295 election applies only to the stock T owns in FC, and does not apply to the stock T indirectly owns in SC.
(4)
Member of consolidated return group as shareholder.
Pursuant to § 1.1502-77(a), the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that join in filing a consolidated income tax return makes a section 1295 election for all members of the affiliated group. An election by a common parent will be effective for all members of the affiliated group with respect to interests in PFIC stock held at the time the election is made or at any time thereafter. A separate election must be made by the common parent for each PFIC of which a member of the affiliated group is a shareholder.
(5)
Option holder.
A holder of an option to acquire stock of a PFIC may not make a section 1295 election that will apply to the option or to the stock subject to the option.
(6)
Exempt organization.
A tax-exempt organization that is not taxable under section 1291, pursuant to § 1.1291-1(e), with respect to a PFIC may not make a section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. In addition, such an exempt organization will not be subject to any section 1295 election made by a domestic pass through entity.
(e)
Time for making a section 1295 election—(1) In general.
Except as provided in § 1.1295-3, a shareholder making the
section 1295 election must make the election on or before the due date, as extended under section 6081 (election due date), for filing the shareholder's income tax return for the first taxable year to which the election will apply. The section 1295 election must be made in the original return for that year, or in an amended return, provided the amended return is filed on or before the election due date.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (e)(1) of this section:

# Example 1.
In 1998, C, a domestic corporation, purchased stock of FC, a foreign corporation that is a PFIC. Both C and FC are calendar year taxpayers. C wishes to make the section 1295 election for its taxable year ended December 31, 1998. The section 1295 election must be made on or before March 15, 1999, the due date of C's 1998 income tax return as provided by section 6072(b). On March 14, 1999, C files a request for a three-month extension of time to file its 1998 income tax return under section 6081(b). C's time to file its 1998 income tax return and to make the section 1295 election is thereby extended to June 15, 1999.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that on May 1, 1999, C filed its 1998 income tax return and failed to include the section 1295 election. C may file an amended income tax return for 1998 to make the section 1295 election provided the amended return is filed on or before the extended due date of June 15, 1999.
(f)
Manner of making a section 1295 election and the annual election requirements of the shareholder
—(1)
Manner of making the election.

If the PFIC has not obtained a private letter ruling from the Commissioner approving an alternative method of verifying the PFIC's ordinary earnings and net capital gain by the time a shareholder is required to make a section 1295 election, the shareholder may not use an alternative method for that taxable year.
(3)
Annual Intermediary Statement.

A section 1295 election made prior to February 2, 1998 that was intended to be effective for the taxable year of the PFIC that began during the shareholder's election year will be effective for that taxable year of the foreign corporation provided that it is clear from all the facts and circumstances that the shareholder intended the election to be effective for that taxable year of the foreign corporation.
(i)
Invalidation, termination, or revocation of section 1295 election
—(1)
Invalidation or termination of election at the discretion of the Commissioner
—(i)
In general.
The Commissioner, in the Commissioner's discretion, may invalidate or terminate a section 1295 election applicable to a shareholder if the shareholder, the PFIC, or any intermediary fails to satisfy the requirements for making a section 1295 election or the annual election requirements of this section to which the shareholder, PFIC, or intermediary is subject, including the requirement to provide, on request, copies of the books and records of the PFIC or other documentation substantiating the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the PFIC.
(ii)
Deferral of section 1293 inclusion.
The Commissioner may invalidate any pass through entity section 1295 election with respect to an interest holder or beneficiary if the section 1293 inclusion with respect to that interest holder or beneficiary is not included in the gross income of either the pass through entity, an intermediate pass through entity, or the interest holder or beneficiary within two years of the end of the PFIC's taxable year due to nonconforming taxable years of the interest holder and the pass through entity or any intermediate pass through entity.
(iii)
When effective.
Termination of a shareholder's section 1295 election will
be effective for the taxable year of the PFIC determined by the Commissioner in the Commissioner's discretion. An invalidation of a shareholder's section 1295 election will be effective for the first taxable year to which the section 1295 election applied, and the shareholder whose election is invalidated will be treated as if the section 1295 election was never made.
(2)
Shareholder revocation
—(i)
In general.
In the Commissioner's discretion, upon a finding of a substantial change in circumstances, the Commissioner may consent to a shareholder's request to revoke a section 1295 election. Request for revocation must be made by the shareholder that made the election and at the time and in the manner provided in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Time for and manner of requesting consent to revoke
—(A)
Time.
The shareholder must request consent to revoke the section 1295 election no later than 12 calendar months after the discovery of the substantial change of circumstances that forms the basis for the shareholder's request to revoke the section 1295 election.
(B)
Manner of making request.
A shareholder requests consent to revoke a section 1295 election by filing a ruling request with the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (International). The ruling request must satisfy the requirements, including payment of the user fee, for filing ruling requests with that office.
(iii)
When effective.
Unless otherwise determined by the Commissioner, revocation of a section 1295 election will be effective for the first taxable year of the PFIC beginning after the date the Commissioner consents to the revocation.
(3)
Automatic termination.
If a United States person, or the United States shareholder on behalf of a controlled foreign corporation, makes an election pursuant to section 1296 and the regulations thereunder with respect to PFIC stock for which a QEF election is in effect, or marks to market such stock under another provision of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, the QEF election is automatically terminated with respect to such stock that is marked to market under section 1296 or another provision of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such termination shall be effective on the last day of the shareholder's taxable year preceding the first taxable year for which the section 1296 election is in effect or such stock is marked to market under another provision of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.

# Example.
Corp Y, a domestic corporation, owns directly 100 shares of marketable stock in foreign corporation FX, a PFIC. Corp Y also owns a 50 percent interest in FP, a foreign partnership that owns 200 shares of FX stock. Accordingly, under section 1298(a)(3) and § 1.1296-1(e)(1), Corp Y is treated as indirectly owning 100 shares of FX stock. Corp Y also owns 100 percent of the stock of FZ, a foreign corporation that is not a PFIC. FZ owns 100 shares of FX stock, and therefore under section 1298(a)(2)(A), Corp Y is treated as owning the 100 shares of FX stock owned by FZ. For taxable year 2005, Corp Y has a QEF election in effect with respect to all 300 shares of FX stock that it owns directly or indirectly. See generally § 1.1295-1(c)(1). For taxable year 2006, Corp Y makes a timely election pursuant to section 1296 and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of section 1296, Corp Y is treated as owning stock held indirectly through a partnership, but not through a foreign corporation. Section 1296(g); § 1.1296-1(e)(1). Accordingly, Corp Y's section 1296 election covers the 100 shares it owns directly and the 100 shares it owns indirectly through FP, but not the 100 shares owned by FZ. With respect to the first 200 shares, Corp Y's QEF election is automatically terminated effective December 31, 2005. With respect to the 100 shares Corp Y owns through foreign FZ, Corp Y's QEF election remains in effect unless invalidated, terminated, or revoked pursuant to this paragraph (i).
(4)
Effect of invalidation, termination, or revocation.
An invalidation, termination, or revocation of a section 1295 election—
(i) Terminates all section 1294 elections, as provided in § 1.1294-1T(e), and the undistributed PFIC earnings tax liability and interest thereon are due by the due date, without regard to extensions, for the return for the last taxable year of the shareholder to which the section 1295 election applies;
(ii) In the Commissioner's discretion, results in a deemed sale of the QEF stock on the last day of the PFIC's last taxable year as a QEF, in which gain, but not loss, will be recognized and with respect to which appropriate basis
and holding period adjustments will be made; and
(iii) Subjects the shareholder to any other terms and conditions that the Commissioner determines are necessary to ensure the shareholder's compliance with sections 1291 through 1298 or any other provisions of the Code.
(5)
Effect after invalidation, termination, or revocation
—(i)
In general.
Without the Commissioner's consent, a shareholder whose section 1295 election was invalidated, terminated, or revoked under this paragraph (i) may not make the section 1295 election with respect to the PFIC before the sixth taxable year in which the invalidation, termination, or revocation became effective.
(ii)
Special rule.
Notwithstanding paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section, a shareholder whose section 1295 election was terminated pursuant to paragraph (i)(3) of this section, and either whose section 1296 election has subsequently been terminated because its PFIC stock ceased to be marketable or who no longer marks to market such stock under another provision of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, may make a section 1295 election with respect to its PFIC stock before the sixth taxable year in which its prior section 1295 election was terminated.
(j)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
Intermediary
is a nominee or shareholder of record that holds stock on behalf of the shareholder or on behalf of another person in a chain of ownership between the shareholder and the PFIC, and any direct or indirect beneficial owner of PFIC stock (including a beneficial owner that is a pass through entity) in the chain of ownership between the shareholder and the PFIC.
Pass through entity
is a partnership, S corporation, trust, or estate.
Shareholder

Furthermore, unless otherwise provided, an interest holder of a pass through entity, which is treated as a shareholder of a PFIC, also will be treated as a shareholder of the PFIC.
Shareholder's election year
is the taxable year of the shareholder for which it made the section 1295 election.
(k)
Effective dates.
Except as otherwise provided, paragraphs (b)(2)(iii), (b)(3), (b)(4), and (c) through (j) of this section are applicable to taxable years of shareholders beginning after December 31, 1997. However, taxpayers may apply the rules under paragraphs (b)(4), (f) and (g) of this section to a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1998, provided the statute of limitations on the assessment of tax has not expired as of April 27, 1998, and, in the case of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the taxpayers who filed the joint return have consistently applied the rules of that section to all taxable years following the year the election was made. Paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section is applicable as of February 7, 2000, however, a taxpayer may apply the rules to a taxable year prior to the applicable date provided the statute of limitations on the assessment of tax for that taxable year has not expired. Paragraphs (i)(3) and (i)(5)(ii) of this section are applicable for taxable years beginning on or after May 3, 2004.

Therefore, a shareholder may not seek such relief under any other provision of the law, including § 301.9100 of this chapter. Paragraph (b) of this section describes the general rules for a shareholder to preserve the ability to make a retroactive election. These rules require that the shareholder possess reasonable belief as of the election due date that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC for its taxable year that ended in the shareholder's taxable year to which the election due date pertains, and that the shareholder file a Protective Statement to preserve its ability to make a retroactive election.

General rule.
Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, a shareholder may make a retroactive election for a taxable year of the shareholder (retroactive election year) only if the shareholder—
(1) Reasonably believed, within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section, that as of the election due date, as defined in § 1.1295-1(e), the foreign corporation was not a PFIC for its taxable year that ended during the retroactive election year;
(2) Filed a Protective Statement with respect to the foreign corporation, applicable to the retroactive election year, in which the shareholder described the basis for its reasonable belief and extended, in the manner provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the periods of limitations on the assessment of taxes determined under sections 1291 and 1298 with respect to the foreign corporation (PFIC related taxes) for all taxable years of the shareholder to which the Protective Statement applies; and

A Protective Statement is a statement executed under penalties of perjury by the shareholder, or a person authorized to sign a Federal income tax return on behalf of the shareholder, that preserves the shareholder's ability to make a retroactive election. To file a Protective Statement that applies to a taxable year of the shareholder, the shareholder must reasonably believe as of the election due date that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC for the foreign corporation's taxable year that ended during the retroactive election year. The Protective Statement must contain—

The reasonable belief statement is a description of the shareholder's basis for its reasonable belief that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC for its taxable year that ended with or within the shareholder's first taxable year to which the Protective Statement applies. If the Protective Statement applies to a taxable year or years described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, the reasonable belief statement must describe the shareholder's basis for its reasonable belief that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC for the foreign corporation's taxable year or years that ended in such taxable year or years of the shareholder. The
reasonable belief statement must discuss the application of the income and asset tests to the foreign corporation and the factors, including those stated in paragraph (d) of this section, that affect the results of those tests.

Addition of partner to non-TEFRA partnership.
In the case of any individual who becomes a partner in a domestic partnership other than a TEFRA partnership (non-TEFRA partnership) in a taxable year subsequent to the year in which the partnership filed a Protective Statement, the partner and the partnership must comply with the rules applicable to non-TEFRA partnerships, as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B)(

In each case, the partnership must attach any new waiver of a partner's periods of limitations, and a copy of the Protective Statement to its Federal income tax return for that taxable year.
(C)
Application of general rule to domestic nongrantor trusts and domestic estates.
A domestic nongrantor trust or a domestic estate that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC satisfies the waiver requirement of this paragraph (c)(4) at the entity level. For this purpose, such entity must comply with rules similar to those applicable to non-TEFRA partnerships, as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section.
(D)
Application of general rule to S corporations.
An S corporation that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC satisfies the waiver requirement of this paragraph (c)(4) at the S corporation level. For this purpose, the S corporation must comply with rules similar to those applicable to non-TEFRA partnerships, as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section. However, in the case of an S corporation that was governed by the unified audit corporate proceedings of sections 6241 through 6245 for any taxable year to which a Protective Statement applies (former TEFRA S corporation), the tax matters person (or any other person authorized to enter into such an agreement), as was provided in sections 6241 through 6245, may execute a waiver described in this paragraph (c)(4) that applies to such taxable year; for any other taxable year, the former TEFRA S corporation must comply with rules similar to those applicable to non-TEFRA partnerships.
(E)
Effect on waiver of complete termination of a pass through entity or pass through entity's business.
The complete termination of a pass through entity described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (B) through (D) of this section, or a pass through entity's trade or business, will not terminate a waiver that applies to a partner, shareholder, or beneficiary.
(F)
Application of general rule to foreign partnerships, foreign trusts, domestic or foreign grantor trusts, and foreign estates.
A U.S. person that is a partner or beneficiary of a foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC satisfies the waiver requirement of this paragraph (c)(4) at the partner or beneficiary level. A U.S. person that is treated under sections 671 through 679 as the owner of the portion of a domestic or foreign trust that owns an interest in PFIC stock also satisfies the waiver requirement at the owner level. A waiver by a partner or beneficiary applies only to that partner or beneficiary, and is not affected by a complete termination of the entity or the entity's trade or business.
(ii)
Terms of waiver
—(A)
Scope of waiver.
The waiver of the periods of limitations is limited to the assessment of PFIC related taxes. If the period of limitations for a taxable year affected by a retroactive election has expired with respect to the assessment of other non-PFIC related taxes, no adjustments, other than consequential changes, may be made by the Internal Revenue Service or by the shareholder to any other item of income, deduction, or credit for that year. If the period of limitations for refunds or credits for a taxable year affected by a retroactive election is open only by virtue of the assessment period extension and section 6511(c), no refund or credit is allowable on grounds other than adjustments to PFIC related taxes and consequential changes.
(B)
Period of Waiver.
The extension of the periods of limitations on the assessment of PFIC related taxes will be effective for all of the shareholder's taxable years to which the Protective Statement applies. In addition, the waiver, to the extent it applies to the period of limitations for a particular year, will terminate with respect to that year no sooner than three years from the date on which the shareholder files an amended return, as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, for that year. For the suspension of the running of the period of limitations for the collection of taxes for which a shareholder has elected under section 1294 to extend the time for payment, as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, see sections 6503(i) and 6229(h).
(5)
Time of and manner for filing a Protective Statement
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, a Protective Statement must be attached to the shareholder's federal income tax return for the shareholder's first taxable year to which the Protective Statement will apply. The shareholder must file its return and the copy of the Protective Statement by the due date, as extended under section 6081, for the return.
(ii)
Special rule for taxable years ended before January 2, 1998.
A shareholder may file a Protective Statement that applies to the shareholder's taxable year or years that ended before January 2, 1998, provided the period of limitations on the assessment of taxes for any such year has not expired (open year). The shareholder must file the Protective Statement applicable to such open year or years, as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, by the due date, as extended, for the shareholder's return for the first taxable year ending after January 2, 1998.
(6)
Applicability of the Protective Statement
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(6), a Protective Statement applies to the shareholder's first taxable year for which the Protective Statement was filed and to each subsequent taxable year. The Protective Statement will not apply to any taxable year of the shareholder during which the shareholder does not own any stock of the foreign corporation or to any taxable year thereafter. Accordingly, if the shareholder has not made a retroactive election with respect to the previously owned stock by the time the shareholder reacquires stock of the foreign corporation, the shareholder must file another Protective Statement to preserve its right to make a retroactive election with respect to the later acquired stock. For the rule that provides that a section 1295 election made with respect to a foreign corporation applies to stock of that corporation acquired after a lapse in ownership, see § 1.1295-1(c)(2)(iii).
(ii)
Invalidity of the Protective Statement.
A shareholder will be treated as if it never filed a Protective Statement if—
(A) The shareholder failed to make a retroactive election by the date prescribed for making the retroactive election in paragraph (g)(1) of this section; or
(B) The waiver of the periods of limitations terminates (by reason of a court decision or other determination) with respect to any taxable year before the expiration of three years from the date of filing of an amended return for that year pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.
(7)
Retention of Protective Statement and information demonstrating reasonable belief.
A shareholder that files a Protective Statement must retain a copy of the Protective Statement and its attachments and must, for each taxable year of the shareholder to which the Protective Statement applies, retain information sufficient to demonstrate the shareholder's reasonable belief that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC for the taxable year of the foreign corporation ending during each such taxable year of the shareholder.
(d)
Reasonable belief
—(1)
In general.
A foreign corporation is a PFIC for a taxable year if the foreign corporation satisfies either the income or asset test of section 1297(a). To determine whether a shareholder had reasonable belief that the foreign corporation is not a PFIC under section 1297(a), the shareholder must consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Reasonable belief may be based on a variety of factors, including reasonable asset valuations as well as reasonable interpretations of the applicable provisions of the Code, regulations, and administrative guidance regarding the direct and indirect ownership of the income or assets of the foreign corporation, the proper character of that income or those assets, and similar issues. Reasonable belief may be based on reasonable predictions regarding income to be earned and assets to be owned in subsequent years where qualifications of the foreign corporation as a PFIC for the current taxable year will depend on the qualification of the corporation as a PFIC in a subsequent year. Reasonable belief may be based on an analysis of generally available financial information of the foreign corporation. To determine whether a shareholder had reasonable belief
that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC, the Commissioner may consider the size of the shareholder's interest in the foreign corporation.
(2)
Knowledge of law required.
Reasonable belief must be based on a good faith effort to apply the Code, regulations, and related administrative guidance. Any person's failure to know or apply these provisions will not form the basis of reasonable belief.
(e)
Special rules for qualified shareholders
—(1)
In general.
A shareholder that is a qualified shareholder, as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, for a taxable year of the shareholder is not required to satisfy the reasonable belief requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section or file a Protective Statement to preserve its ability to make a retroactive election with respect to such taxable year. Accordingly, a qualified shareholder may make a retroactive election for any open taxable year in the shareholder's holding period. The retroactive election will be treated as made in the earliest taxable year of the shareholder during which the foreign corporation qualified as a PFIC (including a taxable year ending prior to January 2, 1998) and the shareholder will be treated as a shareholder of a pedigreed QEF, as defined in § 1.1291-9(j)(2)(ii), provided the shareholder—
(i) Has been a qualified shareholder with respect to the foreign corporation for all taxable years of the shareholder included in the shareholder's holding period during which the foreign corporation was a PFIC, or in the case of taxable years ending before January 2, 1998, the shareholder satisfies the criteria of a qualified shareholder, for all such years; or
(ii) Has been a qualified shareholder, or in the case of taxable years ending before January 2, 1998 satisfies the criteria of a qualified shareholder, for all taxable years in its holding period before it filed a Protective Statement, which Protective Statement is applicable to all subsequent years, beginning with the first taxable year in which the shareholder is not a qualified shareholder.
(2)
Qualified shareholder.
A shareholder will be treated as a qualified shareholder for a taxable year if the shareholder did not file a Protective Statement applicable to an earlier taxable year included in the shareholder's holding period of the stock of the foreign corporation currently held and—
(i) At all times during the taxable year the shareholder owned, within the meaning of section 958, directly, indirectly, or constructively, less than two percent of the vote and value of each class of stock of the foreign corporation; and
(ii) With respect to the taxable year of the foreign corporation ending within the shareholder's taxable year, the foreign corporation or U.S. counsel for the foreign corporation indicated in a public filing, disclosure statement or other notice provided to U.S. persons that are shareholders of the foreign corporation (corporate filing) that the foreign corporation—
(A) Reasonably believes that it is not or should not constitute a PFIC for the corporation's taxable year; or
(B) Is unable to conclude that it is not or should not be a PFIC (due to certain asset valuation or interpretation issues, or because PFIC status will depend on the income or assets of the foreign corporation in the corporation's subsequent taxable years) but reasonably believes that, more likely than not, it ultimately will not be a PFIC.
(3)
Exceptions.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, a shareholder will not be treated as a qualified shareholder for a taxable year of the shareholder if the shareholder knew or had reason to know that a corporate filing regarding the foreign corporation's PFIC status was inaccurate, or knew that the foreign corporation was a PFIC for the taxable year of the foreign corporation ending with or within such taxable year of the shareholder. For purposes of this paragraph, a shareholder will be treated as knowing that a foreign corporation was a PFIC if the principal activity of the foreign corporation, directly or indirectly, is owning or trading a diversified portfolio of stock, securities, or other financial contracts.
(f)
Special consent
—(1)
In general.
A shareholder that has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (b) or (e) of this section may request the consent of
the Commissioner to make a retroactive election for a taxable year of the shareholder provided the shareholder satisfies the requirements set forth in this paragraph (f). The Commissioner will grant relief under this paragraph (f) only if—
(i) The shareholder reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional, within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2) of this section;
(ii) Granting consent will not prejudice the interests of the United States government, as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section;
(iii) The shareholder requests consent under paragraph (f) of this section before a representative of the Internal Revenue Service raises upon audit the PFIC status of the corporation for any taxable year of the shareholder; and
(iv) The shareholder satisfies the procedural requirements set forth in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(2)
Reasonable reliance on a qualified tax professional
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, a shareholder is deemed to have reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional only if the shareholder reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional (including a tax professional employed by the shareholder) who failed to identify the foreign corporation as a PFIC or failed to advise the shareholder of the consequences of making, or failing to make, the section 1295 election. A shareholder will not be considered to have reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional if the shareholder knew, or reasonably should have known, that the foreign corporation was a PFIC and of the availability of a section 1295 election, or knew or reasonably should have known that the qualified tax professional—
(A) Was not competent to render tax advice with respect to the ownership of shares of a foreign corporation; or
(B) Did not have access to all relevant facts and circumstances.
(ii)
Shareholder deemed to have not reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a shareholder is deemed to have not reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional if the shareholder was informed by the qualified tax professional that the foreign corporation was a PFIC and of the availability of the section 1295 election and related tax consequences, but either chose not to make the section 1295 election or was unable to make a valid section 1295 election.
(3)
Prejudice to the interests of the United States government
—(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the Commissioner will not grant consent under paragraph (f) of this section if doing so would prejudice the interests of the United States government. The interests of the United States government are prejudiced if granting relief would result in the shareholder having a lower tax liability, taking into account applicable interest charges, in the aggregate for all years affected by the retroactive election (other than by a de minimis amount) than the shareholder would have had if the shareholder had made the section 1295 election by the election due date. The time value of money is taken into account for purposes of this computation.
(ii)
Elimination of prejudice to the interests of the United States government.
Notwithstanding the general rule of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, if granting relief would prejudice the interests of the United States government, the Commissioner may, in the Commissioner's sole discretion, grant consent to make the election provided the shareholder enters into a closing agreement with the Commissioner that requires the shareholder to pay an amount sufficient to eliminate any prejudice to the United States government as a consequence of the shareholder's inability to file amended returns for closed taxable years.
(4)
Procedural requirements
—(i)
Filing instructions.
A shareholder requests consent under paragraph (f) of this section to make a retroactive election by filing with the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (International) a ruling request that includes the affidavits required by this paragraph (f)(4). The ruling request must satisfy the requirements, including payment of the user fee, for ruling requests filed with that office.
(ii)
Affidavit from shareholder.
The shareholder, or a person authorized to
sign a Federal income tax return on behalf of the shareholder, must submit a detailed affidavit describing the events that led to the failure to make a section 1295 election by the election due date, and to the discovery thereof. The shareholder's affidavit must describe the engagement and responsibilities of the qualified tax professional as well as the extent to which the shareholder relied on the tax professional. The shareholder must sign the affidavit under penalties of perjury. An individual who signs for an entity must have personal knowledge of the facts and circumstances at issue.
(iii)
Affidavits from other persons.
The shareholder must submit detailed affidavits from individuals having knowledge or information about the events that led to the failure to make a section 1295 election by the election due date, and to the discovery thereof. These individuals must include the qualified tax professional upon whose advice the shareholder relied, as well as any individual (including an employee of the shareholder) who made a substantial contribution to the return's preparation, and any accountant or attorney, knowledgeable in tax matters, who advised the shareholder with regard to its ownership of the stock of the foreign corporation. Each affidavit must describe the individual's engagement and responsibilities as well as the advice concerning the tax treatment of the foreign corporation that that individual provided to the shareholder. Each affidavit also must include the individual's name, address, and taxpayer identification number, and must be signed by the individual under penalties of perjury.
(iv)
Other information.
In connection with a request for consent under this paragraph (f), a shareholder must provide any additional information requested by the Commissioner.
(v)
Notification of Internal Revenue Service.
The shareholder must notify the branch of the Associate Chief Counsel (International) considering the request for relief under this paragraph (f) if, while the shareholder's request for consent is pending, the Internal Revenue Service begins an examination of the shareholder's return for the retroactive election year or for any subsequent taxable year during which the shareholder holds stock of the foreign corporation.
(vi)
Who requests special consent under this paragraph (f) and who enters into a closing agreement.
The person that requests consent under this paragraph (f) is the person that makes the section 1295 election, as provided in § 1.1295-1(d). If a shareholder is required to enter into a closing agreement with the Commissioner, as described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, rules similar to those under paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (B) through (E) of this section apply for purposes of determining the person that enters into the closing agreement.
(g)
Time for and manner of making a retroactive election
—(1)
Time for making a retroactive election
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, a shareholder must make a retroactive election, in the manner provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, on or before the due date, as extended, for the shareholder's return—
(A) In the case of a shareholder that makes a retroactive election pursuant to paragraph (b) or (e) of this section, for the taxable year in which the shareholder determines or reasonably should have determined that the foreign corporation was a PFIC; or
(B) In the case of a shareholder that obtains the consent of the Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section for the taxable year in which such consent is granted.
(ii)
Transition rule.
A shareholder that files a Protective Statement for a taxable year described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section may make a retroactive election by the due date, as extended, for the return for the first taxable year ended after January 2, 1998 even if the shareholder determined or should have determined that the foreign corporation was a PFIC for a year described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section at any time on or before January 2, 1998.
(iii)
Ownership not required at time retroactive election is made.
The shareholder need not own shares of the foreign corporation at the time the shareholder makes a retroactive election with respect to the foreign corporation.
(2)
Manner of making a retroactive election.
A shareholder that has satisfied the requirements of paragraph (b) or (e) of this section, or a shareholder that has been granted consent under paragraph (f) of this section, must make a retroactive election in the manner provided in Form 8621 for making a section 1295 election, and must attach Form 8621 to an amended return for the later of the retroactive election year or the earliest open taxable year of the shareholder. The shareholder also must file an amended return for each of its subsequent taxable years affected by the retroactive election. In each amended return the shareholder must redetermine its income tax liability for that year to take into account the assessment of PFIC related taxes. If the period of limitations for the assessment of taxes for a taxable year affected by the retroactive election has expired except to the extent the waiver of limitations, described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, has extended such period, no adjustments, other than consequential changes, may be made to any other items of income, deduction, or credit in that year. In addition, the shareholder must pay all taxes and interest owing by reason of the PFIC and QEF status of the foreign corporation in those years (except to the extent a section 1294 election extends the time to pay the taxes and interest). A shareholder that filed a Protective Statement must attach to Form 8621 filed with each amended return a representation that the shareholder, until the taxable year in which it determined or reasonably should have determined that the foreign corporation was a PFIC, reasonably believed, within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section, that the foreign corporation was not a PFIC in the taxable year for which the amended return is filed, and in all other taxable years to which the Protective Statement applies. A shareholder that entered into a closing agreement must comply with the terms of that agreement, as provided in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, to eliminate any prejudice to the United States government's interests, as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(3)
Who makes the retroactive election.
The person that makes the retroactive election is the person that makes the section 1295 election, as provided in § 1.1295-1(d). A partner, shareholder, or beneficiary for which a pass through entity, as described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (B) through (D) of this section, filed a Protective Statement may make a retroactive election, if the pass through entity completely terminates its business or otherwise ceases to exist.
(4)
Other elections
—(i)
Section 1291(d)(2) election.
If the foreign corporation for which the shareholder makes a retroactive election will be treated as an unpedigreed QEF, as defined in § 1.1291-9(j)(2)(iii), with respect to the shareholder, the shareholder may make an election under section 1291(d)(2) to purge its holding period of the years or parts of years before the effective date of the retroactive election. If the qualification date, within the meaning of § 1.1291-9(e) or 1.1291-10(e), falls in a taxable year for which the period of limitations has expired, the shareholder may treat the first day of the retroactive election year as the qualification date. The shareholder may make a section 1291(d)(2) election at the time that it makes the retroactive election, but no later than two years after the date that the amended return in which the retroactive election is made is filed. For the requirements for making a section 1291(d)(2) election, see §§ 1.1291-9 and 1.1291-10.
(ii)
Section 1294 election.
A shareholder may make an election under section 1294 to extend the time for payment of tax on the shareholder's pro rata shares of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the foreign corporation reported in the shareholder's amended return, and section 6621 interest attributable to such tax, but only to the extent the tax and interest are attributable to earnings that have not been distributed to the shareholder. The shareholder must make a section 1294 election for a taxable year at the time that it files its amended return for that year, as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. For the requirements for making a section 1294 election, see § 1.1294-1T.
(h)
Effective date.
The rules of this section are effective as of January 2, 1998.
[T.D. 8750, 63 FR 19, Jan. 2, 1998. Redesignated and amended by T.D. 8870, 65 FR 5781, Feb. 7, 2000]
§ 1.1296-1
Mark to market election for marketable stock.
(a)
Definitions
—(1)
Eligible RIC.
An
eligible RIC
is a regulated investment company that offers for sale, or has outstanding, any stock of which it is the issuer and which is redeemable at net asset value, or that publishes net asset valuations at least annually.
(2)
Section 1296 stock.
The term
section 1296 stock
means marketable stock in a passive foreign investment company (PFIC), including any PFIC stock owned directly or indirectly by an eligible RIC, for which there is a valid section 1296 election. Section 1296 stock does not include stock of a foreign corporation that previously had been a PFIC, and for which a section 1296 election remains in effect.
(3)
Unreversed inclusions
—(i)
General rule.
The term
unreversed inclusions
means with respect to any section 1296 stock, the excess, if any, of—
(A) The amount of mark to market gain included in gross income of the United States person under paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to such stock for prior taxable years; over
(B) The amount allowed as a deduction to the United States person under paragraph (c)(3) of this section with respect to such stock for prior taxable years.
(ii)
Section 1291 adjustment.
The amount referred to in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section shall include any amount subject to section 1291 under the coordination rule of paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Example.
An example of the computation of unreversed inclusions is as follows:

# Example.
A, a United States person, acquired stock in Corp X, a foreign corporation, on January 1, 2005 for $150. At such time and at all times thereafter, Corp X was a PFIC and A's stock in Corp X was marketable. For taxable years 2005 and 2006, Corp X was a nonqualified fund subject to taxation under section 1291. A made a timely section 1296 election with respect to the X stock, effective for taxable year 2007. The fair market value of the X stock was $200 as of December 31, 2006, and $240 as of December 31, 2007. Additionally, Corp X made no distribution with respect to its stock for the taxable years at issue. In 2007, pursuant to paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section, A must include the $90 gain in the X stock in accordance with the rules of section 1291 for purposes of determining the deferred tax amount and any applicable interest. Nonetheless, for purposes of determining the amount of the unreversed inclusions pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, A will include the $90 of gain that was taxed under section 1291 and not the interest thereon.
(iv)
Special rule for regulated investment companies.
In the case of a regulated investment company which had elected to mark to market the PFIC stock held by such company as of the last day of the taxable year preceding such company's first taxable year for which such company makes a section 1296 election, the amount referred to in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section shall include amounts previously included in gross income by the company pursuant to such mark to market election with respect to such stock for prior taxable years. For further guidance, see Notice 92-53 (1992-2 C.B. 384) (
see
also 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(b)
Application of section 1296 election
—(1)
In general.
Any United States person and any controlled foreign corporation (CFC) that owns directly, or is treated as owning under this section, marketable stock, as defined in § 1.1296-2, in a PFIC may make an election to mark to market such stock in accordance with the provisions of section 1296 and this section.
(2)
Election applicable to specific United States person.
A section 1296 election applies only to the United States person (or CFC that is treated as a U.S. person under paragraph (g)(2) of this section) that makes the election. Accordingly, a United States person's section 1296 election will not apply to a transferee of section 1296 stock.
(3)
Election applicable to specific corporation only.
A section 1296 election is made with respect to a single foreign corporation, and thus a separate section 1296 election must be made for each foreign corporation that otherwise meets the requirements of this section. A United States person's section 1296 election with respect to stock
in a foreign corporation applies to all marketable stock of the corporation that the person owns directly, or is treated as owning under paragraph (e) of this section, at the time of the election or that is subsequently acquired.
(c)
Effect of election
—(1)
Recognition of gain.
If the fair market value of section 1296 stock on the last day of the United States person's taxable year exceeds its adjusted basis, the United States person shall include in gross income for its taxable year the excess of the fair market value of such stock over its adjusted basis (mark to market gain).
(2)
Character of gain.
Mark to market gain, and any gain on the sale or other disposition of section 1296 stock, shall be treated as ordinary income.
(3)
Recognition of loss.
If the adjusted basis of section 1296 stock exceeds its fair market value on the last day of the United States person's taxable year, such person shall be allowed a deduction for such taxable year equal to the lesser of the amount of such excess or the unreversed inclusions with respect to such stock (mark to market loss).
(4)
Character of loss
—(i)
Losses not in excess of unreversed inclusions.
Any mark to market loss allowed as a deduction under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and any loss on the sale or other disposition of section 1296 stock, to the extent that such loss does not exceed the unreversed inclusions attributable to such stock, shall be treated as an ordinary loss, deductible in computing adjusted gross income.
(ii)
Losses in excess of unreversed inclusions.
Any loss recognized on the sale or other disposition of section 1296 stock in excess of any prior unreversed inclusions will be subject to the rules generally applicable to losses provided elsewhere in the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.
(5)
Application of election to separate lots of stock.
In the case in which a United States person purchased or acquired shares of stock in a PFIC at different prices, the rules of this section shall be applied in a manner consistent with the rules of § 1.1012-1.
(6)
Source rules.
The source of any amount included in gross income under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the allocation and apportionment of any amount allowed as a deduction under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, shall be determined in the same manner as if such amounts were gain or loss (as the case may be) from the sale of stock in the PFIC.
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c):

# Example 1. Treatment of gain as ordinary income.
A, a United States individual, purchases stock in FX, a foreign corporation that is not a PFIC, in 1990 for $1,000. On January 1, 2005, when the fair market value of the FX stock is $1,100, FX becomes a PFIC. A makes a timely section 1296 election for taxable year 2005. On December 31, 2005, the fair market value of the FX stock is $1,200. For taxable year 2005, A includes $200 of mark to market gain (the excess of the fair market value of FX stock ($1,200) over A's adjusted basis ($1,000)) in gross income as ordinary income and pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section increases his basis in the FX stock by that amount.

# Example 2. Treatment of gain as capital gain.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
For taxable year 2006, FX does not satisfy either the asset test or the income test of section 1297(a). A does not revoke the section 1296 election it made with respect to the FX stock. On December 1, 2006, A sells the FX stock when the fair market value of the stock is $1,500. For taxable year 2006, A includes $300 of gain (the excess of the fair market value of FX stock ($1,500) over A's adjusted basis ($1,200)) in gross income as long-term capital gain because at the time of sale of the FX stock by A, FX did not qualify as a PFIC, and, therefore, the FX stock was not section 1296 stock at the time of the disposition. Further, A's holding period for non-PFIC purposes was more than one year.

# Example 3. Treatment of losses as ordinary where they do not exceed unreversed inclusions.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
On December 1, 2006, A sells the stock in FX for $1,100. At that time, A's unreversed inclusions (the amount A included in income as mark to market gain) with respect to the stock in FX are $200. Accordingly, for taxable year 2006, A recognizes a loss on the sale of the FX stock of $100, (the fair market value of the FX stock ($1,100) minus A's adjusted basis ($1,200) in the stock) that is treated as an ordinary loss because the loss does not exceed the unreversed inclusions attributable to the stock of FX.

# Example 4. Treatment of losses as long-term capital losses.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that FX does not satisfy either the asset test or the income test of section 1297(a) for taxable year 2006. For taxable year 2006, A's $100 loss from the sale of the FX stock is treated as long-term capital loss because at the time of the sale of the FX stock by A FX did not qualify as a PFIC,
and, therefore, the FX stock was not section 1296 stock at the time of the disposition. Further, A's holding period in the FX stock for non-PFIC purposes was more than one year.

# Example 5. Long-term capital loss treatment of losses in excess of unreversed inclusions.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that A sells his FX stock for $900. At the time of A's sale of the FX stock on December 1, 2006, A's unreversed inclusions with respect to the FX stock are $200. Accordingly, the $300 loss recognized by A on the disposition is treated as an ordinary loss to the extent of his unreversed inclusions ($200). The amount of the loss in excess of A's unreversed inclusions ($100) will be treated as a long-term capital loss because A's holding period in the FC stock for non-PFIC purposes was more than one year.

# Example 6. Application of section 1296 election to separate lots of stock.
On January 1, 2005, Corp A, a domestic corporation, purchased 100 shares (first lot) of stock in FX, a PFIC, for $500 ($5 per share). On June 1, 2005, Corp A purchased 100 shares (second lot) of FX stock for $1,000 ($10 per share). Corp A made a timely section 1296 election with respect to its FX stock for taxable year 2005. On December 31, 2005, the fair market value of FX stock was $8 per share. For taxable year 2005, Corp A includes $300 of gain in gross income as ordinary income under paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to the first lot, and adjusts its basis in that lot to $800 pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section. With respect to the second lot, Corp A is not permitted to recognize a loss under paragraph (c)(3) of this section for taxable year 2005. Although Corp A's adjusted basis in that stock exceeds its fair market value by $200, Corp A has no unreversed inclusions with respect to that particular lot of stock. On July 1, 2006, Corp A sells 100 shares of FX stock for $900. Assuming that Corp A adequately identifies (in accordance with the rules of § 1.1012-1(c)) the shares of FX stock sold as being from the second lot, Corp A recognizes $100 of long term capital loss pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.
(d)
Adjustment to basis
—(1)
Stock held directly.
The adjusted basis of the section 1296 stock shall be increased by the amount included in the gross income of the United States person under paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to such stock, and decreased by the amount allowed as a deduction to the United States person under paragraph (c)(3) of this section with respect to such stock.
(2)
Stock owned through certain foreign entities.
(i) In the case of section 1296 stock that a United States person is treated as owning through certain foreign entities pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the basis adjustments under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall apply to such stock in the hands of the foreign entity actually holding such stock, but only for purposes of determining the subsequent treatment under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States person with respect to such stock. Such increase or decrease in the adjusted basis of the section 1296 stock shall constitute an adjustment to the basis of partnership property only with respect to the partner making the section 1296 election. Corresponding adjustments shall be made to the adjusted basis of the United States person's interest in the foreign entity and in any intermediary entity described in paragraph (e) of this section through which the United States person holds the PFIC stock.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates this paragraph (d)(2):

# Example.
FP is a foreign partnership. Corp A, a domestic corporation, owns a 20 percent interest in FP. Corp B, a domestic corporation, owns a 30 percent interest in FP. Corp C, a foreign corporation, with no direct or indirect shareholders that are U.S. persons, owns a 50% interest in FP. Corp A, Corp B, and FP all use a calendar year for their taxable year. In 2005, FP purchases stock in FX, a foreign corporation and a PFIC, for $1,000. Corp A makes a timely section 1296 election for taxable year 2005. On December 31, 2005, the fair market value of the PFIC stock is $1,100. Corp A includes $20 of ordinary income in taxable year 2005 under paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. Corp A increases its basis in its FP partnership interest by $20. FP increases its basis in the FX stock to $1,020 solely for purposes of determining the subsequent treatment of Corp A, under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to such stock. In 2006, FP sells the FX stock for $1,200. For purposes of determining the amount of gain of Corp A, FP will be treated as having $180 in gain of which $20 is allocated to Corp A. Corp A's $20 of gain will be treated as ordinary income under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. For purposes of determining the amount of gain attributable to Corp B, FP will be treated as having $200 gain, $60 of which will be allocated to Corp B.
(3)
Stock owned indirectly by an eligible RIC.
Paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall also apply to an eligible RIC which is an indirect shareholder under § 1.1296-2(f) of stock in a PFIC and has
a valid section 1296 election in effect with respect to the PFIC stock.
(4)
Stock acquired from a decedent.
In the case of stock of a PFIC that is acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance (or by the decedent's estate) and with respect to which a section 1296 election was in effect as of the date of the decedent's death, notwithstanding section 1014 or section 1022, the basis of such stock in the hands of the person so acquiring it shall be the adjusted basis of such stock in the hands of the decedent immediately before his death (or, if lesser, the basis that would have been determined under section 1014 or section 1022 without regard to this paragraph (d)).
(5)
Transition rule for individuals becoming subject to United States income taxation
—(i)
In general.
If any individual becomes a United States person in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1997, solely for purposes of this section, the adjusted basis, before adjustments under this paragraph (d), of any section 1296 stock owned by such individual on the first day of such taxable year shall be treated as being the greater of its fair market value or its adjusted basis on such first day.
(ii) An example of the transition rule for individuals becoming subject to United States income taxation is as follows:

# Example.
A, a nonresident alien individual, purchases marketable stock in FX, a PFIC, for $50 in 1995. On January 1, 2005, A becomes a United States person and makes a timely section 1296 election with respect to the stock in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The fair market value of the FX stock on January 1, 2005, is $100. The fair market value of the FX stock on December 31, 2005, is $110. Under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, A computes the amount of mark to market gain or loss for the FX stock in 2005 by reference to an adjusted basis of $100, and therefore A includes $10 in gross income as mark to market gain under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Additionally, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, A's adjusted basis in the FX stock for purposes of this section is increased to $110 (and to $60 for all other tax purposes). A sells the FX stock in 2006 for $120. For purposes of applying section 1001, A must use its original basis of $50, with any adjustments under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $10 in this case, and therefore A recognizes $60 of gain. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section (which is applied using an adjusted basis of $110), $10 of such gain is treated as ordinary income. The remaining $50 of gain from the sale of the FX stock is long term capital gain because A held such stock for more than one year.
(e)
Stock owned through certain foreign entities
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the following rules shall apply in determining stock ownership for purposes of this section. PFIC stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a foreign partnership, foreign trust (other than a foreign trust described in sections 671 through 679), or foreign estate shall be considered as being owned proportionately by its partners or beneficiaries. PFIC stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a foreign trust described in sections 671 through 679 shall be considered as being owned proportionately by its grantors or other persons treated as owners under sections 671 through 679 of any portion of the trust that includes the stock. The determination of a person's proportionate interest in a foreign partnership, foreign trust or foreign estate will be made on the basis of all the facts and circumstances. Stock considered owned by reason of this paragraph shall, for purposes of applying the rules of this section, be treated as actually owned by such person.
(2)
Stock owned indirectly by eligible RICs.
The rules for attributing ownership of stock contained in § 1.1296-2(f) will apply to determine the indirect ownership of PFIC stock by an eligible RIC.
(f)
Holding period.
Solely for purposes of sections 1291 through 1298, if section 1296 applied to stock with respect to the taxpayer for any prior taxable year, the taxpayer's holding period in such stock shall be treated as beginning on the first day of the first taxable year beginning after the last taxable year for which section 1296 so applied.
(g)
Special rules
—(1)
Certain dispositions of stock.
To the extent a United States person is treated as actually owning stock in a PFIC under paragraph (e) of this section, any disposition which results in the United States person being treated as no longer owning such stock, and any disposition by the person owning such stock, shall be
treated as a disposition by the United States person of the stock in the PFIC.
(2)
Treatment of CFC as a United States person.
In the case of a CFC that owns, or is treated as owning under paragraph (e) of this section, section 1296 stock:
(i) Other than with respect to the sourcing rules in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, this section shall apply to the CFC in the same manner as if such corporation were a United States person. The CFC will be treated as a foreign person for purposes of applying the source rules of paragraph (c)(6).
(ii) For purposes of subpart F of part III of subchapter N of the Internal Revenue Code—
(A) Amounts included in the CFC's gross income under paragraph (c)(1) or (i)(2)(ii) of this section shall be treated as foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1)(A); and
(B) Amounts allowed as a deduction under paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall be treated as a deduction allocable to foreign personal holding company income for purposes of computing net foreign base company income under § 1.954-1(c).
(iii) A United States shareholder, as defined in section 951(b), of the CFC shall not be subject to section 1291 with respect to any stock of the PFIC for the period during which the section 1296 election is in effect for that stock, and the holding period rule of paragraph (f) of this section shall apply to such United States shareholder.
(iv) The rules of this paragraph (g)(2) shall not apply to a United States person that is a shareholder of the PFIC for purposes of section 1291, but is not a United States shareholder under section 951(b) with respect to the CFC making a section 1296 election.
(3)
Timing of inclusions for stock owned through certain foreign entities.
In the case of section 1296 stock that a United States person is treated as owning through certain foreign entities pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the mark to market gain or mark to market loss is determined in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (i)(2)(ii) of this section as of the last day of the taxable year of the foreign partnership, foreign trust or foreign estate and then included in the taxable year of such United States person that includes the last day of the taxable year of the entity.
(h)
Elections
—(1)
Timing and manner for making a section 1296 election
—(i)
United States persons.
A United States person that owns marketable stock in a PFIC, or is treated as owning marketable stock under paragraph (e) of this section, on the last day of the taxable year of such person, and that wants to make a section 1296 election, must make a section 1296 election for such taxable year on or before the due date (including extensions) of the United States person's income tax return for that year. The section 1296 election must be made on the Form 8621, “Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund”, included with the original tax return of the United States person for that year, or on an amended return, provided that the amended return is filed on or before the election due date.
(ii)
Controlled foreign corporations.
A section 1296 election by a CFC shall be made by its controlling United States shareholders, as defined in § 1.964-1(c)(5), and shall be included with the Form 5471, “Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Corporations”, for that CFC by the due date (including extensions) of the original income tax returns of the controlling United States shareholders for that year. A section 1296 election by a CFC shall be binding on all United States shareholders of the CFC.
(iii)
Retroactive elections for PFIC stock held in prior years.
A late section 1296 election may be permitted only in accordance with § 301.9100 of this chapter.
(2)
Effect of section 1296 election
—(i) A section 1296 election will apply to the taxable year for which such election is made and remain in effect for each succeeding taxable year unless such election is revoked or terminated pursuant to paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Cessation of a foreign corporation as a PFIC.
A United States person will not include mark to market gain or loss pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section with respect to any stock of a foreign corporation for any taxable year that such foreign corporation is
not a PFIC under section 1297 or treated as a PFIC under section 1298(b)(1) (taking into account the holding period rule of paragraph (f) of this section). Cessation of a foreign corporation's status as a PFIC will not, however, terminate a section 1296 election. Thus, if a foreign corporation is a PFIC in a taxable year after a year in which it is not treated as a PFIC, the United States person's original election (unless revoked or terminated in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section) continues to apply and the shareholder must include any mark to market gain or loss in such year.
(3)
Revocation or termination of election
—(i)
In general.
A United States person's section 1296 election is terminated if the section 1296 stock ceases to be marketable; if the United States person elects, or is required, to mark to market the section 1296 stock under another provision of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code; or if the Commissioner, in the Commissioner's discretion, consents to the United States person's request to revoke its section 1296 election upon a finding of a substantial change in circumstances. A substantial change in circumstances for this purpose may include a foreign corporation ceasing to be a PFIC.
(ii)
Timing of termination or revocation.
Where a section 1296 election is terminated automatically (
e.g.,
the stock ceases to be marketable), section 1296 will cease to apply beginning with the taxable year in which such termination occurs. Where a section 1296 election is revoked with the consent of the Commissioner, section 1296 will cease to apply beginning with the first taxable year of the United States person after the revocation is granted unless otherwise provided by the Commissioner.
(4)
Examples.
The operation of the rules of this paragraph (h) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a United States person, owns stock in FX, a PFIC. A makes a QEF election in 1996 with respect to the FX stock. For taxable year 2005, A makes a timely section 1296 election with respect to its stock, and thus its QEF election is automatically terminated pursuant to § 1.1295-1(i)(3). In 2006, A's stock in FX ceases to be marketable, and therefore its section 1296 election is automatically terminated under paragraph (h)(3) of this section. Beginning with taxable year 2006, A is subject to the rules of section 1291 with respect to its FX stock unless it makes a new QEF election. See § 1.1295-1(i)(5).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that A's stock in FX becomes marketable again in 2007. A may make a new section 1296 election with respect to the FX stock for its taxable year 2007, or thereafter. A will be subject to the coordination rules under paragraph (i) of this section unless it made a new QEF election in 2006.
(i)
Coordination rules for first year of election
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary, the rules of this paragraph (i) shall apply to the first taxable year in which a section 1296 election is effective with respect to marketable stock of a PFIC if such foreign corporation was a PFIC for any taxable year, prior to such first taxable year, during the United States person's holding period (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) in such stock, and for which such corporation was not treated as a QEF with respect to such United States person.
(2)
Shareholders other than regulated investment companies.
For the first taxable year of a United States person (other than a regulated investment company) for which a section 1296 election is in effect with respect to the stock of a PFIC, such United States person shall, in lieu of the rules of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section—
(i) Apply the rules of section 1291 to any distributions with respect to, or disposition of, section 1296 stock;
(ii) Apply section 1291 to the amount of the excess, if any, of the fair market value of such section 1296 stock on the last day of the United States person's taxable year over its adjusted basis, as if such amount were gain recognized from the disposition of stock on the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year; and
(iii) Increase its adjusted basis in the section 1296 stock by the amount of excess, if any, subject to section 1291 under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Shareholders that are regulated investment companies.
For the first taxable year of a regulated investment company for which a section 1296 election is in effect with respect to the stock of a PFIC, such regulated investment company shall increase its tax
under section 852 by the amount of interest that would have been imposed under section 1291(c)(3) for such taxable year if such regulated investment company were subject to the rules of paragraph (i)(2) of this section, and not this paragraph (i)(3). No deduction or increase in basis shall be allowed for the increase in tax imposed under this paragraph (i)(3).
(4) The operation of the rules of this paragraph (i) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
A, a United States person and a calendar year taxpayer, owns marketable stock in FX, a PFIC that it acquired on January 1, 1992. At all times, A's FX stock was a nonqualified fund subject to taxation under section 1291. A made a timely section 1296 election effective for taxable year 2005. At the close of taxable year 2005, the fair market value of A's FX stock exceeded its adjusted basis by $10. Pursuant to paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section, A must treat the $10 gain under section 1291 as if the FX stock were disposed of on December 31, 2005. Further, A increases its adjusted basis in the FX stock by the $10 in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section.

# Example (2).
Assume the same facts as in
Example (1),
except that A is a RIC that had not made an election prior to 2005 to mark to market the PFIC stock. In taxable year 2005, A includes $10 of ordinary income under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and such amount is not subject to section 1291. A also increases its tax imposed under section 852 by the amount of interest that would have been determined under section 1291(c)(3), and no deduction is permitted for such amount. Finally, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, A increases its adjusted basis in the FX stock by $10.
(j)
Effective/applicability date.
The provisions in this section are applicable for taxable years beginning on or after May 3, 2004. The provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section relating to section 1022 are effective on and after January 19, 2017.
[T.D. 9123, 69 FR 24074, May 3, 2004, as amended by T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6242, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.1296-2
Definition of marketable stock.
(a)
General rule.
For purposes of section 1296, the term
marketable stock
means—

(3) Options on stock that is described in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, to the extent provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Regularly traded
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a class of stock that is traded on one or more qualified exchanges or other markets, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, is regularly traded on such exchanges or markets for any calendar year during which such class of stock is traded, other than in de minimis quantities, on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter.
(2)
Special rule for year of initial public offering.
For the calendar year in which a corporation initiates a public offering of a class of stock for trading on one or more qualified exchanges or other markets, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, such class of stock meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section for such year if the stock is regularly traded on such exchanges or markets, other than in de minimis quantities, on
1/6
of the days remaining in the quarter in which the offering occurs, and on at least 15 days during each remaining quarter of the taxpayer's calendar year. In cases where a corporation initiates a public offering of a class of stock in the fourth quarter of the calendar year, such class of stock meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section in the calendar year of the offering if the stock is regularly traded on such exchanges or markets, other than in de minimis quantities, on the greater of
1/6
of the days remaining in the quarter in which the offering occurs, or 5 days.
(3)
Anti-abuse rule.
Trades that have as one of their principal purposes the meeting of the trading requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section shall be disregarded. Further, a class of stock shall not be treated as meeting the trading requirement of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section if there is a pattern of trades conducted to meet the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) or
(2) of this section. Similarly, paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to a public offering of stock that has as one of its principal purposes to avail itself of the reduced trading requirements under the special rule for the calendar year of an initial public offering. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, consideration will be given to whether the trading requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are satisfied in the subsequent calendar year.
(c)
Qualified exchange or other market
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the term
qualified exchange or other market
means, for any calendar year—
(i) A national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the national market system established pursuant to section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f); or
(ii) A foreign securities exchange that is regulated or supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the market is located and which has the following characteristics—
(A) The exchange has trading volume, listing, financial disclosure, surveillance, and other requirements designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open, fair and orderly, market, and to protect investors; and the laws of the country in which the exchange is located and the rules of the exchange ensure that such requirements are actually enforced; and
(B) The rules of the exchange effectively promote active trading of listed stocks.
(2)
Exchange with multiple tiers.
If an exchange in a foreign country has more than one tier or market level on which stock may be separately listed or traded, each such tier shall be treated as a separate exchange.
(d)
Stock in certain PFICs
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a foreign corporation is a corporation described in section 1296(e)(1)(B), and paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the foreign corporation offers for sale or has outstanding stock of which it is the issuer and which is redeemable at its net asset value and if the foreign corporation satisfies the following conditions with respect to the class of shares held by the electing taxpayer—

(iv) No less frequently than annually, independent auditors prepare financial statements of the foreign corporation that include balance sheets (statements of assets, liabilities, and net assets) and statements of income and expenses, and those statements are made available to the public;
(v) The foreign corporation is supervised or regulated as an investment company by a foreign government or an agency or instrumentality thereof that has broad inspection and enforcement authority and effective oversight over investment companies;
(vi) At all times during the calendar year, the foreign corporation has no senior securities authorized or outstanding, including any debt other than in de minimis amounts;
(vii) Ninety percent or more of the gross income of the foreign corporation for its taxable year is passive income, as defined in section 1297(a)(1) and the regulations thereunder; and
(viii) The average percentage of assets held by the foreign corporation during its taxable year which produce passive income or which are held for the production of passive income, as
defined in section 1297(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder, is at least 90 percent.
(2)
Anti-abuse rule.
If a foreign corporation undertakes any actions that have as one of their principal purposes the manipulation of the net asset value of a class of its shares, for the calendar year in which the manipulation occurs, the shares are not marketable stock for purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(e) [Reserved]
(f)
Special rules for regulated investment companies (RICs)
—(1)
General rule.
In the case of any RIC that is offering for sale, or has outstanding, any stock of which it is the issuer and which is redeemable at net asset value, if the RIC owns directly or indirectly, as defined in section 1298(a), stock in any passive foreign investment company, that stock will be treated as marketable stock owned by that RIC for purposes of section 1296. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, in the case of any other RIC that publishes net asset valuations at least annually, if the RIC owns directly or indirectly, as defined in section 1298(a), stock in any passive foreign investment company, that stock will be treated as marketable stock owned by that RIC for purposes of section 1296.
(2) [Reserved]
(g)
Effective date.
This section applies to shareholders whose taxable year ends on or after January 25, 2000 for stock in a foreign corporation whose taxable year ends with or within the shareholder's taxable year. In addition, shareholders may elect to apply these regulations to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1997, for stock in a foreign corporation whose taxable year ends with or within the shareholder's taxable year.

§ 1.1297-1
Definition of passive foreign investment company.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules concerning the income test set forth in section 1297(a)(1) and the asset test set forth in section 1297(a)(2). Paragraph (b) of this section provides a rule relating to the definition of gross income with respect to certain dividends that are excluded from gross income under section 1502 for purposes of section 1297. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules relating to the definition of passive income for purposes of section 1297. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules relating to the asset test of section 1297. See §§ 1.1297-2 and 1.1297-6 for additional rules concerning the treatment of the income and assets of a corporation subject to look-through treatment under section 1297(c). Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules relating to the determination of passive foreign investment company (PFIC) status for stapled entities. Paragraph (f) of this section provides definitions applicable for this section, and paragraph (g) of this section provides the applicability date of this section.
(b)
Dividends included in gross income
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of section 1297, gross income includes dividends that are excluded from gross income under section 1502 and § 1.1502-13.
(2)
Example
—(i)
Facts.
USP is a domestic corporation that owns 30% of TFC, a foreign corporation. The remaining 70% of TFC is owned by FP, a foreign corporation that is unrelated to USP. TFC owns 25% of the value of USS1, a domestic corporation. USS1 owns 80% of the value of USS2, a domestic corporation. USS1 and USS2 are members of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)) filing a consolidated return. USS2 distributes a dividend to USS1 that is excluded from USS1's income pursuant to § 1.1502-13 for purposes of determining the U.S. Federal income tax liability of the affiliated group of which USS1 and USS2 are members.
(ii)
Results.
Although the dividend received by USS1 from USS2 is excluded from USS1's income for purposes of determining the U.S. Federal income tax liability of the affiliated group of which USS1 and USS2 are members, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for purposes of section 1297, USS1's gross income includes the USS2 dividend. Accordingly, for purposes of section 1297, TFC's gross income includes 25% of the dividend received by USS1 from USS2 pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(ii). See section 1298(b)(7) and § 1.1298-4 for rules concerning the characterization of the USS2 dividend.
(c)
Passive income
—(1)
Foreign personal holding company income
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of section 1297(b)(1), except as otherwise provided in section 1297(b)(2), this section, and § 1.1297-6, the term
passive income
means income of a kind that would be foreign personal holding company income as defined under section 954(c). For the purpose of this paragraph (c)(1)—
(A) The exceptions to foreign personal holding company income in section 954(c)(1), 954(c)(2)(A) (relating to active rents and royalties), 954(c)(2)(B) (relating to export financing income), and 954(c)(2)(C) (relating to dealers) are taken into account;
(B) The exceptions in section 954(c)(3) (relating to certain income received from related persons), 954(c)(6) (relating to certain amounts received from related controlled foreign corporations), and 954(i) (relating to entities engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business) are not taken into account;
(C) The rules in section 954(c)(4) (relating to sales of certain partnership interests) and 954(c)(5) (relating to certain commodity hedging transactions) are taken into account; and
(D) An entity is treated as a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957(a) for purposes of applying an exception to foreign personal holding company income in section 954(c)(1)(B)'s flush language, (1)(C)(ii), (1)(D), (4), and (5) and § 1.954-2 and for purposes of identifying whether a person is a related person with respect to such entity within the meaning of section 954(d)(3).
(ii)
Determination of gross income or gain on a net basis for certain items of foreign personal holding company income.
For purposes of section 1297, the excess of gains over losses from property transactions described in section 954(c)(1)(B), the excess of gains over losses from transactions in commodities described in section 954(c)(1)(C), the excess of foreign currency gains over foreign currency losses described in section 954(c)(1)(D), and positive net income from notional principal contracts described in section 954(c)(1)(F) are taken into account as gross income. The excess of gains over losses (or, with respect to notional principal contracts, positive net income) for a category of transactions is calculated by a tested foreign corporation taking into account individual items of gain or loss (or, with respect to notional principal contracts, net income or net deduction) recognized by the tested foreign corporation and those items of gain or loss (or, with respect to notional principal contracts, net income or net deduction) treated as recognized by the tested foreign corporation with respect to its look-through subsidiaries and look-through partnerships pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2) or (3).
(iii)
Amounts treated as dividends.
For purposes of section 1297, the term dividend includes all amounts treated as dividends for purposes of this chapter, including amounts treated as dividends pursuant to sections 302, 304, 356(a)(2), 964(e), and 1248.
(2) [Reserved]
(3)
Passive treatment of dividends and distributive share of partnership income.
For purposes of section 1297, a tested foreign corporation's share of dividends received from a corporation that is not a look-through subsidiary (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(3)) and distributive share of any item of income of a partnership that is not a look-through partnership (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(4)) with respect to a tested foreign corporation are treated as passive income, except to the extent that the item of income would not be treated as passive under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(4)
Exception for certain interest, dividends, rents, and royalties received from a
related person
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), interest, dividends, rents, or royalties actually received or accrued by a tested foreign corporation are considered received or accrued from a related person only if the payor of the interest, dividend, rent, or royalty is a related person (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)) with respect to the tested foreign corporation, taking into account paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section. For rules determining when amounts received or accrued by a look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership (and treated as received directly by a tested foreign corporation pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2) and (b)(3)) are treated as received from a related person, see § 1.1297-2(d).
(ii)
Ordering rule.
Gross income that is interest, a dividend, or a rent or royalty that is, in each case, received or accrued from a related person is allocated to income that is not passive under the rules of this paragraph (c)(4). If the related person is also a look-through subsidiary or a look-through partnership with respect to the tested foreign corporation, this paragraph (c)(4) applies after the application of the intercompany income rules of § 1.1297-2(c).
(iii)
Allocation of interest.
For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), interest that is received or accrued, as applicable based on the recipient's method of accounting, from a related person is allocated to income of the related person that is not passive income in proportion to the ratio of the portion of the related person's non-passive gross income for its taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the recipient to the total amount of the related person's gross income for the taxable year. If the related person does not have gross income for the taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the recipient, the interest is either allocated to income of the related person that is not passive income to the extent the related person's deduction for the interest would be allocable to non-passive income of the related person under the principles of §§ 1.861-9 through 1.861-13T, applied in a reasonable and consistent manner taking into account the general operation of the PFIC rules and the purpose of section 1297(b)(2)(C) or, alternatively, at the election of the tested foreign corporation is treated as allocated entirely to passive income.
(iv)
Allocation of dividends
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), the principles of § 1.316-2(a) apply in determining from what year's earnings and profits a dividend from a related person is treated as distributed. A dividend is considered to be distributed, first, out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year of the related person that includes the date the dividend is distributed (current earnings and profits) and that ends with or within the taxable year of the recipient; second, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the immediately preceding taxable year of the related person; third, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the second preceding taxable year of the related person; and so forth. For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the principles of § 1.243-4(a)(6) apply with respect to a deficit in an earnings and profits account for a prior year.
(B)
Dividends paid out of current earnings and profits.
To the extent that a dividend is paid out of current earnings and profits of the related person for its taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the recipient, the dividend is treated as paid ratably out of earnings and profits attributable to passive income and to non-passive income. The portion of the current earnings and profits that is treated as paid out of non-passive income of the related person may be determined by multiplying the current earnings and profits by the ratio of the related person's non-passive gross income as determined under this section (including paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) for the taxable year to its total gross income as determined under this section (including paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) for that year.
(C)
Dividends paid out of accumulated earnings and profits.
To the extent that a dividend from a related person is treated as paid out of the related person's accumulated earnings and profits, the dividend is treated as paid ratably
out of accumulated earnings and profits of the related person for prior taxable years (beginning with the most recently accumulated) that are attributable to passive income and to non-passive income, which may be determined in the same manner as in paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(B) of this section. Alternatively, the accumulated earnings and profits may be allocated based on the ratio of accumulated earnings and profits that are attributable to passive income and to non-passive income during either the related party period or the three-year period. The related party period is the entire period during which the related person was related to the recipient. The three-year period is the three taxable years immediately preceding the related person's taxable year that ends with or within the current taxable year of the recipient. The three-year period may be used only if the related person has been related to the recipient for a period longer than the three taxable years immediately preceding the recipient's taxable year.
(v)
Allocation of rents and royalties.
For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), rents and royalties that are received or accrued, as applicable based on the recipient's method of accounting, from a related person are allocable to income of the related person that is not passive income to the extent the related person's deduction for the rent or royalty is allocable to non-passive gross income of the related person under the principles of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T.
(vi)
Determination of whether amounts are received or accrued from a related person.
For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), the determination of whether interest, dividends, rents, and royalties were received or accrued from a related person is made on the date of the receipt or accrual, as applicable based on the recipient's method of accounting, of the interest, dividend, rent, or royalty.
(vii)
Allocation of distributive share of income from related partnership.
For purposes of section 1297(a)(1), a tested foreign corporation includes its distributive share as provided in section 704 of the separate items of passive or non-passive income from a partnership that is a related person (and not a look-through partnership) with respect to the tested foreign corporation for the taxable year of the tested foreign corporation.
(d)
Asset test
—(1)
Calculation of average annual value (or adjusted bases)
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of section 1297, the calculation of the average percentage of assets held by a tested foreign corporation during its taxable year that produce passive income or that are held for the production of passive income is determined based on the average of the fair market values, or the average of the adjusted bases, as appropriate, of the passive assets and total assets held (including assets treated as held pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)) by the foreign corporation on the last day of each measuring period (
measuring date
) of the foreign corporation's taxable year. The average of the fair market values (or the average of the adjusted bases) of the foreign corporation's passive assets or total assets for the taxable year is equal to the sum of the values (or adjusted bases) of the passive assets or total assets, as applicable, on each measuring date of the foreign corporation's taxable year, divided by the number of measuring dates in the taxable year.
(ii)
Measuring period
—(A)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the measuring periods for a tested foreign corporation are the four quarters that make up the foreign corporation's taxable year.
(B)
Election to use alternative measuring period.
The average percentage of assets held by a tested foreign corporation during its taxable year that produce passive income or that are held for the production of passive income may be calculated using a period that is shorter than a quarter (such as a week or month). The same period must be used to measure the assets of the foreign corporation for the first year (including a short taxable year) that this alternative measuring period is used, and for any and all subsequent years, unless a revocation is made. An election to use an alternative measuring period or a revocation of such an election must be made in accordance
with the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.
(C)
Short taxable year.
For purposes of applying section 1297 to a tested foreign corporation that has a taxable year of less than twelve months (short taxable year), the average values (or adjusted bases) are determined based on the measuring dates of the foreign corporation's taxable year that fall within the short taxable year, and by treating the last day of the short taxable year as a measuring date.
(iii)
Adjusted basis election.
An election under section 1297(e)(2)(B) with respect to an eligible tested foreign corporation or a revocation of such an election may be made by the tested foreign corporation or alternatively by the owner (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section). If made by the owner, the election must be made in accordance with the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.
(iv)
Time and manner of elections and revocations
—(A)
Elections.
An owner (as defined in this paragraph (d)(1)(iv)) of a foreign corporation makes an election described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) or (d)(1)(iii) of this section for a taxable year in the manner provided in the Instructions to Form 8621 (or successor form), if the owner is required to file a Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the foreign corporation for the taxable year of the owner in which or with which the taxable year of the foreign corporation for which the election is made ends. If the owner is not required to file Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the foreign corporation for the taxable year, the owner makes such an election by filing a written statement providing for the election and attaching the statement to an original or amended Federal income tax return for the taxable year of the owner in which or with which the taxable year of the foreign corporation for which the election is made ends clearly indicating that such election has been made. An election can be made by an owner only if the owner's taxable year for which the election is made, and all taxable years that are affected by the election, are not closed by the period of limitations on assessments under section 6501. Elections described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(B) and (d)(1)(iii) of this section are not eligible for relief under § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1)(iv), an owner of a foreign corporation is a United States person that is eligible under § 1.1295-1(d) to make a section 1295 election with respect to the foreign corporation, or would be eligible under § 1.1295-1(d) to make a section 1295 election if the foreign corporation were a PFIC.
(B)
Revocations and subsequent elections.
An election described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) or (d)(1)(iii) of this section made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(A) of this section is effective for the taxable year of the foreign corporation for which it is made and all subsequent taxable years of such corporation unless revoked by the Commissioner or the owner (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(A) of this section) of the foreign corporation. The owner of a foreign corporation may revoke such an election at any time. If an election described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) or (d)(1)(iii) of this section has been revoked under this paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(B), a new election described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) or (d)(1)(iii) of this section, as applicable, cannot be made until the sixth taxable year following the year for which the previous election was revoked, and such subsequent election cannot be revoked until the sixth taxable year following the year for which the subsequent election was made. The owner revokes the election for a taxable year in the manner provided in the Instructions to Form 8621 (or successor form), if the owner is required to file a Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the foreign corporation for the taxable year of the owner in which or with which the taxable year of the foreign corporation for which the election is revoked ends, or by filing a written statement providing for the revocation and attaching the statement to an original or amended Federal income tax return for the taxable year of the owner in which or with which the taxable year of the foreign corporation for which the election is revoked ends clearly indicating that such election has been revoked, if the owner is not required to file Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the
foreign corporation for the taxable year.
(v)
Method of measuring assets
—(A)
Publicly traded foreign corporations.
For purposes of section 1297, the assets of a publicly traded foreign corporation as defined in paragraph (f)(7) of this section (including assets treated as held pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)(i), other than assets of a look-through subsidiary described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section) must be measured for all measuring periods of the taxable year on the basis of value.

)
Lower-tier subsidiaries that are publicly traded foreign corporations.
For purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to the assets of a foreign corporation that is a lower-tier subsidiary of a foreign corporation that directly or indirectly owns all or part of the lower-tier subsidiary (a parent foreign corporation), if the lower-tier subsidiary is described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A), the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) apply. The previous sentence applies both for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to the lower-tier subsidiary as a tested foreign corporation, and for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to a parent foreign corporation with respect to the assets of the lower-tier subsidiary.

Lower-tier subsidiaries that are non-publicly traded controlled foreign corporations.
For purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to the assets of a foreign corporation that is a lower-tier subsidiary of a parent foreign corporation, if the lower-tier subsidiary is described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B), the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B) apply. The previous sentence applies both for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to the lower-tier subsidiary as a tested foreign corporation, and for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to a parent foreign corporation with respect to the assets of the lower-tier subsidiary.

Other lower-tier subsidiaries.
For purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to a foreign corporation that is a lower-tier subsidiary of a parent foreign corporation, if the lower-tier subsidiary is not described in paragraphs (d)(1)(v)(A) or (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section, the assets of the lower-tier subsidiary (including assets treated as held pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)(i)) must be measured under the rules of the same paragraph of this section (d)(1)(v) that applies to the parent foreign corporation. The previous sentence applies both for purposes of applying section
1297(a)(2) to the lower-tier subsidiary as a tested foreign corporation, and for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to a parent foreign corporation. If a tested foreign corporation indirectly owns a lower-tier subsidiary that is not described in paragraphs (d)(1)(v)(A) or (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section through one or more other foreign corporations, the status of any parent foreign corporation in that chain of corporations that is described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) of this section, or if there is no such parent foreign corporation then the status of any parent foreign corporation in that chain of corporations that is described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section, determines the basis on which the assets of the lower-tier subsidiary are measured. In the case of a foreign corporation that is a lower-tier subsidiary with respect to more than one parent foreign corporation, this rule applies separately to measure the assets of the lower-tier subsidiary with respect to each parent foreign corporation.

Dual-character assets
—(i)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (d)(3)(iii) of this section and in § 1.1297-2(c), for purposes of section 1297, an asset (or portion of an asset) that produces both passive income and non-passive income during a taxable year (dual-character asset), including stock and other assets that produce passive and non-passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section, is treated as two assets for each measuring period in the taxable year, one of which is a passive asset and one of which is a non-passive asset. The value (or adjusted basis) of the dual-character asset is allocated between the passive asset and the non-passive asset in proportion to the relative amounts of passive income and non-passive income produced by the asset (or portion of an asset) during the taxable year. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section for a special rule concerning stock that has previously produced dividends subject to the exception provided in section 1297(b)(2)(C). For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), a partnership interest in a partnership that is a related person to the tested foreign corporation is treated as producing passive or non-passive income in proportion to the tested foreign corporation's distributive share of partnership passive or non-passive income for the taxable year under paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section.
(ii)
Special rule when only part of an asset produces income.
For purposes of section 1297, when only a portion of an asset produces income during a taxable year or a portion of a taxable year, the asset is treated as two assets for that period, one of which is characterized as a passive asset or a non-passive asset based on the income that it produces, and one of which is characterized based on the income that it is held to produce. The value (or adjusted basis) of the asset is allocated between the two assets pursuant to the method that most reasonably reflects the uses of the property. In the case of real property, an allocation based on the physical use of the property generally is the most reasonable method.
(iii)
Special rule for stock that previously produced income that was excluded from passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(C).
Stock with respect to which no dividends are received during a taxable year, but with respect to which dividends were received during one or both of the prior two taxable years, is characterized based on the relative portion of the dividends received that was passive or non-passive. If the dividends were in whole excluded from passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the stock is treated as a single non-passive asset. If the dividends were in part excluded from passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the stock is treated as two assets, one of which is a passive asset and one of which is a non-passive asset. The value (or adjusted basis) of the stock is allocated between the two assets in proportion to the average percentage of aggregate dividends received in the prior two taxable years that were characterized as passive income and the average percentage of aggregate dividends received in the prior two years that were characterized as non-passive income, for the previous two taxable years pursuant to section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section. If the tested foreign corporation did not receive any dividends from the stock for the current taxable year or within either of the prior two taxable years of the tested foreign corporation, then the stock is treated as a passive asset.
(iv)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d)(3).
(A)
Facts.
(
1
) USP is a domestic corporation that owns 30% of TFC, a foreign corporation. The remaining 70% of TFC is owned by FP, a foreign corporation that is unrelated to USP. TFC owns 20% of the value of FS1, a foreign corporation, and FP owns the remaining 80% of the value of FS1. FP, TFC,
and FS1 are not controlled foreign corporations within the meaning of section 957(a), and each has a calendar year taxable year.
(
2
) In Year 1, FS1 had current earnings and profits of $1000x, attributable to passive income of $500x and non-passive income of $500x, and paid $300x of dividends to TFC. In Year 2, FS1 had current earnings and profits of $1000x, attributable to passive income of $100x and non-passive income of $900x, and paid $100x of dividends to TFC. In Year 3, FS1 has passive income of $200x and non-passive income of $800x and does not pay a dividend.
(
3
) Throughout Year 3, TFC holds an obligation of FS1 with respect to which FS1 pays $100x of interest.
(
4
) In addition to the stock in FS1 and the FS1 obligation, TFC holds an office building, 40% of which is rented to FP throughout Year 3 for $100x per quarter. During Year 3, FP has only passive income. The remaining 60% of the office building is leased throughout Year 3 to an unrelated person for $300x per quarter, and TFC's own officers or staff of employees regularly perform active and substantial management and operational functions while the property is leased.
(B)
Results.
(
1
) For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), FP is a “related person” with respect to TFC because FP owns more than 50% of the vote or value of TFC, and FS1 is a “related person” with respect to TFC because FP owns more than 50% of the vote or value of both TFC and of FS1.
(
2
) Under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the dividends paid by FS1 in Year 1 were characterized as 50% passive income ($150x) and 50% non-passive income ($150x). Under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the dividends paid by FS1 in Year 2 were characterized as 10% passive income ($10x) and 90% non-passive income ($90x). Accordingly, the average percentage of dividends for the previous two taxable years that were characterized as passive income is 40% (((10% × $100x) + (50% × $300x))/($100x + $300x)), and the average percentage of dividends characterized as non-passive income is 60% (((90% × $100x) + (50% × $300x))/($100x + $300x)). Thus, under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, 60% of each share of stock of FS1 is characterized as a non-passive asset and 40% is characterized as a passive asset for each quarter of Year 3 for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to determine whether TFC is a PFIC.
(
3
) Under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, the interest received by TFC from FS1 is characterized as 20% ($200x/($200x + $800x)) passive income and thus 80% non-passive income for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(1) to determine whether TFC is a PFIC. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, 20% of the obligation of FS1 is characterized as a passive asset and 80% as a non-passive asset for each quarter of Year 3 for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to determine whether TFC is a PFIC.
(
4
) Under paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section, the rent received from FP throughout Year 3 is characterized as 100% passive income. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section and section 954(c)(2)(A), the rent received from the unrelated person is characterized as 100% non-passive income. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the 40% of the office building rented to FP has a value of 25% (($100x × 4)/(($100x × 4) + ($300x × 4))) of the value of the office building and that 25% is a passive asset, and the 60% of the office building rented to the unrelated person has a value of 75% (($300x × 4)/(($100x × 4) + ($300x × 4))) of the value of the office building and is a non-passive asset for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to determine whether TFC is a PFIC.
(4)
Passive treatment of stock and partnership interests.
For purposes of section 1297(a)(2), shares of stock in a corporation that is not a look-through subsidiary (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(3)) and partnership interests in a partnership that is not a look-through partnership (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(4)) with respect to a tested foreign corporation for a taxable year or portion thereof are treated as passive assets for the taxable year or relevant portion thereof, except to the extent the stock or partnership interest is treated as a dual-character asset under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (d)(3) of this section because it produces both passive and non-passive income, or the
stock or partnership interest produces solely non-passive income for the taxable year under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section or under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
(5)
Dealer property.
For purposes of section 1297(a)(2), an asset that produces, or would produce upon disposition, income or gain that is, or would be, excluded from passive income pursuant to section 954(c)(2)(C) is treated as a non-passive asset.
(e)
Stapled stock.
If a United States person that would be a shareholder (within the meaning of § 1.1291-1(b)(7) and (b)(8)) of a stapled entity (as defined in section 269B(c)(2)) owns stock in all entities that are stapled entities with respect to each other and the shares are stapled interests (as defined in section 269B(c)(3)), the United States person's interests in the stapled entities are treated as an interest in a single entity that holds all of the assets of the stapled entities, conducts all of the activities of the stapled entities, and derives all of the income of the stapled entities for all purposes of the PFIC regime.

§ 1.1297-2
Special rules regarding look-through subsidiaries and look-through partnerships.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules concerning the treatment of income and assets of a look-through subsidiary (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(3)) or look-through partnership (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(4)) for purposes of determining whether a tested foreign corporation (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(9)) is a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) under section 1297(a). Paragraph (b) of this section provides guidance for purposes of section 1297(c) on how to determine a tested foreign corporation's ownership in a corporation and how to determine a tested foreign corporation's proportionate share of a look-through subsidiary's or look-through partnership's assets and income. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules that eliminate certain income and assets related to look-through subsidiaries and look-through partnerships for purposes of determining a tested foreign corporation's PFIC status. Paragraph (d) of this section provides a rule to determine whether certain income received or accrued by look-through subsidiaries and look-through partnerships is received or accrued from a related person for purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C). Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules concerning the attribution of activities from qualified affiliates (as defined in § 1.1297-2(e)(2)) for purposes of characterizing the income and assets of a look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for determining the amount of gain from the direct or indirect sale or exchange of stock of a look-through subsidiary or partnership interests in a partnership described in section 954(c)(4) that is taken into account under section 1297(a) and for determining the passive or non-passive character of gain from the sale of a look-through subsidiary. Paragraph (g) of this section provides definitions applicable for this section, and paragraph (h) of this section provides the applicability date of this section.
(b)
General rules
—(1)
Tested foreign corporation's ownership of a corporation.
For purposes of section 1297(c) and this section, the principles of section 958(a) and the regulations in this chapter under that section applicable to determining direct or indirect ownership by value apply to determine a tested foreign corporation's percentage ownership (by value) in the stock of another corporation. These principles apply whether an intermediate entity is domestic or foreign.
(2)
Tested foreign corporation's proportionate share of the assets and income of a look-through subsidiary
—(i)
Proportionate share of subsidiary assets.
For each measuring period (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(2)), a tested foreign corporation is treated as if it held its proportionate share of each asset of a look-through subsidiary, determined based on the tested foreign corporation's percentage ownership (by value) (as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section)) of the look-through subsidiary on the measuring date (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(1)). A tested foreign corporation's proportionate share of a look-through subsidiary's asset is treated as producing passive income, or being held to produce passive income, to the extent the asset produced, or was held to produce, passive income in the hands of such look-through subsidiary under the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Proportionate share of subsidiary income
—(A)
General rule.
A tested foreign corporation is treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of each item of gross income or loss of a corporation for a taxable year if the corporation is a look-through subsidiary with respect to the tested foreign corporation for the taxable year of the tested foreign corporation. In such case, a tested foreign corporation's proportionate share of a look-through subsidiary's gross income or loss is determined based on the corporation's average percentage ownership (by value) of the look-through subsidiary. The exceptions to passive income in section 1297(b)(2) and the relevant exceptions to foreign personal holding company income in section 954(c) that are based on whether income is derived in the active conduct of a business or whether a corporation is engaged in the active conduct of a business apply to such income only if the exception would have
applied to exclude the income from passive income or foreign personal holding company income in the hands of the subsidiary, determined by taking into account only the activities of the subsidiary except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for rules determining whether a person is a related person for purposes of applying section 1297(b)(2)(C) in the case of income received or accrued by a subsidiary that is treated as received directly by a tested foreign corporation pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2).
(B)
Partial year.
When a corporation is not a look-through subsidiary with respect to a tested foreign corporation for an entire taxable year of the tested foreign corporation, the tested foreign corporation may be treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of the gross income or loss of the first corporation for each measuring period in the year for which the first corporation is a look-through subsidiary, if the conditions in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section are satisfied. In such case, a tested foreign corporation's proportionate share of a look-through subsidiary's gross income or loss is determined based on the tested foreign corporation's percentage ownership (by value) (as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) of the look-through subsidiary on the relevant measuring date.
(iii)
Coordination of section 1297(c) with section 1298(b)(7).
A tested foreign corporation is not treated under section 1297(c) and this paragraph (b) as holding its proportionate share of the assets of a domestic corporation, or receiving directly its proportionate share of the gross income or loss of the domestic corporation, if the stock of the domestic corporation is treated as an asset that is not a passive asset (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(5)) that produces income that is not passive income (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(6)) under section 1298(b)(7) (concerning the treatment of certain foreign corporations owning stock in certain 25-percent-owned domestic corporations). See § 1.1298-4 for rules governing the application of section 1298(b)(7).
(3)
Tested foreign corporation's proportionate share of the assets and income of a look-through partnership
—(i)
Proportionate share of partnership assets.
For each measuring period (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(2)), a tested foreign corporation is treated as if it held its proportionate share of each asset of a look-through partnership, determined based on the tested foreign corporation's percentage ownership (by value) (as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) of the look-through partnership on the measuring date (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(1)). A tested foreign corporation's proportionate share of a look-through partnership's asset is treated as producing passive income, or being held to produce passive income, to the extent the asset produced, or was held to produce, passive income in the hands of the partnership under the rules in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Proportionate share of partnership income
—(A)
General rule.
A tested foreign corporation is treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of any item of gross income or loss of a partnership that is a look-through partnership with respect to the tested foreign corporation for the taxable year of the tested foreign corporation. The exceptions to passive income in section 1297(b)(2) and the relevant exceptions to foreign personal holding company income in section 954(c) that are based on whether income is derived in the active conduct of a business or whether a corporation is engaged in the active conduct of a business apply to such income only if the exception would have applied to exclude the income from passive income or foreign personal holding company income in the hands of the partnership, determined by taking into account only the activities of the partnership except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for rules determining whether a person is a related person for purposes of applying section 1297(b)(2)(C) in the case of income received or accrued by a partnership that is treated as received directly by a tested foreign corporation pursuant to this paragraph (b)(3).
(B)
Partial year.
When a partnership is not a look-through partnership with respect to a tested foreign corporation for an entire taxable year of the tested
foreign corporation, the tested foreign corporation may be treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of the gross income of the partnership for each measuring period in the year for which the partnership is a look-through partnership, provided that the conditions set forth in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section would be satisfied if the partnership were a corporation.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b). For purposes of these examples, USP is a domestic corporation; TFC, LTS, and FS are foreign corporations that are not controlled foreign corporations within the meaning of section 957(a); USP owns 30% of TFC; and LTS owns 25% of the only class of FS stock.

LTS.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and pursuant to the principles of section 958(a), LTS owns 25% of the value of FS. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, in determining whether LTS is a PFIC under section 1297(a), LTS is treated as if it held 25% of each of FS's assets on each of the measuring dates in its taxable year and received directly 25% of the gross income of FS for the taxable year.

TFC.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and pursuant to the principles of section 958(a), TFC owns 80% of the value of LTS and indirectly owns 20% of the value of FS. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in determining whether TFC is a PFIC under section 1297(a), TFC is treated as if it held 80% of each of LTS's assets on each of the measuring dates in its taxable year and received directly 80% of the gross income of LTS for the taxable year. However, because TFC indirectly owns less than 25% of FS, FS is not a look-through subsidiary with respect to TFC and, therefore, TFC is treated as if it held a 20% interest in the stock of FS (and not the assets of FS), and received 80% of any dividends paid from FS to LTS (and not any income of FS).
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Facts.
TFC directly owns 25% of the only class of LTS stock on the last day of each of the first three quarters of its taxable year but disposes of its entire interest in LTS during the fourth quarter of its taxable year.
(B)
Results.
Under paragraph (b)(1) and pursuant to the principles of section 958(a), on each of its first three measuring dates, TFC owns 25% of the value of LTS and indirectly owns 6.25% of the value of FS. Under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, if information about the gross income of LTS for each of the first three quarters of its taxable year is available to TFC, LTS is treated as a look-through subsidiary with respect to TFC for those quarters because TFC owned 25% of the value of LTS on the measuring dates with respect to those measuring periods. In that case, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in determining whether TFC is a PFIC under section 1297(a), TFC is treated as if it held 25% of each of LTS's assets and received directly 25% of the gross income of LTS on each of the first three measuring dates in its taxable year. For each of its first three quarters, if LTS is treated as a look-through subsidiary with respect to TFC under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, then TFC is treated as if it held a 6.25% interest in the stock of FS (and not the assets of FS) and received 25% of any dividends paid from FS to LTS (and not any income of FS). Under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, if information about the gross income of LTS for each of the first three quarters of its taxable year is not available to TFC, then LTS is not a look-through subsidiary with respect to TFC.
(iii)
Example 3
—(A)
Facts.
TFC directly owns 100% of the only class of LTS stock for TFC's and LTS's entire taxable year. TFC sells one item of property described in section 954(c)(1)(B)(i) for a gain of $25x and another for a loss of $10x, and no exception from passive income applies to either amount. During the taxable year, FS sells one item of property described in section 954(c)(1)(B)(i) for a gain of $50x and another for a loss of $55x; no exception from passive income applies to either amount.
(B)
Results.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and pursuant to the principles of section 958(a), TFC owns 100%
of the value of LTS, and TFC indirectly owns 25% of the value of FS. Under paragraph (b) of this section, in determining whether TFC is a PFIC under section 1297(a), TFC is treated as if it held 100% of LTS's assets on each of the measuring dates in its taxable year and received directly 100% of the gross income of LTS for the taxable year. Furthermore, TFC is treated as if it held 25% of each of FS's assets and received directly 25% of the gross income of FS. Pursuant to § 1.1297-1(c)(1)(ii), the excess of gains over losses from property transactions described in section 954(c)(1)(B) is taken into account as gross income for purposes of section 1297, and items of gain or loss of look-through subsidiaries are treated as recognized by a tested foreign corporation. Accordingly, TFC takes into account the net $5x loss from the sales of property by FS. TFC's income from its own sales of property constitutes passive income pursuant to § 1.1297-1(c) and section 954(c)(1)(B), although, pursuant to § 1.1297-1(c)(1)(ii), only the excess of gains over losses, $15x ($25x − $10x), is taken into account as gross income for purposes of section 1297. As a result, TFC's income (including the $5x loss from FS), all of which is passive income, equals $10x ($15x − $5x) of gross income.

General rule for asset test
—(i)
LTS stock.
For purposes of section 1297(a)(2), a tested foreign corporation does not take into account the value (or adjusted basis) of stock of a look-through subsidiary (
LTS stock
), including LTS stock that the tested foreign corporation is treated as owning on a measuring date pursuant to section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section. Furthermore, for purposes of section 1297(a)(2), a tested foreign corporation does not take into account the value (or adjusted basis) of its own stock that it is treated as owning on a measuring date pursuant to section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section.
(ii)
LTS obligation.
For purposes of section 1297(a)(2), a tested foreign corporation does not take into account the value (or adjusted basis) of its proportionate share of a direct LTS obligation, an indirect LTS obligation or a TFC obligation that it is treated as owning on a measuring date. The term
direct LTS obligation
means a debt obligation of, lease to, or license to a look-through subsidiary (
LTS debt, LTS lease,
and
LTS license,
respectively, and
LTS obligation
collectively) from the tested foreign corporation that the tested foreign corporation owns on a measuring date, and the term
indirect LTS obligation
means a LTS obligation from a look-through subsidiary that the tested foreign corporation is treated as owning on a measuring date pursuant to section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section. The term
TFC obligation
means a debt obligation of, lease to, or a license to the tested foreign corporation from a look-through subsidiary that the tested foreign corporation is treated as owning on a measuring date pursuant to section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section. The tested foreign corporation's proportionate share of a LTS obligation or a TFC obligation is the value (or adjusted basis) of the item multiplied by the tested foreign corporation's percentage ownership (by value) in each relevant look-through subsidiary. For purposes of section 1297(a)(2) and § 1.1297-1(d) as applied to a tested foreign corporation, property subject to a LTS lease or LTS license or a lease or license to the tested foreign corporation is characterized as either producing passive income or non-passive income (or both) by taking into account the activities of the qualified affiliates (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) of the entity that owns the property. For this purpose, the activities of the entity that owns the property that is subject to the lease or license are not taken into account to the extent that they relate to the lease or license.

General rule for income test
—(i)
LTS stock.
For purposes of section 1297(a)(1), a tested foreign corporation does not take into account dividends derived with respect to LTS stock, including dividends that the tested foreign corporation is treated as receiving on a measuring date pursuant to section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, a tested foreign
corporation takes into account dividends that are attributable to income that was not treated as received directly by the tested foreign corporation pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For this purpose, the rules of § 1.1297-1(c)(4)(iv)(A) apply to determine the earnings and profits from which a dividend is paid, substituting the term “look-through subsidiary” for “related person.”
(ii)
LTS obligation.
For purposes of section 1297(a)(1), a tested foreign corporation does not take into account its proportionate share of interest, rents, or royalties derived with respect to direct or indirect LTS obligations or TFC obligations. The tested foreign corporation's proportionate share of interest, rents, or royalties is the amount of the item multiplied by the tested foreign corporation's percentage ownership (by value) in each relevant look-through subsidiary.
(3)
Partnerships.
For purposes of section 1297(a)(1) and (a)(2), the principles of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section apply with respect to ownership interests in, debt of, and leases or licenses to a look-through partnership (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section), and with respect to distributions and the distributive shares of income from a look-through partnership and interest, rents, or royalties derived with respect to the debt, leases or licenses of a look-through partnership.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c). For purposes of these examples, USP is a domestic corporation; USP owns 30% of TFC; TFC, LTS, LTS1, LTS2, and FS are foreign corporations that are not controlled foreign corporations within the meaning of section 957(a); FPS is a foreign partnership; and TFC, LTS1, and LTS2 measure assets for purposes of section 1297(a)(2) based on value.
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
TFC directly owns 80% of the only class of LTS stock for TFC's and LTS's entire taxable year, and LTS is a look-through subsidiary (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) with respect to TFC. LTS owns 25% of the only class of FS stock, and FS is a look-through subsidiary with respect to LTS. Pursuant to the principles of section 958(a), TFC owns 80% of the value of LTS, LTS owns 25% of the value of FS, and TFC indirectly owns 20% of the value of FS. During the first quarter of the taxable year, LTS received a $20x dividend from FS.

LTS.
Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to LTS, LTS's assets do not include the stock of FS. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(1) to LTS, LTS's income does not include the $20x dividend from FS.
(

)
TFC.
Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to TFC, TFC's assets do not include the stock of LTS. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(1) to TFC, TFC is treated as receiving directly the income of LTS. Because TFC indirectly owns less than 25% of FS, FS is not a look-through subsidiary with respect to TFC and, therefore, TFC's assets include the value of TFC's 20% interest in the stock of FS and do not include 20% of FS's assets. Similarly, TFC is treated as if it received $16x (80% × $20x) of the $20x dividend paid from FS to LTS (and not any income of FS). Because the dividend constitutes gross income to LTS (although it is eliminated for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(1) to LTS), TFC is treated as receiving the dividend from FS directly under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. Because the dividend is from a subsidiary that is not a look-through subsidiary with respect to TFC, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section does not apply to eliminate the $16x dividend for purposes of section 1297(a).
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Facts.
TFC directly owns 40% of the value of LTS1 stock on each of the measuring dates, and thus is treated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as owning 40% of LTS1's assets on each of the measuring dates. TFC's assets include a loan to LTS1 with a balance of $1,000x on each of the measuring dates. During the first quarter of the taxable year, TFC received $20x of dividends from LTS1, which were attributable to income of LTS1 treated as received directly by TFC pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of
this section, and $30x of interest on the loan, both of which were paid in cash.
(B)
Results.
Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of applying section 1297(a), TFC's assets do not include the stock of LTS1, and TFC's income does not include the $20x of dividends received from LTS1 pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Similarly, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section TFC's assets include only $600x ($1,000x loan −(40% × $1,000x)) of the loan to LTS1, and under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, TFC's income includes only $18x ($30x interest − (40% × $30x)) of the interest from LTS1. However, TFC's assets include the entire $50x of cash ($20x of dividends and $30x of interest) received from LTS1.
(iii)
Example 3
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
), except that TFC also directly owns 30% of the value of LTS2 stock on each of the measuring dates, and thus is treated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as owning 30% of LTS2's assets, and LTS1's assets also include a loan to LTS2 with a balance of $200x on each of the measuring dates. During the first quarter of the taxable year, LTS1 received $5x of interest on the loan, which was paid in cash.
(B)
Results.
The results are the same as in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section (the results in
Example 2
), except that TFC's assets also do not include the stock of LTS2. Similarly, although TFC would be treated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as owning $80x (40% × $200x) of the LTS1 loan to LTS2, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section TFC does not take into account its proportionate share of an indirect LTS obligation and accordingly, TFC does not take into account $24x (30% × $80x) of the loan to LTS2. As a result, TFC's assets include only $56x ($80x − $24x) of the LTS1 loan to LTS2. Furthermore, although TFC would be treated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as receiving $2x (40% × $5x) of the interest received by LTS1 from LTS2, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section TFC does not take into account its proportionate share of interest with respect to an indirect LTS obligation and thus, TFC does not take into account $0.60x (30% × $2x) of the interest received by LTS1. Accordingly, TFC's income includes only $1.40x ($2x − $0.60x) of the interest from LTS2. Furthermore, TFC's assets include $2x (40% × $5x) of LTS1's cash received from LTS2.
(iv)
Example 4
—(A)
Facts.
TFC directly owns 80% of the value of LTS1 stock on each of the measuring dates, and thus is treated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as owning 80% of LTS1's assets on each of the measuring dates. TFC also directly owns 50% of the value in FPS on each of the measuring dates. LTS1's assets include the remaining 50% of the value in FPS and a loan to FPS with a balance of $500x on each of the measuring dates. FPS's assets include a loan to TFC with a balance of $1000x on each of the measuring dates. During the first measuring period of the taxable year, FPS received $30x of interest from TFC, and LTS1 received $15x of interest from FPS, both of which were paid in cash. During the last measuring period of the taxable year, FPS received $80x of income from an unrelated person in cash and distributed $60x of such income in cash to TFC and LTS1 in proportion to their interests in FPS.
(B)
Results.
Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, for purposes of applying section 1297(a), TFC's assets do not include the stock of LTS1, the interests in FPS owned by TFC directly and through LTS1, any of the loan by FPS to TFC, or any of the loan by LTS1 to FPS. Similarly, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, TFC's income does not include any of the $30x of interest received by FPS from TFC, any of the $15x of interest received by LTS1 from FPS, or any of the $60x of distributions received by TFC and LTS1 from FPS. However, on each of the measuring dates, TFC's assets include $27x ((50% × $30x) + (80% × 50% × $30x)) of the $30 of cash received by FPS from TFC and $12x (80% × $15x) of the $15x of cash received by LTS1 from FPS. Moreover, on the last measuring date of the taxable year, TFC's assets include $18x ((50% × $20x) + (80% × 50% × $20x)) of the $20x ($80x−$60x) of cash received by FPS from the unrelated person and retained by FPS and $54x ((50% × $60x) + (80% × 50% × $60x))
of the $60x cash received by FPS from the unrelated person and distributed. Furthermore, TFC's income includes $72x ((50% × $80x) + (80% × 50% × $80x)) of the $80x of income received by FPS from an unrelated person.
(v)
Example 5
—(A)
Facts.
TFC directly owns 80% of the value of the stock of LTS1 and 60% of the value of the stock of LTS2 on each of the measuring dates, and thus is treated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section as owning 80% of LTS1's assets and 60% of LTS2's assets on each of the measuring dates. TFC's assets include a license for the use of its intangible property by LTS1 with a value of $5,000x on each of the measuring dates, LTS1's assets include a sub-license of such license to LTS2 with a value of $2,000x on each of the measuring dates, and LTS2's assets include a lease of its building to LTS1 with a value of $4,000x on each of the measuring dates. LTS1 and LTS2 each use the intangible property that is the subject of the license and sub-license in its respective trade or business, and LTS1 uses the building in its trade or business. During the last quarter of the taxable year, TFC received a royalty of $500x from LTS1 with respect to the license, and LTS1 received a royalty of $200x from LTS2 with respect to the sub-license, both of which were paid in cash. LTS2 received $100x of rent paid in cash from LTS1 during each quarter of the taxable year with respect to the building lease.

Asset test.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to TFC's final measuring period, the following analysis applies. TFC's assets do not include the stock of LTS1 and LTS2. Similarly, TFC's assets include only $1,000x ($5,000x license − (80% × $5,000x)) of the license to LTS1. However, TFC's assets include the entire $500x of cash it received from LTS1 as a result of the royalty. Moreover, although TFC would be treated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as owning $1,600x (80% × $2,000x) of the LTS1 sub-license to LTS2, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section TFC does not take into account its proportionate share of an indirect LTS obligation, and accordingly TFC does not take into account $960x (60% × $1,600x) of LTS1's sub-license to LTS2. As a result, TFC's assets include $640x($1,600x − $960x) of the sub-license. In addition, TFC's assets include $160x (80% × $200x) of LTS1's cash received from LTS2 as a result of the royalty to LTS1. Similarly, although TFC would be treated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as owning $2,400x (60% × $4,000x) of the LTS2 lease to LTS1, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section TFC does not take into account $1,920x (80% × $2,400x) of the LTS2 building lease, and accordingly, its assets include $480x ($2,400x − $1,920x) of the lease. TFC's assets also include $240x (60% × $100x × 4) of LTS2's cash received from LTS1 as a result of the rental payment to LTS2.

Income test.
Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, because TFC does not take into account its proportionate share of a direct LTS obligation, TFC's income includes only $100x ($500x royalty − (80% × $500x)) of the royalties from LTS1. Furthermore, although TFC would be treated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as receiving $160x (80% × $200x) of the royalty received by LTS1 from LTS2, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section TFC does not take into account its proportionate share of royalties derived with respect to an indirect LTS obligation, and accordingly TFC does not take into account $96x (60% × $160x) of the royalty received by LTS1. As a result, TFC's income includes only $64x ($160x − $96x) of the royalty from LTS2. Similarly, although TFC would be treated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as receiving $240x (60% × $100x × 4) of the rent received by LTS2 from LTS1, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section TFC does not take into account its proportionate share of rent derived with respect to an indirect LTS obligation, and accordingly TFC does not take into account $192x (80% × $240) of the rent received by LTS2. Therefore, TFC's income includes only $48 ($240x − $192x) of the rent received from LTS1.

Treatment of intangible and rental property.
For purposes of determining whether the intangible property that TFC owns and the building that TFC is treated as owning under paragraph
(b)(2) of this section is held in the production of passive income, the activities performed by TFC and its qualified affiliates with respect to the property are taken into account under paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (e) of this section. Because TFC is the common parent of the affiliated group (as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section) that includes LTS1 and LTS2, LTS1 and LTS2 are qualified affiliates of TFC and the activities of their officers and employees with respect to the intangible property and building are taken into account to determine whether the building and intangible property would be treated as passive assets.
(d)
Related person determination for purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C)
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), interest, dividends, rents or royalties received or accrued by a look-through subsidiary (and treated as received directly by a tested foreign corporation pursuant to section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section) are considered received or accrued from a related person only if the payor of the interest, dividend, rent or royalty is a related person (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)) with respect to the look-through subsidiary, taking into account § 1.1297-1(c)(1)(i)(D). Similarly, for purposes of 1297(b)(2)(C), interest, dividends, rents or royalties received or accrued by a look-through partnership (and treated as received directly by a tested foreign corporation pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section) are considered received or accrued from a related person only if the payor of the interest, dividend, rent or royalty is a related person (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)) with respect to the look-through partnership, taking into account § 1.1297-1(c)(1)(i)(D).
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (d).
(i)
Facts.
USP is a domestic corporation that owns 30% of TFC. TFC directly owns 30% of the value of FS1 stock, and thus under paragraph (b) of this section is treated as owning 30% of FS1's assets and earning 30% of FS1's gross income. The remaining FS1 stock is owned by an unrelated foreign person. FS1 directly owns 60% of the vote of FS2 stock and 20% of the value of FS2 stock. The remaining vote and value of FS2 stock are owned by an unrelated foreign person. TFC, FS1, and FS2 are foreign corporations that are not controlled foreign corporations within the meaning of section 957(a). FS1 receives a $100x dividend from FS2.
(ii)
Results.
Pursuant to section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, TFC is treated as receiving directly $30x of the dividend income received by FS1. FS2 is a related person (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)) with respect to FS1 for purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C) because FS1 owns more than 50% of the vote of FS2. FS2 is not a related person (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)) with respect to TFC for purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C) because TFC indirectly does not own more than 50% of the vote or value of the FS2 stock. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, for purposes of determining whether the dividend income received by FS1 is subject to the exception in section 1297(b)(2)(C) for purposes of testing the PFIC status of TFC, the dividend is treated as received from a related person because FS1 and FS2 are related persons within the meaning of section 1297(b)(2)(C). Therefore, to the extent the dividend income received by FS1 would be properly allocable to income of FS2 that is not passive income, the dividend income that TFC is treated as receiving under section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is treated as non-passive income (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(4)).
(e)
Treatment of activities of certain look-through subsidiaries and look-through partnerships for purposes of certain exceptions
—(1)
General rule.
An item of income received by a tested foreign corporation (including an amount treated as received or accrued pursuant to section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section) that would be passive income in the hands of the entity that actually received or accrued it is not passive if the item would be excluded from foreign personal holding company income under the following exceptions contained in section 954(c) that are based on whether the entity is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business,
determined by taking into account the activities performed by the officers and employees of the tested foreign corporation as well as activities performed by the officers and employees of any qualified affiliate of the tested foreign corporation—
(i) Section 954(c)(1)(B) and § 1.954-2(e)(1)(ii) and (3)(ii), (iii) and (iv);
(ii) Section 954(c)(1)(C) and § 1.954-2(f)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii)(D);
(iii) Section 954(c)(1)(D) and § 1.954-2(g)(2)(ii);
(iv) Section 954(c)(2)(A) and § 1.954-2(b)(6), (c), and (d);
(v) Section 954(c)(2)(B) and § 1.954-2(b)(2); and
(vi) Section 954(c)(2)(C) and § 1.954-2(h)(3)(ii).
(2)
Qualified affiliate.
The term
qualified affiliate
means a corporation or a partnership that is included in an affiliated group that includes the tested foreign corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term
affiliated group
has the meaning provided in section 1504(a), except that—
(i) The affiliated group is determined without regard to sections 1504(a)(2)(A), (b)(2) and (b)(3);
(ii) Subject to paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, a partnership is treated as an includible corporation;
(iii) The common parent of the affiliated group is not a domestic corporation or domestic partnership;
(iv) Section 1504(a)(2)(B) is applied by substituting “more than 50 percent” for “at least 80 percent”;
(v) A foreign corporation or foreign partnership must be the common parent of the affiliated group;
(vi) Subject to paragraph (e)(2)(vii) of this section, a partnership is included as a member of the affiliated group if more than 50 percent of the value of its capital interests or profits interests is owned by one or more corporations or partnerships that are included in the affiliated group; and
(vii) A corporation or a partnership that is not the common parent of an affiliated group is included in the affiliated group only if it would be a look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership, as applicable, of the common parent if the common parent were a tested foreign corporation.

The following examples illustrate the rule of this paragraph (e).
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
USP is a domestic corporation that directly owns 20% of the outstanding stock of FS1. The remaining 80% of the outstanding stock of FS1 is directly owned by a foreign person that is not related to USP. FS1 directly owns 100% of the value of the outstanding stock of FS2 and directly owns 80% of the value of the outstanding stock of FS3. The remaining 20% of the value of the outstanding stock of FS3 is directly owned by a foreign person that is not related to USP. FS2 directly owns 80% of the value of the outstanding stock of FS4. The remaining 20% of the value of the outstanding stock of FS4 is directly owned by a foreign person that is not related to USP. FS1, FS2, FS3 and FS4 are all organized in Country A and are not controlled foreign corporations within the meaning of section 957(a). FS4 owns real property that is leased to a person that is not a related person, but does not perform any activities. FS1 and FS2 also do not perform any activities. Officers and employees of FS3 in Country A perform activities with respect to the real property of FS4 that, if performed by officers or employees of FS4, would allow the rental income in the hands of FS4 to qualify for the exception from foreign personal holding company income in section 954(c)(2)(A) and § 1.954-2(b)(6) and (c)(1)(ii).

Qualified affiliates.
FS1 is the common parent of the affiliated group (as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section) that includes FS2, FS3, and FS4 because (i) FS1 owns more than 50% by value of FS2 and FS3, (ii) FS2 owns more than 50% by value of FS4, and (iii) FS2, FS3, and FS4 would be look-through subsidiaries with respect to FS1 if FS1 were the tested foreign corporation. Accordingly, each of FS1, FS2, FS3 and FS4 are qualified affiliates (as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section) with respect to the other members of the group for purposes of determining whether FS1, FS2, FS3, or FS4 is a PFIC.

FS1 and FS2.
Under this paragraph (e), for purposes of determining whether the rental income actually received
by FS4 with respect to the real property owned and rented by FS4 and treated under section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section as received directly by FS1 or by FS2, respectively, is passive income for purposes of section 1297, the activities of FS3 are taken into account because FS3 is a qualified affiliate of FS1 and FS2, respectively. Thus, the exception in section 954(c)(2)(A) would apply, and the rental income treated as received by FS1 or by FS2, respectively, would be treated as non-passive income for purposes of determining whether FS1 or FS2 is a PFIC.
(

)
FS4.
Under this paragraph (e), for purposes of determining whether the rental income received by FS4 with respect to the real property owned and rented by FS4 is passive income for purposes of section 1297, the activities of FS3 are taken into account, because FS3 is a qualified affiliate of FS4. Thus, the exception in section 954(c)(2)(A) would apply, and the rental income received by FS4 would be treated as non-passive income for purposes of determining whether FS4 is a PFIC.
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that FS2 also owns real property that is leased to a person that is not a related person, and the officers and employees of FS2 in Country A engage in activities that would allow rental income received by FS2 with respect to its real property to qualify for the exception in section 954(c)(2)(A) and § 1.954-2(b)(6) and (c)(1)(iv), relying on the rule in § 1.954-2(c)(2)(ii) that provides that an organization is substantial in relation to rents if active leasing expenses equal or exceed 25% of adjusted leasing profit. However, the active leasing expenses of FS1 are less than 25% of its adjusted leasing profit, which includes the rental income of FS4 treated as received directly by FS1 as well as the rental income of FS2 treated as received directly by FS1.
(B)
Results.
Because FS2's rental income constitutes non-passive income as a result of the application of § 1.1297-1(c)(1)(i)(A) and section 954(c)(2)(A), it is treated as non-passive income that FS1 is treated as receiving directly under section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section for purposes of determining whether FS1 is a PFIC, and accordingly, it is not necessary to rely on paragraph (e) of this section.
(iii)
Example 3
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that USP directly owns 60% of the outstanding stock of FS1.
(B)
Results.
Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, USP cannot be the common parent of an affiliated group for purposes of paragraph (e)(2) of this section because it is a domestic corporation. Because FS1 is a foreign corporation, FS1 may be the common parent of an affiliated group for purposes of paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The results therefore are the same as in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section (the results in Example 1).
(f)
Gain on disposition of a look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership
—(1) [Reserved].
(2)
Amount of gain taken into account from disposition of look-through subsidiary.
For purposes of section 1297(a)(1), section 1298(b)(3), and § 1.1298-2, the amount of gain that is taken into account by a tested foreign corporation from the tested foreign corporation's direct disposition of stock of a look-through subsidiary, or an indirect disposition resulting from the disposition of stock of a look-through subsidiary by other look-through subsidiaries or by look-through partnerships, is the residual gain. The residual gain equals the total gain recognized by the tested foreign corporation (including gain treated as recognized by the tested foreign corporation pursuant to section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section) from the disposition of the stock of the look-through subsidiary reduced (but not below zero) by unremitted earnings.
Unremitted earnings
are the excess (if any) of the aggregate income (if any) taken into account by the tested foreign corporation pursuant to section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section with respect to the stock of the disposed-of look-through subsidiary (including with respect to any other look-through subsidiary, to the extent it is
owned by the tested foreign corporation indirectly through the disposed-of look-through subsidiary) over the aggregate dividends (if any) received by the tested foreign corporation from the disposed-of look-through subsidiary with respect to the stock, determined without regard to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), the amount of gain derived from the disposition of stock of a look-through subsidiary and income of and dividends received from the look-through subsidiary is determined on a share-by-share basis under a reasonable method.
(3)
Characterization of residual gain as passive income.
For purposes of section 1297(a)(1), section 1298(b)(3), and § 1.1298-2, the residual gain from the direct or indirect disposition of stock of a look-through subsidiary is characterized as passive income or non-passive income based on the relative amounts of passive assets and non-passive assets (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(5) and (3), respectively) of the disposed-of look-through subsidiary (and any other look-through subsidiary to the extent owned indirectly through the look-through subsidiary) treated as held by the tested foreign corporation on the date of the disposition of the look-through subsidiary. For the purpose of this paragraph (f)(3), the relative amounts of passive assets and non-passive assets held by the look-through subsidiary are measured under the same method (value or adjusted bases) used to measure the assets of the tested foreign corporation for purposes of section 1297(a)(2).
(4)
Gain taken into account from disposition of 25%-owned partnerships and look-through partnerships
—(i)
Section 954(c)(4) partnerships.
The amount of gain derived from a tested foreign corporation's direct or indirect (through a look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership) disposition of partnership interests in a partnership described in section 954(c)(4) (treating the tested foreign corporation as if it were a controlled foreign corporation) that is taken into account by the tested foreign corporation for purposes of section 1297(a)(1), section 1298(b)(3), and § 1.1298-2 is determined under section 954(c)(4).
(ii)
Look-through partnerships.
In the case of a look-through partnership that is not described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the principles of paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section apply to determine the amount and characterization of gain derived from a tested foreign corporation's direct or indirect (through a look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership) disposition of partnership interests of the look-through partnership that is taken into account by the tested foreign corporation for purposes of section 1297(a)(1), section 1298(b)(3), and § 1.1298-2.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (f). For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (f)(5), USP is a domestic corporation, TFC and FS are foreign corporations that are not controlled foreign corporations within the meaning of section 957(a), and USP, TFC, and FS each has a single class of stock with 100 shares outstanding and a calendar taxable year.
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
USP owned 30% of the outstanding stock of TFC throughout Years 1, 2, 3, and 4. In Year 1, TFC purchased 5 shares of FS stock, representing 5% of the stock of FS, from an unrelated person. On the first day of Year 3, TFC purchased 20 shares of FS stock, representing 20% of the stock of FS, from an unrelated person. TFC owned 25% of the outstanding stock of FS throughout Years 3 and 4. Before Year 3, TFC did not include any amount in income with respect to FS under section 1297(c)(2). During Years 3 and 4, for purposes of section 1297(a)(1), TFC included in income, in the aggregate, $40x of income with respect to FS under section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section. TFC did not receive dividends from FS during Year 1, 2, 3, or 4. For purposes of section 1297(a)(2), TFC measures its assets based on their fair market value as provided under section 1297(e). On the last day of Year 4, TFC recognizes a loss with respect to the sale of 5 shares of FS stock, and a $110x gain with respect to the sale of 20 shares of FS stock. On the date of the sale, FS owns non-passive assets with an aggregate fair market value of $150x, and passive
assets with an aggregate fair market value of $50x.
(B)
Results.
For purposes of applying section 1297(a)(1) to TFC for Year 4, TFC must take into account $78x of residual gain, as provided by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, which equals the amount by which the $110x gain recognized on the sale of 20 shares in FS exceeds the aggregate pro rata share of $32x income ($40x × 20/25) taken into account by TFC with respect to the 20 shares in FS under section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section during Years 3 and 4. There is zero residual gain on the sale of 5 shares of FS stock because they were sold at a loss. Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, $58.50x of the residual gain is non-passive income ($78x × ($150x/$200x)) and $19.50x is passive income ($78x × ($50x/$200x)).
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(5)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that in Year 1, TFC purchased 15 shares of FS stock, representing 15% of the stock of FS, from an unrelated person, and on the first day of Year 3, TFC purchased an additional 15 shares of FS stock, representing 15% of the stock of FS, from an unrelated person, and on the last day of Year 4, TFC recognizes gain of $10x of the sale of 15 shares of FS stock purchased in Year 1, and gain of $60x on the sale of the other 15 shares of FS stock purchased in Year 3.
(B)
Results.
For purposes of applying section 1297(a)(1) to TFC for Year 4, TFC must take into account $40x of residual gain with respect to the 15 shares acquired in Year 3, as provided by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, which equals the amount by which the $60x gain recognized on the sale of those 15 shares exceeds the aggregate pro rata share of $20x income ($40x × 15/30) taken into account by TFC with respect to those 15 shares in FS under section 1297(c)(2) during Years 3 and 4. There is zero residual gain on the sale of the 15 shares of FS stock acquired in Year 1 because the $10x of gain does not exceed the aggregate pro rata share of $20x income taken into account by TFC with respect to those 15 shares of FS under section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, $30x of the residual gain is non-passive income ($40x × ($150x/$200x)) and $10x is passive income ($40x × ($50x/$200x)).
(iii)
Example 3
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
), except that TFC received, in the aggregate, $20x of dividends from FS during Year 2.
(B)
Results.
The results are the same as in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section (the results in
Example 2
) with respect to the 15 shares acquired in Year 3 ($40x of residual gain attributable to the 15 shares acquired in Year 3). For purposes of applying section 1297(a)(1) to TFC for Year 4, TFC must also take into account $10x of residual gain with respect to the 15 shares acquired in Year 1. As provided by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the residual gain equals the amount by which the $10x gain recognized on the sale of those 15 shares exceeds the unremitted earnings with respect to those shares. The unremitted earnings with respect to the 15 shares acquired in Year 1 are $0x, the amount by which the pro rata share of aggregate income ($20x) taken into account by TFC with respect to those 15 shares of FS stock under section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section in Years 3 and 4 exceeds the aggregate pro rata amount of dividends with respect to those 15 shares of FS stock ($20x) received by TFC from FS in Year 2. Total residual gain therefore is $50x ($40x + $10x). Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, $37.50x of the residual gain is non-passive income ($50x × ($150x/$200x)) and $12.50x is passive income ($50x × ($50x/$200x)).

means, with respect to a tested foreign corporation, a corporation as to which the asset test of paragraph (g)(3)(i) and the income
test of paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section are satisfied on each measuring date during the taxable year of a tested foreign corporation. If a corporation satisfies both the asset test of paragraph (g)(3)(i) and the income test of paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) for some but not all measuring periods within the taxable year of a tested foreign corporation, the subsidiary is treated as a look-through subsidiary only for those measuring periods in which both tests are satisfied.

Look-through partnership
—(i)
In general.
The term
look-through partnership
means, with respect to a tested foreign corporation—
(A) A partnership that would be a look-through subsidiary (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) if such partnership were a corporation; or
(B) A partnership that is not described in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(A) of this section, if the tested foreign corporation satisfies both of the active partner tests set forth in paragraphs (g)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section on the measurement date or for the taxable year, as applicable, unless an election is made under paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Active partner test
—(A)
Partnership interest under asset test.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, paragraph (g)(4)(i)(B) of this section applies for the measuring period only if the tested foreign corporation would not be a PFIC if section 1297(a)(1) and (2) and the regulations thereunder were applied to the tested foreign corporation without regard to any partnership interest owned by the tested foreign corporation that is not a partnership described in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(A) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the active partner test is applied on the measurement date (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(1)).
(B)

For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, paragraph (g)(4)(i)(B) of this section applies for the taxable year of the tested foreign corporation or for a measuring period (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(2)), as applicable, only if the tested foreign corporation would not be a PFIC if section 1297(a)(1) and (2) and the regulations thereunder were applied to the tested foreign corporation without regard to any partnership interest owned by the tested foreign corporation that is not a partnership described in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(A) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the active partner test is applied on the measuring date (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(1)) or for the taxable year, as applicable using the same period that was used under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.

Active partner test with respect to partnership interest.
Pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2), TFC is treated as holding directly the assets held by FC1 and FC2. For purposes of the active partner test under paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, TFC does not take into account its interest in FPS to determine whether it would be a PFIC. Because 100% ($2500x/$2500x) of the assets of FC1 and FC2 that TFC is treated as directly holding, without taking into account the interest in FPS, generates non-passive income, TFC satisfies the active partner test in paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.

)
Active partner test with respect to partnership income.
Pursuant to section 1297(c) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, TFC is treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of income of FC1 and FC2. For purposes of the active partner test under paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, TFC does not take into account its interest in FPS to determine whether it would be a PFIC. Because 100% ($250x/$250x) of the income of FC1 and FC2 that TFC is treated as directly receiving, without taking into account the interest in FPS, is non-passive income, TFC satisfies the active partner test in paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(A) of this section with respect to the income of FPS.
(

)
Qualification of look-through partnership.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, FPS qualifies as a look-through partnership because TFC satisfies the active partner tests of both paragraphs (g)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.Unless an election is made not to treat FPS as a look-through partnership under paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section, TFC is treated as receiving directly $5x of income (10% × $50x), TFC's pro rata share of the income of FPS, the character of which is determined at the level of FPS for purposes of section 1297. In addition, TFC is treated as holding directly $50x of FPS's assets (10% × $500x), TFC's proportionate share of the assets held by FPS. The character of those assets as passive or non-passive is determined in the hands of FPS for purposes of section 1297.

Facts.
During Year 1, FC1 generated $50x of passive income, FC2 earned $175x of non-passive income, and FPS generated $50x of income. On all of the measurement dates in Year 1, FC1 has assets with a value of $1100x that produce passive income, and FC2 has assets with a value of $900x that FC2 uses in its trade or business generating non-passive income. The value of FPS is $1000x taking into account its assets and liabilities.

Active partner test with respect to partnership interest.
Pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2), TFC is treated as holding directly the assets held by FC1 and FC2. For purposes of the active partner test under paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, TFC does not take into account its interest in FPS to determine whether it would be a PFIC. Accordingly, 55% ($1100x/$2000x) of the assets that TFC is treated as directly holding, without taking into account the interest in FPS, generate passive income.

Active partner test with respect to partnership income.
Pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2), TFC is treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of income of FC1 and
FC2. For purposes of the active partner test under paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, TFC does not take into account its interest in FPS to determine whether it would be a PFIC. Accordingly, 77.8% ($175x/$225x) of the income that TFC is treated as directly receiving, without taking into account the interest in FPS, is non-passive income.

)
Failure to qualify as look-through partnership.
TFC satisfies the active partner test in paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(A) of this section but does not satisfy the active partner test in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) (B) of this section. Therefore, FPS does not qualify as a look-though partnership. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, TFC's share of income with respect to FPS is treated as passive income for purposes of section 1297 and TFC's $100x interest (10% × $1000x) in FPS is treated as a passive asset for purposes of section 1297.

§ 1.1297-3
Deemed sale or deemed dividend election by a U.S. person that is a shareholder of a section 1297(e) PFIC.
(a)
In general.
A shareholder (as defined in § 1.1291-9(j)(3)) of a foreign corporation that is a section 1297(e) passive foreign investment company (PFIC) (as defined in § 1.1291-9(j)(2)(v)) with respect to such shareholder, shall be treated for tax purposes as holding stock in a PFIC and therefore continues to be subject to taxation under section 1291 unless the shareholder makes a purging election under section 1298(b)(1). A purging election under section 1298(b)(1) is made under rules similar to the rules of section 1291(d)(2). Section 1291(d)(2) allows a shareholder to purge the continuing PFIC taint by either making a deemed sale election or a deemed dividend election.
(b)
Application of deemed sale election rules
—(1)
Eligibility to make the deemed sale election.
A shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a section 1297(e) PFIC with respect to such shareholder may make a deemed sale election under section 1298(b)(1) by applying the rules of this paragraph (b).
(2)
Effect of the deemed sale election.
A shareholder making the deemed sale election with respect to a section 1297(e) PFIC shall be treated as having sold all of its stock in the section 1297(e) PFIC for its fair market value on the controlled foreign corporation (CFC) qualification date, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. A deemed sale under this section is treated as a disposition subject to taxation under section 1291. Thus, the gain from the deemed sale is taxed as an excess distribution received on the CFC qualification date. In the case of an election made by an indirect shareholder, the amount of gain to be recognized and taxed as an excess distribution is the
amount of gain that the direct owner of the stock of the PFIC would have realized on an actual sale or disposition of the stock of the PFIC indirectly owned by the shareholder. Any loss realized on the deemed sale is not recognized. After the deemed sale election, the shareholder's stock with respect to which the election was made under this paragraph (b) shall not be treated as stock in a PFIC and the shareholder shall not be subject to taxation under section 1291 with respect to such stock unless the qualified portion of the shareholder's holding period ends, as determined under section 1297(e)(2), and the foreign corporation thereafter qualifies as a PFIC under section 1297(a).
(3)
Time for making the deemed sale election.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a shareholder shall make the deemed sale election under this paragraph (b) and section 1298(b)(1) in the shareholder's original or amended return for the taxable year that includes the CFC qualification date (election year). If the deemed sale election is made in an amended return, the return must be filed by a date that is within three years of the due date, as extended under section 6081, of the original return for the election year.
(4)
Manner of making the deemed sale election.
A shareholder makes the deemed sale election under this paragraph (b) by filing Form 8621, “Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund”, with the return of the shareholder for the election year, reporting the gain as an excess distribution pursuant to section 1291(a) as if such sale occurred under section 1291(d)(2), and paying the tax and interest due on the excess distribution. A shareholder that makes the deemed sale election after the due date of the return (determined without regard to extensions) for the election year must pay additional interest, pursuant to section 6601, on the amount of underpayment of tax for that year. An electing shareholder that realizes a loss shall report the loss on Form 8621, but shall not recognize the loss.
(5)
Adjustments to basis.
A shareholder that makes the deemed sale election increases its adjusted basis of the PFIC stock owned directly by the amount of gain recognized on the deemed sale. If the shareholder makes the deemed sale election with respect to a PFIC of which it is an indirect shareholder, the shareholder's adjusted basis of the stock or other property owned directly by the shareholder, through which ownership of the PFIC is attributed to the shareholder, is increased by the amount of gain recognized by the shareholder. In addition, solely for purposes of determining the subsequent treatment under the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and regulations of a shareholder of the stock of the PFIC, the adjusted basis of the direct owner of the stock of the PFIC is increased by the amount of gain recognized on the deemed sale. A shareholder shall not adjust the basis of any stock with respect to which the shareholder realized a loss on the deemed sale, which loss is not recognized under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(6)
Treatment of holding period.
If a shareholder of a foreign corporation has made a deemed sale election, then, for purposes of applying sections 1291 through 1298 to such shareholder after the deemed sale, the shareholder's holding period in the stock of the foreign corporation begins on the CFC qualification date, without regard to whether the shareholder recognized gain on the deemed sale. For other purposes of the Code and regulations, this holding period rule does not apply.
(c)
Application of deemed dividend election rules
—(1)
Eligibility to make the deemed dividend election.
A shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a section 1297(e) PFIC with respect to such shareholder may make the deemed dividend election under the rules of this paragraph (c). A deemed dividend election may be made by a shareholder whose pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC attributable to the PFIC stock held on the CFC qualification date is zero.
(2)
Effect of the deemed dividend election.
A shareholder making the deemed dividend election with respect to a section 1297(e) PFIC shall include in income as a dividend its pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC attributable to all of the stock it held, directly or indirectly on
the CFC qualification date, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The deemed dividend is taxed under section 1291 as an excess distribution received on the CFC qualification date. The excess distribution determined under this paragraph (c) is allocated under section 1291(a)(1)(A) only to each day of the shareholder's holding period of the stock during which the foreign corporation qualified as a PFIC. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the shareholder's holding period of the PFIC stock ends on the day before the CFC qualification date. After the deemed dividend election, the shareholder's stock with respect to which the election was made under this paragraph (c) shall not be treated as stock in a PFIC and the shareholder shall not be subject to taxation under section 1291 with respect to such stock unless the qualified portion of the shareholder's holding period ends, as determined under section 1297(e)(2), and the foreign corporation thereafter qualifies as a PFIC under section 1297(a).
(3)
Post-1986 earnings and profits defined
—(i)
In general
—(A)
General rule.
For purposes of this section, the term post-1986 earnings and profits means the post-1986 undistributed earnings, within the meaning of section 902(c)(1) (determined without regard to section 902(c)(3)), as of the day before the CFC qualification date, that were accumulated and not distributed in taxable years of the PFIC beginning after 1986 and during which it was a PFIC, without regard to whether the earnings related to a period during which the PFIC was a CFC.
(B)
Special rule.
If the CFC qualification date is a day that is after the first day of the taxable year, the term post-1986 earnings and profits means the post-1986 undistributed earnings, within the meaning of section 902(c)(1) (determined without regard to section 902(c)(3)), as of the close of the taxable year that includes the CFC qualification date. For purposes of this computation, only earnings and profits accumulated in taxable years during which the foreign corporation was a PFIC shall be taken into account, but without regard to whether the earnings related to a period during which the PFIC was a CFC.
(ii)
Pro rata share of post-1986 earnings and profits attributable to shareholder's stock
—(A)
In general.
A shareholder's pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC attributable to the stock held by the shareholder on the CFC qualification date is the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC accumulated during any portion of the shareholder's holding period ending at the close of the day before the CFC qualification date and attributable, under the principles of section 1248 and the regulations under that section, to the PFIC stock held on the CFC qualification date.
(B)
Reduction for previously taxed amounts.
A shareholder's pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC does not include any amount that the shareholder demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner (in the manner provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section) was, pursuant to another provision of the law, previously included in the income of the shareholder, or of another U.S. person if the shareholder's holding period of the PFIC stock includes the period during which the stock was held by that other U.S. person.
(4)
Time for making the deemed dividend election.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the shareholder shall make the deemed dividend election under this paragraph (c) and section 1298(b)(1) in the shareholder's original or amended return for the taxable year that includes the CFC qualification date (election year). If the deemed dividend election is made in an amended return, the return must be filed by a date that is within three years of the due date, as extended under section 6081, of the original return for the election year.
(5)
Manner of making the deemed dividend election
—(i)
In general.
A shareholder makes the deemed dividend election by filing Form 8621 and the attachment to Form 8621 described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section with the return of the shareholder for the election year, reporting the deemed dividend as an excess distribution pursuant to section 1291(a)(1), and paying the tax and interest due on the excess distribution. A shareholder that makes the deemed dividend election after the
due date of the return (determined without regard to extensions) for the election year must pay additional interest, pursuant to section 6601, on the amount of underpayment of tax for that year.
(ii)
Attachment to Form 8621.
The shareholder must attach a schedule to Form 8621 that demonstrates the calculation of the shareholder's pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC that is treated as distributed to the shareholder on the CFC qualification date, pursuant to this paragraph (c). If the shareholder is claiming an exclusion from its pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits for an amount previously included in its income or the income of another U.S. person, the shareholder must include the following information:
(A) The name, address and taxpayer identification number of each U.S. person that previously included an amount in income, the amount previously included in income by each such U.S. person, the provision of law, pursuant to which the amount was previously included in income, and the taxable year or years of inclusion of each amount.
(B) A description of the transaction pursuant to which the shareholder acquired, directly or indirectly, the stock of the PFIC from another U.S. person, and the provision of law pursuant to which the shareholder's holding period includes the period the other U.S. person held the CFC stock.
(6)
Adjustments to basis.
A shareholder that makes the deemed dividend election increases its adjusted basis of the stock of the PFIC owned directly by the shareholder by the amount of the deemed dividend. If the shareholder makes the deemed dividend election with respect to a PFIC of which it is an indirect shareholder, the shareholder's adjusted basis of the stock or other property owned directly by the shareholder, through which ownership of the PFIC is attributed to the shareholder, is increased by the amount of the deemed dividend. In addition, solely for purposes of determining the subsequent treatment under the Code and regulations of a shareholder of the stock of the PFIC, the adjusted basis of the direct owner of the stock of the PFIC is increased by the amount of the deemed dividend.
(7)
Treatment of holding period.
If the shareholder of a foreign corporation has made a deemed dividend election, then, for purposes of applying sections 1291 through 1298 to such shareholder after the deemed dividend, the shareholder's holding period of the stock of the foreign corporation begins on the CFC qualification date. For other purposes of the Code and regulations, this holding period rule does not apply.
(8)
Coordination with section 959(e).
For purposes of section 959(e), the entire deemed dividend is treated as having been included in gross income under section 1248(a).
(d)
CFC qualification date.
For purposes of this section, the CFC qualification date is the first day on which the qualified portion of the shareholder's holding period in the section 1297(e) PFIC begins, as determined under section 1297(e).
(e)
Late purging elections requiring special consent
—(1)
In general.
This section prescribes the exclusive rules under which a shareholder of a section 1297(e) PFIC may make a section 1298(b)(1) election after the time prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) or (c)(4) of this section for making a deemed sale or a deemed dividend election has elapsed (late purging election). Therefore, a shareholder may not seek such relief under any other provisions of the law, including § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. A shareholder may request the consent of the Commissioner to make a late deemed sale or deemed dividend election for the taxable year of the shareholder that includes the CFC qualification date provided the shareholder satisfies the requirements set forth in this paragraph (e). The Commissioner may, in his discretion, grant relief under this paragraph (e) only if—
(i) In a case where the shareholder is requesting consent under this paragraph (e) after December 31, 2005, the shareholder requests such consent before a representative of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) raises upon audit the PFIC status of the foreign corporation for any taxable year of the shareholder;
(ii) The shareholder has agreed in a closing agreement with the Commissioner, described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to eliminate any prejudice to the interests of the U.S. government, as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, as a consequence of the shareholder's inability to file amended returns for its taxable year in which the CFC qualification date falls or an earlier closed taxable year in which the shareholder has taken a position that is inconsistent with the treatment of the foreign corporation as a PFIC; and
(iii) The shareholder satisfies the procedural requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(2)
Prejudice to the interests of the U.S. government.
The interests of the U.S. government are prejudiced if granting relief would result in the shareholder having a lower tax liability (other than by a de minimis amount), taking into account applicable interest charges, for the taxable year that includes the CFC qualification date (or a prior taxable year in which the taxpayer took a position on a return that was inconsistent with the treatment of the foreign corporation as a PFIC) than the shareholder would have had if the shareholder had properly made the section 1298(b)(1) election in the time prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(3) of this section (or had not taken a position in a return for an earlier year that was inconsistent with the status of the foreign corporation as a PFIC). The time value of money is taken into account for purposes of this computation.
(3)
Procedural requirements
—(i)
In general.
The amount due with respect to a late purging election is determined in the same manner as if the purging election had been timely filed. However, the shareholder is also liable for interest on the amount due, pursuant to section 6601, determined for the period beginning on the due date (without extensions) for the taxpayer's income tax return for the year in which the CFC qualification date falls and ending on the date the late purging election is filed with the IRS.
(ii)
Filing instructions.
A late purging election is made by filing a completed Form 8621-A, “Return by a Shareholder Making Certain Late Elections to End Treatment as a Passive Foreign Investment Company.”
(4)
Time and manner of making late election
—(i)
Time for making a late purging election.
A shareholder may make a late purging election in the manner provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section at any time. The date the election is filed with the IRS will determine the amount of interest due under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Manner of making a late purging election.
A shareholder makes a late purging election by completing Form 8621-A in the manner required by that form and this section and filing that form with the Internal Revenue Service, DP 8621-A, Ogden, UT 84201.
(5)
Multiple late elections
—(i)
General rule.
A shareholder of a foreign corporation may make multiple late purging elections under the rules of this paragraph (e) or § 1.1298-3(e) to the same extent such multiple purging elections could have been made if those purging elections had been filed within the time prescribed under paragraph (b)(3) or (c)(4) of this section or § 1.1298-3(b)(3) or (c)(4).
(ii)
Example.
The rule of this paragraph (e)(5) is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) In 1991, X, a U.S. person, acquired a five percent interest in the stock of FC, a controlled foreign corporation, as defined in section 957(a). In years 1991, 1992, 1995, 1996 and 1997, FC satisfied either the income test or the asset test of section 1297(a). X did not make a QEF election with regard to FC. In years 1993 and 1994, FC did not satisfy either the income or the asset test of section 1297(a). In 1998, X acquired additional stock in FC such that X was a U.S. shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) of FC.
(ii) Because FC qualified as a PFIC in 1991, FC will be treated as a PFIC with respect to all of the stock held by X, under the “once a PFIC always a PFIC” rule of section 1298(b)(1), unless X makes an election to purge the PFIC taint. Because X ceased to satisfy either the income or asset test in 1993, X could have made an election under § 1.1298-3 to purge the PFIC taint of FC for that year if X had filed such an election within the time prescribed under § 1.1298-3(b)(3) or (c)(4). If X had done so, the stock X held in FC would not be treated as stock in a PFIC for the years 1993 and 1994. Because X became a U.S. shareholder of FC in 1998, X then could have made a deemed sale or deemed dividend election under this section to purge the PFIC taint of FC for the years
1995 through 1997 if X had filed within the time prescribed under paragraph (b)(3) or (c)(4) of this section. Accordingly, X may make a late purging election to purge the PFIC taint of FC for the years 1991 and 1992 under the rules of § 1.1298-3(e) and may also make a late purging election to purge the PFIC taint of FC for the years 1995 through 1997 under the rules of this paragraph (e).
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
The rules of this section are applicable as of December 8, 2005.
[T.D. 9360, 72 FR 54821, Sept. 27, 2007, as amended at 72 FR 58758, Oct. 17, 2007]
§ 1.1297-4
Qualifying insurance corporation.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules for determining whether a foreign corporation is a qualifying insurance corporation for purposes of section 1297(f). Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rule for determining whether a foreign corporation is a qualifying insurance corporation. Paragraph (c) of this section describes the 25 percent test in section 1297(f)(1)(B). Paragraph (d) of this section contains rules for applying the alternative facts and circumstances test in section 1297(f)(2). Paragraph (e) of this section contains rules limiting the amount of applicable insurance liabilities for purposes of the 25 percent test described in paragraph (c) of this section and the alternative facts and circumstances test described in paragraph (d) of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section provides definitions that apply for purposes of this section. Paragraph (g) of this section provides the applicability date of this section.
(b)
Qualifying insurance corporation.
For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(B), this section, and §§ 1.1297-5 and 1.1297-6, with respect to a U.S. person, a qualifying insurance corporation (QIC) is a foreign corporation that—
(1) Is an insurance company as defined in section 816(a) that would be subject to tax under subchapter L if the corporation were a domestic corporation; and
(2) Satisfies—
(i) The 25 percent test described in paragraph (c) of this section; or
(ii) The requirements for an election to apply the alternative facts and circumstances test as described in paragraph (d) of this section and a United States person has made an election as described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
(c)
25 percent test.
A foreign corporation satisfies the 25 percent test if the amount of its applicable insurance liabilities exceeds 25 percent of its total assets. This determination is made on the basis of the applicable insurance liabilities and total assets reported on the corporation's applicable financial statement for the applicable reporting period.
(d)
Election to apply the alternative facts and circumstances test
—(1)
In general.
A United States person that owns stock in a foreign corporation that fails to qualify as a QIC solely because of the 25 percent test may elect to treat the stock of the corporation as stock of a QIC if the foreign corporation—
(i) Is predominantly engaged in an insurance business as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section;
(ii) Failed to satisfy the 25 percent test solely due to runoff-related circumstances, as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, or rating-related circumstances, as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section; and
(iii) Reports an amount of applicable insurance liabilities that is at least 10 percent of the amount of the total assets on the corporation's applicable financial statement for the applicable reporting period.
(2)
Predominantly engaged in an insurance business
—(i)
In general.
A foreign corporation is not considered predominantly engaged in an insurance business in any taxable year unless more than half of the business of the foreign corporation is the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts or the reinsuring of risks underwritten by insurance companies. This determination is made based on the character of the business actually conducted in the taxable year. The fact that a foreign corporation has been holding itself out as an insurer for a long period is not determinative of whether the foreign corporation is predominantly engaged in an insurance business.
(ii)
Facts and circumstances.
Facts and circumstances to consider in determining whether a foreign corporation
is predominantly engaged in an insurance business include (but are not limited to)—
(A) Claims payment patterns for the current year and prior years;
(B) The foreign corporation's loss exposure as calculated for a regulator or for a credit rating agency, or, if those are not calculated, for internal pricing purposes;
(C) The percentage of gross receipts constituting premiums for the current and prior years; and
(D) The number and size of insurance contracts issued or taken on through reinsurance by the foreign corporation.
(iii)
Examples of facts indicating a foreign corporation is not predominantly engaged in an insurance business.
Examples of facts that may indicate a foreign corporation is not predominantly engaged in an insurance business include (but are not limited to)—
(A) A small overall number of insured risks with low likelihood but large potential costs;
(B) Employees and agents of the foreign corporation focused to a greater degree on investment activities than underwriting activities; and
(C) Low loss exposure.
(3)
Runoff-related circumstances.
During the annual reporting period covered by the applicable financial statement, a foreign corporation fails to satisfy the 25 percent test solely due to runoff-related circumstances only if the corporation—
(i) Was engaged in the process of terminating its pre-existing, active conduct of an insurance business (within the meaning of section 1297(b)(2)(B)) under the supervision of its applicable insurance regulatory body or pursuant to any court-ordered receivership proceeding (liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation) and fails to satisfy the 25 percent test because the corporation is required to hold additional assets due to its business being in runoff;
(ii) Has no plan or intention to enter into, and did not issue or enter into, any insurance, annuity, or reinsurance contract, other than a contractually obligated renewal of an existing insurance contract or a reinsurance contract pursuant to and consistent with the termination of its active conduct of an insurance business; and
(iii) Made payments during the annual reporting period covered by the applicable financial statement as required to satisfy claims under insurance, annuity, or reinsurance contracts.
(4)
Rating-related circumstances.
A foreign corporation fails to satisfy the 25 percent test solely due to rating-related circumstances only if—
(i) The 25 percent test is not met due to capital and surplus amounts that a generally recognized credit rating agency considers necessary for the foreign corporation to obtain a public rating with respect to its financial strength, and the foreign corporation maintains such capital and surplus in order to obtain the minimum credit rating necessary for the annual reporting period by the foreign corporation to be able to write the business in its regulatory or board supervised business plan. This paragraph (c)(4)(i) applies only if the foreign corporation is a mortgage insurance company (as defined in paragraph (f)(10) of this section) or if more than half of the foreign corporation's net written premiums for the annual reporting period (or the average of the net written premiums for the foreign corporation's annual reporting period and the two immediately preceding annual reporting periods) are from insurance coverage against the risk of loss from a catastrophic loss event (that is, a low frequency but high severity loss event); or
(ii) The foreign corporation is a financial guaranty insurance company (as defined in paragraph (f)(5) of this section).
(5)
Election
—(i)
In general.
A United States person may make the election under section 1297(f)(2) for its taxable year if the foreign corporation directly provides the United States person a statement, signed by a responsible officer of the foreign corporation or an authorized representative of the foreign corporation, or the foreign corporation (or its foreign parent corporation on its behalf) makes a publicly available statement (such as in a public filing, disclosure statement, or other notice provided to United States persons that are shareholders of the foreign corporation) that it satisfied the requirements of section 1297(f)(2) and paragraph (d)(1)
of this section during the foreign corporation's applicable reporting period. However, a United States person may not rely upon any statement by the foreign corporation (or its foreign parent corporation) to make the election under section 1297(f)(2) if the shareholder knows or has reason to know based on reasonably accessible information that the statement made by the foreign corporation (or its foreign parent corporation) was incorrect.
(ii)
Information provided by foreign corporation.
In addition to a statement that the foreign corporation satisfied the requirements of section 1297(f)(2) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the statement described in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section also must include:
(A) The ratio of applicable insurance liabilities to total assets for the applicable reporting period; and
(B) A statement indicating whether the failure to satisfy the 25 percent test described in paragraph (c) of this section was the result of runoff-related or rating-related circumstances, along with a brief description of those circumstances.
(iii)
Time and manner for making the election.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(iv), the election described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be made by a United States person who owns stock in the foreign corporation by completing the appropriate part of Form 8621 (or successor form) for each taxable year of the United States person in which the election applies. A United States person must attach the Form 8621 (or successor form) to its original or amended Federal income tax return for the taxable year of the United States person to which the election relates. A United States person can attach the Form 8621 (or successor form) to an amended return for the taxable year of the United States person to which the election relates if the United States person can demonstrate the reason for not filing the form with its original return was due to reasonable cause.
(iv)
Deemed election for small shareholders in publicly traded companies
—(A)
In general.
A United States person who owns publicly traded stock in a foreign corporation will be deemed to make the election under section 1297(f)(2) with respect to the foreign corporation and its subsidiaries if the following requirements are satisfied:
(
1
) The stock of the foreign corporation that is owned by the United States person (including stock owned indirectly) has a value of $25,000 or less ($50,000 or less in the case of a joint return) on the last day of the United States person's taxable year and on any day during the taxable year on which the United States person disposes of stock of the foreign corporation; and
(
2
) If the United States person owns stock of the foreign corporation indirectly through a domestic partnership, domestic trust, domestic estate, or S corporation (a
domestic pass-through entity
), the stock of the foreign corporation that is owned by the domestic pass-through entity has a value of $25,000 or less on the last day of the taxable year of the domestic pass-through entity that ends with or within the United States person's taxable year and on any day during the taxable year of the domestic pass-through entity on which it disposes of stock of the foreign corporation.
(B)
Publicly traded stock.
For the purpose of paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, stock is publicly traded if it would be treated as marketable stock within the meaning of section 1296(e) and § 1.1296-2 (without regard to § 1.1296-2(d)) if the election under section 1297(f)(2) is not made.
(v)
Options.
If a United States person is considered to own stock in a foreign corporation by reason of holding an option, the United States person may make the election under section 1297(f)(2) (or may be deemed to make an election under paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section) with respect to the foreign corporation or its subsidiaries in the same manner as if the United States person owned stock in the foreign corporation.
(6)
Stock ownership.
For purposes of this section, ownership of stock in a foreign corporation means either direct ownership of such stock or indirect ownership determined using the rules specified in § 1.1291-1(b)(8) (but without regard to the 50 percent ownership requirement of § 1.1291-1(b)(8)(ii)(A)).
(e)
Rules limiting the amount of applicable insurance liabilities
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation satisfies the 25 percent test described in paragraph (c) of this section or the 10 percent test described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the rules of this paragraph (e) apply to limit the amount of applicable insurance liabilities of the foreign corporation.
(2)
General limitation on applicable insurance liabilities.
The amount of applicable insurance liabilities may not exceed any of the amounts described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) to (iii) of this section. This paragraph (e)(2) applies after applying paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(i) The amount of applicable insurance liabilities of the foreign corporation shown on any financial statement that the foreign corporation filed or was required to file with its applicable insurance regulatory body for the financial statement's applicable reporting period;
(ii) If the foreign corporation's applicable financial statement is prepared on the basis of either GAAP or IFRS, the amount of the foreign corporation's applicable insurance liabilities determined on the basis of its applicable financial statement, whether or not the foreign corporation files the statement with its applicable insurance regulatory body; or
(iii) The amount of applicable insurance liabilities required for the foreign corporation by the applicable law or regulation of the jurisdiction of the applicable insurance regulatory body at the end of the applicable reporting period (or a lesser amount of applicable insurance liabilities, if the foreign corporation is holding a lesser amount as a permitted practice of the applicable regulatory body).
(3)
Discounting.
If an applicable financial statement or a financial statement described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is prepared on the basis of an accounting method other than GAAP or IFRS and does not discount applicable insurance liabilities on an economically reasonable basis, the amount of applicable insurance liabilities may not exceed the amount of applicable insurance liabilities on the financial statement reduced by applying the discounting methods that would apply under either GAAP or IFRS to the insurance or annuity contracts to which the applicable insurance liabilities at issue relate. The foreign corporation may choose whether to apply either GAAP or IFRS discounting methods for this purpose.

§ 1.1297-5
[Reserved]
§ 1.1297-6
Exception from the definition of passive income for active insurance income.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules pertaining to the exception from passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(B) for income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business and rules related to certain income of a qualifying domestic insurance corporation. Paragraph (b) of this section provides a general rule that excludes from passive income certain income of a qualifying insurance corporation (QIC), as defined in § 1.1297-4(b), and certain income of a qualifying domestic insurance corporation. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules excluding certain assets for purposes of the passive asset test under section 1297(a)(2). Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules concerning the treatment of income and assets of certain look-through subsidiaries and look-through partnerships of a QIC. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules relating to qualifying domestic insurance corporations. Paragraph (f) of this section provides the applicability date of this section.
(b)
Exclusion from passive income of active insurance income.
For purposes of section 1297 and § 1.1297-1, passive income does not include—
(1) Income that a QIC derives in the active conduct of an insurance business (within the meaning of section 1297(b)(2)(B)); and
(2) Income of a qualifying domestic insurance corporation.
(c)
Exclusion of assets for purposes of the passive asset test under section 1297(a)(2).
For purposes of section 1297 and § 1.1297-1, passive assets (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(5)), do not include—
(1) Assets of a QIC available to satisfy liabilities of the QIC related to its insurance business (as defined in § 1.1297-4(f)(8)), if the QIC is engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business (within the meaning of section 1297(b)(2)(B)); and
(2) Assets of a qualifying domestic insurance corporation.
(d)
Treatment of income and assets of certain look-through subsidiaries and look-through partnerships for purposes of the section 1297(b)(2)(B) exception
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of applying paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section, a QIC is treated as receiving the income or holding the assets of a look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership to the extent provided in section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2) or § 1.1297-2(b)(3). Subject to the limitation of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a QIC's proportionate share of the income or assets of a look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership may be treated as earned or held directly by the QIC, and thus as non-passive under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section, if the requirements of those paragraphs are satisfied.
(2)
Limitation.
A QIC that is engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business (within the meaning of section 1297(b)(2)(B)) may not treat its proportionate share of the income or assets of a look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership as non-passive to the extent that it exceeds the greater of—
(i) The QIC's proportionate share of the income or assets, respectively, of the look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net equity value of the interests held by the QIC in the look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership, and the denominator of which is the value of the QIC's proportionate share of the assets of the look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership; and
(ii) The QIC's proportionate share of the income or assets, respectively, of the look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership that are treated as non-passive in the hands of the look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.
(i)
Example 1: QIC holds all the stock of an investment subsidiary
—(A)
Facts.
(
1
) F1 is a foreign corporation. In Year 1, F1 meets the definition of a QIC under section 1297(f) and § 1.1297-4 and is engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business within the meaning of section 1297(b)(2)(B). Throughout Year 1, F1 owns all the stock of F2, a foreign corporation that is not a QIC and is engaged solely in the investment of passive assets. The stock of F2 is an asset that is available to satisfy liabilities of F1 related to its insurance business within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The assets of F1 are measured on the basis of value under § 1.1297-1(d)(1)(v)(C).
(
2
) Throughout Year 1, F2 owns assets with a value of $1,000x and adjusted bases of $500x, all of which are treated as passive in the hands of F2. F2 has outstanding debt with a principal amount of $250x. On the financial statement end date of F1's applicable financial statement, the net equity value of the F2 stock held by F1 is $750x. In Year 1, F2 earned $100x of income that is treated as passive in the hands of F2.
(B)
Result
—(
1
) Because F1 owns all of the stock of F2, F2 is a look-through subsidiary of F1 within the meaning of § 1.1297-2(g)(3). Under section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2), F1 is treated as if it held 100% of the assets of F2 and received directly 100% of the income of F2. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, because F1 is engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business and the stock of F2 is an asset that is available to satisfy the insurance liabilities of F1, F1 treats its proportionate share of the income and assets of F2 as non-passive. The amount of income and assets that is treated as non-passive is subject to the limitation of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(
2
) Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of F1's proportionate share of F2's income that is treated as non-passive cannot exceed the greater of two amounts: $75x, which is F1's proportionate share of F2's income ($100x) multiplied by 75% (the net equity value of the F2 stock held by F1, which is $750x, divided by the value of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets, which is $1,000x); and zero, which is F1's proportionate share of the income of F2 that is treated as non-passive in the hands of F2. Therefore, for the purpose of characterizing F1's proportionate share of F2's income, $75x is treated as non-passive, and $25x is treated as passive.
(
3
) Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets that is treated as non-passive cannot exceed the greater of two amounts: $750x, which is F1's proportionate share of F2's assets ($1,000x) multiplied by 75% (the net equity value of the F2 stock held by F1, which is $750x, divided by the value of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets, which is $1,000x); and zero, which is F1's proportionate share of the assets of F2 that are treated as non-passive in the hands of F2. Therefore, for the purpose of characterizing F1's proportionate share of the assets of F2, $750x is treated as non-passive, and $250x is treated as passive.
(C)
Alternative facts
—(
1
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section (paragraph (A) of this Example 1), except that the assets of F1 are measured on the basis of adjusted basis under § 1.1297-1(d)(1)(v)(C) pursuant to a valid election under § 1.1297-1(d)(1)(iii).
(
2
)
Result.
The result with respect to F1's proportionate share of the income of F2 is the same as in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section (paragraph (B)(
2
) of this Example 1). Because the
assets of F1 are measured on the basis of adjusted basis under § 1.1297-1(d)(1)(v)(C), F1's proportionate share of the passive assets of F2 is equal to $500x (100% of $500x adjusted bases). Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets that may be treated as non-passive cannot exceed the greater of two amounts: $375x, which is F1's proportionate share of F2's passive assets ($500x) multiplied by 75% (the net equity value of the F2 stock held by F1, which is $750x, divided by the value of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets, which is $1,000x); and zero, which is F1's proportionate share of the assets of F2 that are treated as non-passive in the hands of F2. Therefore, for the purpose of characterizing F1's proportionate share of the assets of F2, $375x is treated as non-passive, and $125x is treated as passive.
(ii)
Example 2: QIC holds all the stock of an operating subsidiary
—(A)
Facts.
(
1
) F1 is a foreign corporation. In Year 1, F1 meets the definition of a QIC under section 1297(f) and § 1.1297-4 and is engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business within the meaning of section 1297(b)(2)(B). Throughout Year 1, F1 owns all the stock of F2, a foreign corporation engaged in a manufacturing business that is not a QIC. The stock of F2 is an asset that is available to satisfy liabilities of F1 related to its insurance business within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The assets of F1 are measured on the basis of value under § 1.1297-1(d)(1)(v)(C).
(
2
) Throughout Year 1, F2 owns assets with a value of $1,200x, of which $1,000x is treated as non-passive and $200x is treated as passive in the hands of F2. F2 has outstanding debt of $600x. On the financial statement end date of F1's applicable financial statement, the net equity value of the F2 stock held by F1 is $600x. In Year 1, F2 earned $120x of income, of which, in the hands of F2, $100x is treated as non-passive and $20x is treated as passive.
(B)
Result
—(
1
) Because F1 owns all the stock of F2, F2 is a look-through subsidiary of F1 within the meaning of § 1.1297-2(g)(3). Under section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2), F1 is treated as if it held 100% of the assets of F2 and received directly 100% of the income of F2. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, because F1 is engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business and the stock of F2 is an asset that is available to satisfy the insurance liabilities of F1, F1 treats its proportionate share of the income and assets of F2 as non-passive. The amount of income and assets that is treated as non-passive is subject to the limitation of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(
2
) Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of F1's proportionate share of F2's income that is treated as non-passive cannot exceed the greater of two amounts: $60x, which is F1's proportionate share of F2's income ($120x) multiplied by 50% (the net equity value of the F2 stock held by F1, which is $600x, divided by the value of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets, which is $1,200x); and $100x, which is F1's proportionate share of the income of F2 that is treated as non-passive in the hands of F2. Therefore, for the purpose of characterizing F1's proportionate share of F2's income, $100x is treated as non-passive, and $20x is treated as passive.
(
3
) Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets that is treated as non-passive cannot exceed the greater of two amounts: $600x, which is F1's proportionate share of F2's income ($1,200x) multiplied by 50% (the net equity value of the F2 stock held by F1, which is $600x, divided by the value of F1's proportionate share of F2's assets, which is $1,200x); and $1,000x, which is F1's proportionate share of the assets of F2 that are treated as non-passive in the hands of F2. Therefore, for the purpose of characterizing F1's proportionate share of the assets of F2, $1,000x is treated as non-passive, and $200x is treated as passive.

(2)
Additional requirement to file for certain indirect shareholders
—(i)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, an indirect shareholder that owns an interest in a PFIC through one or more United States persons also must file Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the PFIC under section 1298(f) and these regulations if, during the indirect shareholder's taxable year, the indirect shareholder is—
(A) Treated as receiving an excess distribution (within the meaning of section 1291(b)) with respect to the PFIC;
(B) Treated as recognizing gain that is treated as an excess distribution (under section 1291(a)(2)) as a result of a disposition of the PFIC;
(C) Required to include an amount in income under section 1293(a) with respect to the PFIC (QEF inclusion);

Exception to indirect shareholder reporting for certain QEF inclusions and MTM inclusions.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), the filing requirements under paragraph (b) of this section do not apply with respect to an interest in a PFIC owned by an indirect shareholder described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) or (D) of this section if another shareholder through which the indirect shareholder owns such interest in the PFIC timely files Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the PFIC under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.

(3)

—(i)
Domestic liquidating trusts and fixed investment trusts.
A United States person that is treated under sections 671 through 678 as the owner of any portion of a trust described in section 7701(a)(30)(E) that owns, directly or indirectly, any interest in a PFIC is not required under section 1298(f) and these regulations to file Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the PFIC if the trust is either a domestic liquidating trust under § 301.7701-4(d) of this chapter created pursuant to a court order issued in a bankruptcy under Chapter 7 (11 U.S.C. 701

et seq.
) of the Bankruptcy Code, or a widely held fixed investment trust under § 1.671-5.

(iii)
Application of the $25,000 exception to shareholders who file a joint return.
In the case of a joint return, the exception described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section shall apply if the value of all PFIC stock owned directly or indirectly (as determined under section 1298(a), § 1.1291-1(b)(8), and paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) by both spouses is $50,000 or less, and all of the other applicable requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are met.
(iv)
Reliance on periodic account statements.
A shareholder may rely upon periodic account statements provided at least annually to determine the value of a PFIC unless the shareholder has actual knowledge or reason to know based on readily accessible information that the statements do not reflect a reasonable estimate of the PFIC's value.
(3)
Exception for PFIC stock marked to market under a provision other than section 1296.
A shareholder is not required under section 1298(f) and these regulations to file Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to a PFIC for any taxable year in which the PFIC is marked to market under any provision of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 1296, provided the rules of § 1.1296-1(i)(2) and (3) do not apply to the shareholder with respect to the PFIC pursuant to § 1.1291-1(c)(4)(ii) for the taxable year.

A shareholder who is a member or beneficiary of, or participant in, a plan, trust, scheme, or other arrangement that is treated as a foreign pension fund (or equivalent) under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party and that owns, directly or indirectly, an interest in a PFIC is not required under section 1298(f) and these regulations to file Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the PFIC interest if, pursuant to the applicable income tax treaty, the income earned by the foreign pension fund may be taxed as the income of the shareholder only when and to the extent the income is paid to, or for the benefit of, the shareholder.
(5)
Exception for certain shareholders who are dual resident taxpayers
—(i)
General rule.
Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section, a shareholder is not required under section 1298(f) and these regulations to file Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to a PFIC for a taxable year, or the portion of a taxable year, in which the shareholder is a dual resident taxpayer (within the meaning of § 301.7701(b)-7(a)(1) of this chapter) who is treated as a nonresident alien of the United States for purposes of computing his or her United States income tax liability pursuant to § 301.7701(b)-7 of this chapter.
(ii)

Exception for certain domestic partnerships.
A shareholder that is a domestic partnership is not required under section 1298(f) and these regulations to file Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to a PFIC directly or indirectly held by the domestic partnership for a taxable year if each person that directly or indirectly owns an interest in the domestic partnership for its taxable year in which or with which the taxable year of the partnership ends is either—

(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
General requirement to file.
(i)
Facts.
In 2013, J, a United States citizen, directly owns an interest in Partnership X, a domestic partnership, which, in turn, owns an interest in A Corp, which is a PFIC. In addition, J directly owns an interest in Partnership Y, a foreign partnership, which, in turn, owns an interest in A Corp. Neither J nor Partnership X has made a qualified electing fund election under section 1295 or a mark to market election under section 1296 with respect to A Corp. As of the last day of 2013, the value of Partnership X's interest in A Corp is $200,000, and the value of J's proportionate share of Partnership Y's interest in A Corp is $100,000. During 2013, J is not treated as receiving an excess distribution or recognizing gain treated as an excess distribution with respect to A Corp. Partnership X timely files a Form 8621 under section 1298(f) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to A Corp for 2013.
(ii)
Results.
J is the first United States person in the chain of ownership with respect to J's interest in A Corp held through Partnership Y. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, J must file a Form 8621 under section 1298(f) with respect to J's interest in A Corp held through Partnership Y because J is an indirect shareholder of A Corp under § 1.1291-1(b)(8) that holds PFIC stock through a foreign entity (Partnership Y), and there are no other United States persons in the chain of ownership. The fact that Partnership X filed a Form 8621 with respect to A Corp does not relieve J of the obligation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to file a Form 8621 with respect to J's interest in A Corp held through Partnership Y. J has no filing obligation under section 1298(f) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section with respect to J's proportionate share of Partnership X's interest in A Corp.

# Example 2.
Application of the $25,000 exception.
(i)
Facts.
In 2013, J, a United States citizen, directly owns stock of A Corp, B Corp, and C Corp, all of which were PFICs during 2013. As of the last day of 2013, the value of
J's interests was $5,000 in A Corp, $10,000 in B Corp, and $4,000 in C Corp. J timely filed an election under section 1295 to treat A Corp as a qualified electing fund for the first year in which A Corp qualified as a PFIC, and a mark-to-market election under section 1296 with respect to the stock of B Corp. J did not make a qualified electing fund election under section 1295 or a mark to market election under section 1296 with respect to C Corp. J did not receive an excess distribution or recognize gain treated as an excess distribution in respect of C Corp during 2013.
(ii)
Results.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, J must file separate Forms 8621 with respect to A Corp and B Corp for 2013. However, J is not required to file a Form 8621 with respect to C Corp because J owns, in the aggregate, PFIC stock with a value of less than $25,000 on the last day of J's taxable year, C Corp is not subject to a qualified electing fund election or mark to market election with respect to J, and J did not receive an excess distribution in respect of C Corp or recognize gain treated as an excess distribution in respect of C Corp during 2013. Therefore, J qualifies for the $25,000 exception in paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to C Corp.

# Example 3.
Application of the $25,000 exception to indirect shareholder.
(i)
Facts.
E, a United States citizen, directly owns an interest in Partnership X, a domestic partnership. Partnership X, in turn, directly owns an interest in A Corp and B Corp, both of which are PFICs. Partnership X timely filed an election under section 1295 to treat B Corp as a qualified electing fund for the first year in which B Corp qualified as a PFIC. In addition, E directly owns an interest in C Corp, which is a PFIC. C Corp, in turn, owns an interest in D Corp, which is a PFIC. E has not made a qualified electing fund election under section 1295 or a mark to market election under section 1296 with respect to A Corp, C Corp, or D Corp. As of the last day of 2013, the value of Partnership X's interest in A Corp is $30,000, the value of Partnership X's interest in B Corp is $30,000, the value of E's indirect interest in A Corp is $10,000, the value of E's indirect interest in B Corp is $10,000, the value of E's interest in C Corp is $20,000, and the value of C Corp's interest in D Corp is $10,000. During 2013, E did not receive an excess distribution, or recognize gain treated as an excess distribution, with respect to A Corp, C Corp, or D Corp. Partnership X timely files Forms 8621 under section 1298(f) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to A Corp and B Corp for 2013.
(ii)
Results.
Under paragraph (b) of this section, E does not have to file a Form 8621 under section 1298(f) and these regulations with respect to A Corp because E is not the United States person that is at the lowest tier in the chain of ownership with respect to A Corp and E did not receive an excess distribution or recognize gain treated as an excess distribution with respect to A Corp. Furthermore, under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, E does not have to file a Form 8621 under section 1298(f) and these regulations with respect to B Corp because Partnership X timely filed a Form 8621 with respect to B Corp. In addition, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, E does not take into account the value of A Corp and B Corp, which E owns through Partnership X, in determining whether E qualifies for the $25,000 exception. Further, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, E does not take into account the value of D Corp in determining whether E qualifies for the $25,000 exception. Therefore, even though E is the United States person that is at the lowest tier in the chain of ownership with respect to C Corp and D Corp, E does not have to file a Form 8621 with respect to C Corp or D Corp because E qualifies for the $25,000 exception set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section.

# Example 4.
Indirect shareholder's requirement to file.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
of this paragraph (g), except that the value of E's interest in C Corp is $30,000 and the value of E's proportionate share of C Corp's interest in D Corp is $3,000.
(ii)
Results.
The results are the same as in
Example 3
of this paragraph (g) with respect to E having no requirement to file a Form 8621 under section 1298(f) and these regulations with respect to A Corp and B Corp. However, under the facts in this
Example 4,
E does not qualify for the $25,000 exception under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section with respect to C Corp because the value of E's interest in C Corp is $30,000. Accordingly, E must file a Form 8621 under section 1298(f) and these regulations with respect to C Corp. However, E does qualify for the $5,000 exception under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)(
2
) of this section with respect to D Corp, and thus does not have to file a Form 8621 with respect to D Corp.

# Example 5.
Application of the domestic partnership exception.
(i)
Facts.
Tax Exempt Entity A and Tax Exempt Entity B are both organizations exempt under section 501(a) because they are described in section 501(c). Tax Exempt Entity A and Tax Exempt Entity B own all the interests in Partnership X, a domestic partnership, which, in turn, owns, an interest in Partnership Y, also a domestic partnership. The remaining interests in Partnership Y are owned by F Corp, a foreign corporation owned solely by individuals that are not residents or citizens of the United States. Partnership Y owns an interest in A Corp, which is a PFIC. Any income derived with respect to A Corp would not be taxable to Tax Exempt Entity A or Tax Exempt Entity B under subchapter F of Subtitle A of the Code. Tax Exempt Entity A, Tax Exempt
Entity B, Partnership X, and Partnership Y all are calendar year taxpayers.
(ii)
Results.
Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, Tax Exempt Entity A and Tax Exempt Entity B do not have to file Form 8621 under section 1298(f) and these regulations with respect to A Corp because neither entity would be subject to tax under subchapter F of Subtitle A of the Code with respect to income derived from A Corp. In addition, under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, neither Partnership X nor Partnership Y is required to file Form 8621 under section 1298(f) and these regulations with respect to A Corp because all of the direct and indirect interests in Partnership X and Partnership Y are owned by persons described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or persons that are not a shareholder of A Corp as defined by § 1.1291-1(b)(7).
(h)
Applicability dates.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, this section applies to taxable years of shareholders ending on or after December 31, 2013.
(2) Paragraph (c)(9) of this section applies to taxable years of shareholders ending before December 31, 2013.
[T.D. 9806, 81 FR 95466, Dec. 28, 2016]
§ 1.1298-2
Rules for certain corporations changing businesses.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules under section 1298(b)(3) and 1298(g) that apply to certain foreign corporations that dispose of one or more active trades or businesses for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is treated as a passive foreign investment company (PFIC). Paragraph (b) of this section provides a rule that applies to certain foreign corporations that dispose of one or more active trades or businesses. Paragraph (c) of this section provides special rules. Paragraph (d) of this section provides a rule for the treatment of the disposition of the stock of a look-through subsidiary (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(3)) or partnership interests in a look-through partnership (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(4)). Paragraph (e) of this section provides guidance on when a tested foreign corporation can apply the change of business exception. Paragraph (f) provides examples illustrating the application of the rules in this section. Paragraph (g) provides the applicability date for this section.
(b)
Change of business exception.
A corporation is not treated as a PFIC for a taxable year if—
(1) Neither the corporation (nor any predecessor) was a PFIC for any prior taxable year;
(2) Either—
(i) Substantially all of the passive income of the corporation for the taxable year is attributable to proceeds from the disposition of one or more active trades or businesses; or
(ii) Following the disposition of one or more active trades or businesses, substantially all of the passive assets of the corporation on each of the measuring dates that occur during the taxable year and after the disposition are attributable to proceeds from the disposition; and
(3) The corporation reasonably does not expect to be and is not a PFIC for either of the first two taxable years following the taxable year.
(c)
Special rules.
The rules in this paragraph (c) apply for purposes of section 1298(b)(3) and this section.
(1) Income is attributable to proceeds from the disposition of one or more active trades or businesses to the extent the income is derived from the investment of the proceeds from the disposition of assets used in the active trades or businesses.
(2) Assets are attributable to proceeds from the disposition of one or more active trades or businesses only to the extent the assets are the proceeds of the disposition of assets used in the active trades or businesses, or are derived from the investment of the proceeds.
(3) The determination of the existence of an active trade or business and whether assets are used in an active trade or business is made under § 1.367(a)-2(d)(2), (3), and (5), except that officers and employees do not include the officers and employees of related entities as provided in § 1.367(a)-2(d)(3). However, if activities performed by the officers and employees of a look-through subsidiary of a corporation or of a look-through partnership (including a look-through subsidiary or a look-through partnership with respect to which paragraph (d) of this section applies) would be taken into account by the corporation pursuant to § 1.1297-
2(e) if it applied, such activities are taken into account for purposes of the determination of the existence of an active trade or business and the determination of whether assets are used in an active trade or business.
(4) In the case of a corporation that satisfies the condition in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the condition in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is deemed to be satisfied if the corporation completely liquidates by the end of the taxable year following the year with respect to which the tested foreign corporation applies the exception in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Disposition of stock of a look-through subsidiary or partnership interests in a look-through partnership.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the proceeds from a tested foreign corporation's disposition of the stock of a look-through subsidiary or of partnership interests in a look-through partnership are treated as proceeds from the disposition of a proportionate share of the assets held by the look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership on the date of the disposition, based on the method (value or adjusted bases) used to measure the assets of the tested foreign corporation for purposes of section 1297(a)(2). The proceeds attributable to assets used by the look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership in an active trade or business are treated as proceeds attributable to the disposition of an active trade or business.
(e)
Application of change of business exception.
A tested foreign corporation can apply the exception in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a taxable year of a disposition of an active trade or business or an immediately succeeding taxable year, but cannot apply the exception with respect to more than one taxable year for a disposition.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of these examples: USP is a domestic corporation; TFC and FS are foreign corporations that are not controlled foreign corporations (within the meaning of section 957(a)); each corporation has outstanding a single class of stock; USP has owned its interest in TFC since the formation of TFC; each of USP, TFC, and FS have a calendar taxable year; and for purposes of section 1297(a)(2), TFC measures the amount of its assets based on value.
(1)
Example 1
—(i)
Facts.
(A) USP owns 15% of the outstanding stock of TFC. TFC owns 30% of the outstanding stock of FS. FS operates an active trade or business and 100% of its assets are used in the active trade or business. The value of FS's non-passive assets (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(3)) is $900x; the value of FS's passive assets (which include cash and cash equivalents) is $100x. TFC has not been treated as a PFIC for any taxable year before Year 1 and has no predecessor. In addition to holding the FS stock, TFC directly conducts its own active trade or business. The value of TFC's non-passive assets (other than FS stock) is $50x; the value of TFC's passive assets (other than FS stock and assets received during Year 1) is $30x. TFC earns $1x of non-passive income (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(4)) from its directly conducted active trade or business.
(B) On January 1, Year 1, TFC sells all of its FS stock for $300x. The residual gain computed under § 1.1297-2(f)(2) on the sale of the FS stock is $10x.Under § 1.1297-2(f)(3), $9x of residual gain is characterized as non-passive income and $1x of residual gain is characterized as passive income. TFC earned $5x of passive income from the investment of the proceeds from the disposition of the FS stock during each quarter of Year 1, and TFC maintained those earnings ($20x in total) as well as the disposition proceeds in cash for the remainder of the year. TFC reinvests the proceeds of the FS stock sale in an active trade or business during Year 2, and, thus, TFC is not a PFIC in Year 2 and Year 3. Less than 75% of TFC's gross income in Year 1 is passive income (($20x + $1x)/($10x + $20x + $1x) = 68%). However, subject to the application of section 1298(b)(3) and this section, TFC would be a PFIC in Year 1 under section 1297(a)(2) because the proceeds from the sale of the FS stock ($300x) together with TFC's other passive assets exceed 50% of TFC's total assets on each quarterly measuring date. For example, on the first quarterly measuring date TFC's ratio of passive assets to total assets is (($300x
+ $30x + $5x)/($300x + $30x + $5x + $50x)) and on the fourth quarterly measuring date TFC's ratio of passive assets to total assets is (($300x + $30x + $20x)/($300x + $30x + $20x + $50x)), each of which exceeds 87%. Therefore, TFC chooses to apply the change of business exception in paragraph (b) of this section to Year 1.
(ii)
Results.
(A) Under paragraph (d) of this section, for purposes of applying section 1298(b)(3)(B)(i) in Year 1, TFC's proceeds from the disposition of the stock of FS that are attributable to assets used by FS in an active trade or business are considered as from the disposition of an active trade or business. Because 100% of FS's assets are used in its active trade or business, all of TFC's proceeds are considered as from the disposition of an active trade or business. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the passive income considered attributable to proceeds from a disposition of one or more active trades or businesses is $20x (from investment of disposition proceeds). Because TFC reasonably does not expect to be a PFIC in Year 2 and Year 3, and TFC is not, in fact, a PFIC for those years, TFC will not be treated as a PFIC in Year 1 by reason of section 1298(b)(3) and paragraph (b) of this section, based on the satisfaction of the condition in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, because the 95% ($20x/($20x + $1x)) of TFC's passive income for Year 1 that is attributable to proceeds of the disposition of FS's active trade or business constitutes substantially all of its passive income.
(B) TFC would also not be treated as a PFIC in Year 1 by reason of section 1298(b)(3) and paragraph (b) of this section, based on the satisfaction of the condition in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, because the over 91% of TFC's passive assets on the quarterly measuring dates during Year 1 following the disposition of the stock of FS that is attributable to proceeds of the disposition of FS's active trade or business constitutes substantially all of its passive assets. For example, on the first quarterly measuring date TFC's ratio of passive assets attributable to the proceeds of the disposition of FS's active trade or business to its total passive assets is 91% ($305x/($305x + $30x)), and the same ratio for the fourth quarterly measuring date is 91.4% ($320x/($320x + $30x)).
(C) Under paragraph (e) of this section, TFC cannot claim the section 1298(b)(3) exception in relation to the income attributable to the proceeds of the FS stock sale in Year 2 because TFC already claimed the exception for Year 1.
(2)
Example 2
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that during the first quarter of Year 1, TFC earned only $4x of passive income ($1x per quarter) from the investment of the proceeds from the disposition of the FS stock and earned $12x of passive income ($3x per quarter) from its other passive assets and maintained such earnings in cash for the remainder of the year.
(ii)
Results.
The results are the same as in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section (the results in
Example 1
), except that under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the passive income considered attributable to proceeds from a disposition of one or more active trades or businesses is $4x (from investment of disposition proceeds). Because 24% ($4x/($4x + $12x + $1x)) of TFC's passive income for Year 1 is attributable to proceeds of the disposition of FS's active trade or business, and 24% does not constitute substantially all of TFC's passive income for Year 1, TFC does not qualify for the exception from treatment as a PFIC in section 1298(b)(3) and paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for Year 1. However, under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (d) of this section, more than $300x ($300x disposition proceeds + amounts earned from investment of disposition proceeds) of TFC's passive assets held on each quarterly measuring date after the disposition is considered attributable to the disposition of an active trade or business. Because TFC reasonably does not expect to be a PFIC in Year 2 and Year 3, and TFC is not, in fact, a PFIC for those years, TFC will not be treated as a PFIC in Year 1 by reason of paragraph (b) of this section, based on the satisfaction of the condition in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, assuming that the average 89% of TFC's passive assets on the quarterly
measuring dates during Year 1 following the disposition of the stock of FS that is attributable to proceeds of the disposition of FS's active trade or business constitutes substantially all of its passive assets.
(g)
Applicability date.
The rules of this section apply to taxable years of shareholders beginning on or after January 14, 2021. A shareholder may choose to apply such rules for any open taxable year beginning before January 14, 2021, provided that, with respect to the tested foreign corporation, the shareholder consistently applies the provisions of this section and § 1.1291-1(b)(8)(iv) and (b)(8)(v)(A), (B), (C), and (D) and §§ 1.1297-1 (except that consistent treatment is not required with respect to § 1.1297-1(c)(1)(i)(A)), 1.1297-2, and 1.1298-4 for such year and all subsequent years.
[T.D. 9936, 86 FR 4576, Jan. 15, 2021, as at 86 FR 13648, Mar. 10, 2021]
§ 1.1298-3
Deemed sale or deemed dividend election by a U.S. person that is a shareholder of a former PFIC.
(a)
In general.
A shareholder (as defined in § 1.1291-9(j)(3)) of a foreign corporation that is a former PFIC, (as defined in § 1.1291-9(j)(2)(iv)) with respect to such shareholder, shall be treated for tax purposes as holding stock in a PFIC and therefore continues to be subject to taxation under section 1291 unless the shareholder makes a purging election under section 1298(b)(1). A purging election under section 1298(b)(1) is made under rules similar to the rules of section 1291(d)(2). Section 1291(d)(2) allows a shareholder to purge the continuing PFIC taint by making either a deemed sale election or a deemed dividend election.
(b)
Application of deemed sale election rules
—(1)
Eligibility to make the deemed sale election.
A shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a former PFIC with respect to such shareholder may make a deemed sale election under section 1298(b)(1) by applying the rules of this paragraph (b).
(2)
Effect of deemed sale election.
A shareholder making the deemed sale election with respect to a former PFIC shall be treated as having sold all its stock in the former PFIC for its fair market value on the termination date, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. A deemed sale is treated as a disposition subject to taxation under section 1291. Thus, gain from the deemed sale is taxed under section 1291 as an excess distribution received on the termination date. In the case of an election made by an indirect shareholder, the amount of gain to be recognized and taxed as an excess distribution is the amount of gain that the direct owner of the stock of the PFIC would have realized on an actual sale or disposition of the stock of the PFIC indirectly owned by the shareholder. Any loss realized on the deemed sale is not recognized. After the deemed sale election, the shareholder's stock with respect to which the election was made under this paragraph (b) shall not be treated as stock in a PFIC and the shareholder shall not be subject to taxation under section 1291 with respect to such stock unless the foreign corporation thereafter qualifies as a PFIC under section 1297(a).
(3)
Time for making the deemed sale election.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the shareholder shall make the deemed sale election under this paragraph (b) and section 1298(b)(1) in the shareholder's original or amended return for the taxable year that includes the termination date (election year). If the deemed sale election is made in an amended return, the return must be filed by a date that is within three years of the due date, as extended under section 6081, of the original return for the election year.
(4)
Manner of making the deemed sale election.
A shareholder makes the deemed sale election under this paragraph (b) by filing Form 8621 (“Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund”) with the return of the shareholder for the election year, reporting the gain as an excess distribution pursuant to section 1291(a) as if such deemed sale occurred under section 1291(d)(2), and paying the tax and interest due on the excess distribution. A shareholder that makes the deemed sale election after the due date of the return (determined without regard to extensions) for the election year must pay additional interest, pursuant to
section 6601, on the amount of underpayment of tax for that year. An electing shareholder that realizes a loss shall report the loss on Form 8621, but shall not recognize the loss.
(5)
Adjustments to basis.
A shareholder that makes the deemed sale election increases its adjusted basis of the PFIC stock owned directly by the amount of gain recognized on the deemed sale. If the shareholder makes the deemed sale election with respect to a PFIC of which it is an indirect shareholder, the shareholder's adjusted basis of the stock or other property owned directly by the shareholder, through which ownership of the PFIC is attributed to the shareholder, is increased by the amount of gain recognized by the shareholder. In addition, solely for purposes of determining the subsequent treatment under the Code and regulations of a shareholder of the stock of the PFIC, the adjusted basis of the direct owner of the stock of the PFIC is increased by the amount of gain recognized on the deemed sale. A shareholder shall not adjust the basis of any stock with respect to which the shareholder realized a loss on the deemed sale, but which loss is not recognized under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(6)
Treatment of holding period.
If a shareholder of a foreign corporation has made a deemed sale election, then, for purposes of applying sections 1291 through 1298 to such shareholder after the deemed sale, the shareholder's holding period in the stock of the foreign corporation begins on the day following the termination, without regard to whether the shareholder recognized gain on the deemed sale. For other purposes of the Code and regulations, this holding period rule does not apply.
(c)
Application of deemed dividend election rules
—(1)
Eligibility to make the deemed dividend election.
A shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a former PFIC with respect to such shareholder may make the deemed dividend election under the rules of this paragraph (c) provided the foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957(a) (CFC)) during its last taxable year as a PFIC. A shareholder may make the deemed dividend election without regard to whether the shareholder is a United States shareholder within the meaning of section 951(b). A deemed dividend election may be made by a shareholder whose pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC attributable to the PFIC stock held on the termination date is zero.
(2)
Effect of the deemed dividend election.
A shareholder making the deemed dividend election with respect to a former PFIC shall include in income as a dividend its pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC attributable to all of the stock it held, directly or indirectly on the termination date, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The deemed dividend is taxed under section 1291 as an excess distribution received on the termination date. The excess distribution determined under this paragraph (c) is allocated under section 1291(a)(1)(A) only to each day of the shareholder's holding period of the stock during which the foreign corporation qualified as a PFIC. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the shareholder's holding period of the PFIC stock ends on the termination date. After the deemed dividend election, the shareholder's stock with respect to which the election was made under this paragraph (c) shall not be treated as stock in a PFIC and the shareholder shall not be subject to taxation under section 1291 with respect to such stock unless the foreign corporation thereafter qualifies as a PFIC under section 1297(a).
(3)
Post-1986 earnings and profits defined—
(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term
post-1986 earnings and profits
means the post-1986 undistributed earnings, within the meaning of section 902(c)(1) (determined without regard to section 902(c)(3)), as of the close of the taxable year that includes the termination date. For purposes of this computation, only earnings and profits accumulated in taxable years during which the foreign corporation was a PFIC shall be taken into account, without regard to whether the earnings relate to a period during which the PFIC was a CFC.
(ii)
Pro rata share of post-1986 earnings and profits attributable to shareholder's stock:
(A)
In general.
A shareholder's pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings
and profits of the PFIC attributable to the stock held by the shareholder on the termination date is the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC accumulated during any portion of the shareholder's holding period ending at the close of the termination date and attributable, under the principles of section 1248 and the regulations under that section, to the PFIC stock held on the termination date.
(B)
Reduction for previously taxed amounts.
A shareholder's pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC does not include any amount that the shareholder demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner (in the manner provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section) was, pursuant to another provision of the law, previously included in the income of the shareholder, or of another U.S. person if the shareholder's holding period of the PFIC stock includes the period during which the stock was held by that other U.S. person.
(4)
Time for making the deemed dividend election.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the shareholder shall make the deemed dividend election under this paragraph (c) and section 1298(b)(1) in the shareholder's original or amended return for the taxable year that includes the termination date (election year). If the deemed dividend election is made in an amended return, the return must be filed by a date that is within three years of the due date, as extended under section 6081, of the original return for the election year.
(5)
Manner of making the deemed dividend election:
(i)
In general.
A shareholder makes the deemed dividend election by filing Form 8621 and the attachment to Form 8621 described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section with the return of the shareholder for the election year, reporting the deemed dividend as an excess distribution pursuant to section 1291(a)(1), and paying the tax and interest due on the excess distribution. A shareholder that makes the deemed dividend election after the due date of the return (determined without regard to extensions) for the election year must pay additional interest, pursuant to section 6601, on the amount of underpayment of tax for that year.
(ii)
Attachment to Form 8621.
The shareholder must attach a schedule to Form 8621 that demonstrates the calculation of the shareholder's pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits of the PFIC that is treated as distributed to the shareholder on the termination date pursuant to this paragraph (c). If the shareholder is claiming an exclusion from its pro rata share of the post-1986 earnings and profits for an amount previously included in its income or the income of another U.S. person, the shareholder must include the following information:
(A) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each U.S. person that previously included an amount in income, the amount previously included in income by each such U.S. person, the provision of law pursuant to which the amount was previously included in income, and the taxable year or years of inclusion of each amount.
(B) A description of the transaction pursuant to which the shareholder acquired, directly or indirectly, the stock of the PFIC from another U.S. person, and the provision of law pursuant to which the shareholder's holding period includes the period the other U.S. person held the CFC stock.
(6)
Adjustments to basis.
A shareholder that makes the deemed dividend election increases its adjusted basis of the stock of the PFIC owned directly by the shareholder by the amount of the deemed dividend. If the shareholder makes the deemed dividend election with respect to a PFIC of which it is an indirect shareholder, the shareholder's adjusted basis of the stock or other property owned directly by the shareholder, through which ownership of the PFIC is attributed to the shareholder, is increased by the amount of the deemed dividend. In addition, solely for purposes of determining the subsequent treatment under the Code and regulations of a shareholder of the stock of the PFIC, the adjusted basis of the direct owner of the stock of the PFIC is increased by the amount of the deemed dividend.
(7)
Treatment of holding period.
If the shareholder of a foreign corporation has made a deemed dividend election, then, for purposes of applying sections 1291 through 1298 to such shareholder after the deemed dividend, the shareholder's holding period of the stock of the foreign corporation begins on the day following the termination date. For other purposes of the Code and regulations, this holding period rule does not apply.
(8)
Coordination with section 959(e).
For purposes of section 959(e), the entire deemed dividend is treated as having been included in gross income under section 1248(a).
(d)
Termination date.
For purposes of this section, the termination date is the last day of the last taxable year of the foreign corporation during which it qualified as a PFIC under section 1297(a).
(e)
Late purging elections requiring special consent
—(1)
In general.
This section prescribes the exclusive rules under which a shareholder of a former PFIC may make a section 1298(b)(1) election after the time prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) or (c)(4) of this section for making a deemed sale or a deemed dividend election has elapsed (late purging election). Therefore, a shareholder may not seek such relief under any other provisions of the law, including § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. A shareholder may request the consent of the Commissioner to make a late purging election for the taxable year of the shareholder that includes the termination date provided the shareholder satisfies the requirements set forth in this paragraph (e). The Commissioner may, in his discretion, grant relief under this paragraph (e) only if—
(i) In a case where the shareholder is requesting consent under this paragraph (e) after December 31, 2005, the shareholder requests such consent before a representative of the Internal Revenue Service raises upon audit the PFIC status of the foreign corporation for any taxable year of the shareholder;
(ii) The shareholder has agreed in a closing agreement with the Commissioner, described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to eliminate any prejudice to the interests of the U.S. government, as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, as a consequence of the shareholder's inability to file amended returns for its taxable year in which the termination date falls or an earlier closed taxable year in which the shareholder has taken a position that is inconsistent with the treatment of the foreign corporation as a PFIC; and
(iii) The shareholder satisfies the procedural requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(2)
Prejudice to the interests of the U.S. government.
The interests of the U.S. government are prejudiced if granting relief would result in the shareholder having a lower tax liability (other than by a
de minimis
amount), taking into account applicable interest charges, for the taxable year that includes the termination date (or a prior taxable year in which the taxpayer took a position on a return that was inconsistent with the treatment of the foreign corporation as a PFIC) than the shareholder would have had if the shareholder had properly made the section 1298(b)(1) election in the time prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(3) of this section (or had not taken a position in a return for an earlier year that was inconsistent with the status of the foreign corporation as a PFIC). The time value of money is taken into account for purposes of this computation.
(3)
Procedural requirements
—(i)
In general.
The amount due with respect to a late purging election is determined in the same manner as if the purging election had been timely filed. However, the shareholder is also liable for interest on the amount due, pursuant to section 6601, determined for the period beginning on the due date (without extensions) for the taxpayer's income tax return for the year in which the termination date falls and ending on the date the late purging election is filed with the IRS.
(ii)
Filing instructions.
A late purging election is made by filing a completed Form 8621-A, “Return by a Shareholder Making Certain Late Elections to End Treatment as a Passive Foreign Investment Company.”
(4)
Time and manner of making late election
—(i)
Time for making a late purging election.
A shareholder may make a late purging election in the manner provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this
section at any time. The date the election is filed with the IRS will determine the amount of interest due under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Manner of making a late purging election.
A shareholder makes a late purging election by completing Form 8621-A in the manner required by that form and this section and filing that form with the Internal Revenue Service, DP 8621-A, Ogden, UT 84201.
(5)
Multiple late elections.
For rules regarding the circumstances under which a shareholder of a foreign corporation may make multiple late purging elections under this paragraph (e) or § 1.1297-3(e), see § 1.1297-3(e)(5).
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
The rules of this section are applicable as of December 8, 2005.
[T.D. 9231, 70 FR 72915, Dec. 8, 2005, as amended by T.D. 9360, 72 FR 54824, Sept. 27, 2007]
§ 1.1298-4
Rules for certain foreign corporations owning stock in 25-percent-owned domestic corporations.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules under section 1298(b)(7) that apply to certain foreign corporations that own stock in 25-percent-owned domestic corporations (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is a passive foreign investment company (PFIC). Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rule. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules concerning ownership of 25-percent-owned domestic corporations or qualified stock (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) through partnerships. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for determining whether a foreign corporation is subject to the tax imposed by section 531 (the section 531 tax) and for waiving treaty benefits that would prevent the imposition of such tax. Paragraph (e) of this section provides an anti-abuse rule for the application of section 1298(b)(7). Paragraph (f) provides the applicability date for this section.
(b)
Treatment of certain foreign corporations owning stock in a 25-percent-owned domestic corporation
—(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, when a tested foreign corporation (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)) is subject to the section 531 tax (or waives any benefit under any treaty that would otherwise prevent the imposition of the tax), and owns (directly or indirectly under the rules in paragraph (c) of this section) at least 25 percent (by value) of the stock of a domestic corporation (a
25-percent-owned domestic corporation
), for purposes of determining whether the foreign corporation is a PFIC, any qualified stock held directly or indirectly under the rules in paragraph (c) of this section by the 25-percent-owned domestic corporation is treated as an asset that does not produce passive income (and is not held for the production of passive income), and any amount included in gross income with respect to the qualified stock is not treated as passive income.
(2)
Qualified stock and second-tier domestic corporation.
For purposes of this section, the term
qualified stock
means any stock in a C corporation that is a domestic corporation and that is not a regulated investment company or real estate investment trust and the term
second-tier corporation
means the corporation.
(c)
Indirect ownership of stock through a partnership.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a tested foreign corporation that is a partner in a partnership is considered to own its proportionate share of any stock of a domestic corporation held by the partnership, and a domestic corporation that is a partner in a partnership is considered to own its proportionate share of any qualified stock held by the partnership. An upper-tier partnership's attributable share of the stock of a domestic corporation or of qualified stock held by a lower-tier partnership is treated as held by the upper-tier partnership for purposes of applying the rule in this paragraph (c).
(d)
Section 531 tax
—(1)
Subject to section 531 tax.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a tested foreign corporation is considered subject to the section 531 tax regardless of whether the tax is imposed on the corporation and of whether the requirements of § 1.532-1(c) are met.
(2)
Waiver of treaty benefits
—(i)
Tested foreign corporation that files, or is required to file, a Federal income tax return.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a tested foreign corporation that files, or is required to file, a Federal income tax return waives the benefit under a treaty that would otherwise prevent the imposition of the section 531 tax by attaching to its original or amended return for the taxable year for which section 1298(b)(7) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section are applied or any prior taxable year a statement that it irrevocably waives treaty protection against the imposition of the section 531 tax, effective for all prior, current, and future taxable years, provided the taxable year for which the return is filed and all subsequent taxable years are not closed by the period of limitations on assessments under section 6501.
(ii)
Tested foreign corporation that is not required to file a Federal income tax return.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a tested foreign corporation that is not required to file a Federal income tax return waives the benefit under a treaty that would otherwise prevent the imposition of the section 531 tax by a date no later than nine months following the close of the taxable year for which section 1298(b)(7) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section are applied by—
(A) Adopting a resolution or similar governance document that confirms that it has irrevocably waived any treaty protection against the imposition of the section 531 tax, effective for all prior, current, and future taxable years, and maintaining a copy of the resolution (or other governance document) in its records; or
(B) In the case of a tested foreign corporation described in section 1297(e)(3), including in its public filings a statement that it irrevocably waives treaty protection against the imposition of the section 531 tax, effective for all prior, current, and future taxable years.
(e)
Anti-abuse rule
—(1)
General rule.
Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply with respect to qualified stock in a second-tier domestic corporation owned by a 25-percent-owned domestic corporation if a principal purpose for the formation of, acquisition of, or holding of stock of the 25-percent-owned domestic corporation or the second-tier domestic corporation, or for the capitalization or other funding of the second-tier domestic corporation, is to hold passive assets (as defined in § 1.1297-1(f)(5)) through the second-tier domestic corporation to avoid classification of the tested foreign corporation as a PFIC.
(2) [Reserved]
(3) [Reserved]
(f)
Applicability date.
The rules of this section apply to taxable years of shareholders beginning on or after January 14, 2021. A shareholder may choose to apply such rules for any open taxable year beginning before January 14, 2021, provided that, with respect to a tested foreign corporation, the shareholder consistently applies the provisions of this section and § 1.1291-1(b)(8)(iv) and (b)(8)(v)(A), (B), (C), and (D) and §§ 1.1297-1
(
except that consistent treatment is not required with respect to § 1.1297-1(c)(1)(i)(A)), 1.1297-2, and 1.1298-2 for such year and all subsequent years.

# Income Averaging
§ 1.1301-1
Averaging of farm and fishing income.
(a)
Overview.
An individual engaged in a farming or fishing business may make a farm income averaging election to compute current year (election year) income tax liability under section 1 by averaging, over the prior three-year period (base years), all or a portion of the individual's current year electible farm income as defined in paragraph (e) of this section. Electible farm income includes income from both farming and fishing businesses. An individual who makes a farm income averaging election—
(1) Designates all or a portion of the individual's electible farm income for the election year as elected farm income; and
(2) Determines the election year section 1 tax by calculating the sum of—
(i) The section 1 tax that would be imposed for the election year if taxable
income for the year were reduced by elected farm income; plus
(ii) The amount by which the section 1 tax would be increased if taxable income for each base year were increased by one-third of elected farm income.
(b)
Individual engaged in a farming or fishing business
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Farming or fishing business.
“Farming business” has the same meaning as provided in section 263A(e)(4) and the regulations under that section.
Fishing business
means the conduct of commercial fishing as defined in section 3 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802(4)). Accordingly, a fishing business is fishing in which the fish harvested are intended to or do enter commerce through sale, barter, or trade.
Fishing
means the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish; the attempted catching, taking, or harvesting of fish; any activities that reasonably can be expected to result in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish; or any operations at sea in support of or in preparation for the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish. Fishing does not include any scientific research activity conducted by a scientific research vessel.
Fish
means finfish, mollusks, crustaceans, and all other forms of marine animal and plant life, other than marine mammals and birds.
Catching, taking, or harvesting
includes activities that result in the killing of fish or the bringing of live fish on board a vessel.
(ii)
Exxon Valdez settlement payments.
For purposes of this section, a qualified taxpayer who receives qualified settlement income in any taxable year is treated as engaged in a fishing business, and the income is treated as income attributable to a fishing business, for that taxable year. A
qualified taxpayer
is an individual plaintiff in the civil action
In re Exxon Valdez,
No. 89-095-CV (HRH) (Consolidated) (D. Alaska).
Qualified taxpayer
also means any individual who is a beneficiary of the estate of such a plaintiff, was the spouse or immediate relative of that plaintiff, and acquired the right to receive the settlement income from that plaintiff.
Qualified settlement income
means any interest and punitive damage awards that are received in connection with the civil action
In re Exxon Valdez
(whether as lump-sum or periodic payments, whether pre- or post-judgment, and whether related to a settlement or to a judgment) and that are otherwise includible in income.
(iii)
Form of business.
An individual engaged in a farming or fishing business includes a sole proprietor of a farming or fishing business, a partner in a partnership engaged in a farming or fishing business, and a shareholder of an S corporation engaged in a farming or fishing business. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, services performed as an employee are disregarded in determining whether an individual is engaged in a farming or fishing business for purposes of section 1301 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(iv)
Base years.
An individual is not required to have been engaged in a farming or fishing business in any of the base years in order to make a farm income averaging election.
(2)
Certain landlords.
A landlord is engaged in a farming business for purposes of section 1301 with respect to rental income that is based on a share of production from a tenant's farming business and, with respect to amounts received on or after January 1, 2003, is determined under a written agreement entered into before the tenant begins significant activities on the land. A landlord is not engaged in a farming business for purposes of section 1301 with respect to either fixed rent or, with respect to amounts received on or after January 1, 2003, rental income based on a share of a tenant's production determined under an unwritten agreement or a written agreement entered into after the tenant begins significant activities on the land. Whether the landlord materially participates in the tenant's farming business is irrelevant for purposes of section 1301.
(3)
Lessors of vessels used in fishing.
A lessor of a vessel is engaged in a fishing business for purposes of section 1301 with respect to payments that are received under the lease and are based on a share of the catch from the lessee's use of the vessel in a fishing business (or a share of the proceeds from the sale of the catch) if this manner of payment is determined under a written
lease agreement entered into before the lessee begins any significant fishing activities resulting in the catch. A lessor of a vessel is not engaged in a fishing business for purposes of section 1301 with respect to fixed lease payments or with respect to lease payments based on a share of the lessee's catch (or a share of the proceeds from the sale of the catch) if the share is determined under either an unwritten agreement or a written agreement entered into after the lessee begins significant fishing activities resulting in the catch.
(c)
Making, changing, or revoking an election
—(1)
In general.
A farm income averaging election is made by filing Schedule J, “Income Averaging for Farmers and Fishermen,” with an individual's Federal income tax return for the election year (including a late or amended return if the period of limitation on filing a claim for credit or refund has not expired).
(2)
Changing or revoking an election.
An individual may change the amount of the elected farm income in a previous election or revoke a previous election if the period of limitations on filing a claim for credit or refund has not expired for the election year.
(d)
Guidelines for calculation of section 1 tax
—(1)
Actual taxable income not affected.
Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a determination of the section 1 tax for the election year involves a computation of the section 1 tax that would be imposed if taxable income for the election year were reduced by elected farm income and taxable income for each of the base years were increased by one-third of elected farm income. The reduction and increases required for purposes of this computation do not affect the actual taxable income for either the election year or the base years. Thus, for each of those years, the actual taxable income is taxable income determined without regard to any hypothetical reduction or increase required for purposes of the computation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The following illustrates this principle:
(i) Any reduction or increase in taxable income required for purposes of the computation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is disregarded in determining the taxable year in which a net operating loss carryover or net capital loss carryover is applied.
(ii) The net section 1231 gain or loss and the character of any section 1231 items for the election year is determined without regard to any reduction in taxable income required for purposes of the computation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(iii) The section 68 overall limitation on itemized deductions for the election year is determined without regard to any reduction in taxable income required for purposes of the computation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Similarly, the section 68 limitation for a base year is not recomputed to take into account any allocation of elected farm income to the base year for such purposes.
(iv) If a base year had a partially used capital loss, the remaining capital loss may not be applied to reduce the elected farm income allocated to the year for purposes of the computation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(v) If a base year had a partially used credit, the remaining credit may not be applied to reduce the section 1 tax attributable to the elected farm income allocated to the year for purposes of the computation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2)
Computation in base years
—(i)
In general.
As provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the election year section 1 tax includes the amounts by which the section 1 tax for each base year would be increased if taxable income for the year were increased by one-third of elected farm income. For this purpose, all allowable deductions (including the full amount of any net operating loss carryover) are taken into account in determining the taxable income for the base year even if the deductions exceed gross income and the result is negative. If the result is negative, however, any amount that may provide a benefit in another taxable year is added back in determining base year taxable income. Amounts that may provide a benefit in another year include—
(A) The net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for the base year;
(B) The net operating loss for any other year to the extent carried forward from the base year under section 172(b)(2); and
(C) The capital loss deduction allowed for the base year under section 1211(b)(1) or (2) to the extent such deduction does not reduce the capital loss carryover from the base year because it exceeds adjusted taxable income (as defined in section 1212(b)(2)(B)).
(ii)
Example.
The rules of this paragraph (d)(2) are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In 2001, F and F's spouse on their joint return elect to average $24,000 of income attributable to a farming business. One-third of the elected farm income, $8,000, is added to the 1999 base year income. In 1999, F and F's spouse reported adjusted gross income of $7,300 and claimed a standard deduction of $7,200 and a deduction for personal exemptions of $8,250. Therefore, their 1999 base year taxable income is −$8,150 [$7,300−($7,200 + $8,250)]. After adding the elected farm income to the negative taxable income, their 1999 base year taxable income would be zero [$8,000 + (−$8,150)=−$150]. If F and F's spouse elected to income average in 2002, and made the adjustments described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section to account for the 2001 election, their 1999 base year taxable income for the 2002 election would be −$150.
(3)
Effect on subsequent elections
—(i)
In general.
The reduction and increases in taxable income assumed in computing the election year section 1 tax (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section) for an election year are treated as having actually occurred for purposes of computing the election year section 1 tax for any subsequent election year. Thus, if a base year for a farm income averaging election is also an election year for another farm income averaging election, the increase in the section 1 tax for that base year is determined after reducing taxable income by the elected farm income from the earlier election year. Similarly, if a base year for a farm income averaging election is also a base year for another farm income averaging election, the increase in the section 1 tax for that base year is determined after increasing taxable income by elected farm income allocated to the year from the earlier election year.
(ii)
Example.
The rules of this paragraph (d)(3) are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) T is a fisherman who uses the calendar taxable year. In each of the years 2007, 2008, and 2009, T's taxable income is $20,000, none of which is electible farm income. In 2010, T has taxable income of $30,000 (prior to any farm income averaging election), $10,000 of which is electible farm income. T makes a farm income averaging election with respect to $9,000 of the electible farm income for 2010. Under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, $3,000 of elected farm income is allocated to each of the base years 2007, 2008, and 2009. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, T's 2010 tax liability is the sum of the following amounts:
(A) The section 1 tax on $21,000, which is T's taxable income of $30,000, minus elected farm income of $9,000.
(B) For each of the base years 2007, 2008, and 2009, the amount by which the section 1 tax would be increased if one-third of elected farm income were allocated to each year. The amount for each year is the section 1 tax on $23,000 (T's taxable income of $20,000, plus $3,000, which is one-third of elected farm income for the 2010 election year), minus the section 1 tax on $20,000.
(ii) In 2011, T has taxable income of $50,000, $12,000 of which is electible farm income. T makes a farm income averaging election with respect to all $12,000 of the electible farm income for 2011. Under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, $4,000 of elected farm income is allocated to each of the base years 2008, 2009, and 2010. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, T's 2011 tax liability is the sum of the following amounts:
(A) The section 1 tax on $38,000, which is T's taxable income of $50,000, minus elected farm income of $12,000.
(B) For each of the base years 2008 and 2009, the amount by which section 1 tax would be increased if, after adjustments for previous farm income averaging elections pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, one-third of 2011 elected farm income were allocated to each year. The amount for each year is the section 1 tax on $27,000 (T's taxable income of $20,000 increased by $3,000 for T's 2010 farm income averaging election and further increased by $4,000, which is one-third of elected farm income for the 2011 election year), minus the section 1 tax on $23,000 (T's taxable income of $20,000 increased by $3,000 for T's 2010 farm income averaging election).
(C) For base year 2010, the amount by which section 1 tax would be increased if, after adjustments for previous farm income averaging elections pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, one-third of elected farm income were allocated to that year. This amount is the section 1 tax on $25,000 (T's 2010 taxable income of $30,000 reduced by
$9,000 for T's 2010 farm income averaging election and increased by $4,000, which is one-third of elected farm income for the 2011 election year), minus the section 1 tax on $21,000 (T's taxable income of $30,000 reduced by $9,000 for T's 2010 farm income averaging election).
(4)
Deposits into Merchant Marine Capital Construction Fund
—(i)
Reductions to taxable income and electible farm income.
Under section 7518(c)(1)(A), certain deposits to a Merchant Marine Capital Construction Fund (CCF) reduce taxable income for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (the CCF reduction). The amount of the CCF reduction is limited under section 7518(a)(1)(A) to the taxpayer's taxable income (determined without regard to the reduction) attributable to specified maritime operations including operations in fisheries of the United States. The CCF reduction is taken into account in determining the taxable income used in computations under this section. In addition, except to the extent the amount described in section 7518(a)(1)(A) is not attributable to the individual's fishing business, the CCF reduction is treated in computing electible farm income as an item of deduction attributable to the individual's fishing business.
(ii)
Example.
The rules of this paragraph (d)(4) are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) T is a fisherman who uses the calendar taxable year. In each of the years 2007, 2008, and 2009, T's taxable income (before taking any CCF reduction into account) is $20,000. For taxable year 2008, all of T's income is described in section 7518(a)(1)(A) and is attributable to T's fishing business. T makes a $5,000 deposit into a CCF for taxable year 2008. In 2010, T has total taxable income of $30,000 (before taking any CCF reduction into account). T's electible farm income for 2010 (before taking the CCF reduction into account) is $10,000, all of which is described in section 7518(a)(1)(A) and is attributable to T's fishing business. For taxable year 2010, T makes a $4,000 deposit into a CCF.
(ii) The amount of the 2010 CCF deposit reduces taxable income. Accordingly, T's taxable income for 2010 is $26,000 ($30,000-$4,000). In addition, the entire amount of the CCF reduction is treated as an item of deduction attributable to T's fishing business. Accordingly, T's electible farm income for 2010 is $6,000 ($10,000-$4,000). Similarly, the amount of the 2008 CCF deposit reduces T's taxable income for 2008. Accordingly, T's taxable income for 2008 is $15,000 ($20,000-$5,000).
(iii) T makes an income averaging election with respect to all $6,000 of the electible farm income for 2010. Under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, $2,000 of elected farm income is allocated to each of the base years 2007, 2008, and 2009. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, T's 2010 tax liability is the sum of the following amounts:
(A) The section 1 tax on $20,000, which is T's taxable income of $26,000 ($30,000 reduced by the $4,000 CCF deposit), minus elected farm income of $6,000.
(B) For each of the base years 2007, 2008, and 2009, the amount by which section 1 tax would be increased if one-third of elected farm income were allocated to each year. The amount for base years 2007 and 2009 is the section 1 tax on $22,000, (T's taxable income of $20,000, plus $2,000, which is one-third of elected farm income for the election year), minus the section 1 tax on $20,000. The amount for base year 2008 is the section 1 tax on $17,000, which is T's taxable income of $15,000 ($20,000 reduced by the $5,000 CCF deposit), plus $2,000 (one-third of elected farm income for the election year), minus the section 1 tax on $15,000.
(e)
Electible farm income
—(1)
Identification of items attributable to a farming or fishing business
—(i)
In general.
Farm and fishing income includes items of income, deduction, gain, and loss attributable to an individual's farming or fishing business. Farm and fishing losses include, to the extent attributable to a farming or fishing business, any net operating loss carryover or carryback or net capital loss carryover to an election year. Income, gain, or loss from the sale of development rights, grazing rights, and other similar rights is not treated as attributable to a farming business. In general, farm and fishing income does not include compensation received as an employee. However, a shareholder of an S corporation engaged in a farming or fishing business may treat compensation received from the corporation as farm or fishing income if the compensation is paid by the corporation in the conduct of the farming or fishing business. If a crewmember on a vessel engaged in commercial fishing (within the meaning of section 3 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1802(4)) is compensated by a share of the boat's catch of fish or a share of the proceeds from the sale of the catch, the crewmember is treated for purposes of section 1301 as engaged in a fishing business and
the compensation is treated for such purposes as income from a fishing business.
(ii)
Gain or loss on sale or other disposition of property
—(A)
In general.
Gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property that was regularly used in the individual's farming or fishing business for a substantial period of time is treated as attributable to a farming or fishing business. For this purpose, the term
property
does not include land, but does include structures affixed to land. Property that has always been used solely in the farming or fishing business by the individual is deemed to meet both the regularly used and substantial period tests. Whether property not used solely in the farming or fishing business was regularly used in the farming or fishing business for a substantial period of time depends on all of the facts and circumstances.
(B)
Cessation of a farming or fishing business.
If gain or loss described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section is realized after cessation of a farming or fishing business, the gain or loss is treated as attributable to a farming or fishing business only if the property is sold within a reasonable time after cessation of the farming or fishing business. A sale or other disposition within one year of cessation of the farming or fishing business is presumed to be within a reasonable time. Whether a sale or other disposition that occurs more than one year after cessation of the farming or fishing business is within a reasonable time depends on all of the facts and circumstances.
(2)
Determination of amount that may be elected farm income
—(i)
Electible farm income.
(A) The maximum amount of income that an individual may elect to average (electible farm income) is the sum of any farm and fishing income and gains, minus any farm and fishing deductions or losses (including loss carryovers and carrybacks) that are allowed as a deduction in computing the individual's taxable income.
(B) Individuals conducting both a farming business and a fishing business must calculate electible farm income by combining income, gains, deductions, and losses derived from the farming business and the fishing business.
(C) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the amount of any CCF reduction is treated as a deduction from income attributable to a fishing business in calculating electible farm income.
(D) Electible farm income may not exceed taxable income, and electible farm income from net capital gain attributable to a farming or fishing business may not exceed total net capital gain. Subject to these limitations, an individual who has both ordinary income and net capital gain from a farming or fishing business may elect to average any combination of the ordinary income and net capital gain.
(ii)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (e)(2) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A has ordinary income from a farming business of $200,000 and deductible expenses from a farming business of $50,000. A's taxable income is $150,000 ($200,000-$50,000). Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, A's electible farm income is $150,000, all of which is ordinary income.

# Example 2.
B has capital gain of $20,000 that is not from a farming or fishing business, capital loss from a farming business of $30,000, and ordinary income from a farming business of $100,000. Under section 1211(b), B's allowable capital loss is limited to $23,000. B's taxable income is $97,000 (($20,000-$23,000) + $100,000). B has a capital loss carryover from a farming business of $7,000 ($30,000 total loss − $23,000 allowable loss). Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, B's electible farm income is $77,000 ($100,000 ordinary income from a farming business, minus $23,000 capital loss from a farming business), all of which is ordinary income.

# Example 3.
C has ordinary income from a fishing business of $200,000 and ordinary loss from a farming business of $60,000. C's taxable income is $140,000 ($200,000 − $60,000). Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, C must deduct the farm loss from the fishing income in determining C's electible farm income. Therefore, C's electible farm income is $140,000 ($200,000-$60,000), all of which is ordinary income.

# Example 4.
D has ordinary income from a farming business of $200,000 and ordinary loss of $50,000 that is not from a farming or fishing business. D's taxable income is $150,000 ($200,000 − $50,000). Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(D) of this section, electible farm income may not exceed taxable income. Therefore, D's electible farm income is $150,000, all of which is ordinary income.

# Example 5.
E has capital gain from a farming business of $50,000, capital loss of $40,000
that is not from a farming or fishing business, and ordinary income from a farming business of $60,000. E's taxable income is $70,000 (($50,000 − $40,000) + $60,000). Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(D) of this section, electible farm income may not exceed taxable income, and electible farm income from net capital gain attributable to a farming or fishing business may not exceed total net capital gain. Therefore, E's electible farm income is $70,000 of which $10,000 is capital gain and $60,000 is ordinary income.
(f)
Miscellaneous rules
—(1)
Short taxable year
—(i)
In general.
If a base year or an election year is a short taxable year, the rules of section 443 and the regulations thereunder apply for purposes of calculating the section 1 tax.
(ii)
Base year is a short taxable year.
If a base year is a short taxable year, elected farm income is allocated to such year for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section after the taxable income for such year has been annualized.
(iii)
Election year is a short taxable year.
In applying paragraph (a)(2) of this section for purposes of determining tax computed on the annual basis (within the meaning of section 443(b)(1)) for an election year that is a short taxable year—
(A) The taxable income and the electible farm income for the year are annualized; and
(B) The taxpayer may designate all or any part of the annualized electible farm income as elected farm income.
(2)
Changes in filing status.
An individual is not prohibited from making a farm income averaging election solely because the individual's filing status is not the same in an election year and the base years. For example, an individual who is married and files a joint return in the election year, who filed as single in one or more of the base years, may elect to average farm or fishing income, by using the single filing status to compute the increase in section 1 taxes for the base years in which the individual filed as single.
(3)
Employment tax.
A farm income averaging election has no effect in determining the amount of wages for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), and the Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages (Federal income tax withholding), or the amount of net earnings from self-employment for purposes of the Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA).
(4)
Alternative minimum tax.
A farm income averaging election is disregarded in computing the tentative minimum tax and the regular tax under section 55 for the election year or any base year. The election is taken into account, however, in determining the regular tax liability under section 53(c) for the election year.
(5)
Unearned income of minor child.
In an election year, if a minor child's investment income is taxable under section 1(g) and a parent makes a farm income averaging election, the tax rate used for purposes of applying section 1(g) is the rate determined after application of the election. In a base year, however, the tax on a minor child's investment income is not affected by a farm income averaging election.
(g)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies for taxable years beginning after December 15, 2010. See the provisions of §§ 1.1301-1 and 1.1301-1T as in effect on December 14, 2010 for rules that apply for taxable years beginning on or before December 15, 2010. In addition, a taxpayer may apply paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003.

# Readjustment of Tax Between Years and Special Limitations

# Mitigation of Effect of Limitations and Other Provisions
§ 1.1311(a)-1
Introduction.
(a) Part II (section 1311 and following), subchapter Q, chapter 1 of the Code, provides certain rules for the correction of the effect of an erroneous treatment of an item in a taxable year which is closed by the statute of limitations or otherwise, in cases where, in connection with the ascertainment of the tax for another taxable year, it has been determined that there was an erroneous treatment of such item in the closed year.
(b) In most situations falling within this part the correction of the effect of
the error on a closed year can be made only if either the Commissioner or the taxpayer has taken a position in another taxable year which is inconsistent with the erroneous treatment of the item in the closed year. If a refund or credit would result from the correction of the error in the closed year, then the Commissioner must be the one maintaining the inconsistent position. For example, if the taxpayer erroneously included an item of income on his return for an earlier year which is now closed and the Commissioner successfully requires it to be included in a later year, then the correction of the effect of the erroneous inclusion of that item in the closed year may be made since the Commissioner has maintained a position inconsistent with the treatment of such item in such closed year. On the other hand, if an additional assessment would result from the correction of the error in the closed year, then the taxpayer must be the one maintaining the inconsistent position. For example, if the taxpayer deducted an item in an earlier year which is now closed and he successfully contends that the item should be deducted in a later year, then the correction of the effect of the erroneous deduction of that item in the closed year may be made since the taxpayer has taken a position inconsistent with the treatment of such item in such earlier year.
(c) There are two special circumstances which fall within this part but which do not require that an inconsistent position be maintained. One of these circumstances relates to the inclusion of an item of income in the correct year and the other relates to the allowance of a deduction in the correct year. In the first situation, if the Commissioner takes the position by a deficiency notice or before the Tax Court that an item of income should be included in the gross income of a taxpayer for a particular year and it is ultimately determined that such item was not so includible, then such item can be included in the income of the proper year if that year was not closed at the time the Commissioner took his position. In the second situation, if the taxpayer claims that a deduction should be allowed for a particular year and it is ultimately determined that the deduction was not allowable in that year, then the taxpayer may take the deduction in the proper year if that year was not closed at the time the taxpayer first claimed a deduction.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12031, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1311(a)-2
Purpose and scope of section 1311.
(a) Section 1311 provides for the correction of the effect of certain errors under circumstances specified in section 1312 when one or more provisions of law, such as the statute of limitations, would otherwise prevent such correction. Section 1311 may be applied to correct the effect of certain errors if, on the date of a determination (as defined in section 1313(a) and the regulations thereunder), correction is prevented by the operation of any provision of law other than sections 1311 through 1315 and section 7122 (relating to compromises) and the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws. Examples of provisions preventing such corrections are sections 6501, 6511, 6532, and 6901 (c), (d) and (e), relating to periods of limitations; section 6212(c) and 6512 relating to the effect of petition to the Tax Court of the United States on further deficiency letters and on credits or refunds; section 7121 relating to closing agreements; and sections 6401 and 6514 relating to payments, refunds, or credits after the period of limitations has expired. Section 1311 may also be applied to correct the effect of an error if, on the date of the determination, correction of the error is prevented by the operation of any rule of law, such as
res judicata
or
estoppel.
(b) The determination (including a determination under section 1313 (a)(4)) may be with respect to any of the taxes imposed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, by chapter 1 and subchapters A, B, D, and E of chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or by the corresponding provisions of any prior revenue act, or by more than one of such provisions. Section 1311 may be applied to correct the effect of the error only as to the tax or taxes with respect to which the error was made which correspond to the tax or taxes with respect to which the determination relates. Thus, if the determination
relates to a tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the adjustment may be only with respect to the tax imposed by such chapter or by the corresponding provisions of prior law.
(c) Section 1311 is not applicable if, on the date of the determination, correction of the effect of the error is permissible without recourse to said section.
(d) If the tax liability for the year with respect to which the error was made has been compromised under section 7122 or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, no adjustment may be made under section 1311 with respect to said year.
(e) No adjustment may be made under section 1311 for any taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1932. See section 1314(d).
(f) Section 1311 applies only to a determination (as defined in section 1313(a) and §§ 1.1313(a)-1 to 1.1313 (a)-4, inclusive) made after November 14, 1954. Section 3801 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and the regulations thereunder apply to determinations, as defined therein, made on or before November 14, 1954. See section 1315.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12031, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1311(b)-1
Maintenance of an inconsistent position.
(a)
In general.
Under the circumstances stated in § 1.1312-1, § 1.1312-2, paragraph (a) of § 1.1312-3, § 1.1312-5, § 1.1312-6, and § 1.1312-7, the maintenance of an inconsistent position is a condition necessary for adjustment. The requirement in such circumstances is that a position maintained with respect to the taxable year of the determination and which is adopted in the determination be inconsistent with the erroneous inclusion, exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, as the case may be, with respect to the taxable year of the error. That is, a position successfully maintained with respect to the taxable year of the determination must be inconsistent with the treatment accorded an item which was the subject of an error in the computation of the tax for the closed taxable year. Adjustments under the circumstances stated in paragraph (b) of § 1.1312-3 and in § 1.1312-4 are made without regard to the maintenance of an inconsistent position.
(b)
Adjustments resulting in refund or credit.
(1) An adjustment under any of the circumstances stated in § 1.1312-1, § 1.1312-5, § 1.1312-6, or § 1.1312-7 which would result in the allowance of a refund or credit is authorized only if (i) the Commissioner, in connection with a determination, has maintained a position which is inconsistent with the erroneous inclusion, omission, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, as the case may be, in the year of the error, and (ii) such inconsistent position is adopted in the determination.

# Example:
A taxpayer who keeps his books on the cash method erroneously included as income on his return for 1954 an item of accrued interest. After the period of limitations on refunds for 1954 had expired, the district director, on behalf of the Commissioner, proposed an adjustment for the year 1955 on the ground that the item of interest was received in 1955 and, therefore, was properly includible in gross income for that year. The taxpayer and the district director entered into an agreement which meets all of the requirements of § 1.1313(a)-4 and which determines that the interest item was includible in gross income for 1955. The Commissioner has maintained a position inconsistent with the inclusion of the interest item for 1954. As the determination (the agreement pursuant to § 1.1313(a)-4) adopted such inconsistent position, an adjustment is authorized for the year 1954.
(2) An adjustment under circumstances stated in § 1.1312-1, § 1.1312-5, § 1.1312-6, or § 1.1312-7 which would result in the allowance of a refund or credit is not authorized if the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made, and not the Commissioner, has maintained such inconsistent position.

# Example:
In the example in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, assume that the Commissioner asserted a deficiency for 1955 based upon other items for that year but, in computing the net income upon which such deficiency was based, did not include the item of interest. The taxpayer appealed to the Tax Court and in his petition asserted that the interest item should be included in gross income for 1955. The Tax Court in 1960 included the item of interest in its redetermination of
tax for the year 1955. In such case no adjustment would be authorized for 1954 as the taxpayer, and not the Commissioner, maintained a position inconsistent with the erroneous inclusion of the item of interest in the gross income of the taxpayer for that year.
(c)
Adjustments resulting in additional assessments.
(1) An adjustment under any of the circumstances stated in § 1.1312-2, paragraph (a) of § 1.1312-3, § 1.1312-5, § 1.1312-6, or § 1.1312-7 which would result in an additional assessment is authorized only if (i) the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made has, in connection therewith, maintained a position which is inconsistent with the erroneous exclusion, omission, allowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, as the case may be, in the year of the error, and (ii) such inconsistent position is adopted in the determination.

# Example:
A taxpayer in his return for 1950 claimed and was allowed a deduction for a loss arising from a casualty. After the taxpayer had filed his return for 1951 and after the period of limitations upon the assessment of a deficiency for 1950 had expired, it was discovered that the loss actually occurred in 1951. The taxpayer, therefore, filed a claim for refund for the year 1951 based upon the allowance of a deduction for the loss in that year, and the claim was allowed by the Commissioner in 1955. The taxpayer thus has maintained a position inconsistent with the allowance of the deduction for 1950 by filing a claim for refund for 1951 based upon the same deduction. As the determination (the allowance of the claim for refund) adopts such inconsistent position, an adjustment is authorized for the year 1950.
(2) An adjustment under the circumstances stated in § 1.1312-2, paragraph (a) of § 1.1312-3, § 1.1312-5, § 1.1312-6, or § 1.1312-7 which would result in an additional assessment is not authorized if the Commissioner, and not the taxpayer, has maintained such inconsistent position.

# Example:
In the example in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, assume that the taxpayer did not file a claim for refund for 1951 but the Commissioner issued a notice of deficiency for 1951 based upon other items. The taxpayer filed a petition with the Tax Court of the United States and the Commissioner in his answer voluntarily proposed the allowance for 1951 of a deduction for the loss previously allowed for 1950. The Tax Court took the deduction into account in its redetermination in 1955 of the tax for the year 1951. In such case no adjustment would be authorized for the year 1950 as the Commissioner, and not the taxpayer, has maintained a position inconsistent with the allowance of a deduction for the loss in that year.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12032, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6617, 27 FR 10823, Nov. 7, 1962]
§ 1.1311(b)-2
Correction not barred at time of erroneous action.
(a) An adjustment under the circumstances stated in paragraph (b) of § 1.1312-3 (relating to the double exclusion of an item of gross income) which would result in an additional assessment, is authorized only if assessment of a deficiency against the taxpayer or related taxpayer for the taxable year in which the item is includible was not barred by any law or rule of law at the time the Commissioner first maintained, in a notice of deficiency sent pursuant to section 6212 (or section 272(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) or before the Tax Court of the United States, that the item described in paragraph (b) of § 1.1312-3 should be included in the gross income of the taxpayer in the taxable year to which the determination relates.
(b) An adjustment under the circumstances stated in § 1.1312-4 (relating to the double disallowance of a deduction or credit), which would result in the allowance of a credit or refund, is authorized only if a credit or refund to the taxpayer or related taxpayer, attributable to such adjustment, was not barred by any law or rule of law when the taxpayer first maintained in writing before the Commissioner or the Tax Court that he was entitled to such deduction or credit for the taxable year to which the determination relates. The taxpayer will be considered to have first maintained in writing before the Commissioner or the Tax Court that he was entitled to such deduction or credit when he first formally asserts his right to such deduction or credit as, for example, in a return, in a claim for refund, or in a petition (or an amended petition) before the Tax Court.
(c) Under the circumstances of adjustment with respect to which the conditions stated in this section are applicable, the conditions stated in § 1.1311(b)-1 (maintenance of an inconsistent position) are not required. See
paragraph (b) of § 1.1312-3 and § 1.1312-4 for examples of the application of this section.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12032, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1311(b)-3
Existence of relationship in case of adjustment by way of deficiency assessment.
(a) Except for cases described in paragraph (b) of § 1.1312-3, no adjustment by way of a deficiency assessment shall be made, with respect to a related taxpayer, unless the relationship existed both at some time during the taxable year with respect to which the error was made and at the time the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made first maintained the inconsistent position with respect to the taxable year to which the determination relates. In the case of an adjustment by way of a deficiency assessment under the circumstance described in paragraph (b) of § 1.1312-3 (where the maintenance of an inconsistent position is not required), the relationship need exist only at some time during the taxable year in which the error was made.
(b) If the inconsistent position is maintained in a return, claim for refund, or petition (or amended petition) to the Tax Court of the United States for the taxable year in respect to which the determination is made, the requisite relationship must exist on the date of filing such document. If the inconsistent position is maintained in more than one of such documents, the requisite date is the date of filing of the document in which it was first maintained. If the inconsistent position was not thus maintained, then the relationship must exist on the date of the determination as, for example, where at the instance of the taxpayer a deduction is allowed, the right to which was not asserted in a return, claim for refund, or petition to the Tax Court, and a determination is effected by means of a closing agreement or an agreement under section 1313(a)(4).
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12033, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1312-1
Double inclusion of an item of gross income.
(a) Paragraph (1) of section 1312 applies if the determination requires the inclusion in a taxpayer's gross income of an item which was erroneously included in the gross income of the same taxpayer for another taxable year or of a related taxpayer for the same or another taxable year.
(b) The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A taxpayer who keeps his books on the cash method erroneously included in income on his return for 1947 an item of accrued rent. In 1952, after the period of limitation on refunds for 1947 had expired, the Commissioner discovered that the taxpayer received this rent in 1948 and asserted a deficiency for the year 1948 which is sustained by the Tax Court of the United States in 1955. An adjustment in favor of the taxpayer is authorized with respect to the year 1947. If the taxpayer had returned the rent for both 1947 and 1948 and by a determination was denied a refund claim for 1948 on account of the rent item, a similar adjustment is authorized.

# Example 2.
A husband assigned to his wife salary to be earned by him in the year 1952. The wife included such salary in her separate return for that year and the husband omitted it. The Commissioner asserted a deficiency against the wife for 1952 with respect to a different item; she contested that deficiency, and the Tax Court entered an order in her case which became final in 1955. The wife would therefore be barred by section 6512(a) from claiming a refund for 1952. Thereafter, the Commissioner asserted a deficiency against the husband on account of the omission of such salary from his return for 1952. In 1955 the husband and the Commissioner enter into a closing agreement for the year 1952 in which the salary is taxed to the husband. An adjustment is authorized with respect to the wife's tax for 1952.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12033, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1312-2
Double allowance of a deduction or credit.
(a) Paragraph (2) of section 1312 applies if the determination allows the taxpayer a deduction or credit which was erroneously allowed the same taxpayer for another taxable year or a related taxpayer for the same or another taxable year.
(b) The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A taxpayer in his return for 1950 claimed and was allowed a deduction for destruction of timber by a forest fire. Subsequently, it was discovered that the forest fire occurred in 1951 rather than 1950. After
the expiration of the period of limitations for the assessment of a deficiency for 1950, the taxpayer filed a claim for refund for 1951 based upon a deduction for the fire loss in that year. The Commissioner in 1955 allows the claim for refund. An adjustment is authorized with respect to the year 1950.

# Example 2.
The beneficiary of a testamentary trust in his return for 1949 claimed, and was allowed, a deduction for depreciation of the trust property. The Commissioner asserted a deficiency against the beneficiary for 1949 with respect to a different item and a final decision of the Tax Court of the United States was rendered in 1951, so that the Commissioner was thereafter barred by section 272(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 from asserting a further deficiency against the beneficiary for 1949. The trustee thereafter filed a timely refund claim contending that, under the terms of the will, the trust, and not the beneficiary, was entitled to the allowance for depreciation. The court in 1955 sustains the refund claim. An adjustment is authorized with respect to the beneficiary's tax for 1949.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12033, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1312-3
Double exclusion of an item of gross income.
(a)
Items included in income or with respect to which a tax was paid.
(1) Paragraph (3)(A) of section 1312 applies if the determination requires the exclusion, from a taxpayer's gross income, of an item included in a return filed by the taxpayer, or with respect to which tax was paid, and which was erroneously excluded or omitted from the gross income of the same taxpayer for another taxable year or of a related taxpayer for the same or another taxable year.
(2) The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) A taxpayer received payments in 1951 under a contract for the performance of services and included the payments in his return for that year. After the expiration of the period of limitations for the assessment of a deficiency for 1950, the Commissioner issued a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer for the year 1951 based upon adjustments to other items, and the taxpayer filed a petition with the Tax Court of the United States and maintained in the proceedings before the Tax Court that he kept his books on the accrual basis and that the payments received in 1951 were on income that had accrued and was properly taxable in 1950. A final decision of the Tax Court was rendered in 1955 excluding the payments from 1951 income. An adjustment in favor of the Commissioner is authorized with respect to the year 1950, whether or not a tax had been paid on the income reported in the 1951 return.
(ii) Assume the same facts as in (i), except that the taxpayer had not included the payments in any return and had not paid a tax thereon. No adjustment would be authorized under section 1312(3)(A) with respect to the year 1950. If the taxpayer, however, had paid a deficiency asserted for 1951 based upon the inclusion of the payments in 1951 income and thereafter successfully sued for refund thereof, an adjustment would be authorized with respect to the year 1950. (See paragraph (b) of this section for circumstances under which correction is authorized with respect to items not included in income and on which a tax was not paid.)

# Example 2.
A father and son conducted a partnership business, each being entitled to one-half of the net profits. The father included the entire net income of the partnership in his return for 1948, and the son included no portion of this income in his return for that year. Shortly before the expiration of the period of limitations with respect to deficiency assessments and refund claims for both father and son for 1948, the father filed a claim for refund of that portion of his 1948 tax attributable to the half of the partnership income which should have been included in the son's return. The court sustains the claim for refund in 1955. An adjustment is authorized with respect to the son's tax for 1948.
(b)
Items not included in income and with respect to which the tax was not paid.
(1) Paragraph (3)(B) of section 1312 applies if the determination requires the exclusion from gross income of an item not included in a return filed by the taxpayer and with respect to which a tax was not paid, but which is includible in the gross income of the same taxpayer for another taxable year, or in the gross income of a related taxpayer for the same or another taxable year. This is one of the two circumstances in which the maintenance of an inconsistent position is not a requirement for an adjustment, but the requirements in paragraph (a) of § 1.1311(b)-2 must be fulfilled (correction not barred at time of erroneous action).
(2) The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The taxpayer, A, who computes his income by use of the accrual method of accounting, performed in 1949 services for
which he received payments in 1949 and 1950. He did not include in his return for either 1949 or 1950 the payments which he received in 1950, and he paid no tax with respect to such payments. In 1952 the Commissioner sent a notice of deficiency to A with respect to the year 1949, contending that A should have included all of such payments in his return for that year. A contested the deficiency on the basis that in 1949 he had no accruable right to the payments which he received in 1950. In 1955 (after the expiration of the period of limitations for assessing deficiencies with respect to 1950), the Tax Court sustains A's position. The Commissioner may assess a deficiency for 1950, since a deficiency assessment for that year was not barred when he sent the notice of deficiency with respect to 1949.

# Example 2.
B and C were partners in 1950, each being entitled to one-half of the profits of the partnership business. During 1950, B received an item of income which he treated as partnership income so that his return for that year reflected only 50 percent of such item. C, however, included no part of such item in any return and paid no tax with respect thereto. In 1952, the Commissioner sent to C a notice of deficiency with respect to 1950, contending that his return for that year should have reflected 50 percent of such item. C contested the deficiency on the basis that such item was not partnership income. In 1955, after the expiration of the period of limitations for assessing deficiencies with respect to 1950, the Tax Court sustained C's position. The Commissioner may assess a deficiency against B with respect to 1950 requiring him to include the entire amount of such item in his income since assessment of the deficiency was not barred when the Commissioner sent the notice of deficiency with respect to such item to C.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12034, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1312-4
Double disallowance of a deduction or credit.
(a) Paragraph (4) of section 1312 applies if the determination disallows a deduction or credit which should have been, but was not, allowed to the same taxpayer for another taxable year or to a related taxpayer for the same or another taxable year. This is one of the two circumstances in which the maintenance of an inconsistent position is not a requirement for an adjustment but the requirements in paragraph (b) of § 1.1311(b)-2 must be fulfilled (correction not barred at time of erroneous action).
(b) The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The taxpayer, A, who computes his income by use of the accrual method of accounting, deducted in his return for the taxable year 1951 an item of expense which he paid in such year. At the time A filed his return for 1951, the statute of limitations for 1950 had not expired. Subsequently, the Commissioner asserted a deficiency for 1951 based on the position that the liability for such expense should have been accrued for the taxable year 1950. In 1955, after the period of limitations on refunds for 1950 had expired, there was a determination by the Tax Court disallowing such deduction for the taxable year 1951. A is entitled to an adjustment for the taxable year 1950. However, if such liability should have been accrued for the taxable year 1946 instead of 1950, A would not be entitled to an adjustment, if a credit or refund with respect to 1946 was already barred when he deducted such expense for the taxable year 1951.

# Example 2.
The taxpayer, B, in his return for 1951 claimed a deduction for a charitable contribution. The Commissioner asserted a deficiency for such year contending that 50 percent of the deduction should be disallowed, since the contribution was made from community property 50 percent of which was attributable to B's spouse. The deficiency is sustained by the Tax Court in 1956, subsequent to the period of limitations within which B's spouse could claim a refund with respect to 1951. An adjustment is permitted to B's spouse, a related taxpayer, since a refund attributable to a deduction by her of such contribution was not barred when B claimed the deduction.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12034, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1312-5
Correlative deductions and inclusions for trusts or estates and legatees, beneficiaries, or heirs.
(a) Paragraph (5) of section 1312 applies to distributions by a trust or an estate to the beneficiaries, heirs, or legatees. If the determination relates to the amount of the deduction allowed by sections 651 and 661 or the inclusion in taxable income of the beneficiary required by sections 652 and 662 (including amounts falling within subpart D, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code, relating to treatment of excess distributions by trusts), or if the determination relates to the additional deduction (or inclusion) specified in section 162 (b) and (c) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1939 (or the corresponding provisions of a prior revenue act), with respect to amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed to the beneficiaries, heirs, and legatees, and such determination requires:
(1) The allowance to the estate or trust of the deduction when such amounts have been erroneously omitted or excluded from the income of the beneficiaries, heirs, or legatees; or
(2) The inclusion of such amounts in the income of the beneficiaries, heirs, or legatees when the deduction has been erroneously disallowed to or omitted by the estate or trust; or
(3) The disallowance to an estate or trust of the deduction when such amounts have been erroneously included in the income of the beneficiaries, heirs, or legatees; or
(4) The exclusion of such amounts from the income of the beneficiaries, heirs, or legatees when the deduction has been erroneously allowed to the estate or trust.
(b) The application of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
For the taxable year 1954, a trustee, directed by the trust instrument to accumulate the trust income, made no distribution to the beneficiary and returned the entire income as taxable to the trust. Accordingly the beneficiary did not include the trust income in his return for the year 1954. In 1957, a State court holds invalid the clause directing accumulation and determines that the income is required to be currently distributed. It also rules that certain extraordinary dividends which the trustee in good faith allocated to corpus in 1954 were properly allocable to income. In 1958, the trustee, relying upon the court decision, files a claim for refund of the tax paid on behalf of the trust for the year 1954 and thereafter files a suit in the District Court. The claim is sustained by the court (except as to the tax on the extraordinary dividends) in 1959 after the expiration of the period of limitations upon deficiency assessments against the beneficiary for the year 1954. An adjustment is authorized with respect to the beneficiary's tax for the year 1954. The treatment of the distribution to the beneficiary of the extraordinary dividends shall be determined under subpart D of subchapter J.
(c) The application of paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
Assume the same facts as in the example in paragraph (b) of this section, except that, instead of the trustee's filing a refund claim, the Commissioner, relying upon the decision of the State court, asserts a deficiency against the beneficiary for 1954. The deficiency is sustained by final decision of the Tax Court of the United States in 1959, after the expiration of the period for filing claim for refund on behalf of the trust for 1954. An adjustment is authorized with respect to the trust for the year 1954.
(d) The application of paragraph (a)(3) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A trustee claimed in the trust return for 1954 for amounts paid to the beneficiary a deduction to the extent of distributable net income. This amount was included by the beneficiary in gross income in his return for 1954. In computing distributable net income the trustee had included short and long-term capital gains. In 1958, the Commissioner asserts a deficiency against the trust on the ground that the capital gains were not includible in distributable net income, and that, therefore, the gains were taxable to the trust, not the beneficiary. The deficiency is sustained by a final decision of the Tax Court in 1960, after the expiration of the period for filing claims for refund by the beneficiary for 1954. An adjustment is authorized with respect to the beneficiary's tax for the year 1954, based on the exclusion from 1954 gross income of the capital gains previously considered distributed by the trust under section 662.
(e) The application of paragraph (a)(4) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
Assume the same facts as in the example in paragraph (d) of this section, except that, instead of the Commissioner's asserting a deficiency, the beneficiary filed a refund claim for 1954 on the same ground. The claim is sustained by the court in 1960 after the expiration of the period of limitations upon deficiency assessments against the trust for 1954. An adjustment is authorized with respect to the trust for the year 1954.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12034, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1312-6
Correlative deductions and credits for certain related corporations.
(a) Paragraph (6) of section 1312 applies if the determination allows or disallows a deduction (including a credit) to a corporation, and if a correlative deduction or credit has been erroneously allowed, omitted, or disallowed
in respect of a related taxpayer described in section 1313(c)(7).
(b) The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Y Corporation. In 1955, X Corporation paid $5,000 to Y Corporation and claimed an interest deduction for this amount in its return for 1955. Y Corporation included this amount in its gross income for 1955. In 1958, the Commissioner asserted a deficiency against X Corporation for 1955, contending that the deduction for interest paid should be disallowed on the ground that the payment was in reality the payment of a dividend to Y Corporation. X Corporation contested the deficiency, and ultimately in June 1959, a final decision of the Tax Court sustained the Commissioner. Since the amount of the payment is a dividend, Y Corporation should have been allowed for 1955 the corporate dividends-received deduction under section 243 with respect to such payment. However, the Tax Court's decision sustaining the deficiency against X Corporation occurred after the expiration of the period for filing claim for refund by Y Corporation for 1955. An adjustment is authorized with respect to Y Corporation for 1955.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that, instead of the Commissioner asserting a deficiency against X Corporation for 1955, Y Corporation filed a claim for refund in 1958, alleging that the payment received in 1955 from X Corporation was in reality a dividend to which the corporate dividends-received deduction (section 243) applies. The Commissioner denied the claim, and ultimately in June 1959, the district court, in a final decision, sustained Y Corporation. Since the amount of the payment is a dividend, X Corporation should not have been allowed an interest deduction for the amount paid to Y Corporation. However, the district court's decision sustaining the claim for refund occurred after the expiration of the period of limitations for assessing a deficiency against X Corporation for the year 1955. An adjustment is authorized with respect to X Corporation's tax for 1955.
[T.D. 6617, 27 FR 10823, Nov. 7, 1962]
§ 1.1312-7
Basis of property after erroneous treatment of a prior transaction.
(a) Paragraph (7) of section 1312 applies if the determination establishes the basis of property, and there occurred one of the following types of errors in respect of a prior transaction upon which such basis depends, or in respect of a prior transaction which was erroneously treated as affecting such basis:
(1) An erroneous inclusion in, or omission from, gross income, or
(2) An erroneous recognition or nonrecognition of gain or loss, or
(3) An erroneous deduction of an item properly chargeable to capital account or an erroneous charge to capital account of an item properly deductible.
(b)(1) For this section to apply, the taxpayer with respect to whom the erroneous treatment occurred must be:
(i) The taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made; or
(ii) A taxpayer who acquired title to the property in the erroneously treated transaction and from whom, mediately or immediately, the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made derived title in such a manner that he will have a basis ascertained by reference to the basis in the hands of the taxpayer who acquired title to the property in the erroneously treated transaction; or
(iii) A taxpayer who had title to the property at the time of the erroneously treated transaction and from whom, mediately or immediately, the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made derived title, if the basis of the property in the hands of the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made is determined under section 1015(a) (relating to the basis of property acquired by gift) or section 1022 (relating to the basis of property acquired from certain decedents who died in 2010).
(2) No adjustment is authorized with respect to the transferor of the property in a transaction upon which the basis of the property depends, when the determination is with respect to the original transferee or a subsequent transferee of the original transferee.
(c) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1949 taxpayer A transferred property which had cost him $5,000 to the X Corporation in exchange for an original issue of shares of its stock having a fair market value of $10,000. In his return for 1949 taxpayer A treated the exchange as one in which the gain or loss was not recognizable:
(i) In 1955 the X Corporation maintains that the gain should have been recognized in
the exchange in 1949 and therefore the property it received had a $10,000 basis for depreciation. Its position is adopted in a closing agreement. No adjustment is authorized with respect to the tax of the X Corporation for 1949, as none of the three types of errors specified in paragraph (a) of this section occurred with respect to the X Corporation in the treatment of the exchange in 1949. Moreover, no adjustment is authorized with respect to taxpayer A, as he is not within any of the three classes of taxpayers described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) In 1953 taxpayer A sells the stock which he received in 1949 and maintains that, as gain should have been recognized in the exchange in 1949, the basis for computing the profit on the sale is $10,000. His position is confirmed in a closing agreement executed in 1955. An adjustment is authorized with respect to his tax for the year 1949 as the basis for computing the gain on the sale depends upon the transaction in 1949, and in respect of that transaction there was an erroneous nonrecognition of gain to taxpayer A, the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made.

# Example 2.
In 1950 taxpayer A was the owner of 10 shares of the common stock of the Z Corporation which had a basis of $1,500. In that year he received as a dividend thereon 10 shares of the preferred stock of the same corporation having a fair market value of $1,000. On his books, entries were made reducing the basis of the common stock by allocating $500 of the basis to the preferred stock, and on his return for 1950 he did not include the dividend in gross income.
(i) In 1951 taxpayer A made a gift of the preferred stock of the Z Corporation to taxpayer B, an unrelated individual. Taxpayer B sold the stock in 1953 and on his return for that year he reported the sale and claimed a basis of $1,000, contending that the dividend of preferred stock was taxable to A in 1950 at its fair market value of $1,000. The basis of $1,000 is confirmed by a closing agreement executed in 1955. An adjustment is authorized with respect to taxpayer A's tax for 1950, as the closing agreement determines basis of property, and in a prior transaction upon which such basis depends there was an erroneous omission from gross income of taxpayer A, a taxpayer who acquired title to the property in the erroneously treated transaction and from whom, immediately, the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made derived title.
(ii) Assuming the same facts as in (i) except that the common stock instead of the preferred stock was the subject of the gift, and the basis claimed by taxpayer B and confirmed in the closing agreement was $1,500. An adjustment is authorized with respect to taxpayer A's tax for 1950, as the closing agreement determines the basis of property, and in a prior transaction which was erroneously treated as affecting such basis there was an erroneous omission from gross income of taxpayer A, a taxpayer who had title to the property at the time of the erroneously treated transaction, and from whom, immediately, taxpayer B, with respect to whom the determination is made, derived title. The basis of the property in taxpayer B's hands with respect to whom the determination is made is determined under section 1015(a) (relating to the basis of property acquired by gift).

# Example 3.
In 1950 taxpayer A sold property acquired at a cost of $5,000 to taxpayer B for $10,000. In his return for 1950 taxpayer A failed to include the profit on such sale. In 1953 taxpayer B sold the property for $12,000, and in his return for 1953 reported a gain of $2,000 upon the sale, which is confirmed by a closing agreement executed in 1955. No adjustment is authorized with respect to the tax of taxpayer A for 1950, as he does not come within any of the three classes of taxpayers described in paragraph (b) of this section.

# Example 4.
In 1950 a taxpayer who owned 100 shares of stock in Corporation Y received $1,000 from the corporation which amount the taxpayer reported on his return for 1950 as a taxable dividend. In 1952 Corporation Y was completely liquidated and the taxpayer received in that year liquidating distributions totalling $8,000. In his return for 1952 the taxpayer reported the receipt of the $8,000 and computed his gain or loss upon the liquidation by using as a basis the amount which he paid for the stock. The Commissioner maintained that the distribution in 1950 was a distribution out of capital and that in computing the taxpayer's gain or loss upon the liquidation in 1952, the basis of the stock should be reduced by the $1,000. This position is adopted in a closing agreement executed in 1955 with respect to the year 1952. An adjustment is authorized with respect to the year 1950 as the basis for computing gain or loss in 1952 depends upon the transaction in 1950, and in respect of the 1950 transaction (upon which the basis of the property depends) there was an erroneous inclusion in gross income of the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made.

# Example 5.
In 1946 a taxpayer received 100 shares of stock of the X Corporation having a fair market value of $5,000, in exchange for shares of stock in the Y Corporation which he had acquired at a cost of $12,000. In his return for 1946 the taxpayer treated the exchange as one in which gain or loss was not recognizable. The taxpayer sold 50 shares of the X Corporation stock in 1947 and in his return for that year treated such shares as having a $6,000 basis. In 1952, the taxpayer sold the remaining 50 shares of stock of the X Corporation for $7,500 and reported $1,500
gain in his return for 1952. After the expiration of the period of limitations on deficiency assessments and on refund claims for 1946 and 1947, the Commissioner asserted a deficiency for 1952 on the ground that the loss realized on the exchange in 1946 was erroneously treated as nonrecognizable, and the basis for computing gain upon the sale in 1952 was $2,500, resulting in a gain of $5,000. The deficiency is sustained by the Tax Court in 1955. An adjustment is authorized with respect to the year 1946 as to the entire $7,000 loss realized on the exchange, as the Court's decision determines the basis of property, and in a prior transaction upon which such basis depends there was an erroneous nonrecognition of loss to the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination was made. No adjustment is authorized with respect to the year 1947 as the basis for computing gain upon the sale of the 50 shares in 1952 does not depend upon the transaction in 1947 but upon the transaction in 1946.

Effective/applicability date.
This section applies on and after January 19, 2017. For rules before January 19, 2017, see § 1.1312-7 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12035, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6617, 27 FR 10824, Nov. 7, 1962; T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6242, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.1312-8
Law applicable in determination of error.
The question whether there was an erroneous inclusion, exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition is determined under the provisions of the internal revenue laws applicable with respect to the year as to which the inclusion, exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, as the case may be, was made. The fact that the inclusion, exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, as the case may be, was in pursuance of an interpretation, either judicial or administrative, accorded such provisions of the internal revenue laws at the time of such action is not necessarily determinative of this question. For example, if a later judicial decision authoritatively alters such interpretation so that such action was contrary to such provisions of the internal revenue laws as later interpreted, the inclusion, exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, as the case may be, is erroneous within the meaning of section 1312.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12036, Nov. 26, 1960. Redesignated by T.D. 6617, 27 FR 10824, Nov. 7, 1962]
§ 1.1313(a)-1
Decision by Tax Court or other court as a determination.
(a) A determination may take the form of a decision by the Tax Court of the United States or a judgment, decree, or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction, which has become final.
(b) The date upon which a decision by the Tax Court becomes final is prescribed in section 7481.
(c) The date upon which a judgment of any other court becomes final must be determined upon the basis of the facts in the particular case. Ordinarily, a judgment of a United States district court becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed for taking an appeal, if no such appeal is duly taken within such time; and a judgment of the United States Court of Claims becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for certiorari if no such petition is duly filed within such time.

§ 1.1313(a)-2
Closing agreement as a determination.
A determination may take the form of a closing agreement authorized by section 7121. Such an agreement may relate to the total tax liability of the taxpayer for a particular taxable year or years or to one or more separate items affecting such liability. A closing agreement becomes final for the purpose of this section on the date of its approval by the Commissioner.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12036, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1313(a)-3
Final disposition of claim for refund as a determination.
(a)
In general.
A determination may take the form of a final disposition of a claim for refund. Such disposition may result in a determination with respect to two classes of items, i.e., items included by the taxpayer in a claim for refund and items applied by the Commissioner to offset the alleged overpayment. The time at which a disposition in respect of a particular item becomes
final may depend not only upon what action is taken with respect to that item but also upon whether the claim for refund is allowed or disallowed.
(b)
Items with respect to which the taxpayer's claim is allowed.
(1) The disposition with respect to an item as to which the taxpayer's contention in the claim for refund is sustained becomes final on the date of allowance of the refund or credit if:
(i) The taxpayer's claim for refund is unqualifiedly allowed; or
(ii) The taxpayer's contention with respect to an item is sustained and with respect to other items is denied, so that the net result is an allowance of refund or credit; or
(iii) The taxpayer's contention with respect to an item is sustained, but the Commissioner applies other items to offset the amount of the alleged overpayment and the items so applied do not completely offset such amount but merely reduce it so that the net result is an allowance of refund or credit.
(2) If the taxpayer's contention in the claim for refund with respect to an item is sustained but the Commissioner applies other items to offset the amount of the alleged overpayment so that the net result is a disallowance of the claim for refund, the date of mailing, by registered mail, of the notice of disallowance (see section 6532) is the date of the final disposition as to the item with respect to which the taxpayer's contention is sustained.
(c)
Items with respect to which the taxpayer's claim is disallowed.
The disposition with respect to an item as to which the taxpayer's contention in the claim for refund is denied becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed by section 6532 for instituting suit on the claim for refund, unless the suit is instituted prior to the expiration of such period, if:
(1) The taxpayer's claim for refund is unqualifiedly disallowed; or
(2) The taxpayer's contention with respect to an item is denied and with respect to other items is sustained so that the net result is an allowance of refund or credit; or
(3) The taxpayer's contention with respect to an item is sustained in part and denied in part. For example, assume that the taxpayer claimed a deductible loss of $10,000 and a consequent overpayment of $2,500 and the Commissioner concedes that a deductible loss was sustained, but only in the amount of $5,000. The disposition of the claim for refund with respect to the allowance of the $5,000 and the disallowance of the remaining $5,000 becomes final upon the expiration of the time for instituting suit on the claim for refund unless suit is instituted prior to the expiration of such period.
(d)
Items applied by the Commissioner in reduction of the refund or credit.
If the Commissioner applies an item in reduction of the overpayment alleged in the claim for refund, and the net result is an allowance of refund or credit, the disposition with respect to the item so applied by the Commissioner becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed by section 6532 for instituting suit on the claim for refund, unless suit is instituted prior to the expiration of such period. If such application of the item results in the assertion of a deficiency, such action does not constitute a final disposition of a claim for refund within the meaning of § 1.1313(a)-3, but subsequent action taken with respect to such deficiency may result in a determination under §§ 1.1313(a)-1, 1.1313(a)-2, or 1.1313(a)-4.
(e)
Elimination of waiting period.
The necessity of waiting for the expiration of the 2-year period of limitations provided in section 6532 may be avoided in such cases as are described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section by the use of a closing agreement (see § 1.1313(a)-2) or agreement under § 1.1313(a)-4 to effect a determination.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12036, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1313(a)-4
Agreement pursuant to section 1313(a)(4) as a determination.
(a)
In general.
(1) A determination may take the form of an agreement made pursuant to this section. This section is intended to provide an expeditious method for obtaining an adjustment under section 1311 and for offsetting deficiencies and refunds whenever possible. The provisions of part II (section 1311 and following), subchapter Q, chapter 1 of the Code, must be strictly complied with in any such agreement.
(2) An agreement made pursuant to this section will not, in itself, establish the tax liability for the open taxable year to which it relates, but it will state the amount of the tax, as then determined, for such open year. The tax may be the amount of tax shown on the return as filed by the taxpayer, but if any changes in the amount have been made, or if any are being made by documents executed concurrently with the execution of said agreement, such changes must be taken into account. For example, an agreement pursuant to this section may be executed concurrently with the execution of a waiver of restrictions on assessment and collection of a deficiency or acceptance of an overassessment with respect to the open taxable year, or concurrently with the execution and filing of a stipulation in a proceeding before the Tax Court of the United States, where an item which is to be the subject of an adjustment under section 1311 is disposed of by the stipulation and is not left for determination by the court.
(b)
Contents of agreement.
An agreement made pursuant to this section shall be so designated in the heading of the agreement, and it shall contain the following:
(1) A statement of the amount of the tax determined for the open taxable year to which the agreement relates, and if said liability is established or altered by a document executed concurrently with the execution of the agreement, a reference to said document.
(2) A concise statement of the material facts with respect to the item that was the subject of the error in the closed taxable year or years, and a statement of the manner in which such item was treated in computing the tax liability set forth pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(3) A statement as to the amount of the adjustment ascertained pursuant to § 1.1314(a)-1 for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made and, where applicable, a statement as to the amount of the adjustment or adjustments ascertained pursuant to § 1.1314(a)-2 with respect to any other taxable year or years; and
(4) A waiver of restrictions on assessment and collection of any deficiencies set forth pursuant to subparagraph 3 of this paragraph.
(c)
Execution and effect of agreement.
An agreement made pursuant to this section shall be signed by the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made, or on the taxpayer's behalf by an agent or attorney acting pursuant to a power of attorney on file with the Internal Revenue Service. If an adjustment is to be made in a case of a related taxpayer, the agreement shall be signed also by the related taxpayer, or on the related taxpayer's behalf by an agent or attorney acting pursuant to a power of attorney on file with the Internal Revenue Service. It may be signed on behalf of the Commissioner by the district director, or such other person as is authorized by the Commissioner. When duly executed, such agreement will constitute the authority for an allowance of any refund or credit agreed to therein, and for the immediate assessment of any deficiency agreed to therein for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made, or any closed taxable year or years affected, or treated as affected, by a net operating loss deduction or capital loss carryover determined with reference to the taxable year with respect to which the error was made.
(d)
Finality of determination.
A determination made by an agreement pursuant to this section becomes final when the tax liability for the open taxable year to which the determination relates becomes final. During the period, if any, that a deficiency may be assessed or a refund or credit allowed with respect to such year, either the taxpayer or the Commissioner may properly pursue any of the procedures provided by law to secure a further modification of the tax liability for such year. For example, if the taxpayer subsequently files a claim for refund, or if the Commissioner subsequently issues a notice of deficiency with respect to such year, either may adopt a position with respect to the item that was the subject of the adjustment that is at variance with the manner in which said item was treated in the agreement. Any assessment, refund, or credit that is subsequently made with respect to the tax liability for such
open taxable year, to the extent that it is based upon a revision in the treatment of the item that was the subject of the adjustment, shall constitute an alteration or revocation of the determination for the purpose of a redetermination of the adjustment pursuant to paragraph (d) of § 1.1314(b)-1.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12037, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1313(c)-1
Related taxpayer.
An adjustment in the case of the taxpayer with respect to whom the error was made may be authorized under section 1311 although the determination is made with respect to a different taxpayer, provided that such taxpayers stand in one of the relationships specified in section 1313(c). The concept of
related taxpayer
has application to all of the circumstances of adjustment specified in § 1.1312-1 through § 1.1312-5 if the related taxpayer is one described in section 1313(c); it has application to the circumstances of adjustment specified in § 1.1312-6 only if the related taxpayer is one described in section 1313(c)(7); it does not apply in the circumstances specified in § 1.1312-7. If such relationship exists, it is not essential that the error involve a transaction made possible only by reason of the existence of the relationship. For example, if the error with respect to which an adjustment is sought under section 1311 grew out of an assignment of rents between taxpayer A and taxpayer B, who are partners, and the determination is with respect to taxpayer A, an adjustment with respect to taxpayer B may be permissible despite the fact that the assignment had nothing to do with the business of the partnership. The relationship need not exist throughout the entire taxable year with respect to which the error was made, but only at some time during that taxable year. For example, if a taxpayer on February 15 assigns to his fiancee the net rents of a building which the taxpayer owns, and the two are married before the end of the taxable year, an adjustment may be permissible if the determination relates to such rents despite the fact that they were not husband and wife at the time of the assignment. See § 1.1311(b)-3 for the requirement in certain cases that the relationship exist at the time an inconsistent position is first maintained.
[T.D. 6617, 27 FR 10824, Nov. 7, 1962]
§ 1.1314(a)-1
Ascertainment of amount of adjustment in year of error.
(a) In computing the amount of the adjustment under sections 1311 to 1315, inclusive, there must first be ascertained the amount of the tax previously determined for the taxpayer as to whom the error was made for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made. The tax previously determined for any taxable year may be the amount of tax shown on the taxpayer's return, but if any changes in that amount have been made, they must be taken into account. In such cases, the tax previously determined will be the sum of the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his return and the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies, reduced by the amount of any rebates made. The amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his return and the amount of any rebates or deficiencies shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 6211 and the regulations thereunder.
(b)(1) The tax previously determined may consist of tax for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1931, imposed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, by chapter 1 and subchapters A, B, D, and E of chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or by the corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws, or by any one or more of such provisions.
(2) After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, a recomputation must then be made under the laws applicable to said taxable year to ascertain the increase or decrease in tax, if any, resulting from the correction of the error. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed after correction of the error will be the amount of the adjustment.
(c) No change shall be made in the treatment given any item upon which the tax previously determined was based other than in the correction of the item or items with respect to which the error was made. However, due regard shall be given to the effect
that such correction may have on the computation of gross income, taxable income, and other matters under chapter 1 of the Code. If the treatment of any item upon which the tax previously determined was based, or if the application of any provisions of the internal revenue laws with respect to such tax, depends upon the amount of income (e.g. charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, dividends received credit, medical expenses, and percentage depletion), readjustment in these particulars will be necessary as part of the recomputation in conformity with the change in the amount of the income which results from the correct treatment of the item or items in respect of which the error was made.
(d) Any interest or additions to the tax collected as a result of the error shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the adjustment.
(e) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
(1) For the taxable year 1949 a taxpayer with no dependents, who kept his books on the cash receipts and disbursements method, filed a joint return with his wife disclosing adjusted gross income of $42,000 deductions amounting to $12,000, and a net income of $30,000. Included among other items in the gross income were salary in the amount of $15,000 and rents accrued but not yet received in the amount of $5,000. During the taxable year he donated $10,000 to the American Red Cross and in his return claimed a deduction of $6,300 on account thereof, representing the maximum deduction allowable under the 15-percent limitation imposed by section 23(o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 as applicable to the year 1949. In computing his net income he omitted interest income amounting to $6,000 and neglected to take a deduction for interest paid in the amount of $4,500. The return disclosed a tax liability of $7,788, which was assessed and paid. After the expiration of the period of limitations upon the assessment of a deficiency or the allowance of a refund for 1949, the Commissioner included the item of rental income amounting to $5,000 in the taxpayer's gross income for the year 1950 and asserted a deficiency for that year. As a result of a final decision of the Tax Court of the United States in 1955 sustaining the deficiency for 1950, an adjustment is authorized for the year 1949.
(2) The amount of the adjustment is computed as follows:
Tax previously determined for 1949
$7,788
Net income for 1949 upon which tax previously determined was based
30,000
Less: Rents erroneously included
5,000
Balance
25,000
Adjustment for contributions (add 15 percent of $5,000)
750
Net income as adjusted
25,750
Tax as recomputed
6,152
Tax previously determined
7,788
Difference
1,636
Amount of adjustment to be refunded or credited
1,636
(3) In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, the recomputation to determine the amount of the adjustment does not take into consideration the item of $6,000 representing interest received, which was omitted from gross income, or the item of $4,500 representing interest paid, for which no deduction was allowed.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12038, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1314(a)-2
Adjustment to other barred taxable years.
(a) An adjustment is authorized under section 1311 with respect to a taxable year or years other than the year of the error, but only if all of the following requirements are met:
(1) The tax liability for such other year or years must be affected, or must have been treated as affected, by a net operating loss deduction (as defined in section 172) or by a capital loss carryback or carryover (as defined in section 1212).
(2) The net operating loss deduction or capital loss carryback or carryover must be determined with reference to the taxable year with respect to which the error was made.
(3) On the date of the determination the adjustment with respect to such other year or years must be prevented by some law or rule of law, other than sections 1311 through 1315 and section 7122 and the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws.
(b) The amount of the adjustment for such other year or years shall be computed in a manner similar to that provided in § 1.1314(a)-1. The tax previously determined for such other year or years shall be ascertained. A recomputation must then be made to ascertain the increase or decrease in tax, if any, resulting solely from the correction of the net operating loss deduction or capital loss carryback or carryover.
The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed is the amount of the adjustment. In the recomputation, no consideration shall be given to items other than the following:
(1) The items upon which the tax previously determined for such other year or years was based, and
(2) The net operating loss deduction or capital loss carryback or carryover as corrected.
In determining the correct net operating loss deduction or capital loss carryback or carryover, no changes shall be made in taxable income (net income in the case of taxable years subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or prior revenue laws), net operating loss or capital loss, for any barred taxable year, except as provided in section 1314. Section 172 and the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, prescribe the methods of computing the net operating loss deduction. Section 1212 and the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, prescribe the methods for computing the capital loss carryback and carryover.
(c) A net operating loss deduction or a capital loss carryback or carryover determined with reference to the year of the error may affect, or may have been treated as affecting, a taxable year with respect to which an adjustment is not prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law. In such case, the appropriate adjustment shall be made with respect to such open taxable year. However, the redetermination of the tax for such open taxable year is not made pursuant to part II (section 1311 and following), subchapter Q, chapter 1 of the Code, and the adjustment for such open year and the method of computation are not limited by the provisions of said sections.
(d) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
The taxpayer is a corporation which makes its income tax returns on a calendar year basis. Its net income in 1949, computed without any net operating loss deduction was $10,000, but because of a net operating loss deduction in excess of that amount resulting from a carryback of a net operating loss claimed for 1950, it paid no income tax for 1949. On its return for 1950 it showed an excess of deductions over gross income of $14,000, and it paid no income tax for 1950. For the year 1951 its net income, computed without any net operating loss deduction, was $15,000, and a net operating loss deduction of $13,000 was allowed ($4,000 of which was attributable to the carryover from 1950 and $9,000 of which was attributable to the carryback of a net operating loss of $9,000 sustained in 1952). In 1957 the assessment of deficiencies or the allowance of refunds for all of said years are barred by the statute of limitations.
(i) A Tax Court decision entered in 1957 with respect to the taxable year 1953 constituted a determination under which an adjustment is authorized to the taxable year 1950, the year with respect to which the error was made. This adjustment increases income for said year by $15,000, so that instead of a net operating loss of $14,000, its corrected net income is $1,000 for 1950, and the tax computed on that income will be assessed as a deficiency for 1950. An adjustment is authorized under this section with respect to each of the years 1949 and 1951, as the tax liability for each year was treated as affected by a net operating loss deduction which was determined by a computation in which reference was made to the year 1950. In the recomputation of the tax for 1949, the net operating loss carryback from 1950 will be eliminated, and in the recomputation of the tax for 1951 the net operating loss carryover from 1950 will be eliminated; for each of the years 1949 and 1951 there will be an adjustment which will be treated as a deficiency for said year.
(ii) Assuming the same facts, except that the correction with respect to the year 1950 increases the net operating loss for said year from $14,000 to $20,000. As a result of this correction, there will be no change in the tax due for 1949 and 1950. However, the net operating loss deduction for 1951 is recomputed to be $19,000, the aggregate of the $10,000 carryover from 1950 and the $9,000 carryback from 1952 (the carryover from 1950 is the excess of the $20,000 net operating loss for 1950 over the $10,000 net income for 1949, such 1949 income being determined without any net operating loss deduction). As a result of the correction of the net operating loss deduction for 1951, the tax recomputation will show no tax due for said year, and the adjustment for 1951 will result in a refund or credit of the tax previously paid. Moreover, computations resulting from this adjustment will disclose a net operating loss carryover from 1952 to 1953 of $4,000, that is, the excess of the $9,000 net operating loss for 1952 over the $5,000 net income for 1951 (such net income for 1951 being computed as the $15,000 reduced by the carryover of $10,000 from 1950,
the carryback from 1952 not being taken into account). A further adjustment is authorized under section 1311 with respect to any subsequent barred year in which the tax liability is affected by a carryover of the net operating loss from 1952, inasmuch as such carryover from 1952 has been determined by a computation in which reference was made to 1950, the taxable year of the error.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12038, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7301, 39 FR 972, Jan. 4, 1974]
§ 1.1314(b)-1
Method of adjustment.
(a) If the amount of the adjustment ascertained pursuant to § 1.1314(a)-1 or § 1.1314(a)-2 represents an increase in tax, it is to be treated as if it were a deficiency determined by the Commissioner with respect to the taxpayer as to whom the error was made and for the taxable year or years with respect to which such adjustment was made. The amount of such adjustment is thus to be assessed and collected under the law and regulations applicable to the assessment and collection of deficiencies, subject, however, to the limitations imposed by § 1.1314(c)-1. Notice of deficiency, unless waived, must be issued with respect to such amount or amounts, and the taxpayer may contest the deficiency before the Tax Court of the United States or, if he chooses, may pay the deficiency and later file claim for refund. If the amount of the adjustment ascertained pursuant to § 1.1314(a)-1 or § 1.1314(a)-2 represents a decrease in tax, it is to be treated as if it were an overpayment claimed by the taxpayer with respect to whom the error was made for the taxable year or years with respect to which such adjustment was made. Such amount may be recovered under the law and regulations applicable to overpayments of tax, subject, however, to the limitations imposed by § 1.1314(c)-1. The taxpayer must file a claim for refund thereof, unless the overpayment is refunded without such claim, and if the claim is denied or not acted upon by the Commissioner within the prescribed time, the taxpayer may then file suit for refund.
(b) For the purpose of the adjustments authorized by section 1311, the period of limitations upon the making of an assessment or upon refund or credit, as the case may be, for the taxable year of an adjustment shall be considered as if, on the date of the determination, one year remained before the expiration of such period. The Commissioner thus has one year from the date of the determination within which to mail a notice of deficiency in respect of the amount of the adjustment where such adjustment is treated as if it were a deficiency. The issuance of such notice of deficiency, in accordance with the law and regulations applicable to the assessment of deficiencies will suspend the running of the 1-year period of limitations provided in section 1314(b). In accordance with the applicable law and regulations governing the collection of deficiencies, the period of limitation for collection of the amount of the adjustment will commence to run from the date of assessment of such amount. (See section 6502 and corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws.) Similarly, the taxpayer has a period of one year from the date of the determination within which to file a claim for refund in respect of the amount of the adjustment where such adjustment is treated as if it were an overpayment. Where the amount of the adjustment is treated as if it were a deficiency and the taxpayer chooses to pay such deficiency and contest it by way of a claim for refund, the period of limitation upon filing a claim for refund will commence to run from the date of such payment. See section 6511 and corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws.
(c) The amount of an adjustment treated as if it were a deficiency or an overpayment, as the case may be, will bear interest and be subject to additions to the tax to the extent provided by the internal revenue laws applicable to deficiencies and overpayments for the taxable year with respect to which the adjustment is made. In the case of an adjustment resulting from an increase or decrease in a net operating loss or net capital loss which is carried back to the year of adjustment, interest shall not be collected or paid for any period prior to the close of the taxable year in which the net operating loss or net capital loss arises.
(d) If, as a result of a determination provided for in § 1.1313(a)-4, an adjustment has been made by the assessment
and collection of a deficiency or the refund or credit of an overpayment, and subsequently such determination is altered or revoked, the amount of the adjustment ascertained under § 1.1314(a)-1 and § 1.1314(a)-2 shall be redetermined on the basis of such alteration or revocation, and any overpayment or deficiency resulting from such redetermination shall be refunded or credited, or assessed and collected, as the case may be, as an adjustment under section 1311. For the circumstances under which such an agreement can be altered or revoked, see paragraph (d) of § 1.1313(a)-4.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12039, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7301, 39 FR 972, Jan. 4, 1974]
§ 1.1314(c)-1
Adjustment unaffected by other items.
(a) The amount of any adjustment ascertained under § 1.1314(a)-1 or § 1.1314(a)-2 shall not be diminished by any credit or set-off based upon any item other than the one that was the subject of the adjustment.
(b) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In the example set forth in paragraph (e) of § 1.1314(a)-1, if, after the amount of the adjustment had been ascertained, the taxpayer, filed a refund claim for the amount thereof, the Commissioner could not diminish the amount of that claim by offsetting against it the amount of tax which should have been paid with respect to the $6,000 interest item omitted from gross income for the year 1949; nor could the court, if suit were brought on such claim for refund, offset against the amount of the adjustment the amount of tax which should have been paid with respect to such interest. Similarly, the amount of the refund could not be increased by any amount attributable to the taxpayer's failure to deduct the $4,500 interest paid in the year 1949.

# Example 2.
Assume that a taxpayer included in his gross income for the year 1953 an item which should have been included in his gross income for the year 1952. After the expiration of the period of limitations upon the assessment of a deficiency or the allowance of a refund for 1952, the taxpayer filed a claim for refund for the year 1953 on the ground that such item was not properly includible in gross income for that year. The claim for refund was allowed by the Commissioner and as a result of such determination an adjustment was authorized under section 1311 with respect to the tax for 1952. If, in such case, the Commissioner issued a notice of deficiency for the amount of the adjustment and the taxpayer contested the deficiency before the Tax Court of the United States, the taxpayer could not in such proceeding claim an offset based upon his failure to take an allowable deduction for the year 1952; nor could the Tax Court in its decision offset against the amount of the adjustment any overpayment for the year 1952 resulting from the failure to take such deduction.
(c) If the Commissioner has refunded the amount of an adjustment under section 1311, the amount so refunded may not subsequently be recovered by the Commissioner in any suit for erroneous refund based upon any item other than the one that was the subject of the adjustment,

# Example:
In the example set forth in paragraph (e) of § 1.1314(a)-1, if the Commissioner had refunded the amount of the adjustment, no part of the amount so refunded could subsequently be recovered by the Commissioner by a suit for erroneous refund based on the ground that there was no overpayment for 1949, as the taxpayer had failed to include in gross income the $6,000 item of interest received in that year.
(d) If the Commissioner has assessed and collected the amount of an adjustment under section 1311, no part thereof may be recovered by the taxpayer in any suit for refund based upon any item other than the one that was the subject of the adjustment.

# Example:
In example (2) of paragraph (b) of this section, if the taxpayer had paid the amount of the adjustment, he could not subsequently recover any part of such payment in a suit for refund based upon the failure to take an allowable deduction for the year 1952.
(e) If the amount of the adjustment is considered an overpayment, it may be credited, under applicable law and regulations, together with any interest allowed thereon, against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the part of the person who made such overpayment. Likewise, if the amount of the adjustment is considered as a deficiency, any overpayment by the taxpayer of any internal revenue tax may be credited against the amount of such adjustment in accordance with the applicable law and regulations thereunder. (See section 6402 and the corresponding provisions of prior revenue
laws.) Accordingly, it may be possible in one transaction between the Commissioner and the taxpayer to settle the taxpayer's tax liability for the year with respect to which the determination is made and to make the adjustment under section 1311 for the year with respect to which the error was made or for a year which is affected, or treated as affected, by a net operating loss deduction or a capital loss carryover from the year of the error.

# Involuntary Liquidation and Replacement of Lifo Inventories
§ 1.1321-1
Involuntary liquidation of lifo inventories.
(a) Section 22(d)(6)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 provides as follows:
Sec. 22. Gross income. * * *
(d) * * *
(6)
Involuntary liquidation and replacement of inventory.
* * *
(B)
Definition of involuntary liquidation.
The term
involuntary liquidation,
as used in this paragraph, means the sale or other disposition of goods inventoried under the method described in this subsection, either voluntary or involuntary, coupled with a failure on the part of the taxpayer to purchase, manufacture, or otherwise produce and have on hand at the close of the taxable year in which such sale or other disposition occurred such goods as would, if on hand at the close of such taxable year, be subject to the application of the provisions of this subsection, if such failure on the part of the taxpayer is due, directly and exclusively, (i) to enemy capture or control of sources of limited foreign supply; (ii) to shipping or other transportation shortages; (iii) to material shortages resulting from priorities or allocations; (iv) to labor shortages; or (v) to other prevailing war conditions beyond the control of the taxpayer.
(b)(1) If, during any taxable year ending after June 30, 1950, and before January 1, 1955, the disruption of normal trade relations between countries, or one or more of the conditions attributable to a state of national preparedness and beyond the control of the taxpayer, as prescribed by section 22(d)(6)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as modified by section 1321(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, should render it impossible during such period for a taxpayer using the last-in first-out inventory method to have on hand at the close of the taxable year a stock of merchandise in kind and description like that included in the opening inventory for the year, or in a quantity equal to that of the opening inventory, the resulting inventory decrease for the year will be regarded, at the election of the taxpayer, as reflecting an involuntary liquidation subject to replacement. If the taxpayer notifies the Commissioner within the period prescribed below that he intends to effect a replacement of the liquidated stock, in whole or in part, and that he desires to have applied in his case the involuntary liquidation and replacement provisions of section 1321, and if he establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the involuntary character of the liquidation to which his stock has been subjected, effect shall be given, when replacement has been made, in whole or in part, but only to the extent made in taxable years ending before January 1, 1956, to an adjustment of taxable income for the year of liquidation in the amount of the difference between the replacement costs incurred and the original inventory cost of the liquidated base stock inventory that is replaced. The notification is to be given within 6 months after the filing by the taxpayer of his income tax return for the year of the liquidation. However, if the liquidation occurs in a taxable year ending after December 31, 1953, the notification may be given at any time within 3 months after the promulgation of regulations under section 1321, or prior to the expiration of the 6-month period following the filing of the return, whichever expiration date later occurs.
(2) If the replacement costs exceed such inventory costs, the taxable income of the taxpayer otherwise computed for the year of liquidation shall be reduced by an amount equal to such excess. If the replacement costs are less than the inventory costs, taxable income otherwise computed for the year of liquidation shall be increased to the extent of such difference. Any deficiency in the income or excess profits tax of the taxpayer, or any overpayment of such taxes, attributable to such adjustment shall be assessed and
collected or credited or refunded to the taxpayer without interest.
(c)(1) A failure on the part of the taxpayer to have on hand in his closing inventory for the taxable year merchandise of the kind, description, and quantity of that reflected in his opening inventory will be considered as an involuntary liquidation only if it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that such failure is due wholly to his inability to purchase, manufacture, or otherwise produce and procure delivery of such merchandise during the taxable year of liquidation by reason of the disruption of normal trade relations between countries or by reason of certain war conditions, described in section 22(d)(6)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as modified by section 1321(b). Such war conditions are (i) shortages in the source of foreign supply by reason of capture or control by an enemy; (ii) shipping or other transportation shortages; (iii) material shortages resulting from priorities or allocations; (iv) labor shortages; and (v) similar war conditions beyond the control of the taxpayer. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the words
enemy
and
war
shall be interpreted to apply to circumstances, occurrences, and conditions lacking a state of war, which are similar, by reason of a state of national preparedness, to those which would exist under a state of war.
(2) The various directives, orders, regulations, and allotments issued by the Federal Government in connection with national preparedness are among such circumstances and conditions which might be recognized as effecting an involuntary liquidation under this section. Likewise, a voluntary compliance with a request of an authorized representative of the Federal Government made upon an industry or an important segment thereof, or a voluntary allocation of materials by an industry or important segment thereof sanctioned by the Federal Government, if made in connection with the national preparedness program, might be considered as such a circumstance or condition. Similarly, so much of an inventory decrease as is directly and exclusively attributable to the Federal Government's stockpiling program for periods during which an item is not subject to allotment shall also be considered as subject to the provisions of section 1321. Thus, so much of an inventory decrease as is due wholly to the effect of directives, orders, regulations, or allotments issued pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2061
et seq.
), or to any other circumstance or condition which is solely dependent upon other action taken by the Federal Government in furtherance of the national preparedness program, ordinarily shall be considered as an involuntary liquidation under section 1321 and this section; however, to the extent that such a decrease is due to the disposition of goods acquired in violation of such directives, orders, regulations, or allotments, such decrease shall not be considered as such an involuntary liquidation. An inventory decrease due directly and exclusively to a disruption of normal trade relations between countries shall be considered as an involuntary liquidation subject to the rules and requirements prescribed in this section, including the requirement that the taxpayer establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the cause of the involuntary liquidation. A disruption of normal trade relations between countries may be reflected by unusual export limitations imposed by a foreign government, by unusual exchange restrictions, or by other unusual circumstances or conditions beyond the control of the taxpayer.
(3) A voluntary shift by the taxpayer, in the exercise of business judgment, to merchandise of a different character, description, or use, or to merchandise processed out of a substantially different kind of raw materials while raw materials of the type originally used are still available will not be considered as an involuntary liquidation notwithstanding the fact that such a shift in merchandise stocked was prompted by a shifting market demand attributable to the above conditions. The term
involuntary liquidation
presupposes a physical inability to maintain a normal inventory as distinguished from a financial or business disinclination on the part of the taxpayer to do so.
(d) If the taxpayer would have the involuntary liquidation and replacement provisions applicable with respect to any inventory decrease, he must so elect within the time prescribed by this section. In making such election, the taxpayer shall attach to his return and make a part thereof, or he shall furnish separately to the Commissioner, a statement setting forth the following matters:
(1) The desire of the taxpayer to invoke the involuntary liquidation and replacement provisions;
(2) A detailed list or other identifying description of the items of merchandise claimed to have been subjected to involuntary liquidation and the extent to which replacement is intended;
(3) The circumstances relied upon as rendering the taxpayer unable to maintain throughout the taxable year a normal inventory of the items involved, including evidence of the applicable inventory control figures for the beginning and the close of the taxable year submitted to the appropriate Federal agency in control of defense production (or if none, a statement to that effect), allotments applied for, allotments received, and reason for failure to place allotments received;
(4) Detailed proof of such circumstances to the extent that they may not be the subject-matter of common knowledge;
(5) A full description of what efforts were made on the part of the taxpayer to effect replacement during the taxable year and the result of such efforts; and
(6) In the case of an election made pursuant to an extension of time granted by the Commissioner, the circumstances relied upon as justifying the election at such time, together with a disclosure of the extent, if any, to which replacements have already been made.
(e) The election of the taxpayer to treat an involuntary decrease of inventory as subject to the replacement adjustments is to be exercised separately for each taxable year reflecting such a decrease and the election, once exercised with respect to a given year, shall be irrevocable with respect to the particular decrease involved and its replacement, and shall be binding for the year of liquidation, the year of replacement, and all prior, intervening, and subsequent years to the extent that such prior, intervening, and subsequent years are affected by the adjustments authorized. The ultimate replacement and the resulting adjustment for the year of liquidation may have consequences, among others, in the earnings and profits of intervening years and the inventory accounts of subsequent years. They may have consequences in the prior years by reason of adjustments in net operating loss or unused excess profits credit carrybacks, and in intervening and subsequent taxable years by reason of adjustments in carryovers. Adjustments are to be made for the several years affected consistent with the adjustments made for the year of liquidation. Detailed records shall be maintained such as will enable the Commissioner, in his examination of the taxpayer's return for the year of replacement, readily to verify the extent of the inventory decrease claimed to be involuntary in character and the facts upon which such claim is based, all subsequent inventory increases and decreases, and all other facts material to the replacement adjustment authorized. For taxable years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, an election under 26 CFR (1939) 39.22(d)-7(e) (Regulations 118) or 26 CFR (1939) 29.22(d)-7 (Regulations 111) to have the involuntary liquidation and replacement provisions of section 22(d)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 apply with respect to any inventory decrease for taxable years to which such section applies, shall be given the same effect as if such election had been made under this section. (See section 7807(b)(2).)
(f) Notwithstanding the ultimate purchase price or the cost of production ultimately incurred by the taxpayer in effecting replacement of a stock involuntarily liquidated, the merchandise reflecting the replacement shall be taken into purchases and included in the closing inventory for the year of replacement, and shall be included in the inventories of subsequent taxable years, at the inventory cost figure of the merchandise replaced.
(g) The goods reflected in any inventory increase in a year subsequent to a
year of involuntary liquidation, to the extent that they constitute items of the kind and description liquidated in prior years, whether or not in a year of involuntary liquidation, shall be deemed, in the order of their acquisition, as having been acquired by the taxpayer in replacement of like goods most recently liquidated and not previously replaced. In a case involving involuntary liquidations of goods of the same class subject to the provisions of both section 22(d)(6)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and section 1321 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the involuntary liquidations of such goods subject to the provisions of section 1321 shall, for the purpose of replacements made in taxable years ending before January 1, 1953, be considered as having occurred prior to the involuntary liquidations of such goods subject to the provisions of section 22(d)(6)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. To the extent that the items of increase are allocated to items liquidated voluntarily, no adjustment will be required or permitted. Such replacement merchandise will be carried in the inventory at its actual cost of acquisition. To the extent that replacements are allocated to items involuntarily liquidated, however, the provisions of this section shall apply, both with respect to adjustments for the year of liquidation and other taxable years affected and with respect to inventory computations for the year of replacement and all subsequent taxable years.
(h) In some cases it may appear that, at the time of the filing of the income tax return for the year of replacement, or within three years thereafter, an adjustment with respect to the income or excess profits taxes for the year of the involuntary liquidation, or for some prior, intervening, or subsequent taxable year, is prevented by the running of the statute of limitations, by the execution of a closing agreement, by virtue of a court decision which has become final, or by reason of some other provision or rule of law other than section 7122 (relating to compromises) and other than the inventory replacement provisions. The adjustments provided for in connection with the involuntary liquidation and replacement of inventory shall nevertheless be made, but only if, within a period of three years after the date of the filing of the income tax return for the year of replacement, a notice of deficiency is mailed or a claim for refund is filed. No credit or refund will be allowed under such circumstances, whether within or without such three-year period, in the absence of a claim for refund duly filed; nor will a resulting deficiency be assessed or collected under section 6213(d) relating to waivers of restrictions. The issuance of the statutory notice of deficiency or the filing of a claim for refund are statutory conditions upon which depend the provisions of section 22(d)(6)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, referred to in section 1321(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The adjustment authorized by section 22(d)(6)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is limited further to the tax attributable solely to the replacement adjustments. The amount of the adjustment shall be computed by reference to the amount of the tax previously determined, and without regard to factors affecting the taxable year involved to which no effect was given in such prior determination. The tax previously determined shall be ascertained in accordance with the principles stated in section 452(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Any deficiency paid or any overpayment credited or refunded under these circumstances shall not be subject to recovery on a claim for refund or a suit for the recovery of an erroneous refund in any case in which such claim or suit is based upon factors other than those giving rise to the adjustments made.

# War Loss Recoveries
§ 1.1331-1
Recoveries in respect of war losses.
(a)(1) The amount of any recovery in respect of
war loss property
must be included in gross income to the extent provided in section 1332 unless, pursuant to the taxpayer's election under section 1335, the provisions of section 1333 are applicable to such recovery. For the treatment of war loss recoveries under section 1333 and the manner of making the election under section 1335, see §§ 1.1333-1 and 1.1335-1.
(2) As used in this part, the term
war loss property
means property considered under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 as
destroyed or seized,
including any interest described in section 127(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
(3) For regulations governing the treatment of war losses under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, see 26 CFR (1939) 29.127(a)-1 to 29.127(a)-4, inclusive, 29.127(b)-1, and 29.127(e)-1 (Regulations 111) and 26 CFR (1939) 39.127(a)-1 (Regulations 118).
(b) The recoveries in respect of any war loss property include the recovery of the same war loss property and the recovery of any money or property in lieu of such property or on account of the destruction or seizure of such property. For example, there is a recovery upon the return to the taxpayer after the termination of the war of his property which was treated as war loss property because it was located in a country at war with the United States. An award by a government on account of the seizure of the taxpayer's property by an enemy country is a recovery under this section. The amount obtained upon the sale or other transfer by the taxpayer of his right to any war loss property is also a recovery for the purpose of this section. Similarly, if a taxpayer who sustained a war loss upon the liquidation of a corporation has received the rights to any property of the corporation which was treated as war loss property, any recovery by the taxpayer with respect to such rights is a recovery by him for the purposes of this section.
(c) For the purpose of this section, the recoveries considered are only those with respect to war losses sustained in prior taxable years. Similarly, the only deductions considered are those allowable for prior taxable years, and any allowable deductions for the year of the recovery are ignored for the purposes of applying such section to the recovery.
(d) If a deduction was claimed under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 by a taxpayer in computing his tax for any taxable year and if such deduction was disallowed in whole or in part, any recovery in respect of the portion disallowed shall not be subject to the provisions of part IV (section 1331 and following), subchapter Q, chapter 1 of the Code.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12042, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1332-1
Inclusion in gross income of war loss recoveries.
(a)
Amount of recovery.
Except as provided in section 1333(1), the amount of the recovery in respect of a war loss in a previous taxable year is determined in the same manner for the purpose of either section 1332 or 1333. The amount of the recovery of any money or property in respect of any war loss is the aggregate of the amount of such money and of the fair market value of such property, both determined as of the date of the recovery. But see paragraph (a) of § 1.1333-1 for optional valuation where the taxpayer recovers the same war loss property.
(b)
Amount of gain includible.
(1) A taxpayer who has sustained a war loss described in section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and who has not elected to have the provisions of section 1333 apply to any taxable year in which he recovered any money or property in respect of a war loss in any previous taxable year must include in his gross income for each taxable year, to the extent provided in section 1332, the amount of his recoveries of money and property for such taxable year in respect of any war loss in a previous taxable year. Section 1332 provides that such recoveries for any taxable year are not includible in income until the taxpayer has recovered an amount equal to his allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of such war losses which did not result in a reduction of any tax under chapter 1 or 2
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. War loss recoveries are considered as made first on account of war losses allowable but not actually allowed as a deduction, and second on account of war losses allowed as a deduction but which did not result in a reduction of tax under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. If there were deductions allowed on account of war losses for two or more taxable years which did not result in a reduction of any tax under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, a recovery on account of such losses is considered as made on account of such losses in the order of the taxable years for which they were allowed beginning with the latest. See § 1.1337-1 for the determination of the amount of such deductions. Recoveries in excess of such amount are treated as ordinary income until such excess equals the amount of the taxpayer's allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of war losses which did result in a reduction of any such tax under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Any further recoveries in excess of all the taxpayer's allowable deductions in prior taxable years for war losses are treated as gain on an involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure, and such gain is recognized or not recognized under the provisions of section 1033. See section 1033 and the regulations thereunder. Such gain, if recognized, is included in gross income as ordinary income unless section 1231(a) applies to cause such gain to be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than six months. See section 1231(a) and the regulations thereunder.
(2) The determination as to whether and to what extent any recoveries are to be included in gross income is made upon the basis of the amount of all the recoveries for each day upon which there are any such recoveries, as follows:
(i) The amount of the recoveries for any day is not included in gross income, and is not considered gain on an involuntary conversion, to the extent, if any, that the aggregate of the allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of war losses which did not result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as determined under § 1.1337-1, exceeds the amount of all previous recoveries in the same and prior taxable years.
(ii) The amount of the recoveries for any day which is not excluded from gross income under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is included in gross income as ordinary income, and is not considered gain on an involuntary conversion, to the extent, if any, that the aggregate of all the allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of war losses (both those which resulted in a reduction of a tax of the taxpayer and those which did not) exceeds the sum of the amount of all previous recoveries in the same and prior taxable years and of that portion, if any, of the amount of the recoveries for such day which is not included in gross income under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(iii) The amount of the recoveries for any day which is not excluded from gross income under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and is not included in gross income as ordinary income under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is considered gain on an involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure. The following provisions then apply to this gain:
(
a
) Such gain is recognized or not recognized under the provisions of section 1033, relating to gain on the involuntary conversion of property. For the purpose of applying section 1033, such gain for any day is deemed to be expended in the manner provided in section 1033 to the extent the recovery for such day is so expended.
(
b
) If such gain is recognized, it is included in gross income as ordinary income or, if the provisions of section 1231(a) apply and require such treatment, as gain on the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than six months. For the purpose of applying section 1231(a), such recognized gain for any day is deemed to be derived from property described in that section to the extent of the recovery for such day with respect to such property, except such portion of such recovery as is attributable to the nonrecognized gain for such day.
(
c
) Section 1336 provides that in determining the unadjusted basis of recovered property, the total gain and the recognized gain with respect to such property must be determined. For such purpose, the recognized gain deemed to be derived from properties described in section 1231(a) may be allocated among such properties in the proportion of the recoveries with respect to such properties, reduced for each property by the portion of the recovery attributable to the nonrecognized gain for such day, and the recoveries with respect to properties not described in section 1231(a) may be similarly allocated. The total gain derived from any recovered property is the sum of the nonrecognized gain attributable to the recovery of such property and of the recognized gain allocable to such property.
(3) The foregoing provisions may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The taxpayer sustained war losses of $3,000 on account of properties A, B, C, and D. Of this amount, $1,000 did not result in a reduction of any income tax of the taxpayer, as determined under the provisions of § 1.1337-1. In a subsequent taxable year, he received an award of $800 from the Government on account of property A. This is not included in income since it is less than the amount by which his allowable deductions for prior taxable years on account of war losses which did not result in any tax benefit ($1,000) exceed $0, the sum of all his previous recoveries. On a later date the taxpayer recovers property B, which is worth $1,500 on the date of recovery. This recovery is not included in gross income to the extent of $200, the amount by which the aggregate of the allowable deductions for prior taxable years on account of war losses which did not result in any tax benefit ($1,000) exceeds the sum of all previous recoveries ($800). The remaining $1,300 of the recovery is included in gross income as ordinary income, and is not considered gain on the involuntary conversion of property, since it is less than the amount by which the aggregate of all the allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of war losses ($3,000) exceeds $1,000, the sum of the $800 of previous recoveries and of the $200 portion of the recovery with respect to B which is not included in gross income. On a still later date the taxpayer sells for $2,500 his rights to recover C. Since the allowable deductions for prior taxable years on account of war losses which did not result in any tax benefit ($1,000) do not exceed the previous recoveries by the taxpayer ($800 and $1,500, or $2,300), none of the recovery on account of C is excluded from gross income. This recovery is included in gross income as ordinary income, and is not considered gain on the involuntary conversion of property, to the extent of $700, the amount by which the aggregate of all the allowable deductions for prior taxable years on account of war losses ($3,000) exceeds $2,300, the sum of the $2,300 of previous recoveries and of the $0 portion of the recovery on account of C which is not included in gross income. The remaining $1,800 of the recovery is considered gain on an involuntary conversion of property on account of its destruction or seizure, and is not recognized if forthwith expended in the manner provided in section 1033. Thus, it is not recognized if it is forthwith expended for the acquisition of property related in service or use to C. On a later date the taxpayer recovers D, which has a fair market value of $400 at the time of the recovery. Since the aggregate of all the allowable deductions for prior taxable years on account of war losses ($3,000) does not exceed the previous recoveries by the taxpayer ($800 + $1,500 + $2,500, or $4,800), all of the recovery with respect to D is considered gain on an involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure. Under the provisions of section 1033, this gain is not recognized if D is used for the same purposes for which it was used before it was deemed destroyed or seized under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

# Example 2.
The taxpayer on one day recovers $3,000 for property A and $7,000 for property B, both of which were treated as war loss property for a prior taxable year, and $8,000 of such $10,000 recoveries is considered gain on the involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure. The taxpayer forthwith expends $5,000 in the acquisition of property similar in use to B. Therefore, $5,000 of the $8,000 gain is not recognized under section 1033, leaving $3,000 of recognized gain. Property B is within the provisions of section 1231(a), relating to gains and losses on the involuntary conversion of certain described property, but property A is not. Therefore, the provisions of section 1231(a) apply to $2,000 of the $3,000 gain, that is, the amount of the recovery with respect to B which is not attributable to the nonrecognized gain for such day ($7,000 minus $5,000). If the taxpayer forthwith expended $8,000 or more for the acquisition of property similar in use to B, none of the gain would be recognized. If the taxpayer forthwith expended the $5,000 to acquire property related in use to A, the $3,000 recognized gain would be considered derived from B to the extent of the recovery with respect to B ($7,000), not reduced by any nonrecognized gain since none of such recovery is attributable to such nonrecognized gain, and therefore all of the $3,000 recognized gain
would be subject to the provisions of section 1231(a).
(4) An allowable deduction with respect to a war loss is any deduction to which the taxpayer is entitled on account of any war loss property, regardless of whether or not such deduction was claimed by the taxpayer or otherwise allowed in computing his tax. If a deduction was claimed by a taxpayer in computing his tax for any taxable year and if such deduction was disallowed, such deduction will not be considered an allowable deduction for such taxable year since the previous determination will not be reconsidered.

§ 1.1333-1
Tax adjustment measured by prior benefits.
(a)
Amount of recovery.
The amount of recovery for purposes of this section shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1332(a). See paragraph (a) of § 1.1332-1. If, pursuant to the taxpayer's election under section 1335, the provisions of section 1333 are applicable to any taxable year in which he recovers the same war loss property, the fair market value of such property shall, at the option of the taxpayer, be considered an amount equal to the adjusted basis (for determining loss) of such property in the hands of the taxpayer on the date such property was considered as destroyed or seized. This option is exercisable by the taxpayer with respect to each separate war loss property. Also, if the provisions of section 1333 are applicable pursuant to the taxpayer's election, the amount of the recovery of any money or property in respect of war loss property shall be reduced for the purpose of section 1333 (2) and (3) by the amount of the obligations or liabilities with respect to such property, if the taxpayer for any previous taxable year chose under section 127(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 to treat such obligations or liabilities as discharged or satisfied out of such property, and such obligations or liabilities were not so discharged or satisfied before the date of the recovery. See 26 CFR (1939) 29.127(b)-1 (Regulations 111).
(b)
Elective method; tax adjustment measured by prior benefits.
(1) If the taxpayer elects pursuant to section 1335 and in accordance with the provisions of § 1.1335-1 to have the provisions of section 1333 apply to any taxable year in which he recovers any money or property in respect of war loss property, the amount of the recovery in respect of such property for any taxable year shall not be included in income until the taxpayer has recovered an amount equal to his allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of the destruction or seizure of such property, whether or not such allowable deductions resulted in a reduction of any tax under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. However, for the purposes of section 6012(a)(1), relating to the requirement of individual returns, section 6012(a)(2), relating to the requirement of corporation returns, and section 1312, relating to the mitigation of the effect of the statute of limitations, the entire amount of the recovery shall be deemed to be an item includible in gross income for the taxable year in which the recovery is made. In lieu of including such amount in gross income, there shall be added to, and assessed and collected as a part of, the tax imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the taxable year of the recovery an adjustment on account of any tax benefits in all prior taxable years resulting directly or indirectly from the fact that the loss from the destruction or seizure of such property was an allowable deduction. The amount of such adjustment shall be the total increase in the tax under chapters 1 and 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for all taxable years which would result by decreasing such allowable deductions with respect to the destruction or seizure of such property by an amount equal to that portion of the amount of the recovery which is not included in gross income for the taxable year of the recovery. The portion of the amount of the recovery which is in excess of such allowable deductions is included in gross income for the taxable year of the recovery as gain on the involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure and is recognized or not recognized as provided in section
1033. See section 1033 and the regulations thereunder. Such gain, if recognized, is included in gross income as ordinary income unless section 1231(a) applies to cause such gain to be treated as gain on the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than six months. See section 1231(a) and the regulations thereunder.
(2) The determination as to whether and to what extent the amount of the recovery is to be excluded from gross income is to be made upon the basis of the total amount of the recoveries in each taxable year in respect of the same war loss property, as follows:
(i) The amount of the recovery in any taxable year is excluded from the gross income of such year and is not considered gain on an involuntary conversion to the extent that such amount does not exceed the aggregate of the allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of the destruction or seizure of such property (whether or not such deductions resulted in a reduction of a tax of the taxpayer) reduced by the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property.
(ii) The amount of the recovery in any taxable year which is not excluded from gross income under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is included in gross income and is considered gain on an involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure. The following provisions apply to this gain:
(
a
) Such gain is recognized or not recognized under the provisions of section 1033, relating to gain on the involuntary conversion of property. For the purpose of applying section 1033, such gain for any taxable year is deemed to be expended in the manner provided in section 1033 to the extent the recovery in such taxable year is so expended.
(
b
) If such gain is recognized it is included in gross income as ordinary income or, if the provisions of section 1231(a) apply and require such treatment, as gain on the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than six months. In the case of the recovery of the same war loss property, any gain will not be deemed to be recognized under the provisions of section 1231(a) if such property is used for the same purpose for which it was used before it was deemed destroyed or seized under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
(3) The determination of the total increase in the tax under chapters 1 and 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for all taxable years which would result by decreasing the deductions allowable in any prior taxable year with respect to the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which the taxpayer has made a recovery by an amount equal to the part of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery shall be made as provided in this subparagraph. Such total increase shall include the increases described in subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this subparagraph, and shall be added to, and assessed and collected as a part of, the tax under subtitle A for the taxable year of the recovery. Proper adjustment of such increases shall be made on account of the application of the provisions of this subparagraph to intervening taxable years. Proper adjustment shall also be made in the determination of such increases in the case of a taxpayer who has made a valid election under section 1020, relating to the adjustment of basis of property for depreciation, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion. The term
tax previously determined
as used in this subparagraph shall have the same meaning as used in section 1314(a) and shall include any tax under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In computing the amount of the increase in the tax previously determined under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for any taxable year, the principles of section 1314(a) shall be applicable. See section 1314(a) and the regulations thereunder. However, the computation of the excess profits credit under chapter 2E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for any taxable year shall not be affected by the adjustment provided in this subparagraph. All credits allowable against the tax for any year shall be taken into account in computing the increase in the tax previously determined. The increases referred to above include the following:
(i) The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for each prior taxable year in which a deduction was allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by disregarding such allowable deduction (to the extent that it does not exceed the sum of the amount of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures or accruals in such prior taxable year in respect of which, and to the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or section 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or section 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed will be the increase in the tax previously determined for the taxable year.
(ii) The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for any taxable year (including the taxable year of the recovery) in which a net operating loss deduction was allowable, if all or a part of such deduction was attributable to the carryover or carryback to such taxable year of a net operating loss from another taxable year in which a deduction was allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by redetermining such net operating loss deduction. In the determination of such net operating loss deduction the net operating loss shall be recomputed by disregarding the deduction allowable on account of the war loss in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added (to the extent that such deduction does not exceed the sum of the amount of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and by disregarding any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures, or accruals in the taxable year in respect of which, and to the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed will be the increase in the tax previously determined for the taxable year.
(iii) The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for any taxable year (including the taxable year of recovery) in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment for such taxable year, if all or a part of such adjustment was attributable to the carryover or carryback to such taxable year of an unused excess profits credit from another taxable year in which a deduction was allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by redetermining such unused excess profits credit carryover or carryback. In the recomputation such carryover or carryback shall be redetermined by disregarding such allowable war loss deduction (to the extent such deduction does not exceed the sum of the amount of the recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and by disregarding any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures, or accruals in the taxable year in respect of which, and to
the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed will be the increase in the tax previously determined for the taxable year. In case there is an increase in the excess profits tax under chapter 2E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for the taxable year in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment, and a decrease in the income tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for such taxable year, the increase in the tax previously determined shall be considered to be an amount equal to the excess of the increase in the excess profits tax over the decrease in the income tax.
(iv) The increase, if any, in the tax previously determined for any taxable year (including the taxable year of the recovery) in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment for such taxable year, if all or a part of such adjustment was attributable to the carryover or carryback to such taxable year of an unused excess profits credit from another taxable year in which there was allowable a net operating loss deduction attributable to the carryover or carryback to such other taxable year of a net operating loss, and such net operating loss resulted in whole or in part from the deduction allowable on account of the destruction or seizure of the property in respect of which there is a recovery in the taxable year to which such increase is to be added. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, such tax shall be recomputed by redetermining such net operating loss deduction and such unused excess profits credit carryover or carryback. In the redetermination of such net operating loss deduction the net operating loss carryover or carryback shall be recomputed by disregarding such allowable war loss deduction (to the extent that such deduction does not exceed the sum of the amount of such recovery not included in gross income for the taxable year of such recovery, plus the aggregate amount of any recoveries in intervening taxable years in respect of the same property) and by disregarding any other deductions allowable on account of other war losses or any other losses, expenditures, or accruals in the taxable year in respect of which, and to the extent that, recoveries in intervening taxable years have been excluded from gross income under section 127(c)(3) or 22(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or section 1333 or 111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or otherwise. The unused excess profits credit carryover or carryback shall then be recomputed to conform to the redetermination of the net operating loss deduction for the taxable year from which the unused credit is carried over or carried back. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed shall be the amount of the increase which shall be added to the tax for the taxable year of the recovery. In case there is an increase in the excess profits tax under chapter 2E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for the taxable year in which an unused excess profits credit was availed of in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment, and a decrease in the income tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for such taxable year, the increase which shall be added to the tax for the taxable year of the recovery shall be considered to be an amount equal to the excess of the increase in the excess profits tax over the decrease in the income tax.

§ 1.1334-1
Restoration of value of investments.
If any interest of the taxpayer in or with respect to property was determined to be worthless and was treated as a war loss under section 127(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (see 26 CFR (1939) 29.127(a)-4) (Regulations 111), or if the taxpayer retained an interest in a corporation with respect to which he sustained a war loss under section 127(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and if the interest in the hands of the taxpayer is restored in
value, in whole or in part, by reason of a recovery with respect to the underlying assets treated as war loss property, then such restoration in value is a recovery by the taxpayer for the purposes of section 1331. In the application of section 1333, such restoration shall be treated as a recovery of the same interest considered as destroyed or seized. War loss property is considered as not being in existence from the date of the loss to the date of its recovery.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12046, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1335-1
Elective method; time and manner of making election and effect thereof.
(a)
In general.
If the taxpayer elects to have the provisions of section 1333 applicable to any taxable year in which any money or property is recovered in respect of war loss property, section 1333 will be applicable by virtue of that election to all taxable years of the taxpayer beginning after December 31, 1941. Thus, the taxpayer need not make an election with respect to each separate taxable year in which he had a recovery. An election for any taxable year in which the taxpayer had a recovery in respect of a prior war loss is sufficient to make the provisions of section 1333 applicable not only to war loss recoveries received by the taxpayer in any past taxable year beginning after December 31, 1941, but to any recoveries which may be received by the taxpayer in any future taxable year. Such election once made shall be irrevocable. The election to have the provisions of section 1333 applicable to any taxable year cannot be made unless the taxpayer recovers money or property (in respect of a prior war loss) during the taxable year for which such election is made.
(b)
Manner of election.
In all cases the election to have the provisions of section 1333 apply must be made by the taxpayer not later than six months from the last day prescribed by law for the filing of his income tax return for any taxable year in which a recovery of war loss property has occurred. The election shall be evidenced by a written statement, made within such 6-month period, that the taxpayer elects to have the provisions of section 1333 apply to any taxable year in which any money or property is recovered in respect of war loss property. The statement may be made in (or attached to):
(1) The return or amended return filed for such taxable year;
(2) A claim for refund or credit filed for such taxable year for an overpayment resulting from application of such provisions;
(3) A timely petition or amended petition to The Tax Court of the United States for a redetermination of any deficiency for any taxable year in which a recovery of war loss property occurred; or
(4) A letter addressed to the district director for the district in which the return for such taxable year was required to be filed.
If the written statement of election is made in a letter, it shall be signed by the taxpayer making the election if an individual or, if the taxpayer is not an individual, the letter must be executed in the same manner as required in the case of the income tax return of such taxpayer. The date of the making of the election shall be the date the return, amended return, claim for refund or credit, or letter is filed in the office of the district director, or the date the petition or amended petition is filed with The Tax Court of the United States. In case the election is made in a return filed before the last day prescribed by law for the filing thereof (including any extension of time for such filing), such election shall not be considered made until such last day. See section 7502 and the regulations thereunder with respect to the timeliness of filing an election where filing is done by mail and section 7503 and the regulations thereunder with respect to the timeliness of filing where the last day for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
(c)
Effect of election.
(1) If the provisions of section 1333 are applicable to any taxable year pursuant to an election made by the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the period of limitations provided in chapter 66 of the Code on the making of assessments and the beginning of distraint or a proceeding in court for collection with respect to (i) the amount to be added to the tax
for such taxable year under the provisions of section 1333 and (ii) any deficiency for such taxable year or for any other taxable year to the extent attributable to the basis of the recovered property being determined under the provisions of section 1336(b), shall not expire prior to the expiration of two years following the date of the making of such election. Such amount or such deficiency may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of such period, notwithstanding any law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment and collection.
(2) If the provisions of section 1333 are applicable to any taxable year pursuant to an election made by the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, and refund or credit of any overpayment resulting from the application of such provisions to such taxable year is prevented on the date of the making of such election, or within one year from such date, by the operation of any law or rule of law (other than section 7122 relating to compromises), refund or credit of such overpayment may nevertheless be made or allowed, provided claim therefor is filed within one year from such date. Thus, the amount of such overpayment which may be refunded or credited is not subject to the limitations contained in section 6511 or 6512(b).
(3) In the case of any taxable year ending before the date of the making by the taxpayer of an election under section 1335, no interest shall be paid on any overpayment specified in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for any period before the expiration of six months following the date of the making of such election by the taxpayer, and no interest shall be assessed or collected with respect to any amount or any deficiency specified in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for any period before the expiration of six months following the date of the making of such election by the taxpayer.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12047, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1336-1
Basis of recovered property.
(a)
General rule.
(1) Under section 1336(a), the unadjusted basis of any war loss property which is recovered and the unadjusted basis of any property which is recovered in lieu of or on account of any such war loss property is considered the fair market value of such recovered property upon the date of its recovery with the following adjustments:
(i) If the sum of the recoveries for the day such property is recovered and of all previous recoveries exceeds the aggregate of the allowable deductions for prior taxable years on account of war losses, so that a portion of the recoveries for such day is treated as gain on the involuntary conversion of property, such fair market value of the property is reduced by the total gain, if any, for such day derived from such recovered property as determined under paragraph (b) of § 1.1332-1.
(ii) Such fair market value, as reduced under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, is increased by the portion, if any, of the recognized gain resulting from the recoveries for such day which is allocable to such recovered property, as determined under paragraph (b) of § 1.1332-1.
In effect, the unadjusted basis of such property is its fair market value upon the date of its recovery, reduced by the amount of nonrecognized gain attributable to such recovery under the provisions of paragraph (b) of § 1.1332-1.
(2) If the respective bases of several properties of a taxpayer determined under section 1336(a) are greatly disproportionate to their adjusted bases immediately before their treatment as war loss properties, the taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner for the allocation of the aggregate of the bases of such properties among them in the proportion of their adjusted bases immediately before the destruction or seizure of such properties determined under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The amount so allocated to any such property, in an application approved by the Commissioner, shall be the unadjusted basis of such property in lieu of the amount determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(3) The application to the Commissioner shall set forth a list of all the properties of the taxpayer having an unadjusted basis determined under this section, a description of each such property together with a statement as
to the amount of its adjusted basis immediately before the destruction or seizure of such property determined under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and a statement as to whether there has been any substantial change in the use or nature of the property chosen for the allocation from its nature or use immediately before the time it was treated as destroyed or seized. Such application will be allowed unless there has been such a substantial change in the nature or use of such property that the allocation of the bases would produce an arbitrary result, or unless the taxpayer has obtained such tax benefits by reason of the basis determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, that it would be inequitable to change his basis. Thus, the allocation will not be allowed if it would give the taxpayer an unadjusted basis with respect to any property which is less than the amount of the adjustments in reduction of the basis of such property which are allowable after its recovery. For example, when property A is recovered it has an unadjusted basis of $100. After $70 depreciation has been allowed on A, an allocation is sought which would give A an unadjusted basis of $60. Since this is less than the depreciation which is an adjustment against such basis, the allocation will not be permitted.
(4) The amount of any adjustments to the unadjusted basis determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall, upon the allocation of the bases, be taken as an adjustment to the allocated unadjusted basis. Thus, if $30 depreciation was allowed upon a $100 basis determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and if the unadjusted basis upon allocation is $75, such $30 depreciation is allowed against such allocated unadjusted basis, so that the adjusted basis of the property is then $45.
(5) The taxpayer may choose any group of recovered properties for allocation, except that if any such recovered properties form one economic unit, such properties may not be separated but all or none must be included in the group. For example, a building may not be separated from the land on which it stands if both are recovered property, nor may one block of stock in a corporation be separated from other stock in such corporation or from bonds in such corporation which are also treated as a recovery. If the taxpayer has once been permitted to allocate the bases of any group of properties, he may obtain another allocation with respect to such properties only if all the properties in the original group are included together with other recovered properties not included in the original group. For example, if the bases of properties A and B are allocated, a second allocation will be made for properties A, B, and C, but not for A and C or B and C.
(b)
Property recovered in taxable year to which section 1333 is applicable.
If, pursuant to an election made by the taxpayer under section 1335 and paragraph (a) of § 1.1335-1, the provisions of section 1333 are applicable to any taxable year in which the taxpayer recovered property in respect of a war loss under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the unadjusted basis of such property shall be the fair market value of such property determined as of the date of the recovery, reduced by the amount of nonrecognized gain attributable to such recovery under the provisions of paragraph (b) of § 1.1333-1. However, if the property recovered is the same war loss property, and if the taxpayer under section 1333(1) includes such property in the amount of the recovery at its adjusted basis (for determining loss) in his hands on the date such property was considered under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 as destroyed or seized, the unadjusted basis of such property shall be such adjusted basis, reduced by the amount of nonrecognized gain attributable to such recovery under the provisions of paragraph (b) of § 1.1333-1. The fair market value of any property recovered, or the adjusted basis for determining loss) of such property if the same property treated as war loss property is recovered, shall not be reduced in determining the unadjusted basis of such property by the amount of the obligations or liabilities with respect to such property in respect of which the recovery was received, if the taxpayer for any previous taxable year chose under
section 127(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 to treat such obligations or liabilities as discharged or satisfied out of such property but such obligations or liabilities were not so discharged or satisfied prior to the date of the recovery.

§ 1.1337-1
Determination of tax benefits from allowable deductions.
(a) That part of the aggregate of the deductions allowed a taxpayer for any taxable year on account of war losses under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 which, if disallowed, would not result in an increase in the normal tax, surtax (including the tax imposed by section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), or victory tax of taxpayer, or of any tax imposed in lieu of such taxes or of any tax imposed by chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, for the taxable year in which such deductions are allowed or in any other taxable year, such as a taxable year in which the taxpayer's income tax is computed by reference to a carryover or carryback of net operating losses from the taxable year in which such deductions are allowed, is considered, for the purposes of section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 an allowable deduction for the taxable year which did not result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In the case of recoveries of war losses and other items to which the recovery exclusion provisions of section 111 apply, such as bad debts, the determination of the tax benefit should be made in accordance with section 111(b) and the regulations thereunder. The deductions allowed a taxpayer for any taxable year on account of war losses are all the deductions on account of war losses which were claimed by the taxpayer in a return, in a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment, or in a petition to The Tax Court of the United States with respect to such taxable year and which were not disallowed, and all deductions on account of war losses which, although not so claimed by the taxpayer, were nevertheless allowed (for example, by the Commissioner, a court, or The Tax Court) in computing a tax of the taxpayer.
(b) Any deduction allowable for a taxable year on account of a war loss under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 which was not claimed by the taxpayer for such year in a return, a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment, or a petition to the Tax Court of the United States and was not allowed as a deduction (for example, by the Commissioner, a court, or the Tax Court) in computing his tax for such year or for any other year is considered a deduction which did not result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, since it is an allowable deduction which was not allowed in computing any tax of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer claimed for any taxable year a deduction on account of a war loss, and if such deduction was disallowed, the taxpayer may not subsequently contend for the purposes of section 1331 that such deduction was an allowable deduction for such taxable year.
(c) If the taxpayer elected under section 127(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 to decrease the amount of a war loss by treating the obligations and liabilities described in that section as discharged or satisfied out of the property destroyed or seized, and if the taxpayer establishes that any of the obligations and liabilities were not so discharged or satisfied, then the amount by which such continuing obligations and liabilities decreased the war loss shall be considered an allowable deduction for the taxable year in which the war loss was sustained which did not result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

# Claim of Right
§ 1.1341-1
Restoration of amounts received or accrued under claim of right.
(a)
In general.
(1) If, during the taxable year, the taxpayer is entitled under other provisions of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to a deduction of more than $3,000 because of the restoration to another of an
item which was included in the taxpayer's gross income for a prior taxable year (or years) under a claim of right, the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the taxable year shall be the tax provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) For the purpose of this section
income included under a claim of right
means an item included in gross income because it appeared from all the facts available in the year of inclusion that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item, and
restoration to another
means a restoration resulting because it was established after the close of such prior taxable year (or years) that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to such item (or portion thereof).
(3) For purposes of determining whether the amount of a deduction described in section 1341(a)(2) exceeds $3,000 for the taxable year, there shall be taken into account the aggregate of all such deductions with respect to each item of income (described in section 1341(a)(1)) of the same class.
(b)
Determination of tax.
(1) Under the circumstances described in paragraph (a) of this section, the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the taxable year shall be the lesser of:
(i) The tax for the taxable year computed under section 1341(a)(4), that is, with the deduction taken into account, or
(ii) The tax for the taxable year computed under section 1341(a)(5), that is, without taking such deduction into account, minus the decrease in tax (net of any increase in tax imposed by section 56, relating to the minimum tax for tax preferences) (under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, under chapter 1 (other than subchapter E) and subchapter E of chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or under the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws) for the prior taxable year (or years) which would result solely from the exclusion from gross income of all or that portion of the income included under a claim of right to which the deduction is attributable. For the purpose of this subdivision, the amount of the decrease in tax is not limited to the amount of the tax for the taxable year. See paragraph (i) of this section where the decrease in tax for the prior taxable year (or years) exceeds the tax for the taxable year.
(iii) For purposes of computing, under section 1341(a)(4) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the tax for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1961, if the deduction of the amount of the restoration results in a net operating loss for the taxable year of restoration, such net operating loss shall, pursuant to section 1341(b)(4)(A), be carried back to the same extent and in the same manner as is provided under section 172 (relating to the net operating loss deduction) and the regulations thereunder. If the aggregate decrease in tax for the taxable year (or years) to which such net operating loss is carried back is greater than the excess of:
(
a
) The amount of decrease in tax for a prior taxable year (or years) computed under section 1341(a)(5)(B), over
(
b
) The tax for the taxable year computed under section 1341(a)(5)(A),
The tax imposed for the taxable year under chapter 1 shall be the tax determined under section 1341(a)(4) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. If the tax imposed for the taxable year is determined under section 1341(a)(4) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the decrease in tax for the taxable year (or years) to which the net operating loss is carried back shall be an overpayment of tax for the taxable year (or years) to which the net operating loss is carried back and shall be refunded or credited as an overpayment for such taxable year (or years). See section 6511(d)(2), relating to special period of limitation with respect to net operating loss carrybacks.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in section 1341(b)(4)(B) and paragraph (d) (1)(ii) and (4)(ii) of this section, if the taxpayer computes his tax for the taxable year under the provisions of section 1341(a)(5) and subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the amount of the restoration shall not be taken into account in computing taxable income or loss for the taxable year, including the computation of any net operating loss carryback or carryover or any capital loss carryover. However, the amount of
such restoration shall be taken into account in adjusting earnings and profits for the current taxable year.
(3) If the tax determined under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph is the same as the tax determined under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the tax imposed for the taxable year under chapter 1 shall be the tax determined under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, and section 1341 and this section shall not otherwise apply.
(4) After it has been determined whether the tax imposed for a taxable year of restoration beginning after December 31, 1961, shall be computed under the provisions of section 1341(a)(4) or under the provisions of section 1341(a)(5), the net operating loss, if any, which remains after the application of section 1341(b)(4)(A) or the net operating loss or capital loss, if any, which remains after the application of section 1341(b)(4)(B) shall be taken into account in accordance with the following rules:
(i) If it is determined that section 1341(a)(4) and subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph apply, then that portion, if any, of the net operating loss for the taxable year which remains after the application of section 1341(b)(4)(A) and subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph shall be taken into account under section 172 for taxable years subsequent to the taxable year of restoration to the same extent and in the same manner as a net operating loss sustained in such taxable year of restoration. Thus, if the net operating loss for the taxable year of restoration (computed with the deduction referred to in section 1341(a)(4)) exceeds the taxable income (computed with the modifications prescribed in section 172) for the taxable year (or years) to which it is carried back, such excess shall be available as a carryover to taxable years subsequent to the taxable year of restoration.
(ii) If it is determined that section 1341(a)(5) and subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph apply, then that portion, if any, of a net operating loss or capital loss which remains after the application of section 1341(b)(4)(B) and paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall be taken into account under section 172 or 1212, as the case may be, for taxable years subsequent to the taxable year of restoration to the same extent and in the same manner as a net operating loss or capital loss sustained in the prior taxable year (or years). For example, if the net operating loss for the prior taxable year (computed with the exclusion referred to in section 1341(a)(5)(B)) exceeds the taxable income (computed with the modifications prescribed in section 172) for prior taxable years to which such net operating loss is carried back or carried over (including for this purpose the taxable year of restoration), such excess shall be available as a carryover to taxable years subsequent to the taxable year of restoration in accordance with the rules prescribed in section 172 which are applicable to such prior taxable year (or years).
(c)
Application to deductions which are capital in nature.
Section 1341 and this section shall also apply to a deduction which is capital in nature otherwise allowable in the taxable year. If the deduction otherwise allowable is capital in nature, the determination of whether the taxpayer is entitled to the benefits of section 1341 and this section shall be made without regard to the net capital loss limitation imposed by section 1211. For example, if a taxpayer restores $4,000 in the taxable year and such amount is a long-term capital loss, the taxpayer will, nevertheless, be considered to have met the $3,000 deduction requirement for purposes of applying this section, although the full amount of the loss might not be allowable as a deduction for the taxable year. However, if the tax for the taxable year is computed with the deduction taken into account, the deduction allowable will be subject to the limitation on capital losses provided in section 1211, and the capital loss carryover provided in section 1212.
(d)
Determination of decrease in tax for prior taxable years
—(1)
Prior taxable years.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the prior taxable year (or years) referred to in paragraph (b) of this section is the year (or years) in which the item to which the deduction is attributable was included in gross income under a claim of right and, in addition, any other prior taxable year (or years)
the tax for which will be affected by the exclusion from gross income in such prior taxable year (or years) of such income.
(ii) For purposes of applying section 1341(b)(4)(B) in computing the amount of the decrease referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1961, the term
prior taxable year (or years)
includes the taxable year of restoration. Under section 1341(b)(4)(B), for taxable years of restoration beginning after December 31, 1961, in any case where the exclusion referred to in section 1341(a)(5)(B) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section results in a net operating loss or capital loss for the prior taxable year (or years), such loss shall, for purposes of computing the decrease in tax for the prior taxable year (or years) under such section 1341(a)(5)(B) and such paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, be carried back and carried over to the same extent and in the same manner as is provided under section 172 (relating to the net operating loss deduction) or section 1212 (relating to capital loss carryover), except that no carryover beyond the taxable year shall be taken into account. See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for rules relating to the computation of the amount of decrease in tax.
(2)
Amount of exclusion from gross income in prior taxable years.
(i) The amount to be excluded from gross income for the prior taxable year (or years) in determining the decrease in tax under section 1341(a)(5)(B) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section shall be the amount restored in the taxable year, but shall not exceed the amount included in gross income in the prior taxable year (or years) under the claim of right to which the deduction for the restoration is attributable, and shall be adjusted as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
(ii) If the amount included in gross income for the prior taxable year (or years) under the claim of right in question was reduced in such year (or years) by a deduction allowed under section 1202 (or section 117 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws), then the amount determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to be excluded from gross income for such year (or years) shall be reduced in the same proportion that the amount included in gross income under a claim of right was reduced.
(iii) The determination of the amount of the exclusion from gross income of the prior taxable year shall be made without regard to the capital loss limitation contained in section 1211 applicable in computing taxable income for the current taxable year. The amount of the exclusion from gross income in a prior taxable year (or years) shall not exceed the amount which would, but for the application of section 1211, be allowable as a deduction in the taxable year of restoration.
(iv) The rule provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph may be illustrated as follows:

# Example:
For the taxable year 1952, an individual taxpayer had long-term capital gains of $50,000 and long-term capital losses of $10,000, a net long-term gain of $40,000. He also had other income of $5,000. In 1956, taxpayer restored the $50,000 of long-term gain. He had no capital gains or losses in 1956 but had other income of $5,000. If his tax liability for 1956, the taxable year of restoration, is computed by taking the deduction into account, the taxpayer would be entitled to a deduction under section 1211 of only $1,000 on account of the capital loss. However, if the taxpayer computes his tax under section 1341(a)(5) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, it is necessary to determine the decrease in tax for 1952. In such a determination, $50,000 is to be excluded from gross income for that year, resulting in a net capital loss for that year of $10,000, and a capital loss deduction of $1,000 under section 117(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (corresponding to section 1211 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954) with carryover privileges. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed after such exclusion for the years affected will be the amount of the decrease.
(3)
Determination of amount of deduction attributable to prior taxable years.
(i) If the deduction otherwise allowable for the taxable year relates to income included in gross income under a claim of right in more than one prior taxable year and the amount attributable to each such prior taxable year cannot be readily identified, then the portion attributable to each such prior taxable year shall be that proportion of the deduction otherwise allowable for the
taxable year which the amount of the income included under the claim of right in question for the prior taxable year bears to the total of all such income included under the claim of right for all such prior taxable years.
(ii) The rule provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated as follows:

# Example:
Under a claim of right, A included in his gross income over a period of three taxable years an aggregate of $9,000 for services to a certain employer, in amounts as follows: $2,000 for taxable year 1952, $4,000 for taxable year 1953, and $3,000 for taxable year 1954. In 1955 it is established that A must restore $6,750 of these amounts to his employer, and that A is entitled to a deduction of this amount in the taxable year 1955. The amount of the deduction attributable to each of the prior taxable years cannot be identified. Accordingly, the amount of the deduction attributable to each prior taxable year is:
1952—$6,750 × $2,000 ÷ $9,000 = $1,500
1953—$6,750 × $4,000 ÷ $9,000 = $3,000
1954—$6,750 × $3,000 ÷ $9,000 = $2,250
(4)
Computation of amount of decrease in tax.
(i) In computing the amount of decrease in tax for a prior taxable year (or years) resulting from the exclusion from gross income of the income included under a claim of right, there must first be ascertained the amount of tax previously determined for the taxpayer for such prior taxable year (or years). The tax previously determined shall be the sum of the amounts shown by the taxpayer on his return or returns, plus any amounts which have been previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies or which appropriately should be assessed or collected, reduced by the amount of any refunds or credits which have previously been made or which appropriately should be made. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, if the provisions of section 1341(b)(4)(B) are applicable, the tax previously determined shall include the tax for the taxable year of restoration computed without taking the deduction for the amount of the restoration into account. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, a recomputation must then be made to determine the decrease in tax, if any, resulting from the exclusion from gross income of all or that portion of the income included under a claim of right to which the deduction otherwise allowable in the taxable year is attributable.
(ii) No item other than the exclusion of the income previously included under a claim of right shall be considered in computing the amount of decrease in tax if reconsideration of such other item is prevented by the operation of any provision of the internal revenue laws or any other rule of law. However, if the amounts of other items in the return are dependent upon the amount of adjusted gross income, taxable income, or net income (such as charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, deductions for depletion, and net operating loss), appropriate adjustment shall be made as part of the computation of the decrease in tax. For the purpose of determining the decrease in tax for the prior taxable year (or years) which would result from the exclusion from gross income of the item included under a claim of right, the exclusion of such item shall be given effect not only in the prior taxable year in which it was included in gross income but in all other prior taxable years (including the taxable year of restoration if such year begins after December 31, 1961, and section 1341(b)(4)(B) applies, see subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph) affected by the inclusion of the item (for example, prior taxable years affected by a net operating loss carryback or carryover or capital loss carryover).
(iii) The rules provided in this subparagraph may be illustrated as follows:

# Example 1.
For the taxable year 1954, a corporation had taxable income of $35,000, on which it paid a tax of $12,700. Included in gross income for the year was $20,000 received under a claim of right as royalties. In 1957, the corporation is required to return $10,000 of the royalties. It otherwise has taxable income in 1957 of $5,000, so that without the application of section 1341 it has a net operating loss of $5,000 in that year. Facts also come to light in 1957 which entitle the corporation to an additional deduction of $5,000 for 1954. When a computation is made under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the corporation has no tax for the taxable year 1957. When a computation is made under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the tax for 1957, without taking the restoration into account, is $1,500, based on a taxable income of $5,000. The decrease in tax for 1954 is computed as follows:
Tax shown on return for 1954
$12,700
Taxable income for 1954 upon which tax shown on return was based
35,000
Less: Additional deduction (on account of which credit or refund could be made)
5,000

$4,100
Tax for 1957 without taking the restoration into account
1,500
Amount by which decrease exceeds the tax for 1957 computed without taking restoration into account
$2,600
(The $2,600 is treated as having been paid on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of the tax for 1957 and is available as a refund. In addition the taxpayer has made an overpayment of $2,600 ($12,700 less $10,000) for 1954 because of the additional deduction of $5,000.)

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that, instead of the corporation being entitled to an additional deduction of $5,000 for 1954, it is determined that the corporation failed to include an item of $5,000 in gross income for that year. The decrease in tax for 1954 is computed as follows:
Tax shown on return for 1954
$12,700
Taxable income for 1954 upon which tax shown on return was based
35,000
Plus: Additional income (on account of which deficiency assessment could be made)
$5,000
Total
40,000
Tax on $40,000 (adjusted taxable income for 1954)
15,300
Tax on $40,000 (adjusted taxable income for 1954)

5,200
Tax for 1957 without taking the restoration into account
1,500
Amount by which decrease exceeds the tax for 1957 computed without taking the restoration into account
$3,700
(The $3,700 is treated as having been paid on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of the tax for 1957 and is available as a refund. In addition the taxpayer has a deficiency of $2,600 ($15,300 less $12,700) for 1954 because of the additional income of $5,000.)

# Example 3.
For the taxable year 1954, a corporation had taxable income of $25,000, on which it paid a tax of $7,500. Included in gross income for the year was $10,000 received under a claim of right as commissions. In 1956, the corporation is required to return $5,000 of the commissions. The corporation has a net operating loss of $10,000 for 1956, excluding the deduction for the $5,000 restored. When a computation is made under either paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the corporation has no tax for the taxable year 1956. The decrease in tax for 1954 is computed as follows:
Tax shown on return for 1954
$7,500
Taxable income for 1954 upon which tax shown on return was based
25,000
Less: Additional deduction (on account of net operating loss carryback from 1956)

Tax for 1956 without taking the restoration into account
None
Amount by which decrease exceeds the tax for 1956 computed without taking the restoration into account
$1,500
(The $1,500 is treated as having been paid on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of the tax for 1956 and is available as a refund. In addition, the taxpayer has an overpayment of $3,000 ($7,500 less $4,500) for 1954 because of the net operating loss deduction of $10,000.)

# Example 4.
For the taxable year 1946 a married man with no dependents, who kept his books on the cash receipts and disbursements basis, filed a return (claiming two exemptions) disclosing adjusted gross income of $42,000, deductions amounting to $12,000, and a net income of $30,000. Gross income included among other items, salary in the amount of $15,000 and rental income in the amount of $5,000. During the taxable year he donated $10,000 to the American Red Cross and in his return claimed a deduction of $6,300 on account thereof, representing the
maximum deduction allowable under the 15-percent limitation imposed by section 23(o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for the year 1946. In computing his net income he omitted interest income amounting to $6,000 and neglected to take a deduction for interest paid in the amount of $4,500. The return disclosed a tax liability of $11,970, which was assessed and paid. In 1955, after the expiration of the period of limitations upon the assessment of a deficiency or the allowance of a refund for 1946, the taxpayer had to restore the $5,000 included in his gross income in 1946 as rental income. The amount of the decrease in tax for 1946 is $2,467.62, computed as follows:
Tax previously determined for 1946
$11,970.00
Net income for 1946 upon which tax previously determined was based
30,000.00
Less: Rents included under claim of right
5,000.00
Balance
25,000.00
Adjustment for contributions (add 15 percent of $5,000)

Amount of decrease in tax for 1946:
Tax previously determined
$11,970.00
Tax as recomputed

Decrease in tax
$2,467.62
The recomputation to determine the amount of the decrease in tax for 1946 does not take into consideration the barred item of $6,000 representing interest received, which was omitted from gross income, or the barred item of $4,500 representing interest paid for which no deduction was allowed. See subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.

# Example 5.
(a)
Facts.
For the taxable year 1959, a corporation reporting income on the calendar year basis had taxable income of $20,000 on which it paid a tax of $6,000. Included in gross income for such year was $100,000 received under a claim of right as royalties. For each of its taxable years 1956, 1957, 1958, 1960, 1961, and 1962, the corporation had taxable income of $10,000 on which it paid tax of $3,000 for each year. In 1963, the corporation returns the entire amount of $100,000 of the royalties. In such taxable year the corporation has taxable income of $25,000 (without taking the deduction of $100,000 into account), and has a net operating loss of $75,000 (taking the deduction of $100,000 into account). In determining whether section 1341(a)(4) or section 1341(a)(5) applies, the corporation will compute the lesser amount of tax referred to in section 1341(a) by applying the rules provided in section 1341(b)(4).
(b)
Tax under section 1341 (a)(4) and (b)(4)(A).
The net operating loss of $75,000 for 1963 (taking into account the deduction of $100,000) is carried back to the three taxable years (1960, 1961, and 1962) in the manner provided under section 172. For purposes of this example it is assumed that no modifications under section 172 are necessary. Since the aggregate taxable income for such three taxable years is only $30,000 the entire taxable income for such years is eliminated by the carryback, and the corporation would be entitled to a refund of the tax for such years in the aggregate amount of $9,000. (In addition, the remaining $45,000 of the net operating loss for 1963 would be available as a carryover to taxable years after the taxable year (1963) to the extent and in the manner provided by section 172.)
(c)
Tax under section 1341 (a)(5) and (b)(4)(B).
The tax for the taxable year (1963) on $25,000 of taxable income (computed without the deduction of $100,000) is $7,500. The exclusion of $100,000 from gross income for the taxable year 1959 (the year in which the item was included) results in a net operating loss of $80,000 for such year ($20,000 taxable income minus the $100,000 exclusion, no adjustments under section 172 being necessary), thus decreasing the tax for such year by the entire amount of $6,000 paid. The resulting net operating loss of $80,000 for 1959 is available as a carryback to 1956, 1957, and 1958, and as a carryover to 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. For purposes of this example it is assumed that no modifications under section 172 are necessary. Since the aggregate taxable income for such taxable years is $85,000, all except $5,000 of the 1963 taxable income is eliminated by such carryback and carryover. The tax on such remaining $5,000 of taxable income for 1963 is $1,500, thus decreasing the tax determined for such year by $6,000 ($7,500 minus $1,500). Under section 1341 (a)(5) and (b)(4)(B), the decrease in tax for the prior taxable years exceeds the tax for the taxable year of restoration computed without the deduction of the amount of the restoration by $22,500, computed as follows:
Tax for taxable year 1963 (on taxable income of $25,000 without the deduction)

Excess of the decrease in tax for the prior taxable years over the tax for taxable year 1963 ($30,000 less $7,500 tax for the taxable year)
22,500
(d)
Application of section 1341(a)(4) or section 1341(a)(5).
Since the computation under section 1341 (a)(4) and (b)(4)(A) results in an available refund of only $9,000 tax for the taxable years to which the net operating loss for 1963 is carried back, and since the computation under section 1341 (a)(5) and (b)(4)(B) results in an overpayment of $22,500, it is determined that section 1341(a)(5) applies. Accordingly, the $22,500 is treated as having been paid on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of tax for 1963 and is available as a refund.
(e)
Method of accounting.
The provisions of section 1341 and this section shall be applicable in the case of a taxpayer on the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting only to the taxable year in which the item of income included in a prior year (or years) under a claim of right is actually repaid. However, in the case of a taxpayer on the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting who constructively received an item of income under a claim of right and included such item of income in gross income in a prior year (or years), the provisions of section 1341 and this section shall be applicable to the taxable year in which the taxpayer is required to relinquish his right to receive such item of income. Such provisions shall be applicable in the case of other taxpayers only to the taxable year which is the proper taxable year (under the method of accounting used by the taxpayer in computing taxable income) for taking into account the deduction resulting from the restoration of the item of income included in a prior year (or years) under a claim of right. For example, if the taxpayer is on an accrual method of accounting, the provisions of this section shall apply to the year in which the obligation properly accrues for the repayment of the item included under a claim of right.
(f)
Inventory items, stock in trade, and property held primarily for sale in the ordinary course of trade or business.
(1) Except for amounts specified in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, the provisions of section 1341 and this section do not apply to deductions attributable to items which were included in gross income by reason of the sale or other disposition of stock in trade of the taxpayer (or other property of a kind which would properly have been included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the prior taxable year) or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business. This section is, therefore, not applicable to sales returns and allowances and similar items.
(2)(i) In the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, the provisions of section 1341 and this section apply to deductions which arise out of refunds or repayments with respect to rates made by a regulated public utility, as defined in section 7701(a)(33) without regard to the limitation contained in the last two sentences thereof (for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, as defined in section 1503(c) (1) or (3) and paragraph (g) of § 1.1502-2A (as contained in the 26 CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1996)), if such refunds or repayments are required to be made by the Government, political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality referred to in such section, or are required to be made by an order of a court, or are made in settlement of litigation or under threat or imminence of litigation. Thus, deductions attributable to refunds of charges for the sale of natural gas under rates approved temporarily by a proper governmental authority are, in the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, eligible for the benefits of section 1341 and this section, if such refunds are required by the governmental authority, or by an order of a court, or are made in settlement of litigation or under threat or imminence of litigation.
(ii) In the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958, the provisions of section 1341 and this section apply to deductions which arise out of refunds or repayments (whether or not with respect to rates) made by a regulated public utility, as defined in section 7701(a)(33) without regard to the
limitation contained in the last two sentences thereof (for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, as defined in section 1503(c) (1) or (3) and paragraph (g) of § 1.1502-2A), if such refunds or repayments are required to be made by the Government, political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality referred to in such section. Thus, in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958, deductions attributable to refunds or repayments may be eligible for the benefits of section 1341 and this section, even though such refunds or repayments are not with respect to rates. On the other hand, in the case of such taxable years, section 1341 and this section do not apply to any deduction which arises out of a refund or repayment (whether or not with respect to rates) which is required to be made by an order of a court, or which is made in settlement of litigation or under threat or imminence of litigation.
(3) The provisions of section 1341 and this section apply to a deduction which arises out of a payment or repayment made pursuant to a price redetermination provision in a subcontract:
(i) If such subcontract was entered into before January 1, 1958, between persons other than those bearing a relationship set forth in section 267(b);
(ii) If such subcontract is subject to statutory renegotiation; and
(iii) If section 1481 (relating to mitigation of effect of renegotiation of Government contracts) does not apply to such payment or repayment solely because such payment or repayment is not paid or repaid to the United States or any agency thereof.
Thus, a taxpayer who enters into a subcontract to furnish items to a prime contractor with the United States may, pursuant to a price redetermination provision in the subcontract, be required to refund an amount to the prime contractor or to another subcontractor. Since the refund would be made directly to the prime contractor or to another subcontractor, and not directly to the United States, the taxpayer would be unable to avail himself of the benefits of section 1481. However, the provisions of section 1341 and this section will apply in such a case, if the conditions set forth in subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of this subparagraph are met. For provisions relating to the mitigation of the effect of a redetermination of price with respect to subcontracts entered into after December 31, 1957, when repayment is made to a party other than the United States or any agency thereof, see section 1482.
(g)
Bad debts.
The provisions of sections 1341 and this section do not apply to deductions attributable to bad debts.
(h)
Legal fees and other expenses.
Section 1341 and this section do not apply to legal fees or other expenses incurred by a taxpayer in contesting the restoration of an item previously included in income. This rule may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A sold his personal residence to B in a prior taxable year and realized a capital gain on the sale. C claimed that under an agreement with A he was entitled to a 5-percent share of the purchase price since he brought the parties together and was instrumental in closing the sale. A rejected C's demand and included the entire amount of the capital gain in gross income for the year of sale. C instituted action and in the taxable year judgment is rendered against A who pays C the amount involved. In addition, A pays legal fees in the taxable year which were incurred in the defense of the action. Section 1341 applies to the payment of the 5-percent share of the purchase price to C. However, the payment of the legal fees, whether or not otherwise deductible, does not constitute an item restored for purposes of section 1341(a) and paragraph (a) of this section.
(i)
Refunds.
If the decrease in tax for the prior taxable year (or years) determined under section 1341(a)(5)(B) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section exceeds the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year computed without the deduction, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, if such excess is greater than the decrease in tax for the taxable year (or years) to which the net operating loss described in section 1341(b)(4)(A) and paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is carried back, such excess shall be considered to be a payment of tax for the taxable year of restoration. Such payment is deemed to have been made on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of tax for the taxable year and shall be refunded or credited in the
same manner as if it were an overpayment of tax for such taxable year. However, no interest shall be allowed or paid if such an excess results from the application of section 1341(a)(5)(B) in the case of a deduction described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section (relating to payments or repayments pursuant to price redetermination). If the tax for the taxable year of restoration is computed under section 1341(a)(4) and results in a decrease in tax for the taxable year (or years) to which a net operating loss described in section 1341(b)(4)(A) is carried back, see paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.

# Other Limitations
§ 1.1346-1
Recovery of unconstitutional taxes.
(a)
In general.
(1) A taxpayer who recovers unconstitutional Federal taxes which were paid or accrued and for which a deduction was allowed in a prior taxable year may elect, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, to exclude the income (exclusive of interest) attributable to such recovery from his gross income in the taxable year of recovery. Any such exclusion of income is subject to the requirements of section 1346 and this section.
(2) If a taxpayer elects to receive the benefits of section 1346, the income (exclusive of interest) attributable to the recovery of the unconstitutional Federal tax will be treated as an offset to the deduction allowed therefor in a prior taxable year (or years). The taxpayer's return for the prior taxable year (or years) with respect to which the statutory period for the assessment of a deficiency has expired will be opened only for the purpose of reducing the deduction allowed for the unconstitutional Federal tax and assessing the resulting deficiency or deficiencies, if any. (An election under section 1346 may be made only if the taxpayer consents in writing to such assessment. See paragraph (b) of this section.) No other adjustment will be allowed.
(3) If the disallowance of the deduction allowed in respect of a prior taxable year results in a deficiency for that year, the deficiency will be assessed against the taxpayer within the period agreed upon between the taxpayer and the district director with respect to the taxable year of the prior deduction, even though the statutory period for the assessment may have expired prior to the filing of the consent.
(4) If a taxpayer does not elect under the provisions of section 1346 and this section to exclude the tax recovered from gross income in the taxable year of recovery, the tax recovered shall, from the standpoint of its inclusion in or exclusion from gross income, be governed by the provisions of section 111.
(b)
Manner of making election.
(1) The election provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made by the taxpayer filing a statement in writing that he elects to treat the deduction allowed in a prior taxable year for the unconstitutional tax as not having been allowable for such taxable year. Such a statement must be filed with the taxpayer's return for the taxable year in which the recovery of the unconstitutional tax or taxes occurs. No other method of making the election is permitted. The statement of election must contain a description of the tax recovered, the date of recovery, the taxable year in which paid or accrued, and the taxable year for which the deduction was allowed. The statement of election must also contain a statement signifying the taxpayer's consent (i) to treat the deduction or portion thereof allowed in a prior year with respect to the unconstitutional tax as not allowable for that year and (ii) to the assessment, in respect of the taxable year for which the deduction was allowed, of any deficiency, together with interest thereon as provided by law, resulting from disallowance of the deduction or
portion thereof, even though the statutory period for the assessment of any such deficiency may have expired before the filing of such consent.
(2) The term
recovery,
as used in this section, includes not only refund or credit of taxes previously paid, but also the cancellation of a purported tax liability which was accrued and deducted for a prior taxable year but never actually paid.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12052, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.1347-1
Tax on certain amounts received from the United States.
(a) In the case of an amount (other than interest) received from the United States by an individual under a claim involving acquisition of property and remaining unpaid for more than 15 years, the tax (or, in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1971, the surtax) imposed by section 1 attributable to such amount shall not exceed 33 percent of the amount (other than interest) so received (30 percent for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1971). For the purpose of section 1347 and this section, such amount shall not include any amount received from the United States which constitutes interest, whether such interest was included in the claim or in any judgment thereon or has accrued on such judgment. Section 1347 and this section shall only apply with respect to amounts received under a claim filed with the United States before January 1, 1958.
(b) To determine the application of section 1347 and this section to a particular amount, the taxpayer shall first compute the tax (or, in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1971, the surtax) imposed by section 1 upon his entire taxable income, including the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section, without regard to the limitation on tax provided in section 1347. The proportion of the tax (or surtax), so computed, indicated by the ratio which the taxpayer's taxable income attributable to the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section, computed as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, bears to his total taxable income, is the portion of the tax (or surtax) attributable to such amount. If this portion of the tax (or surtax) exceeds 33 percent (30 percent for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1971) of the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section, that portion of the tax (or surtax) shall be reduced to 33 percent (or 30 percent) of such amount.
(c) In determining the portion of the taxable income attributable to any amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the taxpayer shall allocate to such amount received and to the gross income derived from all other sources, the expenses, losses, and other deductions properly attributable thereto, and shall apply any general expenses, losses, and other deductions (which cannot be properly apportioned otherwise) ratably to the gross income from all sources. The amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section, less the deductions properly attributable thereto and less its proportion of any general deductions, shall be the taxable income attributable to such amount. The taxpayer shall submit with his return a statement fully explaining the manner in which such expenses, losses, and deductions are allocated or apportioned.

§ 1.1348-1
Fifty-percent maximum tax on earned income.
Section 1348 provides generally that for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, the maximum tax rate applicable to the earned taxable income of an individual, estate, or trust is not to exceed 50 percent. In the case of an estate or trust, earned income includes only amounts which constitute income in respect of a decedent within § 1.1348-3(a)(4). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and before January 1, 1972, the maximum rate is 60 percent. Section 1348 does not apply if the taxpayer chooses the benefits of income averaging under sections 1301 through 1305. Section 1348 does not apply to a married individual who does not file a joint return with his spouse for the taxable year. For purposes of section 1348, an individual's marital
status shall be determined under section 153 and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 7446, 41 FR 55337, Dec. 20, 1976]
§ 1.1348-2
Computation of the fifty-percent maximum tax on earned income.
(a)
Computation of tax for taxable years beginning after 1971.
If, for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971, an individual has earned taxable income (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) which exceeds the applicable amount in column (1) of table A, the tax imposed by section 1 for such year shall be the sum of:
(1) The applicable amount in column (2) of table A.
(2) 50 percent of the amount by which earned taxable income exceeds the applicable amount in column (1) of table A, and
(3) The amount by which the tax imposed by chapter 1 on the entire taxable income exceeds a tax so computed on earned taxable income, such computations to be made without regard to section 1348 or 1301.

Short taxable periods.
If a taxpayer is required under section 443(a)(1) to make a return for a period of less than 12 months, the tax under section 1348 and this section shall be determined by placing his taxable income, earned net income, adjusted gross income, and items of tax preference on an annual basis in accordance with section 443 and the regulations thereunder. If a taxable year referred to in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(
a
) of this section is a period of less than 12 months for which a return is required under section 443(a)(1), the average described in such paragraph shall also be determined by placing the items of tax preference for such period on an annual basis in accordance with section 443 and the regulations thereunder. If a return for a period of less than 12 months is required under section 443(a)(3) for any taxable year referred to in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(
a
) of this section, section 1348 and this section shall not apply unless such period is reopened by the taxpayer as provided by section 6851(b).
(d)
Earned taxable income
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 1348 and this section, the term
earned taxable income
means the excess of (i) the portion of taxable income which, under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, is attributable to earned net income over (ii) the tax preference offset (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph). For purposes of computing the alternative tax under section 1201, earned taxable income shall not exceed the excess of taxable income over 50 percent of the net capital gain (net section 1201 gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977).
(2)
Taxable income attributable to earned net income.
The portion of taxable income which is attributable to
earned net income shall be determined by multiplying taxable income by a fraction (not exceeding one), the numerator of which is earned net income, and the denominator of which is adjusted gross income. For purposes of this subparagraph the term
earned net income
means the excess of the total of earned income (as defined in § 1.1343-(a)) over the total of any deductions which are required to be taken into account under section 62 in determining adjusted gross income and are properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income. Deductions are properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income if, and to the extent that, they are allowable in respect of expenses paid or incurred in connection with the production of earned income and have not been taken into account in determining the net profits of a trade or business in which both personal services and capital are material income producing factors (as defined in § 1.1348-3(a)(3)). Except as otherwise provided, deductions properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income include:
(i) Deductions attributable to a trade or business from which earned income is derived, except that if less than all the gross income from a trade or business constitutes earned income, only a ratable portion of the deductions attributable to such trade or business is allowable in respect of expenses paid or incurred in connection with the production of earned income,
(ii) Deductions consisting of expenses paid or incurred in connection with the performance of services as an employee,
(iii) The deductions described in section 62(7) and allowable by sections 404 and 405(c),
(iv) The deduction allowable by section 217,
(v) The deduction allowable by section 1379(b)(3), and
(vi) A net operating loss deduction to the extent that the net operating losses carried to the taxable year are properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income.
A net operating loss carried to the taxable year is properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income in such year to the extent of the excess (if any) of the deductions for the loss year which are properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income and which are allowable under section 172(d) in determining a net operating loss, over the earned income for the loss year. If the excess described in the preceding sentence is less than the entire net operating loss, such excess and the balance of such loss shall be deemed to reduce taxable income ratably for any taxable year to which such loss may be carried. See examples (3) and (4) in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(3)
Tax preference offset.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the
tax preference offset
is the amount by which the greater of:
(A) The average of the taxpayer's items of tax preference for the taxable year and the four preceding taxable years, or
(B) The taxpayer's items of tax preference for the taxable year,
exceeds $30,000.
(ii) The items of tax preference to be taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph for any taxable year shall be those items of tax preference referred to in section 57(a) and the regulations thereunder for the taxable year, but excluding any amount not taken into account in computing the tax under section 56(a) and the regulations thereunder for such taxable year. The items of tax preference to be taken into account by an individual for any taxable year in which such individual is or was a nonresident alien shall not include items of tax preference which are not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
(iii) Taxable years ending before January 1, 1970 shall not be included in computing the average described in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph. Thus, for example, the tax preference offset for a taxable year ending on December 31, 1973, is the amount by which the average of the taxpayer's items of tax preference for 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973, or the taxpayer's items of tax
preference for 1973, whichever is greater, exceeds $30,000. Taxable years during which the taxpayer was not in existence shall not be included in computing the average described in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph. A fractional part of a year which is treated as a taxable year under sections 441(b) and 7701(a)(23) shall be treated as a taxable year for purposes of this section for special rules if a taxable year referred to in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph is a period of less than 12 months for which a return is required under section 443(a)(1).
(iv) If for the current taxable year the taxpayer and his spouse (or the estate of such spouse) file a joint return together, the items of tax preference for a preceding taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph shall be the sum of the items of tax preference of the taxpayer and his spouse for such preceding year even though a joint return was not, or could not have been, filed by the taxpayer and such spouse for such preceding taxable year. If for the current taxable year the taxpayer (A) is no longer married to a spouse to whom he was married for a preceding taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph and files a return as a single person, head of household, or surviving spouse for such current taxable year, or (B) is married to a spouse other than the spouse to whom he was married for a preceding taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph, his items of tax preference shall be computed as if he were not married during such preceding taxable year.
(v) The sum of the items of tax preference of an estate or trust shall, for purposes of this paragraph, be apportioned between the estate or trust and the beneficiary in the manner and to the extent provided by section 58(c)(1) and the regulations thereunder.
(vi) If an item of gross income in respect of a decedent is includible in the gross income of a taxpayer and is treated as earned income in the hands of the taxpayer by reason of § 1.1348-3(a)(4), the items of tax preference for a taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be the sum of the taxpayer's items of tax preference for such taxable year and the decedent's items of tax preference for any taxable year of the decedent (including a short taxable year described in section 441(b)(3)) which ends with or within such taxable year of the taxpayer. For purposes of this subdivision, if a taxpayer (such as the estate of the decedent or a testamentary trust created by the decedent) has not been in existence for the number of preceding taxable years specified in subdivision (i)(A) or (iii) of this subparagraph, the items of tax preference for preceding taxable years taken into account shall be the taxpayer's items of tax preference for each of its preceding taxable years plus the decedent's items of tax preference for that number of the most recent taxable years of the decedent ending prior to the taxpayer's earliest taxable year which, when added to the taxpayer's preceding taxable years, equals such number of preceding taxable years specified in subdivision (i)(A), or (iii). The increase, if any, in the taxpayer's tax preference offset computed under this subdivision shall not exceed the amount by which the taxpayer's taxable income attributable to earned net income, computed as provided in § 1.1348-2(d)(2) and including the item of gross income in respect of a decedent, exceeds the taxpayer's taxable income attributable to earned net income computed without regard to such item of gross income.

Illustrations.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) H and W, married calendar-year taxpayers filing a joint return, have the following items of income, deductions, and tax preference for 1976:
(a) Salary
$155,000
(b) Dividends and interest
60,000
Total
215,000
(c) Deductible travel expenses of employee allocable to earned income

In addition, the taxpayers have tax preference items for 1976 of $80,000 attributable to the exercise of a qualified stock option and total tax preference items of $300,000 for the years 1972 through 1975. Since the items
of tax preference for 1976 exceed the average of the items of tax preference for the years 1972 through 1976, the tax preference offset for 1976 is $50,000 ($80,000−$30,000).
(ii) H and W have earned taxable income of $72,857 determined in the following manner:
(a) Earned income
$155,000
(b) Earned net income ($155,000−$5,000)
150,000
(c) Taxable income
172,000
(d) Adjusted gross income
210,000
(e) Taxable income attributable to earned net income:
$172,000(c) × ($150,000(b) / $210,000(d)
$122,857
(f) Tax preference offset

$91,740
(d) Tax computed under section 1 on $72,857 (earned taxable income)
29,291
(e) Item (c) minus item (d)
962,449
(f) Tax (total of items (a), (b), and (e))
90,938

# Example 2.
(i) H and W, married calendar-year taxpayers filing a joint return, have the following items of income, deductions, and tax preference for 1976:
(a) Salary
$210,000
(b) Dividends and interest
20,000
(c) Net long-term capital gains
100,000
Total
330,000

(e) Adjusted gross income
$280,000
(f) Exemptions and itemized deductions
40,000
(g) Taxable income
240,000
The taxpayers' tax preference item for 1976 is one-half of the net long-term capital gains of $100,000, or $50,000. The taxpayers have no items of tax preference for the years 1972 through 1975. Accordingly, their tax preference offset for 1976 is $20,000 ($50,000−$30,000).
(ii) H and W have earned taxable income of $160,000, determined in the following manner:
(a) Earned net income
$210,000
(b) Taxable income
240,000
(c) Adjusted gross income
280,000
(d) Taxable income attributable to earned net income:
$240,000(b) × ($210,000(a) / $280,000(c))
180,000

$104,080
(2) Tax under section 1201(b)(2) (25 pct of subsection (d) gain of $50,000)
12,500
(3) Tax under section 1201(b)(3) (tax under section 1 on $240,000 (taxable income) less tax under section 1 on $215,000 (amount subject to tax under section 1201(b)(1) plus 50 pct of subsection (d) gain)) ($138,980−$121,480)
17,500
Total
134,080

$122,560

# Example 3.
(i) A, an unmarried calendar year taxpayer engaged in the practice of law, has the following items of income and deductions for 1973 and 1976:
1973
1976
Gross income from law practice
$240,000
$100,000
Dividends
60,000
20,000
Expense paid in law practice
50,000
160,000
Investment interest
30,000
10,000
Casualty loss on personal residence (amount in excess of $100)
50,000
(ii) For 1976, A's deductions exceed his gross income, and his taxable income is therefore zero. In addition, A has a net operating loss of $100,000 (i.e., the excess of his deductions of $220,000 over his gross income of $120,000), which may be carried back to 1973. In computing his taxable income and earned taxable income for 1973, $60,000 (i.e., the excess of the expenses paid in A's law practice of $160,000, over his gross income from his law practice of $100,000) of the net operating loss deduction is properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income.
(iii) A's recomputed taxable income and earned taxable income for 1973 are $119,250 and $103,350 respectively, determined in the following manner:
Gross income ($240,000 + $60,000)
$300,000
Adjusted gross income ($300,000 − $50,000 − $100,000)
150,000
Taxable income ($150,000 − $30,000 − $750)
119,250
Earned net income ($240,000 − $50,000 − $60,000)
130,000
Earned taxable income ($130,000 / $150,000 × $119,250)
$103,350

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in example (3) except that A's gross income from his law practice for 1973 is $40,000. Thus, for 1973, A's deductions (including the net operating loss deduction) exceed his gross income, and his recomputed taxable income is therefore zero. The taxable income subtracted from the net operating loss to determine the carryback to 1974 is $20,000 (i.e., $40,000 + $60,000 − $50,000 − $30,000), and thus the net operating loss carryback to 1974 is $20,000 (i.e., $40,000 + $60,000 − $50,000 − $30,000), and thus the net operating loss carryback from 1976 to 1974 is $80,000 (i.e., $100,000 − $20,000). Of this amount, $48,000 ($80,000 × [$60,000 (the excess of the expenses paid in 1976 in A's law practice over his gross income from his law practice) ÷ $100,000 (A's net operating loss for 1976)]) is properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income, and must be taken into account in recomputing A's taxable income and earned taxable income for 1974.

# Example 5.
A, an unmarried calendar year taxpayer, receives a salary of $80,000 from Corporation X in 1975 and also owns and operates a laundry in which both his capital and services are material income producing factors. A incurs no section 62 expenses with respect to the salary income. In 1975 the laundry, a sole proprietorship, has gross income of $100,000 and business expenses deductible under section 62 of $80,000. A reasonable allowance as compensation for A's personal services rendered by him in his laundry business would be $12,000. The net profits of the laundry business were $20,000.
A's earned income from the laundry business is limited to $6,000 (30 percent of $20,000). A's total earned income is $36,000 ($80,000 + $60,000). Since the section 62 deductions of the laundry business have already been taken into account in computing net profits, they are not again taken into account in computing earned net income. Accordingly, A's earned net income for 1975 is $86,000.

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as example (5) except that the gross income of the laundry is $130,000 and the net profits from the laundry are $50,000. A's earned income from the laundry is $12,000. Even though the 30-percent-of-net profits limitation has not resulted in a reduction of A's earned income from the laundry, the expenses deducted in computing net profits do not reduce earned income. Accordingly, both the earned income and the earned net income of A for 1975 are $92,000.

# Example 7.
The facts are the same as example (5) except that the gross income of the laundry is $60,000 and the laundry has a net loss of $20,000. A's earned income from the laundry is $12,000. Since the laundry does not have net profits, the expenses of the laundry have not been taken into account in computing the net profits limitation. Accordingly, a ratable portion of deductible expenses of the laundry must be allocated to the earned income from the laundry in accordance with § 1.1348-2(d)(2); $16,000 of the expenses are allocated to the earned income ($12,000/$60,000 × $80,000). A's total earned income for 1975 is $92,000, and his earned net income is $76,000 ($92,000 minus $16,000).
[T.D. 7446, 41 FR 55337, Dec. 20, 1976, as amended by T.D. 7728, 45 FR 72650, Nov. 3, 1980]
§ 1.1348-3
Definitions.
(a)
Earned income
—(1)
In general.
(i) For purposes of section 1348 and the regulations thereunder, the term
earned income
means any item of gross income which is earned income within the meaning of section 401(c)(2)(C) or 911(b) unless the item constitutes deferred compensation as defined in paragraph (b) of this section or is otherwise excluded by application of this paragraph. Thus, subject to such exceptions, the term includes:
(A) Wages, salaries, professional fees, bonuses, amounts includible in gross income under section 83, commissions on sales or on insurance premiums, tips, and other amounts received, actually or constructively, as compensation for personal services actually rendered regardless of the medium or basis of payment.
(B) Compensatory payments for personal services made prior to the time such services are actually rendered, provided such advance payments are not made for a purpose of minimizing Federal income taxes by reason of the application of section 1348, and are either customary in the particular profession, trade, or business, or are made for a bona fide business purpose.
(C) Prizes and awards in recognition of personal services includible in gross income under section 74, amounts includible in gross income under section 79 (relating to group-term life insurance purchased for employees), and amounts includible in gross income under section 1379(b) (relating to contributions to qualified pension plans in the case of certain shareholder-employees); and
(D) Gains (other than gain which is treated as capital gain under any provision of chapter 1) and net earnings derived from the sale or other disposition of, the transfer of any interest in, or the licensing of the use of property
(other than good will) by an individual whose personal efforts created such property
The term does not include such income as dividends (including an amount treated as a dividend by reason of section 1373(b) and § 1.1373-1), other distributions of corporate earnings and profits, gambling gains, or gains which are treated as capital gains under any provision of chapter 1. The term also does not include amounts received for refraining from rendering personal services or engaging in competitive activity or amounts received as consideration for the cancellation of an employment contract.
(ii) In the case of a nonresident alien individual, earned income includes only earned income from sources within the United States which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
(2)
Earned income and employed assistants.
The entire amount received as professional fees shall be treated as earned income if the taxpayer is engaged in a professional occupation, such as a doctor, dentist, lawyer, architect, or accountant, even though he employs assistants to perform part or all of the services, provided the patients or clients are those of the taxpayer and look to the taxpayer as the person responsible for the services performed.
(3)
Earned income from business in which capital is material.
(i) If an individual is engaged in a trade or business (other than in corporate form) in which both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors, a reasonable allowance as compensation for the personal services actually rendered by the individual shall be considered earned income, but the total amount which shall be treated as the earned income of the individual from such a trade or business shall in no case exceed 30 percent of his share of the net profits of such trade or business (which share shall include any guaranteed payment (as defined by § 1.707-1(c)) received from a partnership). For purpose of the preceding sentence, the term
net profits of the trade or business
means the excess of gross income from such trade or business (including income from all sources, whether or not subject to Federal income tax, and without taking into account any deductions which may be allowable under section 1202) over the deductions attributable to such trade or business.
(ii) Whether capital is a material income-producing factor must be determined by reference to all the facts of each case. Capital is a material income-producing factor if a substantial portion of the gross income of the business is attributable to the employment of capital in the business, as reflected, for example, by a substantial investment in inventories, plant, machinery, or other equipment. In general, capital is not a material income-producing factor where gross income of the business consists principally of fees, commissions, or other compensation for personal services performed by an individual. Thus, the practice of his profession by a doctor, dentist, lawyer, architect, or accountant will not, as such, be treated as a trade or business in which capital is a material income-producing factor even though the practitioner may have a substantial capital investment in professional equipment or in the physical plant constituting the office from which he conducts his practice since his capital investment is regarded as only incidental to his professional practice.
(iii) This subparagraph does not apply to gains and net earnings derived from the sale or other disposition of, the transfer of any interest in, or the licensing of the use of property by an individual whose personal efforts created such property which are, by reason of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, treated as earned income. Thus, for example, a research chemist's substantial capital investment in laboratory facilities which he uses to produce patentable chemical processes from which he derives gains within the meaning of this subdivision would not be considered a material income-producing factor.
(4)
Income in respect of a decedent.
An item of gross income in respect of a decedent includible in the gross income of a person described in section described in section 691(a)(1) shall be treated as earned income in the hands
of such person for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph if such item of gross income would have constituted earned income of the decedent had he lived and received such amount. See § 1.1348-2(d)(3)(vi) for rules relating to attribution of tax preferences by reason of an item of income in respect of a decedent.
(5)
Exceptions to definition of earned income.
For purposes of section 1348 and the regulations thereunder, the term
earned income
does not include:
(i) Any distribution to which section 72(m)(5), relating to certain amounts received by owner-employees from a trust described in section 401(a) or under a plan described in section 403(a), applies,
(ii) Any distribution to which section 402(e), relating to the treatment of certain total distributions from a trust described in section 401(a) or under a plan described in section 403(a), applies,
(iii) Any distribution to which section 402(a)(2), relating to capital gains treatment of certain total distributions from a trust described in section 401(a), applies,
(iv) Any distribution to which section 403(a)(2)(A), relating to capital gains treatment for certain distributions under a plan described in section 404(a)(2), applies, or
(v) Any deferred compensation within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section.
(6)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A owns and operates an unincorporated laundering and dry cleaning business. A, assisted by his employees, devotes his entire time and attention to this business. Substantial capital is invested in the plant and equipment utilized in the laundering and dry cleaning of clothing for A's customers. Although personal services performed by A and his employees are a material income-producing factor in A's business, the capital investment in plant and equipment is not merely incidental to the performance of such services but is, as such, material to the production of business income. Therefore, A's laundering and dry cleaning business is one in which both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. A may treat as earned income for a taxable year a reasonable allowance as compensation for the personal services rendered by him in his business, but the amount so treated shall not exceed 30% of the net profits of his business for such year.

# Example 2.
In his unincorporated business as a real estate broker, which he conducts on a full-time basis, A performs substantial personal services, including solicitation of home buyers and sellers, escorting prospective buyers on house visits, arranging appraisal, financing, and legal services, and other related tasks. In the course of conducting such business, A often finances sales of real estate with his own capital, makes all the necessary arrangements incident to such financing, and a substantial portion of the gross income of the business consists of interest income from such financing. Under these facts and circumstances, both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors in A's real estate business within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of this section since the financing of real estate sales is an integral part of the entire business. Accordingly, A's earned income from his real estate business is limited to a reasonable allowance as compensation for the personal services A actually renders, but not in excess of 30% of the net profits from the business, including the interest income derived from financing sales of real estate.

# Example 3.
For his taxable year ending on December 31, 1973, A, a radiologist, reports fees of $100x for professional services rendered to his own patients during 1973. Since 1970, A has maintained his own office in a small building that he purchased for $60x. In addition, A owns X-ray equipment with an original cost of $300x which he uses in his professional practice. The entire $100x of professional fees earned by A during 1973 is treated as earned income, notwithstanding that A has a substantial capital investment in professional equipment and the office from which he conducts his medical practice, because such capital investment is only incidental to the rendition of personal services in A's professional practice.
(b)
Deferred compensation
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 1348 and the regulations thereunder, the term
deferred compensation
means, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, any compensation which is deferred within the meaning of that concept in section 404, including any deferred compensation to which the provisions of section 404 and the regulations thereunder apply and any other compensation taxation of which is deferred in a manner similar to the treatment applicable to deferred compensation to which such provisions
apply. Thus, the term includes any amounts includable in gross income as compensation for personal services pursuant to a plan, or method having the effect of a plan, deferring the taxation of such payment to a taxable year later than that in which such services were rendered. For purposes of section 1348, the term
deferred compensation
is not limited to payments to common-law employees but also includes payments to self-employed individuals: nor is it material that no deduction is allowable in respect of all or part of such payments or that a deduction in respect thereof is allowable under some provision of the Code other than section 404. For example, amounts received by a retired partner pursuant to a written plan of the partnership of the kind described in section 1402(a)(10) constitute deferred compensation except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. The term
deferred compensation,
as defined in this paragraph, shall have no application to a determination of the deductibility of any amount under section 162, 404, or any other provision of the Code.
(2)
Amounts not treated as deferred compensation.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, any amount includible in gross income as compensation before the end of the taxable year following the first taxable year of the taxpayer in which his right to receive such amount is not subject to any requirement or condition which would be treated as resulting in a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of section 83 and the regulations thereunder does not constitute deferred compensation for purposes of section 1348 and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of this subparagraph, a fractional part of a year which is a taxable year under sections 441(b) and 7701(a)(23) shall be treated as a taxable year.
(3)
Application to certain compensation
—(i)
In general.
This subparagraph provides rules for the application of the principles of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph to certain types of compensation.
(ii)
Pension, etc., plans.
(A) In accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the taxable portion of distributions under a pension, annuity, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan, whether or not such plan meets the requirements of section 401(a), or pursuant to a method having the effect of such a plan, generally constitutes deferred compensation. However, under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, such portion constitutes earned income if includible in gross income before the end of the taxable year following the first taxable year of the taxpayer in which his right to receive such amount is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. In the case of a distribution under a contributory plan, the preceding sentence applies only to that part of the taxable portion of the distribution which is attributable to employer contributions to the plan. For purposes of the preceding sentence, that part of the taxable portion of a distribution which is attributable to employer contributions is the amount of such part, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the employer contributions to the plan on behalf of the employee (determined in accordance with the principles of § 1.402(a)-2), and the denominator of which is the sum of such employer contributions and the net employee contributions to the plan (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.402(a)-2). Thus, if the employer does not contribute to the plan, no part of any distribution thereunder constitutes earned income. Amounts included in gross income under section 402(b), 403(c), or 1379(b)(1) in respect of employer contributions to a plan described in this subdivision do not constitute deferred compensation.
(B) If a recipient's rights to receive amounts pursuant to a plan cease to be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture in more than one of his taxable years, each payment pursuant to such plan shall be considered to consist of a ratable portion of all of the amounts which are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture at the time of such payment. Thus, for example, if an employment contract provides in part that an employee or his estate is to receive in each of the fifteen years after the year in which he attains or would have attained age 65 an amount equal to $2,000 times his years of service with the employer and if he had eighteen years of service with the employer,
each $36,000 payment would be considered to consist of 18 payments of $2,000, his right to receive one of which ceased to be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture upon completing his first year of service with the employer, his right to receive another of which ceased to be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture upon completing his second year of service with the employer, etc. Therefore, if the employee's last year of service with the employer was completed in the year in which he attained age 65, $2,000 of the first payment in the next year would not be deferred compensation under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, and the remaining $34,000 of that payment and all of the other fourteen payments of $36,000 would be deferred compensation. If the employee's last year of service was completed in an earlier year, all fifteen payments would constitute deferred compensation in full.
(iii)
Income attributable to options.
(A) Ordinary income realized by a taxpayer upon a disqualifying disposition of stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of a statutory option (as defined in § 1.421-7(b)) is not deferred compensation for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and, therefore, constitutes earned income.
(B) Ordinary income realized by a taxpayer upon the transfer of property pursuant to the exercise, or sale or other disposition, of an option which is not a statutory option (as defined in § 1.421-7(b)) and which was granted on or before December 15, 1971, is not deferred compensation for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and, therefore, constitutes earned income. Ordinary income realized by a taxpayer upon the transfer of property pursuant to the exercise, or sale or other disposition, of an option which is not a statutory option (as defined in § 1.421-(b)) and which is granted after December 15, 1971 constitutes earned income rather than deferred compensation if such option cannot, by its terms, be exercised more than three months after termination (for any reason other than death) of the grantee's employment by the grantor of the option. If the terms of such an option granted after December 15, 1971 permit the exercise of the option more than three months after termination (for any reason other than death) of the grantee's employment by the grantor, ordinary income realized by a taxpayer upon the transfer of property pursuant to exercise, or sale or other disposition, of the option constitutes earned income rather than deferred compensation only if such income is realized in a taxable year no later than that following the taxable year in which the option was granted. In the case of the grantee's death within a period during which ordinary income realized upon the transfer of property pursuant to his exercise, or sale or other disposition, of an option described in this subdivision would have constituted earned income as provided in this subdivision had the grantee lived, ordinary income realized subsequently upon the transfer of property pursuant to exercise, or sale or other disposition, of an option described in this subdivision, by the grantee's legal represedntatives or beneficiary constitutes earned income only if such exercise or sale or other disposition, occurs on a date no later than the date twelve months following that of the grantee's death. For purposes of this subdivision, the term
employment by the grantor
includes employment by a related corporation as defined in § 1.421-7(i), and by a corporation which is considered a related corporation under § 1.421-7(h)(3). Therefore, the transfer of an employee from the grantor corporation to such a related corporation or from one related corporation to another related corporation or to the grantor corporation will not be treated as a termination of employment by the grantor.
(C) For purposes of (B) of this subdivision, if an option described therein and granted after December 15, 1971 is exercisable only following completion of a specified period of employment, the taxable year in which such period of employment is completed shall be treated as the taxable year in which the option was granted. Further, if the terms of an option described in (B) of this subdivision and granted after December 15, 1971 are modified, such modification shall not be considered as the granting of a new option for purposes of (B) in determining the taxable year in which such option was granted.
(D) For purposes of (B) of this subdivision, an option will not be considered exercisable by its terms more than three months following termination (for any reason other than death) of the grantee's employment by the grantor solely because the terms of such option permit, in the event of such grantee's death within three months following termination of such employment, exercise of the option by the grantee's legal representative or beneficiary during or following such three-month period.

Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in each of which it is assumed that any amounts paid as described therein constitute salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered rather than a distribution of earnings and profits:

# Example 1.
(i) On January 1, 1965, Corporation X and E, an individual, execute an employment contract under which E is to be employed by X for a period of 10 years. Under the contract, E is entitled to a stated annual salary and to additional compensation of $10x for each year. This additional compensation is to be credited as of December 31 of each year to a bookkeeping reserve account and will be deferred, accumulated, and paid only upon termination of the employment contract, E's becoming a part-time employee of X, or E's becoming partially or totally incapacitated. Under the terms of the contract, X is merely under a contractual obligation to make the payments when due, and neither X nor E intends that the amounts in the reserve be held by X in trust for E. The contract provides that if E shall fall or refuse to perform his duties, X will be relieved of any obligation to make further credits to the reserve but not of the obligation to distribute amounts previously credited to the reserve. In the event E should die prior to his receipt in full of the balance in the account, the remaining balance is distributed to his personal representative.
(ii) Having completed the terms of his employment contract, E retires from the employment of X on December 31, 1974, and on January 15, 1975, receives a total distribution of $100x from his reserve account. Of this distribution of $100x to E, only $10x, representing the credit made to E's reserve account in 1974, constitutes earned income. No other credits to E's reserve account are taken into account for this purpose because they were made to the reserve account and became nonforfeitable in a year earlier than the year preceding that in which the $100x distribution was made to E.

# Example 2.
(i) Corporation X follows a policy of permitting employees to elect before the beginning of any calendar year to defer the receipt of either 5 percent or 10 percent of their stated annual salary to be earned in that year. E, an employee, elects for each of 10 years of employment to defer receipt of $5x of his stated annual salary. The total so deferred, or $50x, is paid to E on January 15, 1974.
(ii) Since the salary which E elects to defer is includible in his gross income only in the taxable year in which actually received by him, then to the extent E receives any such deferred salary payment after the end of the taxable year following the taxable year from which such payment was deferred, such payment does not constitute earned income since such payment is deferred compensation under this paragraph (b). Accordingly, of the $50x distribution to E, only $5x, representing the salary deferral from 1973, constitutes earned income.

# Example 3.
(i) E is an officer of Corporation X, which has a plan for making future payments of additional compensation for current services to certain employees. The plan provides that a fixed percentage of the annual net earnings in excess of $400x is to be designated for division among the participants. This amount is not currently paid to the participants; but X has set up on its books a separate account for each participant, including E, and each year it credits thereto the dollar amount of his participation for the year. Distributions are to be made from the account when the employee reaches the age of 60, is no longer employed by X, including cessation of employment due to death, or becomes totally unable to perform his duties, whichever occurs first. X's liability to make these distributions is contingent upon the employee's refraining from engaging in any business competitive to that of X, making himself available to X for consultation and advice after retirement or termination of his services, unless disabled, and retaining unencumbered any interest or benefit under the plan. In the event of his death, either before or after the beginning of payments, amounts in an employee's account are distributable to his designated beneficiaries of heirs-at-law. Under the facts and circumstances, E's rights to distributions from his account pursuant to the terms of the plan are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of section 83(c)(1). Under the terms of the compensation plan, X is under a merely contractual obligation to make the payments when due, and the parties did not intend that the amounts in each account be held by X in trust for the participants.
(ii) Cash or property includable in gross income by E which is attributable to a credit to his account in a taxable year earlier than the year immediately preceding the year on
onclusion does not constitute earned income since it is deferred compensation within the meaning of this paragraph (b). See subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (b) for rules for determining that portion of distributions from E's acount which are attributable to credits to his account in a taxable year immediately preceding the year in which such distributions are made.

# Example 4.
(i) Corporation X has an annual incentive bonus plan for its employees. Under this plan, X has the sole discretion to defer all or any part of any employee's incentive bonus award. In addition, no employee has any right to receive any incentive bonus for any year (whether to be paid currently or to be deferred) until such time, if any, as X makes an award to him. No employee has any election as to the amount or time of payment of his award for any year. Furthermore, the last of any payments under an award must be paid no later than 10 years from the normal retirement date of the employee. In addition, the obligations of X under the plan are merely contractual and are not funded or secured. The awards are nonassignable. However, in the case of death the awards are payable to the employee's designated beneficiary. Once made, a bonus award under the plan is not subject to any substantial risk of forfeiture.
(ii) In each of the years 1967, 1968, 1969, and 1970, X awards E a deferred bonus of $100x. E retires on June 30, 1971. Beginning in 1971, X pays to E the total of $400x of deferred bonus awards in 5 annual installments of $80x each. With respect to the $80x payment made to E in 1971, $20x, representing the ratable portion of the payment ($100x/$400x × $80x) allocable to the 1970 bonus award, is earned income because it was received in a year no later than the year following that (1970) in which E's right to receive such amount was no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The balance of the $80x payment made in 1971 and all payments made subsequently constitute deferred compensation.

# Example 5.
(i) Under the terms of a nonqualified bonus planfor its executive employees, Corporation M contributes each year to a bonus reserve a given percentage of its net earnings for the year. M makes bonus awards each year from the reserve in cash or stock of M, or a combination of both, to such executive employees, and in such amounts, as M may determine. The bonus award so determined to be made to a beneficiary is paid to him in installments: 20 percent of the award at the time that the award is made and the remaining installments in January of each succeeding year (until the full amount of the award is paid). Such amounts are payable in succeeding years but only if earned out by the employee by continuing service to M, at the rate of
1/12
th of the amount of the first installment for each complete month of service beginning with the year of determination. If the beneficiary voluntarily terminates his employment, is discharged for cause, or conducts himself in a manner inimical to the best interests of M, he forfeits the rights to receive any portion of his bonus award previously earned out but undelivered to him and to continue earning out his bonus award. Upon retirement a beneficiary retains the right to earn out an unearned bonus award but forfeits the right to continue earning out the award if he conducts himself in a manner inimical to M's best interests or engages in an activity which is in competition with an activity of M. If a beneficiary dies while earning out a bonus award, any unpaid and undelivered portion of his award is paid and delivered to his estate or heirs at such time and in such manner as if the beneficiary were living.
(ii) On January 1, 1971, M makes a cash bonus award to A of $100x. On January 15, 1971, $20x, representing representing the first installment of the award, is paid to A. On January 15, 1972, $20x, representing the portion of the award earned out by A during the calendar year 1971 is paid to him. On January 1, 1972, A retires from employment with M and, having satisfied the conditions to continue earning out his bonus award, receives $20x on January 15, 1975.
(iii) Under the facts and circumstances, the conditions that A not conduct himself in a manner inimical to the best interests of M and refrain from activity competitive to that of M are not considered to result in a substantial risk of forfeiture of the bonus award. The total installments of $40x paid to A in 1971 and 1972 constitute earned income. The installment of $20x earned out by A in 1972 and paid to him in 1973 also constitutes earned income for the taxable year 1973 because it was includible in gross income by A before the end of the taxable year of A following the first taxable year (the year of his retirement, i.e., 1972) in which his right to receive the installment was not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The installments paid to A in 1974 and 1975, however, do not constitute earned income because they were paid in a year later than the year following the year of A's retirement. Had the conditions that A not conduct himself in a manner inimical to the best interests of M and refrain from activity competitive to that of M constituted a substantial risk of forfeiture, the installments paid to A in 1974 and 1975 would have constituted earned income.

# Example 6.
On January 15, 1968, Corporation M, under the terms of a nonqualified bonus plan for its employees, grants to A, an employee, 5,000
dividend units,
which entitle A to receive, for the period during which the award remains in effect, a cash payment equal to the dividends declared andpaid by M on the equivalent of 5,000 shares of its capital stock. The award remains in effect for
A's lifetime but is subject to forfeiture if A is dismissed or leaves the service of M for any reason other than his death or retirement, or if A, following his retirement, engages in any activity which is harmful to the interests of M. Under the particular facts and circumstances, the condition that A not engage in any harmful activity is not considered to amount to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of section 83(c)(1). A retires on January 1, 1971. In each of the calendar years 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1974. A receives cash payments of $5x under his bonus award. The payments totaling $10x to A in the years 1971 and 1972 constitute earned income because A received them before the end of the taxable year following the first taxable year (i.e., 1971, the year in which A retired) in which his right to receive such payments was not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Payments totaling $10x to A in 1973 and 1974, however, constitute deferred compensation under paragraph (b) of this section.

# Example 7.
Corporation M maintains an employees' profit sharing trust which is not exempt from tax under section 501(a). Under the terms of the trust agreement, the interest of the trust beneficiaries in each contribution made to the trust by M is subject to asubstantial risk of forfeiture for a period of 2 years from the date on which the particular contribution is made, except that upon a beneficiary's retirement, his entire interest in the trust vests immediately. Contributions are made on December 30 of each year. As of August 1, 1969, the total interest, forfeitable and nonforfeitable, of A, an employee of M, in the trust is $320x. On December 30 in each of the years 1969, 1970, and 1971, M makes a further contribution to the trust allocable to A's account equal to $60x. A retires on December 31, 1971, and becomes entitled to a total distribution from the trust of $500x, of which $320x represents M's contributions made prior to August 1, 1969, and $180x represents contributions made subsequent to such date. Beginning in 1972, the trust distributes to A $500x in 5 equal annual installments. Because M's contributions to A's account for the years subsequent to August 1, 1969, totaling $180x vested as of his retirement date, such contributions of $180x constitute earned income of A for the year 1971 by reason of § 1.402(b)-1(b). No portion of any annual installment of $100x which is includible in A's gross income constitutes earned income since it is attributable to the $320x, in all of which A's rights became nonforfeitable no later than December 30, 1970.

# Example 8.
Corporation M maintains a qualified noncontributory pension plan for the benefit of its employees. Under the terms of the plan, no employee has a vested right to receive any distribution under the plan prior to his retirement from the employment of M upon reaching the age of 65. A, an employee of M, reaches age 65 on June 15, 1972, and retires on June 30, 1972. Under the terms of the pension plan, A becomes entitled to receive a monthly pension of $5x, beginning on July 1, 1972. A receives pension payments totalling $30x in 1972, $60x in 1973, $60x in 1974, $60x in 1975, and $60x in 1976. The pension payments received by A in 1972 and 1973 constitute earned income within paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The pension payments received by A in 1974, 1975, and 1976 constitute deferred compensation.

# Example 9.
(i) A is a participant in X Corporation's noncontributory qualified pension plan. The plan provides an annual benefit upon attaining age 65 of 2 percent of average compensation for each calendar year of participation in the plan. Average compensation is defined as the average of an employee's annual compensation over the last 5 calendar years of service. The plan provides that an employee's rights in his accrued benefit are nonforfeitable after 15 years of participation in the plan. A attains age 65 on June 20, 1975 and begins to receive a pension on July 1, 1975. A's pension is based upon 30 years of participation in the plan. A's annual compensation for the period 1969 through 1974, is as follows:
Year
Annual Compensation
1969
$75,000
1970
80,000
1971
80,000
1972
85,000
1973
85,000
1974
90,000
(ii) Under the terms of the plan, A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1974, and his pension are $50,400 (0.02 × 30 ×
1/5
($80,000 + $80,000 + $85,000 + $90,000)). A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1973, is $46,980 (0.02 × 29 ×
1/5
$85,000)). Since A's rights in $46,980 of his accrued benefit had ceased to be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture before 1974, only $285 (
1/12
× ($50,400 − $46,980)) of each payment received during 1975 does not constitute deferred compensation. The balance of the amounts received during 1975 and all amounts received in 1976 constitute deferred compensation since they are paid after the end of the taxable year following A's first taxable year in which his right to receive any such amount was not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.

# Example 10.
On January 15, 1971, Corporation M grants to A, an employee, an option to purchase 100 shares of stock of M at a price of $10x per share. Such option constitutes a qualified stock option constitutes a qualified stock option as defined in section 422(b). On August 1, 1971, A exercises his option, at which time the fair market value of the 100 shares of M Stock is $15x per share. On April 24, 1972, A sells the 100 shares of M stock acquired pursuant to exercise of his
option at a price of $25x per share. Because the sale constitutes a disqualifying disposition within the meaning of section 421(b), A realizes ordinary income of $500x and a capital gain of $1,000x in the taxable year 1972. The $500x of ordinary income so realized by A constitutes earned income.

# Example 11.
On November 30, 1072, Corporation M grants to A, an employee, a nonqualified stock option to which section 421 does not apply and which has no readily ascertainable fair market value on that date. The option may, by its terms, be exercised by A at any time during, or following termination of, his employment. On March 30, 1974, A, while still employed by M, exercises his option and realizes compensation income at that time. Such compensation does not constitute earned income because the option is exercisable within a period that may extend beyond three months after A's termination of employment (other than by reason of death). See paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. Had A exercised his option at any time prior to January 1, 1974, the compensation realized by him by reason of such exercise would have constituted earned income.

# Example 12.
On November 30, 1972, Corporation N grants to B, an employee, a nonqualified stock option to which section 421 does not apply and which has no readily ascertainable fair market value on that date. The option may by its terms, be exercised only within the period during which B is employed by N or within three months thereafter. On March 30, 1974, B exercises his option and realizes compensation at that time. Such compensation so realized by B constitutes earned income. See paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.

# Example 13.
On May 9, 1973, and in connection with the performance of services by E, an employee, Corporation X transfers to E 100 shares of X stock. Under the terms of the transfer, E is subject to a binding commitment to return the stock to X if E leaves X's employment for any reason prior to the expiration of a 3-year period beginning on the date of transfer. Since E must perform substantial services for X before he may keep the X stock, E's rights in the stock are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture under section 83(c)(1). Consequently, if such restriction lapses on May 9, 1976, the compensation realized at such time constitutes earned income. Had E elected to include an amount in his gross income in 1973 pursuant to section 83(b) and the regulations thereunder, the amount so included would also have constituted earned income.

# Example 14.
On October 1, 1971, A, an author, and Corporation M, a publisher, executed an agreement under which A granted to M the exclusive right to print, publish and sell a book he had written. The agreement provides that M will pay to A specified royalties based on the actual cash received from the sale of the published work, render semiannual statements of the sales, and at the time of rendering each statement make settlement for the amount due. On the same day, another agreement was signed by A and M, mutually agreeing that, in consideration of, and notwithstanding, any contrary provisions contained in the first contract, M shall not pay A more than $100x in any one calendar year. Under this supplemental contract, sums in excess of $100x accruing in any one calendar year are to be carried over by M into succeeding years. For the calendar year 1971, royalties payable to A under the basic agreement amount to $100x and this sum is paid to A. For the calendar year 1972, royalties of $120x are payable to A under the basic agreement, but by reason of the supplemental agreement, only $100x of this sum is actually paid to A. For each of the calendar years 1973 and 1974, royalties of $100x are payable to A under the basic agreement, and this sum is paid to A. For the calendar year 1975, royalties of $80x are payable to A under the basic agreement, and this sum, plus $20x carried over from 1972, or $100x, is paid to A. The $100x paid to A in each of the years 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1974, and $80x of the $100x paid to A in 1975 constitute earned income. The additional $20x carried over from 1972 and paid to A in 1975 constitutes deferred compensation under this paragraph (b) because it was paid to A later than the end of the year following the year (i.e., 1972) in which A's right to receive the amount was not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.

# Example 15.
Corporation M is the producer and owner of a feature length motion picture which is distributed to exhibitors by Corporation N pursuant to a distribution agreement between M and N providing for current payments to M of a given percentage of the current net profits derived by N from the exhibition and exploitation of the picture. A was employed by M as the leading actor in the picture for fixed compensation payable at the rate of $10x per week during the production period plus additional compensation equal to a given percentage of the net profits derived from the exhibition and exploitation of the picture. A's additional compensation is payable at the time that M receives payments from N under the terms of the distribution agreement. The additional compensation paid to A does not constitute deferred compensation since it is attributable to and measured by current net profits derived from the use of property created in part by A's efforts.

# Example 16.
A, a boxer entered into an agreement with M boxing club to fight a particular opponent on June 19, 1971. The agreement provided in part, that for his performance A was to receive 16 percent of the gross receipts derived from the match. Simultaneously, A and M executed a separate agreement providing for payment of A's share of
the receipts from the match as follows: 25 percent thereof not later than August 15, 1971, and 25 percent thereof during each of the years 1972, 1973, and 1974 in equal semiannual installments. A's share of the gross receipts derived from the match was $100x, of which 25 percent was paid to him in 1971 and a total of $25x in each of the years 1972, 1973, and 1974. Under the particular facts and circumstances, A and M are not acting as partners or joint venturers. Thus, A is taxable upon his share of such gross receipts only in the years in which such share is actually paid to him under the terms of the separate agreement. The payments of $25x in each of the years 1971 and 1972 constitute earned income. The payments of $25x in each of the years 1973 and 1974 would not constitute earned income because they constitute deferred compensation received later than the end of the first taxable year (i.e., 1972) following the year in which A's right to receive such amounts was not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.

estate,
for purposes of this paragraph, includes the estate of an individual in a case under title 11 of the United States Code.
(3)
Treatment of restricted stock.
For purposes of subchapter S, stock that is issued in connection with the performance of services (within the meaning of § 1.83-3(f)) and that is substantially nonvested (within the meaning of § 1.83-3(b)) is not treated as outstanding stock of the corporation, and the holder of that stock is not treated as a shareholder solely by reason of holding the stock, unless the holder makes an election with respect to the stock under section 83(b). In the event of such an election, the stock is treated as outstanding stock of the corporation, and the holder of the stock is treated as a shareholder for purposes of subchapter S. See paragraphs (l) (1) and (3) of this section for rules for determining whether substantially nonvested stock with respect to which an election under section 83(b) has been made is treated as a second class of stock.
(4)
Treatment of deferred compensation plans.
For purposes of subchapter S, an instrument, obligation, or arrangement is not outstanding stock if it—
(i) Does not convey the right to vote;
(ii) Is an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money or property in the future;
(iii) Is issued to an individual who is an employee in connection with the performance of services for the corporation or to an individual who is an independent contractor in connection with the performance of services for the corporation (and is not excessive by reference to the services performed); and
(iv) Is issued pursuant to a plan with respect to which the employee or independent contractor is not taxed currently on income.
A deferred compensation plan that has a current payment feature (e.g., payment of dividend equivalent amounts that are taxed currently as compensation) is not for that reason excluded from this paragraph (b)(4).
(5)
Treatment of straight debt.
For purposes of subchapter S, an instrument or obligation that satisfies the definition of straight debt in paragraph (l)(5) of this section is not treated as outstanding stock.
(6)
Effective date provision.
Section 1.1361-1(b) generally applies to taxable years of a corporation beginning on or after May 28, 1992. However, a corporation and its shareholders may apply this § 1.1361-1(b) to prior taxable years. In addition, substantially nonvested stock issued on or before May 28, 1992, that has been treated as outstanding by the corporation is treated as outstanding for purposes of subchapter S, and the fact that it is substantially nonvested and no section 83(b) election has been made with respect to it will not cause the stock to be treated as a second class of stock.
(c)
Domestic corporation.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term
domestic corporation
means a domestic corporation as defined in § 301.7701-5 of this chapter, and the term
corporation
includes an entity that is classified as an association taxable as a corporation under § 301.7701-2 of this chapter.
(d)
Ineligible corporation
—(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), the term
ineligible corporation
means a corporation that is—
(i) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1997, a financial institution that uses the reserve method of accounting for bad debts described in section 585 (for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1997, a financial institution to which section 585 applies (or would apply but for section 585(c)) or to which section 593 applies);
(ii) An insurance company subject to tax under subchapter L;
(iii) A corporation to which an election under section 936 applies; or
(iv) A DISC or former DISC.
(2)
Exceptions.
See the special rules and exceptions provided in sections 6(c) (2), (3) and (4) of Public Law 97-354 that are applicable for certain casualty insurance companies and qualified oil corporations.
(e)
Number of shareholders
—(1)
General rule.
A corporation does not qualify as a small business corporation if it has more than the number of shareholders provided in section 1361(b)(1)(A). Ordinarily, the person who would have to include in gross income dividends distributed with respect to the stock of the corporation (if the corporation were a C corporation) is considered to be the shareholder of the corporation. For example, if stock (owned other than by a husband and wife or members of a family described in section 1361(c)(1)) is owned by tenants in common or joint tenants, each tenant in common or joint tenant is generally considered to be a shareholder of the corporation. (For special rules relating to stock owned by husband and wife or members of a family, see paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, respectively; for special rules relating to restricted stock, see paragraphs (b)(3) and (6) of this section.) The person for whom stock of a corporation is held by a nominee, guardian, custodian, or an agent is considered to be the shareholder of the corporation for purposes of this paragraph (e) and paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section. For example, a partnership may be a nominee of S corporation stock for a person who qualifies as a shareholder of an S corporation. However, if the partnership is the beneficial owner of the stock, then the partnership is the shareholder, and the corporation does not qualify as a small business corporation. In addition, in
the case of stock held for a minor under a uniform transfers to minors act or similar statute, the minor and not the custodian is the shareholder. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (h) and (j) of this section, and for purposes of this paragraph (e) and paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, if stock is held by a decedent's estate or a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii), the estate or trust (and not the beneficiaries of the estate or trust) is considered to be the shareholder; however, if stock is held by a subpart E trust (which includes a voting trust) or an electing QSST described in section 1361(d)(1), the deemed owner of the trust is considered to be the shareholder. If stock is held by an ESBT described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(v), each potential current beneficiary of the trust shall be treated as a shareholder, except that the trust shall be treated as the shareholder during any period in which there is no potential current beneficiary of the trust. If stock is held by a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(vi), the individual for whose benefit the trust was created shall be treated as the shareholder. See paragraph (h) of this section for special rules relating to trusts.
(2)
Special rules relating to stock owned by husband and wife.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, stock owned by a husband and wife (or by either or both of their estates) is treated as if owned by one shareholder, regardless of the form in which they own the stock. For example, if husband and wife are owners of a subpart E trust, they will be treated as one individual. Both husband and wife must be U.S. citizens or residents, and a decedent spouse's estate must not be a foreign estate as defined in section 7701(a)(31). The treatment described in this paragraph (e)(2) will cease upon dissolution of the marriage for any reason other than death.
(3)
Special rules relating to stock owned by members of a family
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, stock owned by members of a family is treated as owned by one shareholder. Members of a family include a common ancestor, any lineal descendant of the common ancestor (without any generational limit), and any spouse (or former spouse) of the common ancestor or of any lineal descendants of the common ancestor. An individual shall not be considered to be a common ancestor if, on the applicable date, the individual is more than six generations removed from the youngest generation of shareholders who would be members of the family determined by deeming that individual as the common ancestor. For purposes of this six-generation test, a spouse (or former spouse) is treated as being of the same generation as the individual to whom the spouse is or was married. This test is applied on the latest of the date the election under section 1362(a) is made for the corporation, the earliest date that a member of the family (determined by deeming that individual as the common ancestor) holds stock in the corporation, or October 22, 2004. For this purpose, the date the election under section 1362(a) is made for the corporation is the effective date of the election, not the date it is signed or received by any person. The test is only applied as of the applicable date, and lineal descendants (and spouses) more than six generations removed from the common ancestor will be treated as members of the family even if they acquire stock in the corporation after that date. The members of a family are treated as one shareholder under this paragraph (e)(3) solely for purposes of section 1361(b)(1)(A), and not for any other purpose, whether under section 1361 or any other provision. Specifically, each member of the family who owns or is deemed to own stock must meet the requirements of sections 1361(b)(1)(B) and (C) (regarding permissible shareholders) and section 1362(a)(2) (regarding shareholder consents to an S corporation election). Although a person may be a member of more than one family under this paragraph (e)(3), each family (not all of whose members are also members of the other family) will be treated as one shareholder. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), any legally adopted child of an individual, any child who is lawfully placed with an individual for legal adoption by that individual, and any eligible foster child of an individual (within the meaning of section
152(f)(1)(C)), shall be treated as a child of such individual by blood.
(ii)
Certain entities treated as members of a family.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), the estate or trust (described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii)) of a deceased member of the family will be considered to be a member of the family during the period in which the estate or such trust (if the trust is described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii)), holds stock in the S corporation. The members of the family also will include—
(A) In the case of an ESBT, each potential current beneficiary who is a member of the family;
(B) In the case of a QSST, the income beneficiary who makes the QSST election, if that income beneficiary is a member of the family;
(C) In the case of a trust created primarily to exercise the voting power of stock transferred to it, each beneficiary who is a member of the family;
(D) The individual for whose benefit a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(vi) was created, if that individual is a member of the family;
(E) The deemed owner of a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i) if that deemed owner is a member of the family; and
(F) The owner of an entity disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter, if that owner is a member of the family.
(f)
Shareholder must be an individual or estate.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (relating to nominees), paragraph (h) of this section (relating to certain trusts), and, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997, section 1361(c)(6) (relating to certain exempt organizations), a corporation in which any shareholder is a corporation, partnership, or trust does not qualify as a small business corporation.
(g)
Nonresident alien shareholder
—(1)
General rule.
(i) A corporation having a shareholder who is a nonresident alien as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(B) does not qualify as a small business corporation. If a U.S. shareholder's spouse is a nonresident alien who has a current ownership interest (as opposed, for example, to a survivorship interest) in the stock of the corporation by reason of any applicable law, such as a state community property law or a foreign country's law, the corporation does not qualify as a small business corporation from the time the nonresident alien spouse acquires the interest in the stock. If a corporation's S election is inadvertently terminated as a result of a nonresident alien spouse being considered a shareholder, the corporation may request relief under section 1362(f).
(ii) The following examples illustrate this paragraph (g)(1)(i):

# Example 1.
In 1990, W, a U.S. citizen, married H, a citizen of a foreign country. At all times H is a nonresident alien under section 7701(b)(1)(B). Under the foreign country's law, all property acquired by a husband and wife during the existence of the marriage is community property and owned jointly by the husband and wife. In 1996 while residing in the foreign country, W formed X, a U.S. corporation, and X simultaneously filed an election to be an S corporation. X issued all of its outstanding stock in W's name. Under the foreign country's law, X's stock became the community property of and jointly owned by H and W. Thus, X does not meet the definition of a small business corporation and therefore could not file a valid S election because H, a nonresident alien, has a current interest in the stock.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as
Example 1,
except that in 1991, W and H filed a section 6013(g) election allowing them to file a joint U.S. tax return and causing H to be treated as a U.S. resident for purposes of chapters 1, 5, and 24 of the Internal Revenue Code. The section 6013(g) election applies to the taxable year for which made and to all subsequent taxable years until terminated. Because H is treated as a U.S. resident under section 6013(g), X does meet the definition of a small business corporation. Thus, the election filed by X to be an S corporation is valid.

Special rule for dual residents.

(h)
Special rules relating to trusts
—(1)
General rule.
In general, a trust is not a permitted small business corporation shareholder. However, except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the following trusts are permitted shareholders:
(i)
Qualified subpart E trust.
A trust all of which is treated (under subpart E, part I, subchapter J, chapter 1) as owned by an individual (whether or not the grantor) who is a citizen or resident of the United States (a qualified
subpart E trust). This requirement applies only during the period that the trust holds S corporation stock.
(ii)
Subpart E trust ceasing to be a qualified subpart E trust after the death of deemed owner.
A trust that was a qualified subpart E trust immediately before the death of the deemed owner and that continues in existence after the death of the deemed owner, but only for the 2-year period beginning on the day of the deemed owner's death. A trust is considered to continue in existence if the trust continues to hold the stock pursuant to the terms of the will or the trust agreement, or if the trust continues to hold the stock during a period reasonably necessary to wind up the affairs of the trust. See § 1.641(b)-3 for rules concerning the termination of trusts for federal income tax purposes.
(iii)
Electing qualified subchapter S trusts.
A qualified subchapter S trust (QSST) that has a section 1361(d)(2) election in effect (an electing QSST). See paragraph (j) of this section for rules concerning QSSTs including the manner for making the section 1361(d)(2) election.
(iv)
Testamentary trusts.
A trust (other than a qualified subpart E trust, an electing QSST, or an electing small business trust) to which S corporation stock is—
(A) Transferred pursuant to the terms of a will, but only for the 2-year period beginning on the day the stock is transferred to the trust except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(3)(i)(D) of this section; or
(B) Transferred pursuant to the terms of an electing trust as defined in § 1.645-1(b)(2) during the election period as defined in § 1.645-1(b)(6), or deemed to be distributed at the close of the last day of the election period pursuant to § 1.645-1(h)(1), but in each case only for the 2-year period beginning on the day the stock is transferred or deemed distributed to the trust except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(3)(i)(D) of this section.
(v)
Qualified voting trusts.
A trust created primarily to exercise the voting power of S corporation stock transferred to it. To qualify as a voting trust for purposes of this section (a qualified voting trust), the beneficial owners must be treated as the owners of their respective portions of the trust under subpart E and the trust must have been created pursuant to a written trust agreement entered into by the shareholders, that—
(A) Delegates to one or more trustees the right to vote;
(B) Requires all distributions with respect to the stock of the corporation held by the trust to be paid to, or on behalf of, the beneficial owners of that stock;
(C) Requires title and possession of that stock to be delivered to those beneficial owners upon termination of the trust; and
(D) Terminates, under its terms or by state law, on or before a specific date or event.
(vi)
Electing small business trusts.
An electing small business trust (ESBT) under section 1361(e). See paragraph (m) of this section for rules concerning ESBTs including the manner of making the election to be an ESBT under section 1361(e)(3).
(vii)
Individual retirement accounts.
In the case of a corporation which is a bank (as defined in section 581) or a depository institution holding company (as defined in section 3(w)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(w)(1)), a trust which constitutes an individual retirement account under section 408(a), including one designated as a Roth IRA under section 408A, but only to the extent of the stock held by such trust in such bank or company as of October 22, 2004. Individual retirement accounts (including Roth IRAs) are not otherwise eligible S corporation shareholders.
(2)
Foreign trust.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, in any case where stock is held by a foreign trust as defined in section 7701(a)(31), the trust is considered to be the shareholder and is an ineligible shareholder. Thus, even if a foreign trust qualifies as a subpart E trust (e.g., a qualified voting trust), any corporation in which the trust holds stock does not qualify as a small business corporation.
(3)
Determination of shareholders
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section (qualification as a small business corporation), and, except as provided in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section, for purposes of sections
1366 (relating to the pass-through of items of income, loss, deduction, or credit), 1367 (relating to adjustments to basis of shareholder's stock), and 1368 (relating to distributions), the shareholder of S corporation stock held by a trust that is a permitted shareholder under paragraph (h)(1) of this section is determined as follows:
(A) If stock is held by a qualified subpart E trust, the deemed owner of the trust is treated as the shareholder.
(B) If stock is held by a trust defined in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, the estate of the deemed owner is generally treated as the shareholder as of the day of the deemed owner's death. However, if stock is held by such a trust in a community property state, the decedent's estate is the shareholder only of the portion of the trust included in the decedent's gross estate (and the surviving spouse continues to be the shareholder of the portion of the trust owned by that spouse under the applicable state's community property law). The estate ordinarily will cease to be treated as the shareholder upon the earlier of the transfer of the stock by the trust or the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the day of the deemed owner's death. If the trust qualifies and becomes an electing QSST, the beneficiary and not the estate is treated as the shareholder as of the effective date of the QSST election, and the rules provided in paragraph (j)(7) of this section apply. If the trust qualifies and becomes an ESBT, the shareholders are determined under paragraphs (h)(3)(i)(F) and (h)(3)(ii) of this section as of the effective date of the ESBT election, and the rules provided in paragraph (m) of this section apply.
(C) If stock is held by an electing QSST, see paragraph (j)(7) of this section for the rules on who is treated as the shareholder.
(D) If stock is transferred or deemed distributed to a testamentary trust described in paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section (other than a qualified subpart E trust, an electing QSST, or an ESBT), the estate of the testator is treated as the shareholder until the earlier of the transfer of that stock by the trust or the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the day that the stock is transferred or deemed distributed to the trust. If the trust qualifies and becomes an electing QSST, the beneficiary and not the estate is treated as the shareholder as of the effective date of the QSST election, and the rules provided in paragraph (j)(7) of this section apply. If the trust qualifies and becomes an ESBT, the shareholders are determined under paragraphs (h)(3)(i)(F) and (h)(3)(ii) of this section as of the effective date of the ESBT election, and the rules provided in paragraph (m) of this section apply.
(E) If stock is held by a qualified voting trust, each beneficial owner of the stock, as determined under subpart E, is treated as a shareholder with respect to the owner's proportionate share of the stock held by the trust.
(F) If S corporation stock is held by an ESBT, each potential current beneficiary is treated as a shareholder. However, if for any period there is no potential current beneficiary of the ESBT, the ESBT is treated as the shareholder during such period. See paragraph (m)(4) of this section for the definition of potential current beneficiary.
(G) If stock in an S corporation bank or depository institution holding company is held by an individual retirement account (including a Roth IRA) described in paragraph (h)(1)(vii) of this section, the individual for whose benefit the trust was created shall be treated as the shareholder.
(ii)
Exceptions. See
§ 1.641(c)-1 for the rules for the taxation of an ESBT. Solely for purposes of section 1366, 1367, and 1368 the shareholder of S corporation stock held by a trust is determined as follows—
(A) If stock is held by a trust as defined in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section (other than an electing QSST or an ESBT), the trust is treated as the shareholder. If the trust continues to own the stock after the expiration of the 2-year period, the corporation's S election will terminate unless the trust is otherwise a permitted shareholder.
(B) If stock is transferred or deemed distributed to a testamentary trust described in paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section (other than a qualified subpart E trust, an electing QSST, or an ESBT), the trust is treated as the
shareholder. If the trust continues to own the stock after the expiration of the 2-year period, the corporation's S election will terminate unless the trust otherwise qualifies as a permitted shareholder.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Qualified subchapter S trust
—(1)
Definition.
A qualified subchapter S trust (QSST) is a trust (whether intervivos or testamentary), other than a foreign trust described in section 7701(a)(31), that satisfies the following requirements:
(i) All of the income (within the meaning of § 1.643(b)-1) of the trust is distributed (or is required to be distributed) currently to one individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States. For purposes of the preceding sentence, unless otherwise provided under local law (including pertinent provisions of the governing instrument that are effective under local law), income of the trust includes distributions to the trust from the S corporation for the taxable year in question, but does not include the trust's pro rata share of the S corporation's items of income, loss, deduction, or credit determined under section 1366. See §§ 1.651(a)-2(a) and 1.663(b)-1(a) for rules relating to the determination of whether all of the income of a trust is distributed (or is required to be distributed) currently. If under the terms of the trust income is not required to be distributed currently, the trustee may elect under section 663(b) to consider a distribution made in the first 65 days of a taxable year as made on the last day of the preceding taxable year. See section 663(b) and § 1.663(b)-2 for rules on the time and manner for making the election. The income distribution requirement must be satisfied for the taxable year of the trust or for that part of the trust's taxable year during which it holds S corporation stock.
(ii) The terms of the trust must require that—
(A) During the life of the current income beneficiary, there will be only one income beneficiary of the trust;
(B) Any corpus distributed during the life of the current income beneficiary may be distributed only to that income beneficiary;
(C) The current income beneficiary's income interest in the trust will terminate on the earlier of that income beneficiary's death or the termination of the trust; and
(D) Upon termination of the trust during the life of the current income beneficiary, the trust will distribute all of its assets to that income beneficiary.
(iii) The terms of the trust must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section from the date the QSST election is made or from the effective date of the QSST election, whichever is earlier, throughout the entire period that the current income beneficiary and any successor income beneficiary is the income beneficiary of the trust. If the terms of the trust do not preclude the possibility that any of the requirements stated in paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section will not be met, the trust will not qualify as a QSST. For example, if the terms of the trust are silent with respect to corpus distributions, and distributions of corpus to a person other than the current income beneficiary are permitted under local law during the life of the current income beneficiary, then the terms of the trust do not preclude the possibility that corpus may be distributed to a person other than the current income beneficiary and, therefore, the trust is not a QSST.
(2)
Special rules
—(i) If a husband and wife are income beneficiaries of the same trust, the husband and wife file a joint return, and each is a U.S. citizen or resident, the husband and wife are treated as one beneficiary for purposes of paragraph (j) of this section. If a husband and wife are treated by the preceding sentence as one beneficiary, any action required by this section to be taken by an income beneficiary requires joinder of both of them. For example, each spouse must sign the QSST election, continue to be a U.S. citizen or resident, and continue to file joint returns for the entire period that the QSST election is in effect.
(ii)(A)
Terms of the trust and applicable local law.
The determination of whether the terms of a trust meet all of the requirements under paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section depends upon the terms
of the trust instrument and the applicable local law. For example, a trust whose governing instrument provides that A is the sole income beneficiary of the trust is, nevertheless, considered to have two income beneficiaries if, under the applicable local law, A and B are considered to be the income beneficiaries of the trust.
(B)
Legal obligation to support.
If under local law a distribution to the income beneficiary is in satisfaction of the grantor's legal obligation of support to that income beneficiary, the trust will not qualify as a QSST as of the date of distribution because, under section 677(b), if income is distributed, the grantor will be treated as the owner of the ordinary income portion of the trust or, if trust corpus is distributed, the grantor will be treated as a beneficiary under section 662. See § 1.677(b)-1 for rules on the treatment of trusts for support and § 1.662(a)-4 for rules concerning amounts used in discharge of a legal obligation.
(C)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section:

# Example:
F creates a trust for the benefit of F's minor child, G. Under the terms of the trust, all income is payable to G until the trust terminates on the earlier of G's attaining age 35 or G's death. Upon the termination of the trust, all corpus must be distributed to G or G's estate. The trust includes all of the provisions prescribed by section 1361(d)(3)(A) and paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section, but does not preclude the trustee from making income distributions to G that will be in satisfaction of F's legal obligation to support G. Under the applicable local law, distributions of trust income to G will satisfy F's legal obligation to support G. If the trustee distributes income to G in satisfaction of F's legal obligation to support G, the trust will not qualify as a QSST because F will be treated as the owner of the ordinary income portion of the trust. Further, the trust will not be a qualified subpart E trust because the trust will be subject to tax on the income allocable to corpus.
(iii) If, under the terms of the trust, a person (including the income beneficiary) has a special power to appoint, during the life of the income beneficiary, trust income or corpus to any person other than the current income beneficiary, the trust will not qualify as a QSST. However, if the power of appointment results in the grantor being treated as the owner of the entire trust under the rules of subpart E, the trust may be a permitted shareholder under section 1361 (c)(2)(A)(i) and paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.
(iv) If the terms of a trust or local law do not preclude the current income beneficiary from transferring the beneficiary's interest in the trust or do not preclude a person other than the current income beneficiary named in the trust instrument from being treated as a beneficiary of the trust under § 1.643(c)-1, the trust will still qualify as a QSST. However, if the income beneficiary transfers or assigns the income interest or a portion of the income interest to another, the trust may no longer qualify as a QSST, depending on the facts and circumstances, because any transferee of the current income beneficiary's income interest and any person treated as a beneficiary under § 1.643(c)-1 will be treated as a current income beneficiary for purposes of paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section and the trust may no longer meet the QSST requirements.
(v) If the terms of the trust do not preclude a person other than the current income beneficiary named in the trust instrument from being awarded an interest in the trust by the order of a court, the trust will qualify as a QSST assuming the trust meets the requirements of paragraphs (j)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. However, if as a result of such court order, the trust no longer meets the QSST requirements, the trust no longer qualifies as a QSST and the corporation's S election will terminate.
(vi) A trust may qualify as a QSST even though a person other than the current income beneficiary is treated under subpart E as the owner of a part or all of that portion of a trust which does not consist of the S corporation stock, provided the entire trust meets the QSST requirements stated in paragraphs (j)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.
(3)
Separate and independent shares of a trust.
For purposes of sections 1361 (c) and (d), a substantially separate and independent share of a trust, within the meaning of section 663(c) and the regulations thereunder, is treated as a separate trust. For a separate share which holds S corporation stock to
qualify as a QSST, the terms of the trust applicable to that separate share must meet the QSST requirements stated in paragraphs (j)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.
(4)
Qualified terminable interest property trust.
If property, including S corporation stock, or stock of a corporation that intends to make an S election, is transferred to a trust and an election is made to treat all or a portion of the transferred property as qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) under section 2056(b)(7), the income beneficiary may make the QSST election if the trust meets the requirements set out in paragraphs (j)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. However, if property is transferred to a QTIP trust under section 2523(f), the income beneficiary may not make a QSST election even if the trust meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section because the grantor would be treated as the owner of the income portion of the trust under section 677. In addition, if property is transferred to a QTIP trust under section 2523(f), the trust does not qualify as a permitted shareholder under section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i) and paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section (a qualified subpart E trust), unless under the terms of the QTIP trust, the grantor is treated as the owner of the entire trust under sections 671 to 677. If the grantor ceases to be the income beneficiary's spouse, the trust may qualify as a QSST if it otherwise satisfies the requirements under paragraphs (j)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.
(5)
Ceasing to meet the QSST requirements.
If a QSST for which an election under section 1361(d)(2) has been made (as described in paragraph (j)(6) of this section) ceases to meet any of the requirements specified in paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section, the provisions of this paragraph (j) will cease to apply as of the first day on which that requirement ceases to be met. If such a trust ceases to meet the income distribution requirement specified in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section, but continues to meet all of the requirements in paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section, the provisions of this paragraph (j) will cease to apply as of the first day of the first taxable year beginning after the first taxable year for which the trust ceased to meet the income distribution requirement of paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section. If a corporation's S election is inadvertently terminated as a result of a trust ceasing to meet the QSST requirements, the corporation may request relief under section 1362(f).
(6)
Qualified subchapter S trust election
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (j)(6) applies to the election provided in section 1361(d)(2) (the QSST election) to treat a QSST (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) as a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i), and thus a permitted shareholder. This election must be made separately with respect to each corporation whose stock is held by the trust. The QSST election does not itself constitute an election as to the status of the corporation; the corporation must make the election provided by section 1362(a) to be an S corporation. Until the effective date of a corporation's S election, the beneficiary is not treated as the owner of the stock of the corporation for purposes of section 678. Any action required by this paragraph (j) to be taken by a person who is under a legal disability by reason of age may be taken by that person's guardian or other legal representative, or if there be none, by that person's natural or adoptive parent.
(ii)
Filing the QSST election.
The current income beneficiary of the trust must make the election by signing and filing with the service center with which the corporation files its income tax return the applicable form or a statement that—
(A) Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the current income beneficiary, the trust, and the corporation;
(B) Identifies the election as an election made under section 1361(d)(2);
(C) Specifies the date on which the election is to become effective (not earlier than 15 days and two months before the date on which the election is filed);
(D) Specifies the date (or dates) on which the stock of the corporation was transferred to the trust; and
(E) Provides all information and representations necessary to show that:
(
1
) Under the terms of the trust and applicable local law—
(
i
) During the life of the current income beneficiary, there will be only one income beneficiary of the trust (if husband and wife are beneficiaries, that they will file joint returns and that both are U.S. residents or citizens);
(
ii
) Any corpus distributed during the life of the current income beneficiary may be distributed only to that beneficiary;
(
iii
) The current beneficiary's income interest in the trust will terminate on the earlier of the beneficiary's death or upon termination of the trust; and
(
iv
) Upon the termination of the trust during the life of such income beneficiary, the trust will distribute all its assets to such beneficiary.
(
2
) The trust is required to distribute all of its income currently, or that the trustee will distribute all of its income currently if not so required by the terms of the trust.
(
3
) No distribution of income or corpus by the trust will be in satisfaction of the grantor's legal obligation to support or maintain the income beneficiary.
(iii)
When to file the QSST election.
(A) If S corporation stock is transferred to a trust, the QSST election must be made within the 16-day-and-2-month period beginning on the day that the stock is transferred to the trust. If a C corporation has made an election under section 1362(a) to be an S corporation (S election) and, before that corporation's S election is in effect, stock of that corporation is transferred to a trust, the QSST election must be made within the 16-day-and-2-month period beginning on the day that the stock is transferred to the trust.
(B) If a trust holds C corporation stock and that C corporation makes an S election effective for the first day of the taxable year in which the S election is made, the QSST election must be made within the 16-day-and-2-month period beginning on the day that the S election is effective. If a trust holds C corporation stock and that C corporation makes an S election effective for the first day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the S election is made, the QSST election must be made within the 16-day-and-2-month period beginning on the day that the S election is made. If a trust holds C corporation stock and that corporation makes an S election intending the S election to be effective for the first day of the taxable year in which the S election is made but, under § 1.1362-6(a)(2), such S election is subsequently treated as effective for the first day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the S election is made, the fact that the QSST election states that the effective date of the QSST election is the first day of the taxable year in which the S election is made will not cause the QSST election to be ineffective for the first year in which the corporation's S election is effective.
(C) If a trust ceases to be a qualified subpart E trust, satisfies the requirements of a QSST, and intends to become a QSST, the QSST election must be filed within the 16-day-and-2-month period beginning on the date on which the trust ceases to be a qualified subpart E trust. If the estate of the deemed owner of the trust is treated as the shareholder under paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, the QSST election may be filed at any time, but no later than the end of the 16-day-and-2-month period beginning on the date on which the estate of the deemed owner ceases to be treated as a shareholder.
(D) If a testamentary trust is a permitted shareholder under paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section, satisfies the requirements of a QSST, and intends to become a QSST, the QSST election may be filed at any time, but no later than the end of the 16-day-and-2-month period beginning on the day after the end of the 2-year period.
(E) If a corporation's S election terminates because of a late QSST election, the corporation may request inadvertent termination relief under section 1362(f). See § 1.1362-4 for rules concerning inadvertent terminations.
(iv)
Protective QSST election when a person is an owner under subpart E.
If the grantor of a trust is treated as the owner under subpart E of all of the trust, or of a portion of the trust which consists of S corporation stock, and the current income beneficiary is not
the grantor, the current income beneficiary may not make the QSST election, even if the trust meets the QSST requirements stated in paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section. See paragraph (j)(6)(iii)(C) of this section as to when the QSST election may be made. See also paragraph (j)(2)(vi) of this section. However, if the current income beneficiary (or beneficiaries who are husband and wife, if both spouses are U.S. citizens or residents and file a joint return) of a trust is treated under subpart E as owning all or a portion of the trust consisting of S corporation stock, the current income beneficiary (or beneficiaries who are husband and wife, if both spouses are U.S. citizens or residents and file a joint return) may make the QSST election. See
Example 8
of paragraph (k)(1) of this section.
(7)
Treatment as shareholder.
(i) The income beneficiary who makes the QSST election and is treated (for purposes of section 678(a)) as the owner of that portion of the trust that consists of S corporation stock is treated as the shareholder for purposes of sections 1361(b)(1), 1366, 1367, and 1368.
(ii) If, upon the death of an income beneficiary, the trust continues in existence, continues to hold S corporation stock but no longer satisfies the QSST requirements, is not a qualified subpart E trust, and does not qualify as an ESBT, then, solely for purposes of section 1361(b)(1), as of the date of the income beneficiary's death, the estate of that income beneficiary is treated as the shareholder of the S corporation with respect to which the income beneficiary made the QSST election. The estate ordinarily will cease to be treated as the shareholder for purposes of section 1361(b)(1) upon the earlier of the transfer of that stock by the trust or the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the day of the income beneficiary's death. During the period that the estate is treated as the shareholder for purposes of section 1361(b)(1), the trust is treated as the shareholder for purposes of sections 1366, 1367, and 1368. If, after the 2-year period, the trust continues to hold S corporation stock and does not otherwise qualify as a permitted shareholder, the corporation's S election terminates. If the termination is inadvertent, the corporation may request relief under section 1362(f).
(8)
Coordination with grantor trust rules.
If a valid QSST election is made, the income beneficiary is treated as the owner, for purposes of section 678(a), of that portion of the trust that consists of the stock of the S corporation for which the QSST election was made. However, solely for purposes of applying the preceding sentence to a QSST, an income beneficiary who is a deemed section 678 owner only by reason of section 1361(d)(1) will not be treated as the owner of the S corporation stock in determining and attributing the Federal income tax consequences of a disposition of the stock by the QSST. For example, if the disposition is a sale, the QSST election terminates as to the stock sold and any gain or loss recognized on the sale will be that of the trust, not the income beneficiary. Similarly, if a QSST distributes its S corporation stock to the income beneficiary, the QSST election terminates as to the distributed stock and the consequences of the distribution are determined by reference to the status of the trust apart from the income beneficiary's terminating ownership status under sections 678 and 1361(d)(1). The portions of the trust other than the portion consisting of S corporation stock are subject to subparts A through D of subchapter J of chapter 1, except as otherwise required by subpart E of the Internal Revenue Code. However, solely for purposes of applying sections 465 and 469 to the income beneficiary, a disposition of S corporation stock by a QSST shall be treated as a disposition by the income beneficiary.
(9)
Successive income beneficiary.
(i) If the income beneficiary of a QSST who made a QSST election dies, each successive income beneficiary of that trust is treated as consenting to the election unless a successive income beneficiary affirmatively refuses to consent to the election. For this purpose, the term
successive income beneficiary
includes a beneficiary of a trust whose interest is a separate share within the meaning of section 663(c), but does not include any beneficiary of a trust that is created upon the death of the income beneficiary of the QSST
and which is a new trust under local law.
(ii) The application of this paragraph (j)(9) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Shares of stock in Corporation X, an S corporation, are held by Trust A, a QSST for which a QSST election was made. B is the sole income beneficiary of Trust A. On B's death, under the terms of Trust A, J and K become the current income beneficiaries of Trust A. J and K each hold a separate and independent share of Trust A within the meaning of section 663(c). J and K are successive income beneficiaries of Trust A, and they are treated as consenting to B's QSST election.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that on B's death, under the terms of Trust A and local law, Trust A terminates and the principal is to be divided equally and held in newly created Trust B and Trust C. The sole income beneficiaries of Trust B and Trust C are J and K, respectively. Because Trust A terminated, J and K are not successive income beneficiaries of Trust A. J and K must make QSST elections for their respective trusts to qualify as QSSTs, if they qualify. The result is the same whether or not the trustee of Trusts B and C is the same as the trustee of trust A.
(10)
Affirmative refusal to consent
—(i)
Required statement.
A successive income beneficiary of a QSST must make an affirmative refusal to consent by signing and filing with the service center where the corporation files its income tax return a statement that—
(A) Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the successive income beneficiary, the trust, and the corporation for which the election was made;
(B) Identifies the refusal as an affirmative refusal to consent under section 1361(d)(2); and
(C) Sets forth the date on which the successive income beneficiary became the income beneficiary.
(ii)
Filing date and effectiveness.
The affirmative refusal to consent must be filed within 15 days and 2 months after the date on which the successive income beneficiary becomes the income beneficiary. The affirmative refusal to consent will be effective as of the date on which the successive income beneficiary becomes the current income beneficiary.
(11)
Revocation of QSST election.
A QSST election may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. The Commissioner will not grant a revocation when one of its purposes is the avoidance of Federal income taxes or when the taxable year is closed. The application for consent to revoke the election must be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service in the form of a letter ruling request under the appropriate revenue procedure. The application must be signed by the current income beneficiary and must—
(i) Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the current income beneficiary, the trust, and the corporation with respect to which the QSST election was made;
(ii) Identify the election being revoked as an election made under section 1361(d)(2); and
(iii) Explain why the current income beneficiary seeks to revoke the QSST election and indicate that the beneficiary understands the consequences of the revocation.
(12)
Converting a QSST to an ESBT.
For a trust that seeks to convert from a QSST to an ESBT, the consent of the Commissioner is hereby granted to revoke the QSST election as of the effective date of the ESBT election, if all the following requirements are met:
(i) The trust meets all of the requirements to be an ESBT under paragraph (m)(1) of this section except for the requirement under paragraph (m)(1)(iv)(A) of this section that the trust not have a QSST election in effect.
(ii) The trustee and the current income beneficiary of the trust sign the ESBT election. The ESBT election must be filed with the service center where the S corporation files its income tax return. This ESBT election must state at the top of the document “ATTENTION ENTITY CONTROL—CONVERSION OF A QSST TO AN ESBT PURSUANT TO SECTION 1.1361-1(j)” and include all information otherwise required for an ESBT election under paragraph (m)(2) of this section. A separate election must be made with respect to the stock of each S corporation held by the trust.
(iii) The trust has not converted from an ESBT to a QSST within the 36-month period preceding the effective date of the new ESBT election.
(iv) The date on which the ESBT election is to be effective cannot be more than 15 days and two months prior to the date on which the election is filed and cannot be more than 12 months after the date on which the election is filed. If an election specifies an effective date more than 15 days and two months prior to the date on which the election is filed, it will be effective on the day that is 15 days and two months prior to the date on which it is filed. If an election specifies an effective date more than 12 months after the date on which the election is filed, it will be effective on the day that is 12 months after the date it is filed.
(k)(1)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraphs (h) and (j) of this section are illustrated by the following examples in which it is assumed that all noncorporate persons are citizens or residents of the United States:

# Example 1.
(i)
Terms of the trust.
In 1996, A and A's spouse, B, created an intervivos trust and each funded the trust with separately owned stock of an S corporation. Under the terms of the trust, A and B designated themselves as the income beneficiaries and each, individually, retained the power to amend or revoke the trust with respect to the trust assets attributable to their respective trust contributions. Upon A's death, the trust is to be divided into two separate parts; one part attributable to the assets A contributed to the trust and one part attributable to B's contributions. Before the trust is divided, and during the administration of A's estate, all trust income is payable to B. The part of the trust attributable to B's contributions is to continue in trust under the terms of which B is designated as the sole income beneficiary and retains the power to amend or revoke the trust. The part attributable to A's contributions is to be divided into two separate trusts both of which have B as the sole income beneficiary for life. One trust, the
Credit Shelter Trust,
is to be funded with an amount that can pass free of estate tax by reason of A's available estate tax unified credit. The terms of the Credit Shelter Trust meet the requirements of section 1361(d)(3) as a QSST. The balance of the property passes to a Marital Trust, the terms of which satisfy the requirements of section 1361(d)(3) as a QSST and section 2056(b)(7) as QTIP. The appropriate fiduciary under § 20.2056(b)-7(b)(3) is directed to make an election under section 2056(b)(7).
(ii)
Results after deemed owner's death.
On February 3, 1997, A dies and the portion of the trust assets attributable to A's contributions including the S stock contributed by A, is includible in A's gross estate under sections 2036 and 2038. During the administration of A's estate, the trust holds the S corporation stock. Under section 1361(c)(2)(B)(ii), A's estate is treated as the shareholder of the S corporation stock that was included in A's gross estate for purposes of section 1361(b)(1); however, for purposes of sections 1366, 1367, and 1368, the trust is treated as the shareholder. B's part of the trust continues to be a qualified subpart E trust of which B is the owner under sections 676 and 677. B, therefore, continues to be treated as the shareholder of the S corporation stock in that portion of the trust. On May 13, 1997, during the continuing administration of A's estate, the trust is divided into separate trusts in accordance with the terms of the trust instrument. The S corporation stock that was included in A's gross estate is distributed to the Marital Trust and to the Credit Shelter Trust. A's estate will cease to be treated as the shareholder of the S corporation under section 1361(c)(2)(B)(ii) on May 13, 1997 (the date on which the S corporation stock was transferred to the trusts). B, as the income beneficiary of the Marital Trust and the Credit Shelter Trust, must make the QSST election for each trust by July 28, 1997 (the end of the 16-day-and-2-month period beginning on the date the estate ceases to be treated as a shareholder) to have the trusts become permitted shareholders of the S corporation.

# Example 2.
(i)
Qualified subpart E trust as shareholder.
In 1997, A, an individual established a trust and transferred to the trust A's shares of stock of Corporation M, an S corporation. A has the power to revoke the entire trust. The terms of the trust require that all income be paid to B and otherwise meet the requirements of a QSST under section 1361(d)(3). The trust will continue in existence after A's death. The trust is a qualified subpart E trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i) during A's life, and A (not the trust) is treated as the shareholder for purposes of sections 1361(b)(1), 1366, 1367, and 1368.
(ii)
Trust ceasing to be a qualified subpart E trust on deemed owner's death.
Assume the same facts as paragraph (i) of this
Example 2,
except that A dies without having exercised A's power to revoke. Upon A's death, the trust ceases to be a qualified subpart E trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i). A's estate (and not the trust) is treated as the shareholder for purposes of section 1361(b)(1). A's estate will cease to be treated as the shareholder for purposes of section 1361(b)(1) upon the earlier of the transfer of the Corporation M stock by the trust (other than to A's estate), the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the day of A's death, or the effective date of a QSST or ESBT election if
the trust qualifies as a QSST or ESBT. However, until that time, because the trust continues in existence after A's death and will receive any distributions with respect to the stock it holds, the trust is treated as the shareholder for purposes of sections 1366, 1367, and 1368. If no QSST or ESBT election is made effective upon the expiration of the 2-year period, the corporation ceases to be an S corporation, but the trust continues as the shareholder of a C corporation.
(iii)
Trust continuing to be a qualified subpart E trust on deemed owner's death.
Assume the same facts as paragraph (ii) of this
Example 2,
except that the terms of the trust also provide that if A does not exercise the power to revoke before A's death, B will have the sole power to withdraw all trust property at any time after A's death. The trust continues to qualify as a qualified subpart E trust after A's death because, upon A's death, B is deemed to be the owner of the entire trust under section 678. Because the trust does not cease to be a qualified subpart E trust upon A's death, B (and not A's estate) is treated as the shareholder for purposes of sections 1361(b)(1), 1366, 1367, and 1368. Since the trust qualifies as a QSST, B may make a protective QSST election under paragraph (j)(6)(iv) of this section.

# Example 3.
(i)
2-year rule under section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii).
F owns stock of Corporation P, an S corporation. In addition, F is the deemed owner of a qualified subpart E trust that holds stock in Corporation O, an S corporation. F dies on July 1, 2003. The trust continues in existence after F's death but is no longer a qualified subpart E trust. On August 1, 2003, F's shares of stock in Corporation P are transferred to the trust pursuant to the terms of F's will. Because the stock of Corporation P was not held by the trust when F died, section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) does not apply with respect to that stock. Under section 1361(c)(2)(A)(iii), the last day on which the trust could be treated as a permitted shareholder of Corporation P is July 31, 2005 (that is, the last day of the 2-year period that begins on the date of the transfer from the estate to the trust). With respect to the shares of stock in Corporation O held by the trust at the time of F's death, section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) applies and the last day on which the trust could be treated as a permitted shareholder of Corporation O is June 30, 2005 (that is, the last day of the 2-year period that begins on the date of F's death).
(ii)
Section 645 electing trust and successor trust.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 3,
except that F's trust is a qualified revocable trust for which a valid section 645 election is made on October 1, 2003 (electing trust). Because under section 645 the electing trust is treated and taxed for purposes of subtitle A of the Code as part of F's estate, the trust may continue to hold the O stock pursuant to § 1361(b)(1)(B), without causing the termination of Corporation O's S election, for the duration of the section 645 election period. However, on January 1, 2004, during the election period, the shares of stock in Corporation O are transferred pursuant to the terms of the electing trust to a successor trust. Because the successor trust satisfies the definition of a testamentary trust under paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section, the successor trust is a permitted shareholder until the earlier of the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on January 1, 2004, or the effective date of a QSST or ESBT election for the successor trust.

# Example 4.
(i)
QSST when terms do not require current distribution of income.
Corporation Q, a calendar year corporation, makes an election to be an S corporation effective for calendar year 1996. On July 1, 1996, G, a shareholder of Corporation Q, transfers G's shares of Corporation Q stock to a trust with H as its current income beneficiary. The terms of the trust otherwise satisfy the QSST requirements, but authorize the trustee in its discretion to accumulate or distribute the trust income. However, the trust, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, initially satisfies the income distribution requirement because the trustee is currently distributing all of the income. On August 1, 1996, H makes a QSST election with respect to Corporation Q that is effective as of July 1, 1996. Accordingly, as of July 1, 1996, the trust is a QSST and H is treated as the shareholder for purposes of sections 1361(b)(1), 1366, 1367, and 1368.
(ii)
QSST when trust income is not distributed currently.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 4,
except that, for the taxable year ending on December 31, 1997, the trustee accumulates some trust income. The trust ceases to be a QSST on January 1, 1998, because the trust failed to distribute all of its income for the taxable year ending December 31, 1997. Thus, Corporation Q ceases to be an S corporation as of January 1, 1998, because the trust is not a permitted shareholder.
(iii)
QSST when a person other than the current income beneficiary may receive trust corpus.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 4,
except that the events occur in 2003 and H dies on November 1, 2003, and the trust does not qualify as an ESBT. Under the terms of the trust, after H's death, L is the income beneficiary of the trust and the trustee is authorized to distribute trust corpus to L as well as to J. The trust ceases to be a QSST as of November 1, 2003, because corpus distributions may be made to someone other than L, the current (successive) income beneficiary. Under section 1361(c)(2)(B)(ii), H's estate (and not the trust) is considered to be the shareholder for purposes of section 1361(b)(1) for the 2-year period beginning on November 1, 2003. However, because the trust continues in existence
after H's death and will receive any distributions from the corporation, the trust (and not H's estate) is treated as the shareholder for purposes of sections 1366, 1367, and 1368, during that 2-year period. After the 2-year period, the S election terminates and the trust continues as a shareholder of a C corporation. If the termination is inadvertent, Corporation Q may request relief under section 1362(f). However, the S election would not terminate if the trustee distributed all Corporation Q shares to L, J, or both on or before October 31, 2005, (the last day of the 2-year period) assuming that neither L nor J becomes the 76th shareholder of Corporation Q as a result of the distribution.

# Example 5. QSST when current income beneficiary assigns the income interest to a person not named in the trust.
On January 1, 1996, stock of Corporation R, a calendar year S corporation, is transferred to a trust that satisfies all of the requirements to be a QSST. Neither the terms of the trust nor local law preclude the current income beneficiary, K, from assigning K's income interest in the trust. K files a timely QSST election that is effective January 1, 1996. On July 1, 1996, K assigns the income interest in the trust to N. Under applicable state law, the trustee is bound as a result of the assignment to distribute the trust income to N. Thus, the QSST will cease to qualify as a QSST under section 1361(d)(3)(A)(iii) because N's interest will terminate on K's death (rather than on N's death). Accordingly, as of the date of the assignment, the trust ceases to be a QSST and Corporation R ceases to be an S corporation.

# Example 6. QSST when terms fail to provide for distribution of trust assets upon termination during life of current income beneficiary.
A contributes S corporation stock to a trust the terms of which provide for one income beneficiary, annual distributions of income, discretionary invasion of corpus only for the benefit of the income beneficiary, and termination of the trust only upon the death of the current income beneficiary. Since the trust can terminate only upon the death of the income beneficiary, the governing instrument fails to provide for any distribution of trust assets during the income beneficiary's life. The governing instrument's silence on this point does not disqualify the trust under section 1361(d)(3)(A) (ii) or (iv).

# Example 7. QSST when settlor of trust retains a reversion in the trust.
On January 10, 1996, M transfers to a trust shares of stock in corporation X, an S corporation. D, who is 13 years old and not a lineal descendant of M, is the sole income beneficiary of the trust. On termination of the trust, the principal (including the X shares) is to revert to M. The trust instrument provides that the trust will terminate upon the earlier of D's death or D's 21st birthday. The terms of the trust satisfy all of the requirements to be a QSST except those of section 1361(d)(3)(A)(ii) (that corpus may be distributed during the current income beneficiary's life only to that beneficiary) and (iv) (that, upon termination of the trust during the life of the current income beneficiary, the corpus, must be distributed to that beneficiary). On February 10, 1996, M makes a gift of M's reversionary interest to D. Until M assigns M's reversion in the trust to D, M is deemed to own the entire trust under section 673(a) and the trust is a qualified subpart E trust. For purposes of section 1361(b)(1), 1366, 1367, and 1368, M is the shareholder of X. The trust ceases to be a qualified subpart E trust on February 10, 1996. Assuming that, by virtue of the assignment to D of M's reversionary interest, D (upon his 21st birthday) or D's estate (in the case of D's death before reaching age 21) is entitled under local law to receive the trust principal, the trust will be deemed as of February 10, 1996, to have satisfied the conditions of section 1361(d)(3)(A) (ii) and (iv) even though the terms of the trust do not explicitly so provide. D must make a QSST election by no later than April 25, 1996 (the end of the 16-day-and-2-month period that begins on February 10, 1996, the date on which the X stock is deemed transferred to the trust by M). See example (5) of § 1.1001-2(c) of the regulations.

# Example 8. QSST when the income beneficiary has the power to withdraw corpus.
On January 1, 1996, F transfers stock of an S corporation to an irrevocable trust whose income beneficiary is F's son, C. Under the terms of the trust, C is given the noncumulative power to withdraw from the corpus of the trust the greater of $5,000 or 5 percent of the value of the corpus on a yearly basis. The terms of the trust meet the QSST requirements. Assuming the trust distributions are not in satisfaction of F's legal obligation to support C, the trust qualifies as a QSST. C (or if C is a minor, C's legal representative) must make the QSST election no later than March 16, 1996 (the end of the 16-day-and-2-month period that begins on the date the stock is transferred to the trust).

# Example 9.
(i)
Filing the QSST election.
On January 1, 1996, stock of Corporation T, a calendar year C corporation, is transferred to a trust that satisfies all of the requirements to be a QSST. On January 31, 1996, Corporation T files an election to be an S corporation that is to be effective for its taxable year beginning on January 1, 1996. In order for the S election to be effective for the 1996 taxable year, the QSST election must be effective January 1, 1996, and must be filed within the period beginning on January 1, 1996, and ending March 16, 1996 (the 16-day-and-2-month period beginning on the first day of the first taxable year for which the election to be an S corporation is intended to be effective).
(ii)
QSST election when the S election is filed late.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 9,
except that Corporation T's election to be an S corporation is filed on April 1, 1996 (after the 15th day of the 3rd month of the first taxable year for which it is to be effective but before the end of that taxable year). Because the election to be an S corporation is not timely filed for the 1996 taxable year, under section 1362(b)(3), the S election is treated as made for the taxable year beginning on January 1, 1997. The QSST election must be filed within the 16-day-and-2-month period beginning on April 1, 1996, the date the S election was made, and ending on June 16, 1996.

# Example 10.
(i)
Transfers to QTIP trust.
On June 1, 1996, A transferred S corporation stock to a trust for the benefit of A's spouse B, the terms of which satisfy the requirements of section 2523(f)(2) as qualified terminable interest property. Under the terms of the trust, B is the sole income beneficiary for life. In addition, corpus may be distributed to B, at the trustee's discretion, during B's lifetime. However, under section 677(a), A is treated as the owner of the trust. Accordingly, the trust is a permitted shareholder of the S corporation under section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i), and A is treated as the shareholder for purposes of sections 1361(b)(1), 1366, 1367, and 1368.
(ii)
Transfers to QTIP trust where husband and wife divorce.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 10,
except that A and B divorce on May 2, 1997. Under section 682, A ceases to be treated as the owner of the trust under section 677(a) because A and B are no longer husband and wife. Under section 682, after the divorce, B is the income beneficiary of the trust and corpus of the trust may only be distributed to B. Accordingly, assuming the trust otherwise meets the requirements of section 1361(d)(3), B must make the QSST election within 2 months and 15 days after the date of the divorce.
(iii)
Transfers to QTIP trust where no corpus distribution is permitted.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 10,
except that the terms of the trust do not permit corpus to be distributed to B and require its retention by the trust for distribution to A and B's surviving children after the death of B. Under section 677, A is treated as the owner of the ordinary income portion of the trust, but the trust will be subject to tax on gross income allocable to corpus. Accordingly, the trust does not qualify as an eligible shareholder of the S corporation because it is neither a qualified subpart E trust nor a QSST.
(2)
Effective date
—(i)
In general.
Paragraph (a) of this section, and paragraphs (c) through (k) of this section (as contained in the 26 CFR edition revised April 1, 2003) apply to taxable years of a corporation beginning after July 21, 1995. For taxable years beginning on or before July 21, 1995, to which paragraph (a) of this section and paragraphs (c) through (k) of this section (as contained in the 26 CFR edition revised April 1, 2003) do not apply, see § 18.1361-1 of this chapter (as contained in the 26 CFR edition revised April 1, 1995). However, paragraphs (h)(1)(vi), (h)(3)(i)(F), (h)(3)(ii), and (j)(12) of this section (as contained in the 26 CFR edition revised April 1, 2003) are applicable for taxable years beginning on and after May 14, 2002. Otherwise, paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (f), (h)(1)(ii), (h)(1)(iv), (h)(3)(i)(B), (h)(3)(i)(D), (h)(3)(ii)(A), (h)(3)(ii)(B), (j)(6)(iii)(C), (j)(6)(iii)(D), (j)(7)(ii), and (k)(1)
Example 2
(ii) fourth and last sentences,
Example 3,
and
Example 4
(iii) of this section apply on and after July 17, 2003. Paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (e)(1), (e)(3), (h)(1)(vii), (h)(3)(i)(G), and the fifth sentence of paragraph (j)(8) are effective on
August 14, 2008.
(ii)
Transition rules.
Taxpayers may apply paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(B) of this section on and after December 24, 2002, and before July 17, 2003, to treat a trust as a testamentary trust, but not during any period for which a QSST or ESBT election was in effect for the trust. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge the treatment of a trust described in paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(B) of this section as a permitted shareholder of an S corporation for periods after August 5, 1997, and before the earlier of July 17, 2003, or the effective date of any QSST or ESBT election for that trust.
(iii)
Exception.
If a QSST has sold or otherwise disposed of all or a portion of its S corporation stock in a tax year that is open for the QSST and the income beneficiary but on or before July 21, 1995, the QSST and the income beneficiary may both treat the transaction as if the beneficiary was the owner of the stock sold or disposed of, and thus recognize any gain or loss, or as if the QSST was the owner of the stock sold or disposed of as described in paragraph (j)(8) of this section. This exception applies only if the QSST and the income beneficiary take consistent reporting positions. The QSST and the income
beneficiary must disclose by a statement on their respective returns (or amended returns), that they are taking consistent reporting positions.
(l)
Classes of stock
—(1)
General rule.
A corporation that has more than one class of stock does not qualify as a small business corporation. Except as provided in paragraph (l)(4) of this section (relating to instruments, obligations, or arrangements treated as a second class of stock), a corporation is treated as having only one class of stock if all outstanding shares of stock of the corporation confer identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds. Differences in voting rights among shares of stock of a corporation are disregarded in determining whether a corporation has more than one class of stock. Thus, if all shares of stock of an S corporation have identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds, the corporation may have voting and nonvoting common stock, a class of stock that may vote only on certain issues, irrevocable proxy agreements, or groups of shares that differ with respect to rights to elect members of the board of directors.
(2)
Determination of whether stock confers identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds
—(i)
In general.
The determination of whether all outstanding shares of stock confer identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds is made based on the corporate charter, articles of incorporation, bylaws, applicable state law, and binding agreements relating to distribution and liquidation proceeds (collectively, the governing provisions). A commercial contractual agreement, such as a lease, employment agreement, or loan agreement, is not a binding agreement relating to distribution and liquidation proceeds and thus is not a governing provision unless a principal purpose of the agreement is to circumvent the one class of stock requirement of section 1361(b)(1)(D) and this paragraph (l). Although a corporation is not treated as having more than one class of stock so long as the governing provisions provide for identical distribution and liquidation rights, any distributions (including actual, constructive, or deemed distributions) that differ in timing or amount are to be given appropriate tax effect in accordance with the facts and circumstances.
(ii)
State law requirements for payment and withholding of income tax.
State laws may require a corporation to pay or withhold state income taxes on behalf of some or all of the corporation's shareholders. Such laws are disregarded in determining whether all outstanding shares of stock of the corporation confer identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds, within the meaning of paragraph (l)(1) of this section, provided that, when the constructive distributions resulting from the payment or withholding of taxes by the corporation are taken into account, the outstanding shares confer identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds. A difference in timing between the constructive distributions and the actual distributions to the other shareholders does not cause the corporation to be treated as having more than one class of stock.
(iii)
Buy-sell and redemption agreements
—(A)
In general.
Buy-sell agreements among shareholders, agreements restricting the transferability of stock, and redemption agreements are disregarded in determining whether a corporation's outstanding shares of stock confer identical distribution and liquidation rights unless—
(
1
) A principal purpose of the agreement is to circumvent the one class of stock requirement of section 1361(b)(1)(D) and this paragraph (l), and
(
2
) The agreement establishes a purchase price that, at the time the agreement is entered into, is significantly in excess of or below the fair market value of the stock.
Agreements that provide for the purchase or redemption of stock at book value or at a price between fair market value and book value are not considered to establish a price that is significantly in excess of or below the fair market value of the stock and, thus, are disregarded in determining whether the outstanding shares of stock confer identical rights. For purposes of this paragraph (l)(2)(iii)(A), a good faith determination of fair market value will be respected unless it can be shown that the value was substantially in error and the determination of the
value was not performed with reasonable diligence. Although an agreement may be disregarded in determining whether shares of stock confer identical distribution and liquidation rights, payments pursuant to the agreement may have income or transfer tax consequences.
(B)
Exception for certain agreements.
Bona fide agreements to redeem or purchase stock at the time of death, divorce, disability, or termination of employment are disregarded in determining whether a corporation's shares of stock confer identical rights. In addition, if stock that is substantially nonvested (within the meaning of § 1.83-3(b)) is treated as outstanding under these regulations, the forfeiture provisions that cause the stock to be substantially nonvested are disregarded. Furthermore, the Commissioner may provide by Revenue Ruling or other published guidance that other types of bona fide agreements to redeem or purchase stock are disregarded.
(C)
Safe harbors for determinations of book value.
A determination of book value will be respected if—
(
1
) The book value is determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (including permitted optional adjustments); or
(
2
) The book value is used for any substantial nontax purpose.
(iv)
Distributions that take into account varying interests in stock during a taxable year.
A governing provision does not, within the meaning of paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, alter the rights to liquidation and distribution proceeds conferred by an S corporation's stock merely because the governing provision provides that, as a result of a change in stock ownership, distributions in a taxable year are to be made on the basis of the shareholders' varying interests in the S corporation's income in the current or immediately preceding taxable year. If distributions pursuant to the provision are not made within a reasonable time after the close of the taxable year in which the varying interests occur, the distributions may be recharacterized depending on the facts and circumstances, but will not result in a second class of stock.
(v)
Special rule for section 338(h)(10) elections.
If the shareholders of an S corporation sell their stock in a transaction for which an election is made under section 338(h)(10) and § 1.338(h)(10)-1, the receipt of varying amounts per share by the shareholders will not cause the S corporation to have more than one class of stock, provided that the varying amounts are determined in arm's length negotiations with the purchaser.
(vi)
Examples.
The application of paragraph (l)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. In each of the examples, the S corporation requirements of section 1361 are satisfied except as otherwise stated, the corporation has in effect an S election under section 1362, and the corporation has only the shareholders described.

# Example 1. Determination of whether stock confers identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds.
(i) The law of State A requires that permission be obtained from the State Commissioner of Corporations before stock may be issued by a corporation. The Commissioner grants permission to S, a corporation, to issue its stock subject to the restriction that any person who is issued stock in exchange for property, and not cash, must waive all rights to receive distributions until the shareholders who contributed cash for stock have received distributions in the amount of their cash contributions.
(ii) The condition imposed by the Commissioner pursuant to state law alters the rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds conferred by the outstanding stock of S so that those rights are not identical. Accordingly, under paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, S is treated as having more than one class of stock and does not qualify as a small business corporation.

# Example 2. Distributions that differ in timing.
(i) S, a corporation, has two equal shareholders, A and B. Under S's bylaws, A and B are entitled to equal distributions. S distributes $50,000 to A in the current year, but does not distribute $50,000 to B until one year later. The circumstances indicate that the difference in timing did not occur by reason of a binding agreement relating to distribution or liquidation proceeds.
(ii) Under paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, the difference in timing of the distributions to A and B does not cause S to be treated as having more than one class of stock. However, section 7872 or other recharacterization principles may apply to determine the appropriate tax consequences.

# Example 3. Treatment of excessive compensation.
(i) S, a corporation, has two equal shareholders, C and D, who are each employed by S and have binding employment agreements with S. The compensation paid by S to C under C's employment agreement is reasonable. The compensation paid by S to D under D's employment agreement, however, is found to be excessive. The facts and circumstances do not reflect that a principal purpose to D's employment agreement is to circumvent the one class of stock requirement of section 1361(b)(1)(D) and this paragraph (l).
(ii) Under paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, the employment agreements are not governing provisions. Accordingly, S is not treated as having more than one class of stock by reason of the employment agreements, even though S is not allowed a deduction for the excessive compensation paid to D.

# Example 4. Agreement to pay fringe benefits.
(i) S, a corporation, is required under binding agreements to pay accident and health insurance premiums on behalf of certain of its employees who are also shareholders. Different premium amounts are paid by S for each employee-shareholder. The facts and circumstances do not reflect that a principal purpose of the agreements is to circumvent the one class of stock requirement of section 1361(b)(1)(D) and this paragraph (l).
(ii) Under paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, the agreements are not governing provisions. Accordingly, S is not treated as having more than one class of stock by reason of the agreements. In addition, S is not treated as having more than one class of stock by reason of the payment of fringe benefits.

# Example 5. Below-market corporation-shareholder loan.
(i) E is a shareholder of S, a corporation. S makes a below-market loan to E that is a corporation-shareholder loan to which section 7872 applies. Under section 7872, E is deemed to receive a distribution with respect to S stock by reason of the loan. The facts and circumstances do not reflect that a principal purpose of the loan is to circumvent the one class of stock requirement of section 1361(b)(1)(D) and this paragraph (l).
(ii) Under paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, the loan agreement is not a governing provision. Accordingly, S is not treated as having more than one class of stock by reason of the below-market loan to E.

# Example 6. Agreement to adjust distributions for state tax burdens.
(i) S, a corporation, executes a binding agreement with its shareholders to modify its normal distribution policy by making upward adjustments of its distributions to those shareholders who bear heavier state tax burdens. The adjustments are based on a formula that will give the shareholders equal after-tax distributions.
(ii) The binding agreement relates to distribution or liquidation proceeds. The agreement is thus a governing provision that alters the rights conferred by the outstanding stock of S to distribution proceeds so that those rights are not identical. Therefore, under paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section, S is treated as having more than one class of stock.

# Example 7. State law requirements for payment and withholding of income tax.
(i) The law of State X requires corporations to pay state income taxes on behalf of nonresident shareholders. The law of State X does not require corporations to pay state income taxes on behalf of resident shareholders. S is incorporated in State X. S's resident shareholders have the right (for example, under the law of State X or pursuant to S's bylaws or a binding agreement) to distributions that take into account the payments S makes on behalf of its nonresident shareholders.
(ii) The payment by S of state income taxes on behalf of its nonresident shareholders are generally treated as constructive distributions to those shareholders. Because S's resident shareholders have the right to equal distributions, taking into account the constructive distributions to the nonresident shareholders, S's shares confer identical rights to distribution proceeds. Accordingly, under paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this section, the state law requiring S to pay state income taxes on behalf of its nonresident shareholders is disregarded in determining whether S has more than one class of stock.
(iii) The same result would follow if the payments of state income taxes on behalf of nonresident shareholders are instead treated as advances to those shareholders and the governing provisions require the advances to be repaid or offset by reductions in distributions to those shareholders.

# Example 8. Redemption agreements.
(i) F, G, and H are shareholders of S, a corporation. F is also an employee of S. By agreement, S is to redeem F's shares on the termination of F's employment.
(ii) On these facts, under paragraph (l)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the agreement is disregarded in determining whether all outstanding shares of S's stock confer identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds.

# Example 9. Analysis of redemption agreements.
(i) J, K, and L are shareholders of S, a corporation. L is also an employee of S. L's shares were not issued to L in connection with the performance of services. By agreement, S is to redeem L's shares for an amount significantly below their fair market value on the termination of L's employment or if S's sales fall below certain levels.
(ii) Under paragraph (l)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the portion of the agreement providing for redemption of L's stock on termination of employment is disregarded. Under
paragraph (l)(2)(iii)(A), the portion of the agreement providing for redemption of L's stock if S's sales fall below certain levels is disregarded unless a principal purpose of that portion of the agreement is to circumvent the one class of stock requirement of section 1361(b)(1)(D) and this paragraph (l).
(3)
Stock taken into account.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b) (3), (4), and (5) of this section (relating to restricted stock, deferred compensation plans, and straight debt), in determining whether all outstanding shares of stock confer identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds, all outstanding shares of stock of a corporation are taken into account. For example, substantially nonvested stock with respect to which an election under section 83(b) has been made is taken into account in determining whether a corporation has a second class of stock, and such stock is not treated as a second class of stock if the stock confers rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds that are identical, within the meaning of paragraph (l)(1) of this section, to the rights conferred by the other outstanding shares of stock.
(4)
Other instruments, obligations, or arrangements treated as a second class of stock
—(i)
In general.
Instruments, obligations, or arrangements are not treated as a second class of stock for purposes of this paragraph (l) unless they are described in paragraph (l)(5) (ii) or (iii) of this section. However, in no event are instruments, obligations, or arrangements described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section (relating to deferred compensation plans), paragraphs (l)(4)(iii) (B) and (C) of this section (relating to the exceptions and safe harbor for options), paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(B) of this section (relating to the safe harbors for certain short-term unwritten advances and proportionally-held debt), or paragraph (l)(5) of this section (relating to the safe harbor for straight debt), treated as a second class of stock for purposes of this paragraph (l).
(ii)
Instruments, obligations, or arrangements treated as equity under general principles
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (l)(4)(i) of this section, any instrument, obligation, or arrangement issued by a corporation (other than outstanding shares of stock described in paragraph (l)(3) of this section), regardless of whether designated as debt, is treated as a second class of stock of the corporation—
(
1
) If the instrument, obligation, or arrangement constituters equity or otherwise results in the holder being treated as the owner of stock under general principles of Federal tax law; and
(
2
) A principal purpose of issuing or entering into the instrument, obligation, or arrangement is to circumvent the rights to distribution or liquidation proceeds conferred by the outstanding shares of stock or to circumvent the limitation on eligible shareholders contained in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(B)
Safe harbor for certain short-term unwritten advances and proportionately held obligations
—(
1
)
Short-term unwritten advances.
Unwritten advances from a shareholder that do not exceed $10,000 in the aggregate at any time during the taxable year of the corporation, are treated as debt by the parties, and are expected to be repaid within a reasonable time are not treated as a second class of stock for that taxable year, even if the advances are considered equity under general principles of Federal tax law. The failure of an unwritten advance to meet this safe harbor will not result in a second class of stock unless the advance is considered equity under paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section and a principal purpose of the advance is to circumvent the rights of the outstanding shares of stock or the limitation on eligible shareholders under paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section.
(
2
)
Proportionately-held obligations.
Obligations of the same class that are considered equity under general principles of Federal tax law, but are owned solely by the owners of, and in the same proportion as, the outstanding stock of the corporation, are not treated as a second class of stock. Furthermore, an obligation or obligations owned by the sole shareholder of a corporation are always held proportionately to the corporation's outstanding stock. The obligations that are considered equity that do not meet this safe harbor will not result in a second class of stock unless a principal purpose of the obligations is to circumvent the rights of the outstanding
shares of stock or the limitation on eligible shareholders under paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section.
(iii)
Certain call options, warrants or similar instruments
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (l)(4)(iii), a call option, warrant, or similar instrument (collectively, call option) issued by a corporation is treated as a second class of stock of the corporation if, taking into account all the facts and circumstances, the call option is substantially certain to be exercised (by the holder or a potential transferee) and has a strike price substantially below the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date that the call option is issued, transferred by a person who is an eligible shareholder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to a person who is not an eligible shareholder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or materially modified. For purposes of this paragraph (l)(4)(iii), if an option is issued in connection with a loan and the time period in which the option can be exercised is extended in connection with (and consistent with) a modification of the terms of the loan, the extension of the time period in which the option may be exercised is not considered a material modification. In addition, a call option does not have a strike price substantially below fair market value if the price at the time of exercise cannot, pursuant to the terms of the instrument, be substantially below the fair market value of the underlying stock at the time of exercise.
(B)
Certain exceptions.
(
1
) A call option is not treated as a second class of stock for purposes of this paragraph (l) if it is issued to a person that is actively and regularly engaged in the business of lending and issued in connection with a commercially reasonable loan to the corporation. This paragraph (l)(4)(iii)(B)(
1
) continues to apply if the call option is transferred with the loan (or if a portion of the call option is transferred with a corresponding portion of the loan). However, if the call option is transferred without a corresponding portion of the loan, this paragraph (l)(4)(iii)(B)(
1
) ceases to apply. Upon that transfer, the call option is tested under paragraph (l)(4)(iii)(A) (notwithstanding anything in that paragraph to the contrary) if, but for this paragraph, the call option would have been treated as a second class of stock on the date it was issued.
(
2
) A call option that is issued to an individual who is either an employee or an independent contractor in connection with the performance of services for the corporation or a related corporation (and that is not excessive by reference to the services performed) is not treated as a second class of stock for purposes of this paragraph (l) if—
(
i
) The call option is nontransferable within the meaning of § 1.83-3(d); and
(
ii
) The call option does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value as defined in § 1.83-7(b) at the time the option is issued.
If the call option becomes transferable, this paragraph (l)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) ceases to apply. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (l)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
), a corporation is related to the issuing corporation if more than 50 percent of the total voting power and total value of its stock is owned by the issuing corporation.
(
3
) The Commissioner may provide other exceptions by Revenue Ruling or other published guidance.
(C)
Safe harbor for certain options.
A call option is not treated as a second class of stock if, on the date the call option is issued, transferred by a person who is an eligible shareholder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to a person who is not an eligible shareholder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or materially modified, the strike price of the call option is at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the underlying stock on that date. For purposes of this paragraph (l)(4)(iii)(C), a good faith determination of fair market value by the corporation will be respected unless it can be shown that the value was substantially in error and the determination of the value was not performed with reasonable diligence to obtain a fair value. Failure of an option to meet this safe harbor will not necessarily result in the option being treated as a second class of stock.
(iv)
Convertible debt.
A convertible debt instrument is considered a second class of stock if—
(A) It would be treated as a second class of stock under paragraph (l)(4)(ii)
of this section (relating to instruments, obligations, or arrangements treated as equity under general principles); or
(B) It embodies rights equivalent to those of a call option that would be treated as a second class of stock under paragraph (l)(4)(iii) of this section (relating to certain call options, warrants, and similar instruments).
(v)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (l)(4) may be illustrated by the following examples. In each of the examples, the S corporation requirements of section 1361 are satisfied except as otherwise stated, the corporation has in effect an S election under section 1362, and the corporation has only the shareholders described.

# Example 1. Transfer of call option by eligible shareholder to ineligible shareholder.
(i) S, a corporation, has 10 shareholders. S issues call options to A, B, and C, individuals who are U.S. residents. A, B, and C are not shareholders, employees, or independent contractors of S. The options have a strike price of $40 and are issued on a date when the fair market value of S stock is also $40. A year later, P, a partnership, purchases A's option. On the date of transfer, the fair market value of S stock is $80.
(ii) On the date the call option is issued, its strike price is not substantially below the fair market value of the S stock. Under paragraph (l)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, whether a call option is a second class of stock must be redetermined if the call option is transferred by a person who is an eligible shareholder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to a person who is not an eligible shareholder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In this case, A is an eligible shareholder of S under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but P is not. Accordingly, the option is retested on the date it is transferred to D.
(iii) Because on the date the call option is transferred to P its strike price is 50% of the fair market value, the strike price is substantially below the fair market value of the S stock. Accordingly, the call option is treated as a second class of stock as of the date it is transferred to P if, at that time, it is determined that the option is substantially certain to be exercised. The determination of whether the option is substantially certain to be exercised is made on the basis of all the facts and circumstances.

# Example 2. Call option issued in connection with the performance of services.
(i) E is a bona fide employee of S, a corporation. S issues to E a call option in connection with E's performance of services. At the time the call option is issued, it is not transferable and does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value. However, the call option becomes transferable before it is exercised by E.
(ii) While the option is not transferable, under paragraph (l)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section, it is not treated as a second class of stock, regardless of its strike price. When the option becomes transferable, that paragraph ceases to apply, and the general rule of paragraph (l)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies. Accordingly, if the option is materially modified or is transferred to a person who is not an eligible shareholder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and on the date of such modification or transfer, the option is substantially certain to be exercised and has a strike price substantially below the fair market value of the underlying stock, the option is treated as a second class of stock.
(iii) If E left S's employment before the option became transferable, the exception provided by paragraph (l)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) would continue to apply until the option became transferable.
(5)
Straight debt safe harbor
—(i)
In general.
Notwithstanding paragraph (l)(4) of this section, straight debt is not treated as a second class of stock. For purposes of section 1361(c)(5) and this section, the term straight debt means a written unconditional obligation, regardless of whether embodied in a formal note, to pay a sum certain on demand, or on a specified due date, which—
(A) Does not provide for an interest rate or payment dates that are contingent on profits, the borrower's discretion, the payment of dividends with respect to common stock, or similar factors;
(B) Is not convertible (directly or indirectly) into stock or any other equity interest of the S corporation; and
(C) Is held by an individual (other than a nonresident alien), an estate, or a trust described in section 1361(c)(2).
(ii)
Subordination.
The fact that an obligation is subordinated to other debt of the corporation does not prevent the obligation from qualifying as straight debt.
(iii)
Modification or transfer.
An obligation that originally qualifies as straight debt ceases to so qualify if the obligation—
(A) Is materially modified so that it no longer satisfies the definition of straight debt; or
(B) Is transferred to a third party who is not an eligible shareholder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(iv)
Treatment of straight debt for other purposes.
An obligation of an S corporation that satisfies the definition of straight debt in paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section is not treated as a second class of stock even if it is considered equity under general principles of Federal tax law. Such an obligation is generally treated as debt and when so treated is subject to the applicable rules governing indebtedness for other purposes of the Code. Accordingly, interest paid or accrued with respect to a straight debt obligation is generally treated as interest by the corporation and the recipient and does not constitute a distribution to which section 1368 applies. However, if a straight debt obligation bears a rate of interest that is unreasonably high, an appropriate portion of the interest may be recharacterized and treated as a payment that is not interest. Such a recharacterization does not result in a second class of stock.
(v)
Treatment of C corporation debt upon conversion to S status.
If a C corporation has outstanding an obligation that satisfies the definition of straight debt in paragraph (l)(5)(i) of this section, but that is considered equity under general principles of Federal tax law, the obligation is not treated as a second class of stock for purposes of this section if the C corporation converts to S status. In addition, the conversion from C corporation status to S corporation status is not treated as an exchange of debt for stock with respect to such an instrument.
(6)
Inadvertent terminations.
See section 1362(f) and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to inadvertent terminations in cases where the one class of stock requirement has been inadvertently breached.
(7)
Effective date.
Section 1.1361-1(l) generally applies to taxable years of a corporation beginning on or after May 28, 1992. However, § 1.1361-1(l) does not apply to: an instrument, obligation, or arrangement issued or entered into before May 28, 1992, and not materially modified after that date; a buy-sell agreement, redemption agreement, or agreement restricting transferability entered into before May 28, 1992, and not materially modified after that date; or a call option or similar instrument issued before May 28, 1992, and not materially modified after that date. In addition, a corporation and its shareholders may apply this § 1.1361-1(l) to prior taxable years.
(m)
Electing small business trust (ESBT)
—(1)
Definition
—(i)
General rule.
An electing small business trust (ESBT) means any trust if it meets the following requirements: the trust does not have as a beneficiary any person other than an individual, an estate, an organization described in section 170(c)(2) through (5), or an organization described in section 170(c)(1) that holds a contingent interest in such trust and is not a potential current beneficiary; no interest in the trust has been acquired by purchase; and the trustee of the trust makes a timely ESBT election for the trust.
(ii)
Qualified beneficiaries
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this section, a beneficiary includes a person who has a present, remainder, or reversionary interest in the trust.
(B)
Distributee trusts.
A distributee trust is the beneficiary of the ESBT only if the distributee trust is an organization described in section 170(c)(2) or (3). In all other situations, any person who has a beneficial interest in a distributee trust is a beneficiary of the ESBT. A distributee trust is a trust that receives or may receive a distribution from an ESBT, whether the rights to receive the distribution are fixed or contingent, or immediate or deferred.
(C)
Powers of appointment.
A person in whose favor a power of appointment could be exercised is not a beneficiary of an ESBT until the holder of the power of appointment actually exercises the power in favor of such person.
(D)
Nonresident aliens.
A nonresident alien (NRA), as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(B), is an eligible beneficiary of an ESBT and an eligible potential current beneficiary.
(iii)
Interests acquired by purchase.
A trust does not qualify as an ESBT if any interest in the trust has been acquired by purchase. Generally, if a person acquires an interest in the trust and thereby becomes a beneficiary of the trust as defined in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(A), and any portion of the basis in the acquired interest in the trust is determined under section 1012,
such interest has been acquired by purchase. This includes a net gift of a beneficial interest in the trust, in which the person acquiring the beneficial interest pays the gift tax. The trust itself may acquire S corporation stock or other property by purchase or in a part-gift, part-sale transaction.
(iv)
Ineligible trusts.
An ESBT does not include—
(A) Any qualified subchapter S trust (as defined in section 1361(d)(3)) if an election under section 1361(d)(2) applies with respect to any corporation the stock of which is held by the trust;
(B) Any trust exempt from tax or not subject to tax under subtitle A; or
(C) Any charitable remainder annuity trust or charitable remainder unitrust (as defined in section 664(d)).
(2)
ESBT election
—(i)
In general.
The trustee of the trust must make the ESBT election by signing and filing, with the service center where the S corporation files its income tax return, a statement that meets the requirements of paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section. If there is more than one trustee, the trustee or trustees with authority to legally bind the trust must sign the election statement. If any one of several trustees can legally bind the trust, only one trustee needs to sign the election statement. Generally, only one ESBT election is made for the trust, regardless of the number of S corporations whose stock is held by the ESBT. However, if the ESBT holds stock in multiple S corporations that file in different service centers, the ESBT election must be filed with all the relevant service centers where the corporations file their income tax returns. This requirement applies only at the time of the initial ESBT election; if the ESBT later acquires stock in an S corporation which files its income tax return at a different service center, a new ESBT election is not required.
(ii)
Election statement.
The election statement must include—
(A) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the trust, the potential current beneficiaries, and the S corporations in which the trust currently holds stock. If the trust includes a power described in paragraph (m)(4)(vi)(B) of this section, then the election statement must include a statement that such a power is included in the instrument, but does not need to include the name, address, or taxpayer identification number of any particular charity or any other information regarding the power.
(B) An identification of the election as an ESBT election made under section 1361(e)(3);
(C) The first date on which the trust owned stock in each S corporation;
(D) The date on which the election is to become effective (not earlier than 15 days and two months before the date on which the election is filed); and
(E) Representations signed by the trustee stating that—
(
1
) The trust meets the definitional requirements of section 1361(e)(1); and
(
2
) All potential current beneficiaries of the trust meet the shareholder requirements of section 1361(b)(1); for the purpose of this paragraph (m)(2)(ii)(E)(
2
), an NRA potential current beneficiary does not violate the requirement under section 1361(b)(1)(C) that an S corporation cannot have an NRA as a shareholder.
(iii)
Due date for ESBT election.
The ESBT election must be filed within the time requirements prescribed in paragraph (j)(6)(iii) of this section for filing a qualified subchapter S trust (QSST) election.
(iv)
Election by a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii).
A trust that is a qualified S corporation shareholder under section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii) may elect ESBT treatment at any time during the 2-year period described in those sections or the 16-day-and-2-month period beginning on the date after the end of the 2-year period. If the trust makes an ineffective ESBT election, the trust will continue nevertheless to qualify as an eligible S corporation shareholder for the remainder of the period described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii).
(v)
No protective election.
A trust cannot make a conditional ESBT election that would be effective only in the event the trust fails to meet the requirements for an eligible trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i) through (iv). If a trust attempts to make such a conditional ESBT election and it fails to qualify as an eligible S
corporation shareholder under section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i) through (iv), the S corporation election will be ineffective or will terminate because the corporation will have an ineligible shareholder. Relief may be available under section 1362(f) for an inadvertent ineffective S corporation election or an inadvertent S corporation election termination. In addition, a trust that qualifies as an ESBT may make an ESBT election notwithstanding that the trust is a wholly-owned grantor trust.
(3)
Effect of ESBT election
—(i)
General rule.
If a trust makes a valid ESBT election, the trust will be treated as an ESBT for purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code as of the effective date of the ESBT election.
(ii)
Employer Identification Number.
An ESBT has only one employer identification number (EIN). If an existing trust makes an ESBT election, the trust continues to use the EIN it currently uses.
(iii)
Taxable year.
If an ESBT election is effective on a day other than the first day of the trust's taxable year, the ESBT election does not cause the trust's taxable year to close. The termination of the ESBT election (including a termination caused by a conversion of the ESBT to a QSST) other than on the last day of the trust's taxable year also does not cause the trust's taxable year to close. In either case, the trust files one tax return for the taxable year.
(iv)
Allocation of S corporation items.
If, during the taxable year of an S corporation, a trust is an ESBT for part of the year and an eligible shareholder under section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i) through (iv) for the rest of the year, the S corporation items are allocated between the two types of trusts under section 1377(a). See § 1.1377-1(a)(2)(iii).
(v)
Estimated taxes.
If an ESBT election is effective on a day other than the first day of the trust's taxable year, the trust is considered one trust for purposes of estimated taxes under section 6654.
(4)
Potential current beneficiaries
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining whether a corporation is a small business corporation within the meaning of section 1361(b)(1), each potential current beneficiary of an ESBT generally is treated as a shareholder of the corporation. Subject to the provisions of this paragraph (m)(4), a potential current beneficiary generally is, with respect to any period, any person who at any time during such period is entitled to, or in the discretion of any person may receive, a distribution from the principal or income of the trust. A person is treated as a shareholder of the S corporation at any moment in time when that person is entitled to, or in the discretion of any person may, receive a distribution of principal or income of the trust. No person is treated as a potential current beneficiary solely because that person holds any future interest in the trust. An NRA potential current beneficiary of an ESBT is treated as a shareholder for purposes of the 100-shareholder limit under section 1361(b)(1)(A). However, an NRA potential current beneficiary of an ESBT is not treated as a shareholder in determining whether a corporation is a small business corporation for purposes of the NRA-shareholder prohibition under section 1361(b)(1)(C).
(ii)
Grantor trusts.
If all or a portion of an ESBT is treated as owned by a person under subpart E, part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, such owner is a potential current beneficiary in addition to persons described in paragraph (m)(4)(i) of this section.
(iii)
Special rule for dispositions of stock.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (m)(4)(i) of this section, if a trust disposes of all of the stock which it holds in an S corporation, then, with respect to that corporation, any person who first met the definition of a potential current beneficiary during the 1-year period ending on the date of such disposition is not a potential current beneficiary and thus is not a shareholder of that corporation.
(iv)
Distributee trusts
—(A)
In general.
This paragraph (m)(4)(iv) contains the rules for determining who are the potential current beneficiaries of an ESBT if a distributee trust becomes entitled to, or at the discretion of any person, may receive a distribution from principal or income of an ESBT. A distributee trust does not include a trust that is not currently in existence. For this purpose, a trust is not currently in
existence if the trust has no assets and no items of income, loss, deduction, or credit. Thus, if a trust instrument provides for a trust to be funded at some future time, the future trust is not currently a distributee trust.
(B) If the distributee trust is not a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A), then the distributee trust is the potential current beneficiary of the ESBT and the corporation's S corporation election terminates.
(C) If the distributee trust is a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A), the persons who would be its potential current beneficiaries (as defined in paragraphs (m)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section) if the distributee trust were an ESBT are treated as the potential current beneficiaries of the ESBT. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, however, if the distributee trust is a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii), the estate described in section 1361(c)(2)(B) (ii) or (iii) is treated as the potential current beneficiary of the ESBT for the 2-year period during which such trust would be permitted as a shareholder.
(D) For the purposes of paragraph (m)(4)(iv)(C) of this section, a trust will be deemed to be described in section 1361(c)(2)(A) if such trust would qualify for a QSST election under section 1361(d) or an ESBT election under section 1361(e) if it owned S corporation stock.
(v)
Contingent distributions.
A person who is entitled to receive a distribution only after a specified time or upon the occurrence of a specified event (such as the death of the holder of a power of appointment) is not a potential current beneficiary until such time or the occurrence of such event.
(vi)
Currently exercisable powers of appointment and other powers
—(A)
Powers of appointment.
A person to whom a distribution may be made during any period pursuant to a power of appointment (as described for transfer tax purposes in section 2041 and § 20.2041-1(b) of this chapter and section 2514 and § 25.2514-1(b) of this chapter) is not a potential current beneficiary unless the power is exercised in favor of that person during the period. It is immaterial for purposes of this paragraph (m)(4)(vi)(A) whether such power of appointment is a “general power of appointment” for transfer tax purposes as described in §§ 20.2041-1(c) and 25.2514-1(c) of this chapter. The mere existence of one or more powers of appointment during the lifetime of a power holder that would permit current distributions from the trust to be made to more than the number of persons described in section 1361(b)(1)(A) or to a person described in section 1361(b)(1)(B) or (C) will not cause the S corporation election to terminate unless one or more of such powers are exercised, collectively, in favor of an excessive number of persons or in favor of a person who is ineligible to be an S corporation shareholder. For purposes of this paragraph (m)(4)(vi)(A), a “power of appointment” includes a power, regardless of by whom held, to add a beneficiary or class of beneficiaries to the class of potential current beneficiaries, but generally does not include a power held by a fiduciary who is not also a beneficiary of the trust to spray or sprinkle trust distributions among beneficiaries. Nothing in this paragraph (m)(4)(vi)(A) alters the definition of “power of appointment” for purposes of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations.
(B)
Powers to distribute to certain organizations not pursuant to powers of appointment.
If a trustee or other fiduciary has a power (that does not constitute a power of appointment for transfer tax purposes as described in §§ 20.2041-1(b) and 25.2514-1(b) of this chapter) to make distributions from the trust to one or more members of a class of organizations described in section 1361(c)(6), such organizations will be counted collectively as only one potential current beneficiary for purposes of this paragraph (m), except that each organization receiving a distribution also will be counted as a potential current beneficiary. This paragraph (m)(4)(vi)(B) shall not apply to a power to currently distribute to one or more particular charitable organizations described in section 1361(c)(6). Each of such organizations is a potential current beneficiary of the trust.
(vii)
Number of shareholders.
Each potential current beneficiary of the ESBT, as defined in paragraphs
(m)(4)(i) through (vi) of this section, is counted as a shareholder of any S corporation whose stock is owned by the ESBT. During any period in which the ESBT has no potential current beneficiaries, the ESBT is counted as the shareholder. A person is counted as only one shareholder of an S corporation even though that person may be treated as a shareholder of the S corporation by direct ownership and through one or more eligible trusts described in section 1361(c)(2)(A). Thus, for example, if a person owns stock in an S corporation and is a potential current beneficiary of an ESBT that owns stock in the same S corporation, that person is counted as one shareholder of the S corporation. Similarly, if a husband owns stock in an S corporation and his wife is a potential current beneficiary of an ESBT that owns stock in the same S corporation, the husband and wife will be counted as one shareholder of the S corporation.
(viii)
Miscellaneous.
Payments made by an ESBT to a third party on behalf of a beneficiary are considered to be payments made directly to the beneficiary. The right of a beneficiary to assign the beneficiary's interest to a third party does not result in the third party being a potential current beneficiary until that interest is actually assigned.
(5)
ESBT terminations
—(i)
Ceasing to meet ESBT requirements.
A trust ceases to be an ESBT on the first day the trust fails to meet the definition of an ESBT under section 1361(e). The last day the trust is treated as an ESBT is the day before the date on which the trust fails to meet the definition of an ESBT.
(ii)
Disposition of S stock.
In general, a trust ceases to be an ESBT on the first day following the day the trust disposes of all S corporation stock. However, if the trust is using the installment method to report income from the sale or disposition of its stock in an S corporation, the trust ceases to be an ESBT on the day following the earlier of the day the last installment payment is received by the trust or the day the trust disposes of the installment obligation.
(iii)
Potential current beneficiaries that are ineligible shareholders.
If a potential current beneficiary of an ESBT is not an eligible shareholder of a small business corporation within the meaning of section 1361(b)(1), the S corporation election terminates. For example, the S corporation election will terminate if a charitable remainder trust becomes a potential current beneficiary of an ESBT. Such a potential current beneficiary is treated as an ineligible shareholder beginning on the day such person becomes a potential current beneficiary, and the S corporation election terminates on that date. However,
see
the special rule of paragraph (m)(4)(iii) of this section. If the S corporation election terminates, relief may be available under section 1362(f).
(6)
Revocation of ESBT election.
An ESBT election may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. The application for consent to revoke the election must be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service in the form of a letter ruling request under the appropriate revenue procedure.
(7)
Converting an ESBT to a QSST.
For a trust that seeks to convert from an ESBT to a QSST, the consent of the Commissioner is hereby granted to revoke the ESBT election as of the effective date of the QSST election, if all the following requirements are met:
(i) The trust meets all of the requirements to be a QSST under section 1361(d).
(ii) The trustee and the current income beneficiary of the trust sign the QSST election. The QSST election must be filed with the service center where the S corporation files its income tax return. This QSST election must state at the top of the document “ATTENTION ENTITY CONTROL—CONVERSION OF AN ESBT TO A QSST PURSUANT TO SECTION 1.1361-1(m)” and include all information otherwise required for a QSST election under § 1.1361-1(j)(6). A separate QSST election must be made with respect to the stock of each S corporation held by the trust.
(iii) The trust has not converted from a QSST to an ESBT within the 36-month period preceding the effective date of the new QSST election.
(iv) The date on which the QSST election is to be effective cannot be more than 15 days and two months
prior to the date on which the election is filed and cannot be more than 12 months after the date on which the election is filed. If an election specifies an effective date more than 15 days and two months prior to the date on which the election is filed, it will be effective on the day that is 15 days and two months prior to the date on which it is filed. If an election specifies an effective date more than 12 months after the date on which the election is filed, it will be effective on the day that is 12 months after the date it is filed.
(8)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (m) are illustrated by the following examples in which it is assumed, unless otherwise specified, that all noncorporate persons are citizens or residents of the United States:
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
ESBT election with section 663(c) separate shares.
On January 1, 2003,
M
contributes S corporation stock to Trust for the benefit of
M
's three children
A, B,
and
C.
Pursuant to section 663(c), each of Trust's separate shares for
A, B,
and
C
will be treated as separate trusts for purposes of determining the amount of distributable net income (DNI) in the application of sections 661 and 662. On January 15, 2003, the trustee of Trust files a valid ESBT election for Trust effective January 1, 2003. Trust will be treated as a single ESBT and will have a single S portion taxable under section 641(c).
(B)
ESBT acquires stock of an additional S corporation.
On February 15, 2003, Trust acquires stock of an additional S corporation. Because Trust is already an ESBT, Trust does not need to make an additional ESBT election.
(C)
Section 663(c) shares of ESBT convert to separate QSSTs.
Effective January 1, 2004,
A, B, C,
and Trust's trustee elect to convert each separate share of Trust into a separate QSST pursuant to paragraph (m)(7) of this section. For each separate share, they file a separate election for each S corporation whose stock is held by Trust. Each separate share will be treated as a separate QSST.
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Invalid potential current beneficiary.
Effective January 1, 2005, Trust makes a valid ESBT election. On January 1, 2006, A, a partnership, becomes a potential current beneficiary of Trust. Trust does not dispose of all of its S corporation stock within one year after January 1, 2006. As of January 1, 2006,
A
is the potential current beneficiary of Trust and therefore is treated as a shareholder of the S corporation. Because
A
is not an eligible shareholder of an S corporation under section 1361(b)(1), the S corporation election of any corporation in which Trust holds stock terminates effective January 1, 2006. Relief may be available under section 1362(f).
(B)
Invalid potential current beneficiary and disposition of S stock.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2
in paragraph (m)(8)(ii)(A) of this section except that within one year after January 1, 2006, trustee of Trust disposes of all Trust's S corporation stock.
A
is not considered a potential current beneficiary of Trust and therefore is not treated as a shareholder of any S corporation in which Trust previously held stock.
(iii)
Example 3. Subpart E trust
.
M
transfers stock in
X,
an S corporation, and other assets to Trust for the benefit of
B
and
B
's siblings.
M
retains no powers or interest in Trust. Under section 678(a),
B
is treated as the owner of a portion of Trust that includes a portion of the
X
stock. No beneficiary has acquired any portion of his or her interest in Trust by purchase, and Trust is not an ineligible trust under paragraph (m)(1)(iv) of this section. Trust is eligible to make an ESBT election.
(iv)
Example 4. Subpart E trust continuing after grantor's death.
On January 1, 2003, M transfers stock in
X,
an S corporation, and other assets to Trust. Under the terms of Trust, the trustee of Trust has complete discretion to distribute the income or principal to
M
during
M
's lifetime and to
M
's children upon
M
's death. During
M
's life,
M
is treated as the owner of Trust under section 677. The trustee of Trust makes a valid election to treat Trust as an ESBT effective January 1, 2003. On March 28, 2004, M dies. Under applicable local law, Trust does not terminate on
M
's death. Trust continues to be an ESBT after
M
's death, and no additional ESBT election needs to be filed for Trust after
M
's death.
(v)
Example 5. Potential current beneficiaries and distributee trust holding S corporation stock.
Trust-1 has a valid ESBT election in effect. The trustee of
Trust-1 has the power to make distributions to
A
directly or to any trust created for the benefit of
A.
On January 1, 2003,
M
creates Trust-2 for the benefit of
A.
Also on January 1, 2003, the trustee of Trust-1 distributes some S corporation stock to Trust-2.
A,
as the current income beneficiary of Trust-2, makes a timely and effective election to treat Trust-2 as a QSST. Because Trust-2 is a valid S corporation shareholder, the distribution to Trust-2 does not terminate the ESBT election of Trust-1. Trust-2 itself will not be counted toward the shareholder limit of section 1361(b)(1)(A). Additionally, because
A
is already counted as an S corporation shareholder because of
A
's status as a potential current income beneficiary of Trust-1,
A
is not counted again by reason of
A
's status as the deemed owner of Trust-2.
(vi)
Example 6. Potential current beneficiaries and distributee trust not holding S corporation stock
—(A)
Distributee trust that would itself qualify as an ESBT.
Trust-1 holds stock in
X,
an S corporation, and has a valid ESBT election in effect. Under the terms of Trust-1, the trustee has discretion to make distributions to
A, B,
and Trust-2, a trust for the benefit of
C, D,
and
E.
Trust-2 would qualify to be an ESBT, but it owns no S corporation stock and has made no ESBT election. Under paragraph (m)(4)(iv) of this section, Trust-2's potential current beneficiaries are treated as the potential current beneficiaries of Trust-1 and are counted as shareholders for purposes of section 1361(b)(1). Thus,
A, B, C, D,
and
E
are potential current beneficiaries of Trust-1 and are counted as shareholders for purposes of section 1361(b)(1). Trust-2 itself will not be counted as a shareholder of Trust-1 for purposes of section 1361(b)(1).
(B)
Distributee trust that would not qualify as an ESBT or a QSST.
Assume the same facts as
Example 6
in paragraph (m)(8)(vi)(A) of this section except that D is a charitable remainder trust. Trust-2 would not be eligible to make an ESBT or QSST election if it owned S corporation stock and therefore Trust-2 is a potential current beneficiary of Trust-1. Since Trust-2 is not an eligible shareholder,
X
's S corporation election terminates.
(C)
Distributee trust that is a section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) trust.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 6
in paragraph (m)(8)(vi)(A) of this section except that Trust-2 is a trust treated as owned by
A
under section 676 because
A
has the power to revoke Trust-2 at any time prior to
A
's death. On January 1, 2003,
A
dies. Because Trust-2 is a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(ii) during the 2-year period beginning on the day of
A
's death, under paragraph (m)(4)(iv)(C) of this section, Trust-2's only potential current beneficiary is the person listed in section 1361(c)(2)(B)(ii),
A
's estate. Thus,
B
and
A
's estate are potential current beneficiaries of Trust-1 and are counted as shareholders for purposes of section 1361(b)(1).
(vii)
Example 7. Potential current beneficiaries and powers of appointment.
M
creates Trust from which
A
has a right to all net income and funds it with S corporation stock.
A
also has a currently exercisable power to appoint income or principal to anyone except
A
,
A
's creditors,
A
's estate, and the creditors of A's estate. The potential current beneficiaries of Trust for any period will be
A
and each person who receives a distribution from Trust pursuant to
A
's exercise of
A
's power of appointment during that period.
(viii)
Example 8. Power to distribute to an unlimited class of charitable organizations not pursuant to a power of appointment.
M
creates Trust from which
A
has a right to all net income and funds it with S corporation stock. In addition, the trustee of Trust, who is not
A
or a descendant of
M
, has the power to make discretionary distributions of principal to the living descendants of
M
and to any organizations described in section 1361(c)(6). The potential current beneficiaries of Trust for any period will be
A
, each then-living descendant of M, and each exempt organization described in section 1361(c)(6) that receives a distribution during that period. In addition, the class of exempt organizations will be counted as one potential current beneficiary.
(ix)
Example 9. Power to distribute to a class of named charitable organizations not pursuant to a power of appointment.
M
creates Trust from which
A
has a right to all net income and funds it
with S corporation stock. In addition, the trustee of Trust, who is not
A
or a descendant of
M
, has the power to make discretionary distributions of principal to the living descendants of

§ 1.1361-2
Definitions relating to S corporation subsidiaries.
(a)
In general.
The term
qualified subchapter S subsidiary
(QSub) means any domestic corporation that is not an ineligible corporation (as defined in section 1361(b)(2) and the regulations thereunder), if—
(1) 100 percent of the stock of such corporation is held by an S corporation; and
(2) The S corporation properly elects to treat the subsidiary as a QSub under § 1.1361-3.
(b)
Stock treated as held by S corporation.
For purposes of satisfying the 100 percent stock ownership requirement in section 1361(b)(3)(B)(i) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section—
(1) Stock of a corporation is treated as held by an S corporation if the S corporation is the owner of that stock for Federal income tax purposes; and
(2) Any outstanding instruments, obligations, or arrangements of the corporation which would not be considered stock for purposes of section 1361(b)(1)(D) if the corporation were an S corporation are not treated as outstanding stock of the QSub.
(c)
Straight debt safe harbor.
Section 1.1361-1(l)(5)(iv) and (v) apply to an obligation of a corporation for which a QSub election is made if that obligation would satisfy the definition of straight debt in § 1.1361-1(l)(5) if issued by the S corporation.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of Y, a corporation for which a valid QSub election is in effect for the taxable year. Y owns 100 percent of Z, a corporation otherwise eligible for QSub status. X may elect to treat Z as a QSub under section 1361(b)(3)(B)(ii).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that Y is a business entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under § 301.7701-2(c)(2) of this chapter. X may elect to treat Z as a QSub.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that Y owns 50 percent of Z, and X owns the other 50 percent. X may elect to treat Z as a QSub.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that Y is a C corporation. Although Y is a domestic corporation that is otherwise eligible to be a QSub, no QSub election has been made for Y. Thus, X is not treated as holding the stock of Z. Consequently, X may not elect to treat Z as a QSub.

# Example 5.
Individuals A and B own 100 percent of the stock of corporation X, an S corporation, and, except for C's interest (described below), X owns 100 percent of corporation Y, a C corporation. Individual C holds an instrument issued by Y that is considered to be equity under general principles of tax law but would satisfy the definition of straight debt under § 1.1361-1(l)(5) if Y were an S corporation. In determining whether X owns 100 percent of Y for purposes of making the QSub election, the instrument held by C is not considered outstanding stock. In addition, under § 1.1361-1(l)(5)(v), the QSub election is not treated as an exchange of debt for stock with respect to such instrument, and § 1.1361-1(l)(5)(iv) applies to determine the tax treatment of payments on the instrument while Y's QSub election is in effect.
[T.D. 8869, 65 FR 3849, Jan. 25, 2000]
§ 1.1361-3
QSub election.
(a)
Time and manner of making election
—(1)
In general.
The corporation for
which the QSub election is made must meet all the requirements of section 1361(b)(3)(B) at the time the election is made and for all periods for which the election is to be effective.
(2)
Manner of making election.
Except as provided in section 1361(b)(3)(D) and § 1.1361-5(c) (five-year prohibition on re-election), an S corporation may elect to treat an eligible subsidiary as a QSub by filing a completed form to be prescribed by the IRS. The election form must be signed by a person authorized to sign the S corporation's return required to be filed under section 6037. Unless the election form provides otherwise, the election must be submitted to the service center where the subsidiary filed its most recent tax return (if applicable), and, if an S corporation forms a subsidiary and makes a valid QSub election (effective upon the date of the subsidiary's formation) for the subsidiary, the election should be submitted to the service center where the S corporation filed its most recent return.
(3)
Time of making election.
A QSub election may be made by the S corporation parent at any time during the taxable year.
(4)
Effective date of election.
A QSub election will be effective on the date specified on the election form or on the date the election form is filed if no date is specified. The effective date specified on the form cannot be more than two months and 15 days prior to the date of filing and cannot be more than 12 months after the date of filing. For this purpose, the definition of the term
month
found in § 1.1362-6(a)(2)(ii)(C) applies. If an election form specifies an effective date more than two months and 15 days prior to the date on which the election form is filed, it will be effective two months and 15 days prior to the date it is filed. If an election form specifies an effective date more than 12 months after the date on which the election is filed, it will be effective 12 months after the date it is filed.
(5)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (a)(4) of this section:

# Example.
X has been a calendar year S corporation engaged in a trade or business for several years. X acquires the stock of Y, a calendar year C corporation, on April 1, 2002. On August 10, 2002, X makes an election to treat Y as a QSub. Unless otherwise specified on the election form, the election will be effective as of August 10, 2002. If specified on the election form, the election may be effective on some other date that is not more than two months and 15 days prior to August 10, 2002, and not more than 12 months after August 10, 2002.
(6)
Extension of time for making a QSub election.
An extension of time to make a QSub election may be available under the procedures applicable under §§ 301.9100-1 and 301.9100-3 of this chapter.
(b)
Revocation of QSub election
—(1)
Manner of revoking QSub election.
An S corporation may revoke a QSub election under section 1361 by filing a statement with the service center where the S corporation's most recent tax return was properly filed. The revocation statement must include the names, addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers of both the parent S corporation and the QSub, if any. The statement must be signed by a person authorized to sign the S corporation's return required to be filed under section 6037.
(2)
Effective date of revocation.
The revocation of a QSub election is effective on the date specified on the revocation statement or on the date the revocation statement is filed if no date is specified. The effective date specified on the revocation statement cannot be more than two months and 15 days prior to the date on which the revocation statement is filed and cannot be more than 12 months after the date on which the revocation statement is filed. If a revocation statement specifies an effective date more than two months and 15 days prior to the date on which the statement is filed, it will be effective two months and 15 days prior to the date it is filed. If a revocation statement specifies an effective date more than 12 months after the date on which the statement is filed, it will be effective 12 months after the date it is filed.
(3)
Revocation after termination.
A revocation may not be made after the occurrence of an event that renders the subsidiary ineligible for QSub status under section 1361(b)(3)(B).
(4)
Revocation before QSub election effective.
For purposes of Section 1361(b)(3)(D) and § 1.1361-5(c) (five-year prohibition on re-election), a revocation effective on the first day the QSub election was to be effective will not be treated as a termination of a QSub election.
[T.D. 8869, 65 FR 3850, Jan. 25, 2000]
§ 1.1361-4
Effect of QSub election.
(a)
Separate existence ignored
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(6), (a)(7), (a)(8), and (a)(9) of this section, for Federal tax purposes—
(i) A corporation that is a QSub shall not be treated as a separate corporation; and
(ii) All assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of a QSub shall be treated as assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the S corporation.
(2)
Liquidation of subsidiary
—(i)
In general.
If an S corporation makes a valid QSub election with respect to a subsidiary, the subsidiary is deemed to have liquidated into the S corporation. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the tax treatment of the liquidation or of a larger transaction that includes the liquidation will be determined under the Internal Revenue Code and general principles of tax law, including the step transaction doctrine. Thus, for example, if an S corporation forms a subsidiary and makes a valid QSub election (effective upon the date of the subsidiary's formation) for the subsidiary, the transfer of assets to the subsidiary and the deemed liquidation are disregarded, and the corporation will be deemed to be a QSub from its inception.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section:

# Example 1.
Corporation X acquires all of the outstanding stock of solvent corporation Y from an unrelated individual for cash and short-term notes. Thereafter, as part of the same plan, X immediately makes an S election and a QSub election for Y. Because X acquired all of the stock of Y in a qualified stock purchase within the meaning of section 338(d)(3), the liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is respected as an independent step separate from the stock acquisition, and the tax consequences of the liquidation are determined under sections 332 and 337.

# Example 2.
Corporation X, pursuant to a plan, acquires all of the outstanding stock of corporation Y from the shareholders of Y solely in exchange for 10 percent of the voting stock of X. Prior to the transaction, Y and its shareholders are unrelated to X. Thereafter, as part of the same plan, X immediately makes an S election and a QSub election for Y. The transaction is a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), assuming the other conditions for reorganization treatment (e.g., continuity of business enterprise) are satisfied.

# Example 3.
After the expiration of the transition period provided in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, individual A, pursuant to a plan, contributes all of the outstanding stock of Y to his wholly owned S corporation, X, and immediately causes X to make a QSub election for Y. The transaction is a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D), assuming the other conditions for reorganization treatment (e.g., continuity of business enterprise) are satisfied. If the sum of the amount of liabilities of Y treated as assumed by X exceeds the total of the adjusted basis of the property of Y, then section 357(c) applies and such excess is considered as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be.
(iii)
Adoption of plan of liquidation.
For purposes of satisfying the requirement of adoption of a plan of liquidation under section 332, unless a formal plan of liquidation that contemplates the QSub election is adopted on an earlier date, the making of the QSub election is considered to be the adoption of a plan of liquidation immediately before the deemed liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
(iv)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section:

# Example.
Corporation X owns 75 percent of a solvent corporation Y, and individual A owns the remaining 25 percent of Y. As part of a plan to make a QSub election for Y, X causes Y to redeem A's 25 percent interest on June 1 for cash and makes a QSub election for Y effective on June 3. The making of the QSub election is considered to be the adoption of a plan of liquidation immediately before the deemed liquidation. The deemed liquidation satisfies the requirements of section 332.
(v)
Stock ownership requirements of section 332.
The deemed exercise of an option under § 1.1504-4 and any instruments, obligations, or arrangements that are not considered stock under § 1.1361-2(b)(2) are disregarded in determining if the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) are met with respect to the deemed liquidation provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Treatment of banks
—(i)
In general.
If an S corporation is a bank, or if an S corporation makes a valid QSub election for a subsidiary that is a bank, any special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code continue to apply separately to the bank parent or bank subsidiary as if the deemed liquidation of any QSub under paragraph (a)(2) of this section had not occurred (except as other published guidance may apply section 265(b) and section 291(a)(3) and (e)(1)(B) not only to the bank parent or bank subsidiary but also to any QSub deemed to have liquidated under paragraph (a)(2) of this section). For any QSub that is a bank, however, all assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the QSub, as determined in accordance with the special bank rules, are treated as assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the S corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3)(i), the term bank has the same meaning as in section 581.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(3):

# Example 1.
X, an S corporation, is a bank as defined in section 581. X owns 100 percent of Y and Z, corporations for which valid QSub elections are in effect. Y is a bank as defined in section 581, and Z is not a financial institution. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, any special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code continue to apply separately to X and Y and do not apply to Z. Thus, for example, section 265(b), which provides special rules for interest expense deductions of banks, applies separately to X and Y. That is, X and Y each must make a separate determination under section 265(b) of interest expense allocable to tax-exempt interest, and no deduction is allowed for that interest expense. Section 265(b) does not apply to Z except as published guidance may provide otherwise.

# Example 2.
X, an S corporation, is a bank holding company and thus is not a bank as defined in section 581. X owns 100 percent of Y, a corporation for which a valid QSub election is in effect. Y is a bank as defined in section 581. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, any special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code continue to apply to Y and do not apply to X. However, all of Y's assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit, as determined in accordance with the special bank rules, are treated as those of X. Thus, for example, section 582(c), which provides special rules for sales and exchanges of debt by banks, applies only to sales and exchanges by Y. However, any gain or loss on such a transaction by Y that is considered ordinary income or ordinary loss pursuant to section 582(c) is treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss of X.
(iii)
Effective date.
This paragraph (a)(3) applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996.
(4)
Treatment of stock of QSub.
Except for purposes of section 1361(b)(3)(B)(i) and § 1.1361-2(a)(1), the stock of a QSub shall be disregarded for all Federal tax purposes.
(5)
Transitional relief
—(i)
General rule.
If an S corporation and another corporation (the related corporation) are persons specified in section 267(b) prior to an acquisition by the S corporation of some or all of the stock of the related corporation followed by a QSub election for the related corporation, the step transaction doctrine will not apply to determine the tax consequences of the acquisition. This paragraph (a)(5) shall apply to QSub elections effective before January 1, 2001.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(5):

# Example 1.
Individual A owns 100 percent of the stock of X, an S corporation. X owns 79 percent of the stock of Y, a solvent corporation, and A owns the remaining 21 percent. On May 4, 1998, A contributes its Y stock to X in exchange for X stock. X makes a QSub election with respect to Y effective immediately following the transfer. The liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is respected as an independent step separate from the stock acquisition, and the tax consequences of the liquidation are determined under sections 332 and 337. The contribution by A of the Y stock qualifies under section 351, and no gain or loss is recognized by A, X, or Y.

# Example 2.
Individual A owns 100 percent of the stock of two solvent S corporations, X and Y. On May 4, 1998, A contributes the stock of Y to X. X makes a QSub election
with respect to Y immediately following the transfer. The liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is respected as an independent step separate from the stock acquisition, and the tax consequences of the liquidation are determined under sections 332 and 337. The contribution by A of the Y stock to X qualifies under section 351, and no gain or loss is recognized by A, X, or Y. Y is not treated as a C corporation for any period solely because of the transfer of its stock to X, an ineligible shareholder. Compare
Example 3
of § 1.1361-4(a)(2)(ii).
(6)
Treatment of certain QSubs
—(i)
In general.
A QSub, even though it is generally not treated as a corporation separate from the S corporation, is treated as a separate corporation for purposes of:
(A) Federal tax liabilities of the QSub with respect to any taxable period for which the QSub was treated as a separate corporation.
(B) Federal tax liabilities of any other entity for which the QSub is liable.
(C) Refunds or credits of Federal tax.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section:

# Example 1.
X has owned all of the outstanding stock of Y, a domestic corporation that reports its taxes on a calendar year basis, since 2001. X and Y do not report their taxes on a consolidated basis. For 2003, X makes a timely S election and simultaneously makes a QSub election for Y. In 2004, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeks to extend the period of limitations on assessment for Y's 2001 taxable year. Because Y was treated as a separate corporation for its 2001 taxable year, Y is the proper party to sign the consent to extend the period of limitations.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that in 2004, the IRS determines that Y miscalculated and underreported its income tax liability for 2001. Because Y was treated as a separate corporation for its 2001 taxable year, the deficiency for Y's 2001 taxable year may be assessed against Y and, in the event that Y fails to pay the liability after notice and demand, a general tax lien will arise against all of Y's property and rights to property.

# Example 3.
X is a QSub of Y. In 2001, Z, a domestic corporation that reports its taxes on a calendar year basis, merges into X in a state law merger. Z was not a member of a consolidated group at any time during its taxable year ending in December 2000. Under the applicable state law, X is the successor to Z and is liable for all of Z's debts. In 2003, the IRS seeks to extend the period of limitations on assessment for Z's 2000 taxable year. Because X is the successor to Z and is liable for Z's 2000 taxes that remain unpaid, X is the proper party to execute the consent to extend the period of limitations on assessment.
(iii)
Effective date.
This paragraph (a)(6) applies on or after April 1, 2004.
(7)
Treatment of QSubs for purposes of employment taxes
—(i)
In general.
A QSub is treated as a separate corporation for purposes of Subtitle C—Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax (Chapters 21, 22, 23, 23A, 24, and 25 of the Internal Revenue Code).
(ii)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (a)(7) applies with respect to wages paid on or after January 1, 2009.
(8)
Treatment of QSubs for purposes of certain excise taxes
—(i)
In general.
A QSub is treated as a separate corporation for purposes of—
(A) Federal tax liabilities imposed by Chapters 31, 32 (other than section 4181), 33, 34, 35, 36 (other than section 4461), 38, and 49 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any floor stocks tax imposed on articles subject to any of these taxes;
(B) Collection of tax imposed by Chapters 33 and 49 of the Internal Revenue Code;
(C) Registration under sections 4101, 4222, and 4412;
(D) Claims of a credit (other than a credit under section 34), refund, or payment related to a tax described in paragraph (a)(8)(i)(A) of this section or under section 6426 or 6427; and
(E) Assessment and collection of an assessable payment imposed by section 4980H and reporting required by section 6056.
(ii)
Effective/applicability date.
(A) Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(8)(ii), paragraph (a)(8) of this section applies to liabilities imposed and actions first required or permitted in periods beginning on or after January 1, 2008.
(B) References to Chapter 49 in paragraph (a)(8) of this section apply to taxes imposed on amounts paid on or after July 1, 2012.
(C) Paragraph (a)(8)(i)(E) of this section applies for periods after December 31, 2014.
(9)
Information returns
—(i)
In general.
Except to the extent provided by the Secretary or Commissioner in guidance
(including forms or instructions), paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply to part III of subchapter A of chapter 61, relating to information returns.
(ii)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (a)(9) is effective on
August 14, 2008.
(b)
Timing of the liquidation
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section, the liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section occurs at the close of the day before the QSub election is effective. Thus, for example, if a C corporation elects to be treated as an S corporation and makes a QSub election (effective the same date as the S election) with respect to a subsidiary, the liquidation occurs immediately before the S election becomes effective, while the S electing parent is still a C corporation.
(2)
Application to elections in tiered situations.
When QSub elections for a tiered group of subsidiaries are effective on the same date, the S corporation may specify the order of the liquidations. If no order is specified, the liquidations that are deemed to occur as a result of the QSub elections will be treated as occurring first for the lowest tier entity and proceed successively upward until all of the liquidations under paragraph (a)(2) of this section have occurred. For example, S, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of C, the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that includes X and Y. C owns all of the stock of X and X owns all of the stock of Y. S elects under § 1.1361-3 to treat C, X and Y as QSubs effective on the same date. If no order is specified for the elections, the following liquidations are deemed to occur as a result of the elections, with each successive liquidation occuring on the same day immediately after the preceding liquidation: Y is treated as liquidating into X, then X is treated as liquidating into C, and finally C is treated as liquidating into S.
(3)
Acquisitions.
(i)
In general.
If an S corporation does not own 100 percent of the stock of the subsidiary on the day before the QSub election is effective, the liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section occurs immediately after the time at which the S corporation first owns 100 percent of the stock.
(ii)
Special rules for acquired S corporations.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, if a corporation (Y) for which an election under section 1362(a) was in effect is acquired, and a QSub election is made effective on the day Y is acquired, Y is deemed to liquidate into the S corporation at the beginning of the day the termination of its S election is effective. As a result, if corporation X acquires Y, an S corporation, and makes an S election for itself and a QSub election for Y effective on the day of acquisition, Y liquidates into X at the beginning of the day when X's S election is effective, and there is no period between the termination of Y's S election and the deemed liquidation of Y during which Y is a C corporation. Y's taxable year ends for all Federal income tax purposes at the close of the preceding day. Furthermore, if Y owns Z, a corporation for which a QSub election was in effect prior to the acquisition of Y by X, and X makes QSub elections for Y and Z, effective on the day of acquisition, the transfer of assets to Z and the deemed liquidation of Z are disregarded. See §§ 1.1361-4(a)(2) and 1.1361-5(b)(1)(i).
(4)
Coordination with section 338 election.
An S corporation that makes a qualified stock purchase of a target may make an election under section 338 with respect to the acquisition if it meets the requirements for the election, and may make a QSub election with respect to the target. If an S corporation makes an election under section 338 with respect to a subsidiary acquired in a qualified stock purchase, a QSub election made with respect to that subsidiary is not effective before the day after the acquisition date (within the meaning of section 338(h)(2)). If the QSub election is effective on the day after the acquisition date, the liquidation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section occurs immediately after the deemed asset purchase by the new target corporation under section 338. If an S corporation makes an election under section 338 (without a section 338(h)(10) election) with respect to a target, the target must file
a final return as a C corporation reflecting the deemed sale.
See § 1.338-10(a).
If the target was an S corporation on the day before the acquisition date, the final return as a C corporation must reflect the activities of the target for the acquisition date, including the deemed sale.
See § 1.338-10(a)(3).
(c)
Carryover of disallowed losses and deductions.
If an S corporation (S1) acquires the stock of another S corporation (S2), and S1 makes a QSub election with respect to S2 effective on the day of the acquisition, see § 1.1366-2(c)(1) for provisions relating to the carryover of losses and deductions with respect to a former shareholder of S2 that may be available to that shareholder as a shareholder of S1.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, a C corporation. On June 2, 2002, X makes a valid QSub election for Y, effective June 2, 2002. Assume that, under general principles of tax law, including the step transaction doctrine, X's acquisition of the Y stock and the subsequent QSub election would not be treated as related. The liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section occurs at the close of the day on June 1, 2002, the day before the QSub election is effective, and the plan of liquidation is considered adopted on that date. Y's taxable year and separate existence for Federal tax purposes end at the close of June 1, 2002.

# Example 2.
X, a C corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, another C corporation. On December 31, 2002, X makes an election under section 1362 to be treated as an S corporation and a valid QSub election for Y, both effective January 1, 2003. Assume that, under general principles of tax law, including the step transaction doctrine, X's acquisition of the Y stock and the subsequent QSub election would not be treated as related. The liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section occurs at the close of December 31, 2002, the day before the QSub election is effective. The QSub election for Y is effective on the same day that X's S election is effective, and the deemed liquidation is treated as occurring before the S election is effective, when X is still a C corporation. Y's taxable year ends at the close of December 31, 2002. See § 1.381(b)-1.

# Example 3.
On June 1, 2002, X, an S corporation, acquires 100 percent of the stock of Y, an existing S corporation, for cash in a transaction meeting the requirements of a qualified stock purchase (QSP) under section 338. X immediately makes a QSub election for Y effective June 2, 2002, and also makes a joint election under section 338(h)(10) with the shareholder of Y. Under section 338(a) and § 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(3), Y is treated as having sold all of its assets at the close of the acquisition date, June 1, 2002. Y is treated as a new corporation which purchased all of those assets as of the beginning of June 2, 2002, the day after the acquisition date. Section 338(a)(2). The QSub election is effective on June 2, 2002, and the liquidation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section occurs immediately after the deemed asset purchase by the new corporation.

# Example 4.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of Y, a corporation for which a QSub election is in effect. On May 12, 2002, a date on which the QSub election is in effect, X issues Y a $10,000 note under state law that matures in ten years with a market rate of interest. Y is not treated as a separate corporation, and X's issuance of the note to Y on May 12, 2002, is disregarded for Federal tax purposes.

# Example 5.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, a C corporation. At a time when Y is indebted to X in an amount that exceeds the fair market value of Y's assets, X makes a QSub election effective on the date it is filed with respect to Y. The liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not qualify under sections 332 and 337 and, thus, Y recognizes gain or loss on the assets distributed, subject to the limitations of section 267.

§ 1.1361-5
Termination of QSub election.
(a) In
general
—(1)
Effective date.
The termination of a QSub election is effective—
(i) On the effective date contained in the revocation statement if a QSub election is revoked under § 1.1361-3(b);
(ii) At the close of the last day of the parent's last taxable year as an S corporation if the parent's S election terminates under § 1.1362-2; or
(iii) At the close of the day on which an event (other than an event described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section) occurs that renders the subsidiary ineligible for QSub status under section 1361(b)(3)(B).
(2)
Information to be provided upon termination of QSub election by failure to qualify as a QSub.
If a QSub election terminates because an event renders the subsidiary ineligible for QSub status, the S corporation must attach to its return for the taxable year in which the termination occurs a notification that a QSub election has terminated, the date of the termination, and the names, addresses, and employer identification numbers of both the parent corporation and the QSub.
(3)
QSub joins a consolidated group.
If a QSub election terminates because the S corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group (and no election under section 338(g) is made) the principles of § 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(2) (relating to a special rule for S corporations that join a consolidated group) apply to any QSub of the S corporation that also becomes a member of the consolidated group at the same time as the S corporation. See
Example 4
of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(4)
Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a):

# Example 1. Termination because parent's S election terminates.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of Y. A QSub election is in effect with respect to Y for 2001. Effective on January 1, 2002, X revokes its S election. Because X is no longer an S corporation, Y no longer qualifies as a QSub at the close of December 31, 2001.

# Example 2. Termination due to transfer of QSub stock.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of Y. A QSub election is in effect with respect to Y. On December 10, 2002, X sells one share of Y stock to A, an individual. Because X no longer owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, Y no longer qualifies as a QSub. Accordingly, the QSub election made with respect to Y terminates at the close of December 10, 2002.

# Example 3. No termination on stock transfer between QSub and parent.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, and Y owns 100 percent of the stock of Z. QSub elections are in effect with respect to both Y and Z. Y transfers all of its Z stock to X. Because X is treated as owning the stock of Z both before and after the transfer of stock solely for purposes of determining whether the requirements of section 1361(b)(3)(B)(i) and § 1.1361-2(a)(1) have been satisfied, the transfer of Z stock does not terminate Z's QSub election. Because the stock of Z is disregarded for all other Federal tax purposes, no gain is recognized under section 311.

# Example 4. Termination due to acquisition of S parent by a consolidated group.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of Y, a corporation for which a QSub election is in effect. Z, the common parent of a consolidated group of corporations, acquires 80 percent of the stock of X on June 1, 2002. Z does not make an election under section 338(g) with respect to the purchase of X stock. X's S election terminates as of the close of the preceding day, May 31, 2002. Y's QSub election also terminates at the close of May 31, 2002. Under § 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(2) and paragraph (a)(3) of this section, X and Y become members of Z's consolidated group of corporations as of the beginning of the day June 1, 2002.

# Example 5. Termination due to acquisition of QSub by a consolidated group.
The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that Z acquires 80 percent of the stock of Y (instead of X) on June 1, 2002. In this case, Y's QSub election terminates as of the close of June 1, 2002, and, under § 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1), Y becomes a member of the consolidated group at that time.
(b)
Effect of termination of QSub election
—(1)
Formation of new corporation
—(i)
In general.
If a QSub election terminates under paragraph (a) of this section, the former QSub is treated as a new corporation acquiring all of its assets (and assuming all of its liabilities) immediately before the termination from the S corporation parent in exchange for stock of the new corporation. The tax treatment of this transaction or of a larger transaction that includes this transaction will be determined under the Internal Revenue Code and general principles of tax law, including the step transaction doctrine. For purposes of determining the application of section 351 with respect to this transaction, instruments, obligations, or other arrangements that are not treated as stock of the QSub under § 1.1361-2(b) are disregarded in determining control for purposes of section 368(c) even if they are equity under general principles of tax law.
(ii)
Termination for tiered QSubs.
If QSub elections terminate for tiered QSubs on the same day, the formation of any higher tier subsidiary precedes the formation of its lower tier subsidiary. See Example 6 in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(2)
Carryover of disallowed losses and deductions.
If a QSub terminates because the S corporation distributes the
QSub stock to some or all of the S corporation's shareholders in a transaction to which section 368(a)(1)(D) applies by reason of section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355), see § 1.1366-2(c)(2) for provisions relating to the carryover of disallowed losses and deductions that may be available.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b):

# Example 1. X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, a corporation for which a QSub election is in effect.
X sells 21 percent of the Y stock to Z, an unrelated corporation, for cash, thereby terminating the QSub election. Y is treated as a new corporation acquiring all of its assets (and assuming all of its liabilities) in exchange for Y stock immediately before the termination from the S corporation. The deemed exchange by X of assets for Y stock does not qualify under section 351 because X is not in control of Y within the meaning of section 368(c) immediately after the transfer as a result of the sale of stock to Z. Therefore, X must recognize gain, if any, on the assets transferred to Y in exchange for its stock. X's losses, if any, on the assets transferred are subject to the limitations of section 267.

# Example 2.
(i) X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, a corporation for which a QSub election is in effect. As part of a plan to sell a portion of Y, X causes Y to merge into T, a limited liability company wholly owned by X that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for Federal tax purposes. X then sells 21 percent of T to Z, an unrelated corporation, for cash. Following the sale, no entity classification election is made under § 301.7701-3(c) of this chapter to treat the limited liability company as an association for Federal tax purposes.
(ii) The merger of Y into T causes a termination of Y's QSub election. The new corporation (Newco) that is formed as a result of the termination is immediately merged into T, an entity that is disregarded for Federal tax purposes. Because, at the end of the series of transactions, the assets continue to be held by X for Federal tax purposes, under step transaction principles, the formation of Newco and the transfer of assets pursuant to the merger of Newco into T are disregarded. The sale of 21 percent of T is treated as a sale of a 21 percent undivided interest in each of T's assets. Immediately thereafter, X and Z are treated as contributing their respective interests in those assets to a partnership in exchange for ownership interests in the partnership.
(iii) Under section 1001, X recognizes gain or loss from the deemed sale of the 21 percent interest in each asset of the limited liability company to Z. Under section 721(a), no gain or loss is recognized by X and Z as a result of the deemed contribution of their respective interests in the assets to the partnership in exchange for ownership interests in the partnership.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that, instead of purchasing Y stock, Z contributes to Y an operating asset in exchange for 21 percent of the Y stock. Y is treated as a new corporation acquiring all of its assets (and assuming all of its liabilities) in exchange for Y stock immediately before the termination. Because X and Z are co-transferors that control the transferee immediately after the transfer, the transaction qualifies under section 351.

# Example 4.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, a corporation for which a QSub election is in effect. X distributes all of the Y stock pro rata to its shareholders, and the distribution terminates the QSub election. The transaction can qualify as a distribution to which sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 apply if the transaction otherwise satisfies the requirements of those sections.

# Example 5.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, a corporation for which a QSub election is in effect. X subsequently revokes the QSub election. Y is treated as a new corporation acquiring all of its assets (and assuming all of its liabilities) immediately before the revocation from its S corporation parent in a deemed exchange for Y stock. On a subsequent date, X sells 21 percent of the stock of Y to Z, an unrelated corporation, for cash. Assume that under general principles of tax law including the step transaction doctrine, the sale is not taken into account in determining whether X is in control of Y immediately after the deemed exchange of assets for stock. The deemed exchange by X of assets for Y stock and the deemed assumption by Y of its liabilities qualify under section 351 because, for purposes of that section, X is in control of Y within the meaning of section 368(c) immediately after the transfer.

# Example 6.
(i) X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, and Y owns 100 percent of the stock of Z. Y and Z are corporations for which QSub elections are in effect. X subsequently revokes the QSub elections and the effective date specified on each revocation statement is June 26, 2002, a date that is less than 12 months after the date on which the revocation statements are filed.
(ii) Immediately before the QSub elections terminate, Y is treated as a new corporation acquiring all of its assets (and assuming all of its liabilities) directly from X in exchange for the stock of Y. Z is treated as a new corporation acquiring all of its assets (and assuming all of its liabilities) directly from Y in exchange for the stock of Z.

# Example 7.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that, prior to June 26, 2002 (the effective date of the revocations), Y distributes the Z stock to X under state law.
(ii) Immediately before the QSub elections terminate, Y is treated as a new corporation acquiring all of its assets (and assuming all of its liabilities) directly from X in exchange for the stock of Y. Z is also treated as a new corporation acquiring all of its assets (and assuming all of its liabilities) directly from X in exchange for the stock of Z.

# Example 8. Merger of parent into QSub.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, a corporation for which a QSub election is in effect. X merges into Y under state law, causing the QSub election for Y to terminate, and Y survives the merger. The formation of the new corporation, Y, and the merger of X into Y can qualify as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) if the transaction otherwise satisfies the requirements of that section.

# Example 9. Transfer of 100 percent of QSub.
X, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of Y, a corporation for which a QSub election is in effect. Z, an unrelated C corporation, acquires 100 percent of the stock of Y. The deemed formation of Y by X (as a consequence of the termination of Y's QSub election) is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. The transaction is treated as a transfer of the assets of Y to Z, followed by Z's transfer of these assets to the capital of Y in exchange for Y stock. Furthermore, if Z is an S corporation and makes a QSub election for Y effective as of the acquisition, Z's transfer of the assets of Y in exchange for Y stock, followed by the immediate liquidation of Y as a consequence of the QSub election are disregarded for Federal income tax purposes.
(c)
Election after QSub termination
—(1)
In general.
Absent the Commissioner's consent, and except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a corporation whose QSub election has terminated under paragraph (a) of this section (or a successor corporation as defined in§ 1.1362-5(b)) may not make an S election under section 1362 or have a QSub election under section 1361(b)(3)(B)(ii) made with respect to it for five taxable years (as described in section 1361(b)(3)(D)). The Commissioner may permit an S election by the corporation or a new QSub election with respect to the corporation before the five-year period expires. The corporation requesting consent to make the election has the burden of establishing that, under the relevant facts and circumstances, the Commissioner should consent to a new election.
(2)
Exception.
In the case of S and QSub elections effective after December 31, 1996, if a corporation's QSub election terminates, the corporation may, without requesting the Commissioner's consent, make an S election or have a QSub election made with respect to it before the expiration of the five-year period described in section 1361(b)(3)(D) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that—
(i) Immediately following the termination, the corporation (or its successor corporation) is otherwise eligible to make an S election or have a QSub election made for it; and
(ii) The relevant election is made effective immediately following the termination of the QSub election.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1. Termination upon distribution of QSub stock to shareholders of parent.
X, an S corporation, owns Y, a QSub. X distributes all of its Y stock to X's shareholders. The distribution terminates the QSub election because Y no longer satisfies the requirements of a QSub. Assuming Y is otherwise eligible to be treated as an S corporation, Y's shareholders may elect to treat Y as an S corporation effective on the date of the stock distribution without requesting the Commissioner's consent.

# Example 2. Sale of 100 percent of QSub stock.
X, an S corporation, owns Y, a QSub. X sells 100 percent of the stock of Y to Z, an unrelated S corporation. Z may elect to treat Y as a QSub effective on the date of purchase without requesting the Commissioner's consent.

Except as provided in §§ 1.1361-4(a)(3)(iii), 1.1361-4(a)(5)(i), 1.1361-4(a)(6)(iii), 1.1361-4(a)(7)(ii), 1.1361-4(a)(8)(ii), 1.1361-4(a)(9), and 1.1361-5(c)(2), the provisions of §§ 1.1361-2 through 1.1361-5 apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 20, 2000; however, taxpayers may elect to apply the regulations in whole, but not in part (aside from those sections with
special dates of applicability), for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2000, provided all affected taxpayers apply the regulations in a consistent manner. To make this election, the corporation and all affected taxpayers must file a return or an amended return that is consistent with these rules for the taxable year for which the election is made. For purposes of this section, affected taxpayers means all taxpayers whose returns are affected by the election to apply the regulations.

§ 1.1362-1
Election to be an S corporation.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in § 1.1362-5, a small business corporation as defined in section 1361 may elect to be an S corporation under section 1362(a). An election may be made only with the consent of all of the shareholders of the corporation at the time of the election. See § 1.1362-6(a) for rules concerning the time and manner of making this election.
(b)
Years for which election is effective.
An election under section 1362(a) is effective for the entire taxable year of the corporation for which it is made and for all succeeding taxable years of the corporation, until the election is terminated.
[T.D. 8449, 57 FR 55449, Nov. 25, 1992]
§ 1.1362-2
Termination of election.
(a)
Termination by revocation
—(1)
In general.
An election made under section 1362(a) is terminated if the corporation revokes the election for any taxable year of the corporation for which the election is effective, including the first taxable year. A revocation may be made only with the consent of shareholders who, at the time the revocation is made, hold more than one-half of the number of issued and outstanding shares of stock (including non-voting stock) of the corporation. See § 1.1362-6(a) for rules concerning the time and manner of revoking an election made under section 1362(a).
(2)
When effective
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a revocation made during the taxable year and before the 16th day of the third month of the taxable year is effective on the first day of the taxable year and a revocation made after the 15th day of the third month of the taxable year is effective for the following taxable year. If a corporation makes an election to be an S corporation that is to be effective beginning with the next taxable year and revokes its election on or before the first day of the next taxable year, the corporation
is deemed to have revoked its election on the first day of the next taxable year.
(ii)
Revocations specifying a prospective revocation date.
If a corporation specifies a date for revocation and the date is expressed in terms of a stated day, month, and year that is on or after the date the revocation is filed, the revocation is effective on and after the date so specified.
(iii)
Applicability of section 7503.
With respect to a revocation made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, see section 7503 (addressing time for performance of acts where the last day occurs on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday). This paragraph (a)(2)(iii) applies to revocations made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section effective after October 20, 2020. A corporation may apply this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) retroactively to a revocation made by the corporation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section effective on or before October 20, 2020.
(3)
Effect on taxable year of corporation.
In the case of a corporation that revokes its election to be an S corporation effective on the first day of the first taxable year for which its election is to be effective, any statement made with the election regarding a change in the corporation's taxable year has no effect.
(4)
Rescission of a revocation.
A corporation may rescind a revocation made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section at any time before the revocation becomes effective. A rescission may be made only with the consent of each person who consented to the revocation and by each person who became a shareholder of the corporation within the period beginning on the first day after the date the revocation was made and ending on the date on which the rescission is made. See § 1.1362-6(a) for rules concerning the time and manner of rescinding a revocation.
(b)
Termination by reason of corporation ceasing to be a small business corporation
—(1)
In general.
If a corporation ceases to be a small business corporation, as defined in section 1361(b), at any time on or after the first day of the first taxable year for which its election under section 1362(a) is effective, the election terminates. In the event of a termination under this paragraph (b)(1), the corporation should attach to its return for the taxable year in which the termination occurs a notification that a termination has occurred and the date of the termination.
(2)
When effective.
If an election terminates because of a specific event that causes the corporation to fail to meet the definition of a small business corporation, the termination is effective as of the date on which the event occurs. If a corporation makes an election to be an S corporation that is effective beginning with the following taxable year and is not a small business corporation on the first day of that following taxable year, the election is treated as having terminated on that first day. If a corporation is a small business corporation on the first day of the taxable year for which its election is effective, its election does not terminate even if the corporation was not a small business corporation during all or part of the period beginning after the date the election was made and ending before the first day of the taxable year for which the election is effective.
(3)
Effect on taxable year of corporation.
In the case of a corporation that fails to meet the definition of a small business corporation on the first day of the first taxable year for which its election to be an S corporation is to be effective, any statement made with the election regarding a change in the corporation's taxable year has no effect.

See section 1375 for the tax imposed on excess passive investment income.
(2)
When effective.
A termination under this paragraph (c) is effective on the first day of the first taxable year beginning after the third consecutive year in which the S corporation had excess passive investment income.

(6)
Examples.
The principles of paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section are illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise provided in an example,
S
is an S corporation with subchapter C earnings and profits, and
S
's gross receipts from operations are gross receipts not derived from royalties, rents, dividends, interest, annuities, or gains from the sales or exchanges of stock or securities.
S
is a calendar year taxpayer and its first taxable year as an S corporation is 1993.

# Example 1. Sales of capital assets, stock and securities.
(i)
S
uses an accrual method of accounting and sells:
(1) A depreciable asset, held for more than 6 months, which is used in the corporation's business;
(2) A capital asset (other than stock or securities) for a gain;
(3) A capital asset (other than stock or securities) for a loss; and
(4) Securities.
S
receives payment for each asset partly in money and partly in the form of a note payable at a future time, and elects not to report the sales on the installment method.
(ii) The amount of money and the face amount (or issue price if different) of the note received for the business asset are considered gross receipts in the taxable year of sale and are not reduced by the adjusted basis of the property, costs of sale, or any other amount. With respect to the sales of the capital assets, gross receipts include the cash down payment and face amount (or issue price if different) of any notes, but only to the extent of
S
's capital gain net income. In the case of the sale of the securities, gross receipts include the cash down payment and face amount (or issue price if different) of the notes, but only to the extent of gain on the sale. In determining gross receipts from sales of securities, losses are not netted against gains.

# Example 2. Long-term contract reported on percentage-of-completion method.
S
has a long-term contract as defined in § 1.460-1(b)(1) with respect to which it reports income according to the percentage-of-completion method as described in § 1.460-4(b). The portion of the gross contract price which corresponds to the percentage of the entire contract which has been completed during the taxable year is included in
S
's gross receipts for the year.

# Example 3. Income reported on installment sale method.
For its 1993 taxable year, S sells personal property on the installment plan and elects to report its taxable income from the sale of the property (other than property qualifying as a capital asset or stock or securities) on the installment method in accordance with section 453. The installment payment actually received in a given taxable year of S is included in gross receipts for the year.

# Example 4. Partnership interests.
In 1993, S and two of its shareholders contribute cash to form a general partnership, PRS. S receives a 50 percent interest in the capital and profits of PRS. S formed PRS to indirectly invest in marketable stocks and securities. The only assets of PRS are the stock and securities, and certain real and tangible personal property. In 1994, S needs cash in its business and sells its partnership interest at a gain rather than having PRS sell the marketable stock or securities that have appreciated. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section, the gain on S's disposition of its interest is PRS is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of stock or securities to the extent of the amount the distributive share of gain S would have received from the sale of stock or securities held by PRS if PRS had sold all of its stock or securities at fair market value at the time S disposed of its interest in PRS.

# Example 5. Royalties derived in ordinary course of trade or business.
(i) In 1993, S has gross receipts of $75,000. Of this amount, $5,000 is from royalty payments with respect to Trademark A, $8,000 is from royalty payments with respect to Trademark B, and $62,000 is gross receipts from operations. S created Trademark A, but S did not create Trademark B or perform significant services or incur substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of Trademark B.
(ii) Because S created Trademark A, the royalty payments with respect to Trademark A are derived in the ordinary course of S's business and are not included within the definition of
royalties
for purposes of determining S's passive investment income. However, the royalty payments with respect to Trademark B are included within the definition of
royalties
for purposes of determining S's passive investment income. See paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section. S's passive investment income for the year is $8,000, and S's passive investment income percentage for the taxable year is 10.67% ($8,000/$75,000). This does not exceed 25 percent of S's gross receipts and consequently the three-year period described in section 1362(d)(3) does not begin to run.

# Example 6. Dividends; gain on sale of stock derived in the ordinary course of trade or business.
(i) In 1993, S receives dividends of $10,000 on stock of corporations P and O, recognizes a gain of $25,000 on sale of the P stock, and recognizes a loss of $12,000 on sale of the O stock. S held the P and O stock for investment, rather than for sale in the ordinary course of a trade or business. S has gross receipts from operations and from gain on the sale of stock in the ordinary course of its trade or business of $110,000.
(ii) S's gross receipts are calculated as follows:
$110,000
Gross receipts from operations and from gain on the sale of stock in the ordinary course of a trade or business
10,000
Gross dividend receipts
25,000
Gain on sale of P stock (Loss on O stock not taken into account
145,000
Total gross receipts
(iii) S's passive investment income is determined as follows:
$10,000
Gross dividend receipts
25,000
Gain on sale of P stock (Loss on O stock not taken into account
35,000
Total passive investment income
(iv) S's passive investment income percentage for its first year as an S corporation is 24.1% ($35,000/$145,000). This does not exceed 25 percent of S's gross receipts and consequently the three-year period described in section 1362(d)(3) does not begin to run.

# Example 7. Interest on accounts receivable; netting of gain on sale of real property investments.
(i) In 1993, S receives $6,000 of interest on accounts receivable arising from S's sales
of inventory property. S also received dividends with respect to stock held for investment of $1,500. In addition,
S
sells two parcels of real property (Property J and Property K) that S had purchased and held for investment. S sells Property J, in which S has a basis of $5,000, for $10,000 (a gain of $5,000). S sells Property K, in which S has a basis of $12,000, for $9,000 (a loss of $3,000). S has gross receipts from operations of $90,000.
(ii) S's gross receipts are calculated as follows:
$90,000
Gross receipts from operations
6,000
Gross interest receipts
1,500
Gross dividend receipts
2,000
Net gain on sale of real property investments
$99,500
Total gross receipts
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section, S's gross interest receipts are not passive investment income. In addition, gain on the sale of real property ($2,000) is not passive investment income. S's passive investment income includes only the $1,500 of gross dividend receipts. Accordingly, S's passive investment income percentage for its first year as an S corporation is 1.51% ($1,500/$99,500). This does not exceed 25 percent of S's gross receipts and consequently the three-year period described in section 1362(d)(3) does not begin to run.

# Example 8. Interest received in the ordinary course of a lending business.
(i) In 1993, S has gross receipts of $100,000 from loans and investments made in the ordinary course of S's mortgage banking business. This includes, for example, mortgage servicing fees, interest earned on mortgages prior to sale of the mortgages, and gain on sale of mortgages. In addition, S receives, from the investment of idle funds in short-term securities, $15,000 of gross interest income and $5,000 of gain.
(ii) S's gross receipts are calculated as follows:
$100,000
Gross receipts from operations
15,000
Gross interest receipts
5,000
Gain on sale of securities
120,000
Total gross receipts
(iii)
S'
s passive investment income is determined as follows:
$15,000
Gross interest receipts
5,000
Gain on sale of securities,
20,000
Total passive investment income
(iv) S's passive investment income percentage for its first year as an S corporation is 16.67% ($20,000/$120,000). This does not exceed 25 percent of S's gross receipts and consequently the three-year period described in section 1362(d)(3) does not begin to run.
[T.D. 8449, 57 FR 55449, Nov. 25, 1992; 58 FR 15274, Mar. 22, 1993, as amended by T.D. 8869, 65 FR 3854, Jan. 25, 2000; T.D. 8995, 67 FR 34610, May 15, 2002; T.D. 9914, 85 FR 66478, Oct. 20, 2020]
§ 1.1362-3
Treatment of S termination year.
(a)
In general.
If an S election terminates under section 1362(d) on a date other than the first day of a taxable year of the corporation, the corporation's taxable year in which the termination occurs is an S termination year. The portion of the S termination year ending at the close of the day prior to the termination is treated as a short taxable year for which the corporation is an S corporation (the
S short year
). The portion of the S termination year beginning on the day the termination is effective is treated as a short taxable year for which the corporation is a C corporation (the
C short year
). Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, the corporation allocates income or loss for the entire year on a pro rata basis as described in section 1362(e)(2). To the extent that income or loss is not allocated on a pro rata basis under this section, items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit are assigned to each short taxable year on the basis of the corporation's normal method of accounting as determined under section 446. See, however, § 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(
2
) for special rules for an S election that terminates under section 1362(d) immediately before the S corporation becomes a member of a consolidated group (within the meaning of § 1.1502-1(h)). See § 1.460-4(k)(3)(iv)(D) for rules relating to the computation of the S corporation's income or loss from a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting in the S termination year.
(b)
Allocations other than pro rata
—(1)
Elections under section 1362(e)(3).
The pro rata allocation rules of section 1362(e)(2) do not apply if the corporation elects to allocate its S termination year income on the basis of its normal tax accounting method. This election may be made only with the consent of each person who is a shareholder in the corporation at any time during the S short year and of each person who is a shareholder in the corporation on the first day of the C short year. See § 1.1362-6(a) for rules concerning the time and manner of making this election.
(2)
Purchase of stock treated as an asset purchase.
The pro rata allocation rules of section 1362(e)(2) do not apply with respect to any item resulting from the application of section 338.
(3)
50 percent change in ownership during S termination year.
The pro rata allocation rules of section 1362(e)(2) do not apply if at any time during the S termination year, as a result of sales or exchanges of stock in the corporation during that year, there is a change in ownership of 50 percent or more of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the corporation. If stock has already been sold or exchanged during the S termination year, subsequent sales or exchanges of that stock are not taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3).
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
S corporation that is a partner in a partnership.
For purposes of section 706(c) only, the termination of the election of an S corporation that is a partner in a partnership during any portion of the S short year under § 1.1362-2 (a) or (b), is treated as a sale or exchange of the corporation's entire interest in the partnership on the last day of the S short year, if—
(i) The pro rata allocation rules do not apply to the corporation; and
(ii) Any taxable year of the partnership ends with or within the C short year.
(2)
Tax for the C short year.
The taxable income for the C short year is determined on an annualized basis as described in section 1362(e)(5).
(3)
Each short year treated as taxable year
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the S and C short years are treated as two separate years for purposes of all provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
(ii)
Application of section 163(j).
For purposes of section 163(j), a separate limitation (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(36)) applies to each S short year and each C short year. Any items necessary to determine the amount of business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(3)) that are deducted in each S short year or C short year must be allocated between the S short year and C short year in accordance with an allocation methodology provided in section 1362(e).
(4)
Year for carryover purposes.
The S and C short years are treated as one year for purposes of determining the number of taxable years to which any item may be carried back or forward by the corporation.
(5)
Due date for S short year return.
The date by which the return for the S short year must be filed is the same as the date by which the return for the C short year must be filed (including extensions).
(6)
Year in which income from S short year is includible.
A shareholder must include in taxable income the shareholder's pro rata share of the items described in section 1366(a) for the S short year for the taxable year with or within which the S termination year ends.
(d)
Examples
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:
(1)
Example 1.
—S termination year not created.
(i) On January 1, 1993, the first day of its taxable year, a subchapter C corporation had three eligible shareholders. During 1993, the corporation properly elected to be treated as an S corporation effective January 1, 1994, the first day of the succeeding taxable year. Subsequently, a transfer of some of the stock in the corporation was made to an ineligible shareholder. The ineligible shareholder still holds the stock on January 1, 1994.
(ii) The corporation fails to meet the definition of a small business corporation on January 1, 1994, and its election is treated as having terminated on that date. See § 1.1362-2(b)(2) for the termination rules. Because the corporation ceases to be a small business corporation on the first day of a taxable year, an S termination year is not created. In addition, if the corporation in the future meets the definition of a small business corporation and desires to elect to be treated as an S corporation, the corporation is automatically granted consent to reelect before the expiration of the 5-year waiting period. See § 1.1362-5 for special rules concerning automatic consent to reelect.
(2)
Example 2.
More than 50 percent change in ownership during S short year.
A, an individual, owns all 100 outstanding shares of stock of S, a calendar year S corporation. On January 31, 1993, A sells 60 shares of S stock to B, an individual. On June 1, 1993, A sells 5 shares of S stock to PRS, a partnership. S ceases to be a small business corporation on June 1, 1993, and pursuant to section 1362(d)(2), its election terminates on that date. Because there was a more than 50 percent change in ownership of the issued and outstanding shares of S stock, S must assign the items of income, loss, deduction, or credit for the S termination year to the two short taxable years on the basis of S's normal method of accounting under the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(3)
Example 3.
More than 50 percent change in ownership during C short year.
A, an individual, owns all 100 outstanding shares of stock of S, a calendar year S corporation. On June 1, 1993, A sells 5 shares of S stock to PRS, a partnership. S ceases to be a small business corporation on that date and pursuant to section 1362(d)(3), its election terminates on that date. On July 1, 1993, A sells 60 shares of S stock to B, an individual. Since there was a more than 50 percent change in ownership of the issued and outstanding shares of S stock during the S termination year, S must assign the items of income, loss, deduction, or credit for the S termination year to the two short taxable years on the basis of S's normal method of accounting under the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(4)
Example 4.
Stock acquired other than by sale or exchange.
C and D are shareholders in S, a calendar year S corporation. Each owns 50 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of the corporation on December 31, 1993. On March 1, 1994, C makes a gift of his entire shareholder interest to T, a trust not permitted as a shareholder under section 1361(c)(2). S ceases to be a small business corporation on March 1, 1994, and pursuant to section 1362(d)(2), its S corporation election terminates effective on that date. As a result of the gift, T owns 50 percent of S's issued and outstanding stock. However, because T acquired the stock by gift from C rather than by sale or exchange, there has not been a more than 50 percent change in ownership by sale or exchange of S that would cause the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section to apply.

§ 1.1362-4
Inadvertent terminations and inadvertently invalid elections.
(a)
In general.
A corporation is treated as continuing to be an S corporation or a QSub (or, an invalid election to be either an S corporation or a QSub is treated as valid) during the period specified by the Commissioner if—
(1) The corporation made a valid election under section 1362(a) or section 1361(b)(3) and the election terminated or the corporation made an election under section 1362(a) or section 1361(b)(3) that was invalid;
(2) The Commissioner determines that the termination or invalidity was inadvertent;
(3) Within a reasonable period of time after discovery of the terminating event or invalid election, steps were taken so that the corporation for which the election was made or the termination occurred is a small business corporation or a QSub, as the case may be, or to acquire the required shareholder consents; and
(4) The corporation and shareholders agree to adjustments that the Commissioner may require for the period.
(b)
Inadvertent termination or inadvertently invalid election.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the determination of whether a termination or invalid election was inadvertent is made by the Commissioner. The corporation has the burden of establishing that under the relevant facts and circumstances the Commissioner should determine that the termination or invalid election was inadvertent. The fact that the terminating event or invalidity of the election was not reasonably within the control of the corporation and, in the case of a termination, was not part of a plan to terminate the election, or the fact that the terminating event or circumstance took place without the knowledge of the corporation, notwithstanding its due
diligence to safeguard itself against such an event or circumstance, tends to establish that the termination or invalidity of the election was inadvertent.
(c)
Corporation's request for determination of an inadvertent termination or invalid election.
A corporation that believes that the termination or invalidity of its election was inadvertent may request a determination from the Commissioner that the termination or invalidity of its election was inadvertent. The request is made in the form of a ruling request and should set forth all relevant facts pertaining to the event or circumstance including, but not limited to, the facts described in paragraph (b) of this section, the date of the corporation's election (or intended election) under section 1362(a) or 1361(b)(3), a detailed explanation of the event or circumstance causing the termination or invalidity, when and how the event or circumstance was discovered, and the steps taken under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(d)
Adjustments.
The Commissioner may require any adjustments that are appropriate. In general, the adjustments required should be consistent with the treatment of the corporation as an S corporation or QSub during the period specified by the Commissioner. In the case of stock held by an ineligible shareholder that causes an inadvertent termination or invalid election for an S corporation under section 1362(f), the Commissioner may require the ineligible shareholder to be treated as a shareholder of the S corporation during the period the ineligible shareholder actually held stock in the corporation. Moreover, the Commissioner may require protective adjustments that prevent the loss of any revenue due to the holding of stock by an ineligible shareholder (for example, a nonresident alien).
(e)
Corporation and shareholder consents.
The corporation and all persons who were shareholders of the corporation at any time during the period specified by the Commissioner must consent to any adjustments that the Commissioner may require. Each consent should be in the form of a statement agreeing to make the adjustments. The statement must be signed by the shareholder (in the case of shareholder consent) or a person authorized to sign the return required by section 6037 (in the case of corporate consent). See § 1.1362-6(b)(2) for persons required to sign consents. A shareholder's consent statement should include the name, address, and taxpayer identification numbers of the corporation and shareholder, the number of shares of stock owned by the shareholder, and the dates on which the shareholder owned any stock. The corporate consent statement should include the name, address, and taxpayer identification numbers of the corporation and each shareholder.
(f)
Status of corporation.
The status of the corporation after the terminating event or invalid election and before the determination of inadvertence is determined by the Commissioner. Inadvertent termination or inadvertent invalid election relief may be granted retroactively for all years for which the terminating event or circumstance giving rise to invalidity is effective, in which case the corporation is treated as if its election was valid or had not terminated. Alternatively, relief may be granted only for the period in which the corporation became eligible for subchapter S or QSub treatment, in which case the corporation is treated as a C corporation or, in the case of a QSub with an inadvertently terminated or invalid election, as a separate C corporation, during the period for which the corporation was not eligible for its intended status.
(g)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (f) of this section are effective on
August 14, 2008.
[T.D. 8449, 57 FR 55453, Nov. 25, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9422, 73 FR 47530, Aug. 14, 2008]
§ 1.1362-5
Election after termination.
(a)
In general.
Absent the Commissioner's consent, an S corporation whose election has terminated (or a successor corporation) may not make a new election under section 1362(a) for five taxable years as described in section 1362(g). However, the Commissioner may permit the corporation to make a new election before the 5-year period expires. The corporation has the burden of establishing that under the
relevant facts and circumstances, the Commissioner should consent to a new election. The fact that more than 50 percent of the stock in the corporation is owned by persons who did not own any stock in the corporation on the date of the termination tends to establish that consent should be granted. In the absence of this fact, consent ordinarily is denied unless the corporation shows that the event causing termination was not reasonably within the control of the corporation or shareholders having a substantial interest in the corporation and was not part of a plan on the part of the corporation or of such shareholders to terminate the election.
(b)
Successor corporation.
A corporation is a
successor corporation
to a corporation whose election under section 1362 has been terminated if—
(1) 50 percent or more of the stock of the corporation (the new corporation) is owned, directly or indirectly, by the same persons who, on the date of the termination, owned 50 percent or more of the stock of the corporation whose election terminated (the old corporation); and
(2) Either the new corporation acquires a substantial portion of the assets of the old corporation, or a substantial portion of the assets of the new corporation were assets of the old corporation.
(c)
Automatic consent after certain terminations.
A corporation may, without requesting the Commissioner's consent, make a new election under section 1362(a) before the 5-year period described in section 1362(g) expires if the termination occurred because the corporation—
(1) Revoked its election effective on the first day of the first taxable year for which its election was to be effective (see § 1.1362-2(a)(2)); or
(2) Failed to meet the definition of a small business corporation on the first day of the first taxable year for which its election was to be effective (see § 1.1362-2(b)(2)).
[T.D. 8449, 57 FR 55454, Nov. 25, 1992]
§ 1.1362-6
Elections and consents.
(a)
Time and manner of making elections
—(1)
In general.
An election statement made under this section must identify the election being made, set forth the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the corporation, and be signed by a person authorized to sign the return required to be filed under section 6037.
(2)
Election to be an S corporation
—(i)
Manner of making election.
A small business corporation makes an election under section 1362(a) to be an S corporation by filing a completed Form 2553. The election form must be filed with the service center designated in the instructions applicable to Form 2553. The election is not valid unless all shareholders of the corporation at the time of the election consent to the election in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section. However, once a valid election is made, new shareholders need not consent to that election.
(ii)
Time of making election
—(A)
In general.
The election described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section may be made by a small business corporation at any time during the taxable year that immediately precedes the taxable year for which the election is to be effective, or during the taxable year for which the election is to be effective provided that the election is made before the 16th day of the third month of the year. If a corporation makes an election for a taxable year, and the election meets all the requirements of this section but is made during the period beginning after the 15th day of the third month of the taxable year, the election is treated as being made for the following taxable year provided that the corporation meets all the requirements of section 1361(b) at the time the election is made. For taxable years of 2
1/2
months or less, an election made before the 16th day of the third month after the first day of the taxable year is treated as made during that year.
(B)
Elections made during the first 2
1/2
months treated as made for the following taxable year.
A timely election made by a small business corporation during the taxable year for which it is intended to be effective is nonetheless treated as made for the following taxable year if—
(
1
) The corporation is not a small business corporation during the entire
portion of the taxable year which occurs before the date the election is made; or
(
2
) Any person who held stock in the corporation at any time during the portion of the taxable year which occurs before the time the election is made, and who does not hold stock at the time the election is made, does not consent to the election.
(C)
Definition of month and beginning of the taxable year. Month
means a period commencing on the same numerical day of any calendar month as the day of the calendar month on which the taxable year began and ending with the close of the day preceding the numerically corresponding day of the succeeding calendar month or, if there is no corresponding day, with the close of the last day of the succeeding calendar month. In addition, the taxable year of a new corporation begins on the date that the corporation has shareholders, acquires assets, or begins doing business, whichever is the first to occur. The existence of incorporators does not necessarily begin the taxable year of a new corporation.
(iii)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Effective election; no prior taxable year.
A calendar year small business corporation begins its first taxable year on January 7, 1993. To be an S corporation beginning with its first taxable year, the corporation must make the election set forth in this section during the period that begins January 7, 1993, and ends before March 22, 1993. Because the corporation had no taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year for which the election is to be effective, an election made earlier than January 7, 1993, will not be valid.

# Example 2. Effective election; taxable year less than 2
1/2

# months.
A calendar year small business corporation begins its first taxable year on November 8, 1993. To be an S corporation beginning with its first taxable year, the corporation must make the election set forth in this section during the period that begins November 8, 1993, and ends before January 23, 1994.

# Example 3. Election effective for the following taxable year; ineligible shareholder.
On January 1, 1993, two individuals and a partnership own all of the stock of a calendar year subchapter C corporation. On January 31, 1993, the partnership dissolved and distributed its shares in the corporation to its five partners, all individuals. On February 28, 1993, the seven shareholders of the corporation consented to the corporation's election of subchapter S status. The corporation files a properly completed Form 2533 on March 2, 1993. The corporation is not eligible to be a subchapter S corporation for the 1993 taxable year because during the period of the taxable year prior to the election it had an ineligible shareholder. However, under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the election is treated as made for the corporation's 1994 taxable year.
(3)
Revocation of S election
—(i)
Manner of revoking election.
To revoke an election, the corporation files a statement that the corporation revokes the election made under section 1362(a). The statement must be filed with the service center where the election was properly filed. The revocation statement must include the number of shares of stock (including non-voting stock) issued and outstanding at the time the revocation is made. A revocation may be made only with the consent of shareholders who, at the time the revocation is made, hold more than one-half of the number of issued and outstanding shares of stock (including non-voting stock) of the corporation. Each shareholder who consents to the revocation must consent in the manner required under paragraph (b) of this section. In addition, each consent should indicate the number of issued and outstanding shares of stock (including non-voting stock) held by each shareholder at the time of the revocation.
(ii)
Time of revoking election.
For rules concerning when a revocation is effective, see § 1.1362-2(a)(2).
(iii)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (a)(3) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Revocation; consent of shareholders owning more than one-half of issued and outstanding shares.
A calendar year S corporation has issued an outstanding 40,000 shares of class A voting common stock and 20,000 shares of class B non-voting common stock. The corporation wishes to revoke its election of subchapter S status. Shareholders owning 11,000 shares of class A stock sign revocation consents. Shareholders owning 20,000 shares of class B stock sign revocation consents. The corporation has obtained the required shareholder consent to revoke its subchapter S election because shareholders owning more than one-half of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of stock
of the corporation consented to the revocation.

# Example 2. Effective prospective revocation.
In June 1993, a calendar year S corporation determines that it will revoke its subchapter S election effective August 1, 1993. To do so it must file its revocation statement with consents attached on or before August 1, 1993, and the statement must indicate that the revocation is intended to be effective August 1, 1993.
(4)
Rescission of revocation
—(i)
Manner of rescinding a revocation.
To rescind a revocation, the corporation files a statement that the corporation rescinds the revocation made under section 1362(d)(1). The statement must be filed with the service center where the revocation was properly filed. A rescission may be made only with the consent (in the manner required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) of each person who consented to the revocation and of each person who became a shareholder of the corporation within the period beginning on the first day after the date the revocation was made and ending on the date on which the rescission is made.
(ii)
Time of rescinding a revocation.
If the rescission statement is filed before the revocation becomes effective and is filed with proper service center, the rescission is effective on the date it is so filed.
(5)
Election not to apply pro rata allocation.
To elect not to apply the pro rata allocation rules to an S termination year, a corporation files a statement that it elects under section 1362(e)(3) not to apply the rules provided in section 1362(e)(2). In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the statement must set forth the cause of the termination and the date thereof. The statement must be filed with the corporation's return for the C short year. This election may be made only with the consent of all persons who are shareholders of the corporation at any time during the S short year and all persons who are shareholders of the corporation on the first day of the C short year (in the manner required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section).
(b)
Shareholders' consents
—(1)
Manner of consents in general.
A shareholder's consent required under paragraph (a) of this section must be in the form of a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the shareholder, the number of shares of stock owned by the shareholder, the date (or dates) on which the stock was acquired, the date on which the shareholder's taxable year ends, the name of the S corporation, the corporation's taxpayer identification number, and the election to which the shareholder consents. The statement must be signed by the shareholder under penalties of perjury. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the election of the corporation is not valid if any required consent is not filed in accordance with the rules contained in this paragraph (b). The consent statement should be attached to the corporation's election statement.
(2)
Persons required to consent.
The following rules apply in determining persons required to consent:
(i)
Community interest in stock.
When stock of the corporation is owned by husband and wife as community property (or the income from the stock is community property), or is owned by tenants in common, joint tenants, or tenants by the entirety, each person having a community interest in the stock or income therefrom and each tenant in common, joint tenant and tenant by the entirety must consent to the election.
(ii)
Minor.
The consent of a minor must be made by the minor or by the legal representative of the minor (or by a natural or an adoptive parent of the minor if no legal representative has been appointed).
(iii)
Estate.
The consent of an estate must be made by an executor or administrator thereof, or by any other fiduciary appointed by testamentary instrument or appointed by the court having jurisdiction over the administration of the estate.
(iv)
Trusts.
In the case of a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A) (including a trust treated under section 1361(d)(1)(A) as a trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(i) and excepting an electing small business trust described in section 1361(c)(2)(A)(v) (ESBT)), only the person treated as the shareholder for purposes of section 1361(b)(1) must consent to the election. When stock of
the corporation is held by a trust, both husband and wife must consent to any election if the husband and wife have a community interest in the trust property. See paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for rules concerning community interests in S corporation stock. In the case of an ESBT, the trustee and the owner of any portion of the trust that consists of the stock in one or more S corporations under subpart E, part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code must consent to the S corporation election. If there is more than one trustee, the trustee or trustees with authority to legally bind the trust must consent to the S corporation election.
(3)
Special rules for consent of shareholder to election to be an S corporation
—(i)
In general.
The consent of a shareholder to an election by a small business corporation under section 1362(a) may be made on Form 2553 or on a separate statement in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In addition, the separate statement must set forth the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the corporation. A shareholder's consent is binding and may not be withdrawn after a valid election is made by the corporation. Each person who is a shareholder (including any person who is treated as a shareholder under section 1361(c)(2)(B)) at the time the election is made) must consent to the election. If the election is made before the 16th day of the third month of the taxable year and is intended to be effective for that year, each person who was a shareholder (including any person who was treated as a shareholder under section 1361(c)(2)(B)) at any time during the portion of that year which occurs before the time the election is made, and who is not a shareholder at the time the election is made, must also consent to the election. If the election is to be effective for the following taxable year, no consent need be filed by any shareholder who is not a shareholder on the date of the election. Any person who is considered to be a shareholder under applicable State law solely by virtue of his or her status as an incorporator is not treated as a shareholder for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(i).
(ii)
Examples.
The principles of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Effective election; shareholder consents.
On January 1, 1993, the first day of its taxable year, a subchapter C corporation had 15 shareholders. On January 30, 1993, two of the C corporation's shareholders, A and B, both individuals, sold their shares in the corporation to P, Q, and R, all individuals. On March 1, 1993, the corporation filed its election to be an S corporation for the 1993 taxable year. The election will be effective (assuming the other requirements of section 1361(b) are met) provided that all of the shareholders as of March 1, 1993, as well as former shareholders A and B, consent to the election.

# Example 2. Consent of new shareholder unnecessary.
On January 1, 1993, three individuals own all of the stock of a calendar year subchapter C corporation. On April 15, 1993, the corporation, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, files a properly completed Form 2553. The corporation anticipates that the election will be effective beginning January 1, 1994, the first day of the succeeding taxable year. On October 1, 1993, the three shareholders collectively sell 75% of their shares in the corporation to another individual. On January 1, 1994, the corporation's shareholders are the three original individuals and the new shareholder. Because the election was valid and binding when made, it is not necessary for the new shareholder to consent to the election. The corporation's subchapter S election is effective on January 1, 1994 (assuming the other requirements of section 1361(b) are met).
(iii)
Extension of time for filing consents to an election
—(A)
In general.
An election that is timely filed for any taxable year and that would be valid except for the failure of any shareholder to file a timely consent is not invalid if consents are filed as required under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section and it is shown to the satisfaction of the district director or director of the service center with which the corporation files its income tax return that—
(
1
) There was reasonable cause for the failure to file the consent;
(
2
) The request for the extension of time to file a consent is made within a reasonable time under the circumstances; and
(
3
) The interests of the Government will not be jeopardized by treating the election as valid.
(B)
Required consents.
Consents must be filed within the extended period of time as may be granted by the Internal Revenue Service, by all persons who—
(
1
) Were shareholders of the corporation at any time during the period beginning as of the date of the invalid election and ending on the date on which an extension of time is granted in accordance with this paragraph (b)(3)(iii); and
(
2
) Have not previously consented to the election.
[T.D. 8449, 57 FR 55454, Nov. 25, 1992, as amended by T.D. 8994, 67 FR 34400, May 14, 2002]
§ 1.1362-7
Effective dates.
(a)
In general.
The provisions of §§ 1.1362-1 through 1.1362-6 apply to taxable years of corporations beginning after December 31, 1992. For taxable years to which these regulations do not apply, corporations and shareholders subject to the provisions of section 1362 must take reasonable return positions taking into consideration the statute; its legislative history; the provisions of §§ 18.1362-1 through 18.1362-5 (see 26 CFR part 18 as contained in the CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1992). In addition, following these regulations is a reasonable return position. See Notice 92-56, 1992-49 I.R.B. (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter), for additional guidance regarding reasonable return positions for years to which §§ 1.362-1 through 1.1362-6 do not apply. Section 1.1362-6(b)(2)(iv) is applicable for taxable years beginning on and after May 14, 2002.
(b)
Special effective date for passive investment income provisions.
For taxable years of an S corporation and all affected shareholders that are not closed, the S corporation and all affected shareholders may elect to apply the provisions of § 1.1362-2(c)(5). To make the election, the corporation and all affected shareholders must file a return or an amended return that is consistent with these rules for the taxable year for which the election is made and each subsequent taxable year. For purposes of this section,
affected shareholders
means all shareholders who received distributive shares of S corporation items in the taxable year for which the election is made and all shareholders of the S corporation for all subsequent taxable years. However, the Commissioner may, in appropriate circumstances, permit taxpayers to make this election even if all affected shareholders cannot file consistent returns.
[T.D. 8449, 57 FR 55456, Nov. 25, 1992, as amended by T.D. 8994, 67 FR 34401, May 14, 2002]
§ 1.1362-8
Dividends received from affiliated subsidiaries.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of section 1362(d)(3), if an S corporation holds stock in a C corporation meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2), the term
passive investment income
does not include dividends from the C corporation to the extent those dividends are attributable to the earnings and profits of the C corporation derived from the active conduct of a trade or business (active earnings and profits). For purposes of applying section 1362(d)(3), earnings and profits of a C corporation are active earnings and profits to the extent that the earnings and profits are derived from activities that would not produce passive investment income (as defined in section 1362(d)(3)) if the C corporation were an S corporation.
(b)
Determination of active or passive earnings and profits
—(1)
In general.
An S corporation may use any reasonable method to determine the amount of dividends that are not treated as passive investment income under section 1362(d)(3)(E). Paragraph (b)(5) of this section describes a method of determining the amount of dividends that are not treated as passive investment income under section 1362(d)(3)(E) that is deemed to be reasonable under all circumstances.
(2)
Lower tier subsidiaries.
If a C corporation subsidiary (upper tier corporation) holds stock in another C corporation (lower tier subsidiary) meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2), the upper tier corporation's gross receipts attributable to a dividend from the lower tier subsidiary are considered to be derived from the active conduct of a trade or business to the extent the lower tier subsidiary's earnings and profits are attributable to the active conduct of a trade or business by the subsidiary under paragraph
(b) (1), (3), (4), or (5) of this section. For purposes of this section, distributions by the lower tier subsidiary will be considered attributable to active earnings and profits according to the rule in paragraph (c) of this section. This paragraph (b)(2) does not apply to any member of a consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1(h)).
(3)
De minimis exception.
If less than 10 percent of a C corporation's earnings and profits for a taxable year are derived from activities that would produce passive investment income if the C corporation were an S corporation, all earnings and profits produced by the corporation during that taxable year are considered active earnings and profits.
(4)
Special rules for earnings and profits accumulated by a C corporation prior to 80 percent acquisition.
A C corporation may treat all earnings and profits accumulated by the corporation in all taxable years ending before the S corporation held stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) as active earnings and profits in the same proportion as the C corporation's active earnings and profits for the three taxable years ending prior to the time when the S corporation acquired 80 percent of the C corporation bears to the C corporation's total earnings and profits for those three taxable years.
(5)
Gross receipts safe harbor.
A corporation may treat its earnings and profits for a year as active earnings and profits in the same proportion as the corporation's gross receipts (as defined in § 1.1362-2(c)(4)) derived from activities that would not produce passive investment income (if the C corporation were an S corporation), including those that do not produce passive investment income under paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section, bear to the corporation's total gross receipts for the year in which the earnings and profits are produced.
(c)
Allocating distributions to active or passive earnings and profits
—(1)
Distributions from current earnings and profits.
Dividends distributed by a C corporation from current earnings and profits are attributable to active earnings and profits in the same proportion as current active earnings and profits bear to total current earnings and profits of the C corporation.
(2)
Distributions from accumulated earnings and profits.
Dividends distributed by a C corporation out of accumulated earnings and profits for a taxable year are attributable to active earnings and profits in the same proportion as accumulated active earnings and profits for that taxable year bear to total accumulated earnings and profits for that taxable year immediately prior to the distribution.
(3)
Adjustments to active earnings and profits.
For purposes of applying paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section to a distribution, the active earnings and profits of a corporation shall be reduced by the amount of any prior distribution properly treated as attributable to active earnings and profits from the same taxable year.
(4)
Special rules for consolidated groups.
For purposes of applying section 1362(d)(3) and this section to dividends received by an S corporation from the common parent of a consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1(h)), the following rules apply—
(i) The current earnings and profits, accumulated earnings and profits, and active earnings and profits of the common parent shall be determined under the principles of § 1.1502-33 (relating to earnings and profits of any member of a consolidated group owning stock of another member); and
(ii) The gross receipts of the common parent shall be the sum of the gross receipts of each member of the consolidated group (including the common parent), adjusted to eliminate gross receipts from intercompany transactions (as defined in § 1.1502-13(b)(1)(i)).
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) X, an S corporation, owns 85 percent of the one class of stock of Y. On December 31, 2002, Y declares a dividend of $100 ($85 to X), which is equal to Y's current earnings and profits. In 2002, Y has total gross receipts of $1,000, $200 of which would be passive investment income if Y were an S corporation.
(ii) One-fifth ($200/$1,000) of Y's gross receipts for 2002 is attributable to activities that would produce passive investment income. Accordingly, one-fifth of the $100 of earnings and profits is passive, and $17 (
1/5
of
$85) of the dividend from Y to X is passive investment income.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that Y owns 90 percent of the stock of Z. Y and Z do not join in the filing of a consolidated return. In 2002, Z has gross receipts of $15,000, $12,000 of which are derived from activities that would produce passive investment income. On December 31, 2002, Z declares a dividend of $1,000 ($900 to Y) from current earnings and profits.
(ii) Four-fifths ($12,000/$15,000) of the dividend from Z to Y are attributable to passive earnings and profits. Accordingly, $720 (
4/5
of $900) of the dividend from Z to Y is considered gross receipts from an activity that would produce passive investment income. The $900 dividend to Y gives Y a total of $1,900 ($1,000 + $900) in gross receipts, $920 ($200 + $720) of which is attributable to passive investment income-producing activities. Under these facts, $41 ($920/$1,900 of $85) of Y's distribution to X is passive investment income to X.
(e)
Effective date.
This section applies to dividends received in taxable years beginning on or after January 20, 2000; however, taxpayers may elect to apply the regulations in whole, but not in part, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2000, provided all affected taxpayers apply the regulations in a consistent manner. To make this election, the corporation and all affected taxpayers must file a return or an amended return that is consistent with these rules for the taxable year for which the election is made. For purposes of this section, affected taxpayers means all taxpayers whose returns are affected by the election to apply the regulations.

§ 1.1363-1
Effect of election on corporation.
(a)
Exemption of corporation from income tax
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (a), a small business corporation that makes a valid election under section 1362(a) is exempt from the taxes imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to taxable years of the corporation for which the election is in effect.
(2)
Corporate level taxes.
An S corporation is not exempt from the tax imposed by section 1374 (relating to the tax imposed on certain built-in gains), or section 1375 (relating to the tax on excess passive investment income). See also section 1363(d) (relating to the recapture of LIFO benefits) for the rules regarding the payment by an S corporation of LIFO recapture amounts.
(b)
Computation of corporate taxable income.
The taxable income of an S corporation is computed as described in section 1363(b).
(c)
Elections of the S corporation
—(1)
In general.
Any elections (other than those described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) affecting the computation of items derived from an S corporation are made by the corporation. For example, elections of methods of accounting, of computing depreciation, of treating soil and water conservation expenditures, and the option to deduct as expenses intangible drilling and development costs, are made by the corporation and not by the shareholders separately. All corporate elections are applicable to all shareholders.
(2)
Exceptions.
(i) Each shareholder's pro rata share of expenses described in section 617 paid or accrued by the S corporation is treated according to the shareholder's method of treating those expenses, notwithstanding the treatment of the expenses by the corporation.
(ii) Each shareholder may elect to amortize that shareholder's pro rata share of any qualified expenditure described in section 59(e) paid or accrued by the S corporation.
(iii) Each shareholder's pro rata share of taxes described in section 901 paid or accrued by the S corporation to foreign countries or possessions of the United States (according to its method of treating those taxes) is treated according to the shareholder's method of treating those taxes, and each shareholder may elect to use the total amount either as a credit against tax or as a deduction from income.
(d)
Effective date.
This section applies to taxable years of corporations beginning after December 31, 1992. For taxable years to which this section does not apply, corporations and shareholders subject to the provisions of section 1363 must take reasonable return positions taking into consideration the statute, its legislative history and these regulations. See Notice 92-56,
1992-49 I.R.B. (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter), for additional guidance regarding reasonable return positions for taxable years to which this section does not apply.
[T.D. 8449, 57 FR 55456, Nov. 25, 1992]
§ 1.1363-2
Recapture of LIFO benefits.
(a)
In general.
A C corporation must include the LIFO recapture amount (as defined in section 1363(d)(3)) in its gross income—
(1) In its last taxable year as a C corporation if the corporation inventoried assets under the LIFO method for its last taxable year before its S corporation election becomes effective; or
(2) In the year of transfer by the C corporation to an S corporation of the LIFO inventory assets if paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply and the C corporation—
(i) Inventoried assets under the LIFO method during the taxable year of the transfer of those LIFO inventory assets; and
(ii) Transferred the LIFO inventory assets to the S corporation in a nonrecognition transaction (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(45)) in which the transferred assets constitute transferred basis property (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(43)).
(b)
LIFO inventory held indirectly through partnership.
A C corporation must include the lookthrough LIFO recapture amount (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) in its gross income—
(1) In its last taxable year as a C corporation if, on the last day of the corporation's last taxable year before its S corporation election becomes effective, the corporation held a lookthrough partnership interest (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section); or
(2) In the year of transfer by the C corporation to an S corporation of a lookthrough partnership interest if the corporation transferred its lookthrough partnership interest to the S corporation in a nonrecognition transaction (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(45)) in which the transferred interest constitutes transferred basis property (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(43)).
(c)
Definitions and special rules
—(1)
Recapture date.
In the case of a transaction described in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, the recapture date is the day before the effective date of the S corporation election. In the case of a transaction described in paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(2) of this section, the recapture date is the date of the transfer of the partnership interest to the S corporation.
(2)
Determination of LIFO recapture amount.
The LIFO recapture amount shall be determined as of the end of the recapture date for transactions described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and as of the moment before the transfer occurs for transactions described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(3)
Lookthrough partnership interest.
A partnership interest is a lookthrough partnership interest if the partnership owns (directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships) assets accounted for under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (LIFO inventory).
(4)
Lookthrough LIFO recapture amount
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, a corporation's lookthrough LIFO recapture amount is the amount of income that would be allocated to the corporation, taking into account section 704(c) and § 1.704-3, if the partnership sold all of its LIFO inventory for the inventory's FIFO value. For this purpose, the FIFO value of inventory is the inventory amount of the inventory assets under the first-in, first-out method of accounting authorized by section 471, determined in accordance with section 1363(d)(4)(C).
(ii)
Determination of lookthrough LIFO recapture amount.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, the lookthrough LIFO recapture amount shall be determined as of the end of the recapture date for transactions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and as of the moment before the transfer occurs for transactions described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(iii)
Alternative rule.
If the partnership is not otherwise required to determine the inventory amount of the inventory using the LIFO method (the LIFO value) on the recapture date, the partnership may determine the lookthrough LIFO recapture amount as though the FIFO and LIFO values of
the inventory on the recapture date equaled the FIFO and LIFO values of the opening inventory for the partnership's taxable year that includes the recapture date. For this purpose, the opening inventory includes inventory contributed by a partner to the partnership on or before the recapture date and excludes inventory distributed by the partnership to a partner on or before the recapture date. A partnership that applies the alternative method of this paragraph (c)(4)(iii) to calculate the lookthrough LIFO recapture amount must take into account any adjustments to the partnership's basis in its LIFO inventory that result from transactions occurring after the start of the partnership's taxable year and before the end of the recapture date. For example, the lookthrough LIFO recapture amount must be adjusted to take into account any adjustments to the basis of LIFO inventory during that period under sections 734(b), 737(c), or 751(b).
(d)
Payment of tax.
Any increase in tax caused by including the LIFO recapture amount or the lookthrough LIFO recapture amount in the gross income of the C corporation is payable in four equal installments. The C corporation must pay the first installment of this payment by the due date of its return, determined without regard to extensions, for the last taxable year it operated as a C corporation if paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section applies, or for the taxable year of the transfer if paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(2) of this section applies. The three succeeding installments must be paid—
(1) For a transaction described in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, by the corporation that made the election under section 1362(a) to be an S corporation, on or before the due date for the corporation's returns (determined without regard to extensions) for the succeeding three taxable years; and
(2) For a transaction described in paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(2) of this section, by the transferee S corporation on or before the due date for the transferee corporation's returns (determined without regard to extensions) for the succeeding three taxable years.
(e)
Basis adjustments
—(1)
General rule.
Appropriate adjustments to the basis of inventory are to be made to reflect any amount included in income under paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
LIFO inventory owned through a partnership
—(i)
Basis of corporation's partnership interest.
Appropriate adjustments to the basis of the corporation's lookthrough partnership interest are to be made to reflect any amount included in income under paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii)
Basis of partnership assets.
A partnership directly holding LIFO inventory that is taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section may elect to adjust the basis of that LIFO inventory. In addition, a partnership that holds, through another partnership, LIFO inventory that is taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section may elect to adjust the basis of that partnership interest. Any adjustment under this paragraph (e)(2) to the basis of inventory held by the partnership is equal to the amount of LIFO recapture attributable to the inventory. Likewise, any adjustment under this paragraph (e)(2) to the basis of a lookthrough partnership interest held by the partnership is equal to the amount of LIFO recapture attributable to the interest. A basis adjustment under this paragraph (e)(2) is treated in the same manner and has the same effect as an adjustment to the basis of partnership property under section 743(b). See § 1.743-1(j).
(3)
Election.
A partnership elects to adjust the basis of its inventory and any lookthrough partnership interest that it owns by attaching a statement to its original or amended income tax return for the first taxable year ending on or after the date of the S corporation election or transfer described in paragraph (b) of this section. This statement shall state that the partnership is electing under this paragraph (e)(3) and must include the names, addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers of any corporate partner liable for tax under paragraph (d) of this section and of the partnership, as well as the amount of the adjustment and the portion of the adjustment that is attributable to each pool of inventory
or lookthrough partnership interest that is held by the partnership.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) G is a C corporation with a taxable year ending on June 30. GH is a partnership with a calendar year taxable year. G has a 20 percent interest in GH. The remaining 80 percent interest is owned by an individual. On April 25, 2005, G contributed inventory that is LIFO inventory to GH, increasing G's interest in the partnership to 50 percent. GH holds no other LIFO inventory, and there are no other adjustments to the partnership's basis in its LIFO inventory between January 1, 2005 and the end of the recapture date. G elects to be an S corporation effective July 1, 2005. The recapture date is June 30, 2005 under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. GH elects to use the LIFO method for the inventory and determines that the FIFO and LIFO values of the opening inventory for GH's 2005 taxable year, including the inventory contributed by G, are $200 and $120, respectively.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, GH is not required to determine the FIFO and LIFO values of the inventory on the recapture date. Instead, GH may determine the lookthrough LIFO recapture amount as though the FIFO and LIFO values of the inventory on the recapture date equaled the FIFO and LIFO values of the opening inventory for the partnership's taxable year (2005) that includes the recapture date. For this purpose, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the opening inventory includes the inventory contributed by G. The amount by which the FIFO value ($200) exceeds the LIFO value ($120) in GH's opening inventory is $80. Thus, if GH sold all of its LIFO inventory for $200, it would recognize $80 of income. G's lookthrough LIFO recapture amount is $80, the amount of income that would be allocated to G, taking into account section 704(c) and § 1.704-3, if GH sold all of its LIFO inventory for the FIFO value. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, G must include $80 in income in its taxable year ending on June 30, 2005. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, G must increase its basis in its interest in GH by $80. Under paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, and in accordance with section 743(b) principles, GH may elect to increase the basis (with respect to G only) of its LIFO inventory by $80.

# Example 2.
(i) J is a C corporation with a calendar year taxable year. JK is a partnership with a calendar year taxable year. J has a 30 percent interest in the partnership. JK owns LIFO inventory that is not section 704(c) property. J elects to be an S corporation effective January 1, 2005. The recapture date is December 31, 2004 under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. JK determines that the FIFO and LIFO values of the inventory on December 31, 2004 are $240 and $140, respectively.
(ii) The amount by which the FIFO value ($240) exceeds the LIFO value ($140) on the recapture date is $100. Thus, if JK sold all of its LIFO inventory for $240, it would recognize $100 of income. J's lookthrough LIFO recapture amount is $30, the amount of income that would be allocated to J if JK sold all of its LIFO inventory for the FIFO value (30 percent of $100). Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, J must include $30 in income in its taxable year ending on December 31, 2004. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, J must increase its basis in its interest in JK by $30. Under paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, and in accordance with section 743(b) principles, JK may elect to increase the basis (with respect to J only) of its inventory by $30.

§ 1.1366-1
Shareholder's share of items of an S corporation.
(a)
Determination of shareholder's tax liability
—(1)
In general.
An S corporation must report, and a shareholder is required to take into account in the shareholder's return, the shareholder's pro rata share, whether or not distributed, of the S corporation's items of income, loss, deduction, or credit described in paragraphs (a)(2), (3), and (4) of this section. A shareholder's pro rata share is determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1377(a) and the regulations thereunder. The shareholder takes these items into account in determining the shareholder's taxable income and tax liability for the shareholder's taxable year with or within which the taxable year of the corporation ends. If the shareholder dies (or if the shareholder is an estate or trust and the estate or trust terminates) before the end of the taxable year of the corporation, the shareholder's pro rata share of these items is taken into account on the shareholder's final return. For the limitation on allowance of a shareholder's pro rata share of S corporation losses or deductions, see section 1366(d) and § 1.1366-2.
(2)
Separately stated items of income, loss, deduction, or credit.
Each shareholder must take into account separately the shareholder's pro rata share of any item of income (including tax-exempt income), loss, deduction, or credit of the S corporation that if separately taken into account by any shareholder could affect the shareholder's tax liability for that taxable year differently than if the shareholder did not take the item into account separately. The separately stated items of the S corporation include, but are not limited to, the following items—
(i) The corporation's combined net amount of gains and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets grouped by applicable holding periods, by applicable rate of tax under section 1(h), and by any other classification that may be relevant in determining the shareholder's tax liability;
(ii) The corporation's combined net amount of gains and losses from sales or exchanges of property described in section 1231 (relating to property used
in the trade or business and involuntary conversions), grouped by applicable holding periods, by applicable rate of tax under section 1(h), and by any other classification that may be relevant in determining the shareholder's tax liability;
(iii) Charitable contributions, grouped by the percentage limitations of section 170(b), paid by the corporation within the taxable year of the corporation;
(iv) The taxes described in section 901 that have been paid (or accrued) by the corporation to foreign countries or to possessions of the United States;
(v) Each of the corporation's separate items involved in the determination of credits against tax allowable under part IV of subchapter A (section 21 and following) of the Internal Revenue Code, except for any credit allowed under section 34 (relating to certain uses of gasoline and special fuels);
(vi) Each of the corporation's separate items of gains and losses from wagering transactions (section 165(d)); soil and water conservation expenditures (section 175); deduction under an election to expense certain depreciable business expenses (section 179); medical, dental, etc., expenses (section 213); the additional itemized deductions for individuals provided in part VII of subchapter B (section 212 and following) of the Internal Revenue Code; and any other itemized deductions for which the limitations on itemized deductions under sections 67 or 68 applies;
(vii) Any of the corporation's items of portfolio income or loss, and expenses related thereto, as defined in the regulations under section 469;
(viii) The corporation's tax-exempt income. For purposes of subchapter S, tax-exempt income is income that is permanently excludible from gross income in all circumstances in which the applicable provision of the Internal Revenue Code applies. For example, income that is excludible from gross income under section 101 (certain death benefits) or section 103 (interest on state and local bonds) is tax-exempt income, while income that is excludible from gross income under section 108 (income from discharge of indebtedness) or section 109 (improvements by lessee on lessor's property) is not tax-exempt income;
(ix) The corporation's adjustments described in sections 56 and 58, and items of tax preference described in section 57; and
(x) Any item identified in guidance (including forms and instructions) issued by the Commissioner as an item required to be separately stated under this paragraph (a)(2).
(3)
Nonseparately computed income or loss.
Each shareholder must take into account separately the shareholder's pro rata share of the nonseparately computed income or loss of the S corporation. For this purpose, nonseparately computed income or loss means the corporation's gross income less the deductions allowed to the corporation under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, determined by excluding any item requiring separate computation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(4)
Separate activities requirement.
An S corporation must report, and each shareholder must take into account in the shareholder's return, the shareholder's pro rata share of an S corporation's items of income, loss, deduction, or credit described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section for each of the corporation's activities as defined in section 469 and the regulations thereunder.
(5)
Aggregation of deductions or exclusions for purposes of limitations
—(i)
In general.
A shareholder aggregates the shareholder's separate deductions or exclusions with the shareholder's pro rata share of the S corporation's separately stated deductions or exclusions in determining the amount of any deduction or exclusion allowable to the shareholder under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code as to which a limitation is imposed.
(ii)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In 1999, Corporation M, a calendar year S corporation, purchases and places in service section 179 property costing $10,000. Corporation M elects to expense the entire cost of the property. Shareholder A owns 50 percent of the stock of Corporation M. Shareholder A's pro rata share of this item after Corporation M applies the section
179(b) limitations is $5,000. Because the aggregate amount of Shareholder A's pro rata share and separately acquired section 179 expense may not exceed $19,000 (the aggregate maximum cost that may be taken into account under section 179(a) for the applicable taxable year), Shareholder A may elect to expense up to $14,000 of separately acquired section 179 property that is purchased and placed in service in 1999, subject to the limitations of section 179(b).
(b)
Character of items constituting pro rata share
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, the character of any item of income, loss, deduction, or credit described in section 1366(a)(1)(A) or (B) and paragraph (a) of this section is determined for the S corporation and retains that character in the hands of the shareholder. For example, if an S corporation has capital gain on the sale or exchange of a capital asset, a shareholder's pro rata share of that gain will also be characterized as a capital gain regardless of whether the shareholder is otherwise a dealer in that type of property. Similarly, if an S corporation engages in an activity that is not for profit (as defined in section 183), a shareholder's pro rata share of the S corporation's deductions will be characterized as not for profit. Also, if an S corporation makes a charitable contribution to an organization qualifying under section 170(b)(1)(A), a shareholder's pro rata share of the S corporation's charitable contribution will be characterized as made to an organization qualifying under section 170(b)(1)(A).
(2)
Exception for contribution of noncapital gain property.
If an S corporation is formed or availed of by any shareholder or group of shareholders for a principal purpose of selling or exchanging contributed property that in the hands of the shareholder or shareholders would not have produced capital gain if sold or exchanged by the shareholder or shareholders, then the gain on the sale or exchange of the property recognized by the corporation is not treated as a capital gain.
(3)
Exception for contribution of capital loss property.
If an S corporation is formed or availed of by any shareholder or group of shareholders for a principal purpose of selling or exchanging contributed property that in the hands of the shareholder or shareholders would have produced capital loss if sold or exchanged by the shareholder or shareholders, then the loss on the sale or exchange of the property recognized by the corporation is treated as a capital loss to the extent that, immediately before the contribution, the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the shareholder or shareholders exceeded the fair market value of the property.
(c)
Gross income of a shareholder
—(1)
In general.
Where it is necessary to determine the amount or character of the gross income of a shareholder, the shareholder's gross income includes the shareholder's pro rata share of the gross income of the S corporation. The shareholder's pro rata share of the gross income of the S corporation is the amount of gross income of the corporation used in deriving the shareholder's pro rata share of S corporation taxable income or loss (including items described in section 1366(a)(1)(A) or (B) and paragraph (a) of this section). For example, a shareholder is required to include the shareholder's pro rata share of S corporation gross income in computing the shareholder's gross income for the purposes of determining the necessity of filing a return (section 6012(a)) and the shareholder's gross income derived from farming (sections 175 and 6654(i)).
(2)
Gross income for substantial omission of items
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining the applicability of the 6-year period of limitation on assessment and collection provided in section 6501(e) (relating to omission of more than 25 percent of gross income), a shareholder's gross income includes the shareholder's pro rata share of S corporation gross income (as described in section 6501(e)(1)(A)(i)). In this respect, the amount of S corporation gross income used in deriving the shareholder's pro rata share of any item of S corporation income, loss, deduction, or credit (as included or disclosed in the shareholder's return) is considered as an amount of gross income stated in the shareholder's return for purposes of section 6501(e).
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section:

# Example.
Shareholder A, an individual, owns 25 percent of the stock of Corporation N, an S corporation that has $10,000 gross income and $2,000 taxable income. A reports only $300 as A's pro rata share of N's taxable income. A should have reported $500 as A's pro rata share of taxable income, derived from A's pro rata share, $2,500, of N's gross income. Because A's return included only $300 without a disclosure meeting the requirements of section 6501(e)(1)(A)(ii) describing the difference of $200, A is regarded as having reported on the return only $1,500 ($300/$500 of $2,500) as gross income from N.
(d)
Shareholders holding stock subject to community property laws.
If a shareholder holds S corporation stock that is community property, then the shareholder's pro rata share of any item or items listed in paragraphs (a)(2), (3), and (4) of this section with respect to that stock is reported by the husband and wife in accordance with community property rules.
(e)
Net operating loss deduction of shareholder of S corporation.
For purposes of determining a net operating loss deduction under section 172, a shareholder of an S corporation must take into account the shareholder's pro rata share of items of income, loss, deduction, or credit of the corporation. See section 1366(b) and paragraph (b) of this section for rules on determining the character of the items. In determining under section 172(d)(4) the nonbusiness deductions allowable to a shareholder of an S corporation (arising from both corporation sources and any other sources), the shareholder separately takes into account the shareholder's pro rata share of the deductions of the corporation that are not attributable to a trade or business and combines this amount with the shareholder's nonbusiness deductions from any other sources. The shareholder also separately takes into account the shareholder's pro rata share of the gross income of the corporation not derived from a trade or business and combines this amount with the shareholder's nonbusiness income from all other sources. See section 172 and the regulations thereunder.

[T.D. 8852, 64 FR 71645, Dec. 22, 1999]
§ 1.1366-2
Limitations on deduction of passthrough items of an S corporation to its shareholders.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Limitation on losses and deductions.
The aggregate amount of losses and deductions taken into account by a shareholder under § 1.1366-1(a) (2), (3), and (4) for any taxable year of an S corporation cannot exceed the sum of—
(i) The adjusted basis of the shareholder's stock in the corporation (as determined under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section); and
(ii) The adjusted basis of any indebtedness of the corporation to the shareholder (as determined under paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section).
(2)
Basis of indebtedness
—(i)
In general.
The term
basis of any indebtedness of the S corporation to the shareholder
means the shareholder's adjusted basis (as defined in § 1.1011-1 and as specifically provided in section 1367(b)(2)) in any bona fide indebtedness of the S corporation that runs directly to the shareholder. Whether indebtedness is bona fide indebtedness to a shareholder is determined under general Federal tax principles and depends upon all of the facts and circumstances.
(ii)
Special rule for guarantees.
A shareholder does not obtain basis of indebtedness in the S corporation merely by guaranteeing a loan or acting as a surety, accommodation party, or in any similar capacity relating to a loan. When a shareholder makes a payment on bona fide indebtedness of the S corporation for which the shareholder has acted as guarantor or in a similar capacity, then the shareholder may increase the shareholder's basis of indebtedness to the extent of that payment.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:

# Example 1.
Shareholder loan transaction.
A is the sole shareholder of S, an S corporation. S received a loan from A. Whether the loan from A to S constitutes bona fide indebtedness from S to A is determined under general Federal tax principles and depends upon all of the facts and circumstances. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. If the loan constitutes bona fide indebtedness from S to A, A's loan to S increases A's basis of indebtedness under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
The result is the same if A made the loan to S through an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from A under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter.

# Example 2.
Back-to-back loan transaction.
A is the sole shareholder of two S corporations, S1 and S2. S1 loaned $200,000 to A. A then loaned $200,000 to S2. Whether the loan from A to S2 constitutes bona fide indebtedness from S2 to A is determined under general Federal tax principles and depends upon all of the facts and circumstances. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. If A's loan to S2 constitutes bona fide indebtedness from S2 to A, A's back-to-back loan increases A's basis of indebtedness in S2 under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

# Example 3.
Loan restructuring through distributions.
A is the sole shareholder of two S corporations, S1 and S2. In May 2014, S1 made a loan to S2. In December 2014, S1 assigned its creditor position in the note to A by making a distribution to A of the note. Under local law, after S1 distributed the note to A, S2 was relieved of its liability to S1 and was directly liable to A. Whether S2 is indebted to A rather than S1 is determined under general Federal tax principles and depends upon all of the facts and circumstances. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. If the note constitutes bona fide indebtedness from S2 to A, the note increases A's basis of indebtedness in S2 under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

# Example 4.
Guarantee.
A is a shareholder of S, an S corporation. In 2014, S received a loan from Bank. Bank required A's guarantee as a condition of making the loan to S. Beginning in 2015, S could no longer make payments on the loan and A made payments directly to Bank from A's personal funds until the loan obligation was satisfied. For each payment A made on the note, A obtains basis of indebtedness under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, A's basis of indebtedness is increased during 2015 under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section to the extent of A's payments to Bank pursuant to the guarantee agreement.
(3)
Carryover of disallowance.
A shareholder's aggregate amount of losses and deductions for a taxable year in excess of the sum of the adjusted basis of the shareholder's stock in an S corporation and of any indebtedness of the S corporation to the shareholder is not allowed for the taxable year. However, any disallowed loss or deduction retains its character and is treated as incurred by the corporation in the corporation's first succeeding taxable year, and subsequent taxable years, with respect to the shareholder. For rules on determining the adjusted bases of stock of an S corporation and indebtedness of the corporation to the shareholder, see paragraphs (a)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section.
(4)
Basis limitation amount
—(i)
Stock portion.
A shareholder generally determines the adjusted basis of stock for purposes of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (3) of this section (limiting losses and deductions) by taking into account only increases in basis under section 1367(a)(1) for the taxable year and decreases in basis under section 1367(a)(2) (A), (D) and (E) (relating to distributions, noncapital, nondeductible expenses, and certain oil and gas depletion deductions) for the taxable year. In so determining this loss limitation amount, the shareholder disregards decreases in basis under section 1367(a)(2) (B) and (C) (for losses and deductions, including losses and deductions previously disallowed) for the taxable year. However, if the shareholder has in effect for the taxable year an election under § 1.1367-1(g) to decrease basis by items of loss and deduction prior to decreasing basis by noncapital, nondeductible expenses and certain oil and gas depletion deductions, the shareholder also disregards decreases in basis under section 1367(a)(2) (D) and (E). This basis limitation amount for stock is determined at the time prescribed under § 1.1367-1(d)(1) for adjustments to the basis of stock.
(ii)
Indebtedness portion.
A shareholder determines the shareholder's adjusted basis in indebtedness of the corporation for purposes of paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (3) of this section (limiting losses and deductions) without regard to any adjustment under section 1367(b)(2)(A) for the taxable year. This basis limitation amount for indebtedness is determined at the time prescribed under § 1.1367-2(d)(1) for adjustments to the basis of indebtedness.
(5)
Limitation on losses and deductions allocated to each item.
If a shareholder's pro rata share of the aggregate amount of losses and deductions specified in § 1.1366-1(a)(2), (3), and (4) exceeds the sum of the adjusted basis of the shareholder's stock in the corporation (determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section) and the adjusted basis of any indebtedness of the
corporation to the shareholder (determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section), then the limitation on losses and deductions under section 1366(d)(1) must be allocated among the shareholder's pro rata share of each loss or deduction. The amount of the limitation allocated to any loss or deduction is an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of the limitation as the loss or deduction bears to the total of the losses and deductions. For this purpose, the total of losses and deductions for the taxable year is the sum of the shareholder's pro rata share of losses and deductions for the taxable year, and the losses and deductions disallowed and carried forward from prior years pursuant to section 1366(d)(2).
(6)
Nontransferability of losses and deductions
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, any loss or deduction disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is personal to the shareholder and cannot in any manner be transferred to another person. If a shareholder transfers some but not all of the shareholder's stock in the corporation, the amount of any disallowed loss or deduction under this section is not reduced and the transferee does not acquire any portion of the disallowed loss or deduction. If a shareholder transfers all of the shareholder's stock in the corporation, any disallowed loss or deduction is permanently disallowed.
(ii)
Exceptions for transfers of stock under section 1041(a).
If a shareholder transfers stock of an S corporation after December 31, 2004, in a transfer described in section 1041(a), any loss or deduction with respect to the transferred stock that is disallowed to the transferring shareholder under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be treated as incurred by the corporation in the following taxable year with respect to the transferee spouse or former spouse. The amount of any loss or deduction with respect to the stock transferred shall be determined by prorating any losses or deductions disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the year of the transfer between the transferor and the spouse or former spouse based on the stock ownership at the beginning of the following taxable year. If a transferor claims a deduction for losses in the taxable year of transfer, then under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, if the transferor's pro rata share of the losses and deductions in the year of transfer exceeds the transferor's basis in stock and the indebtedness of the corporation to the transferor, then the limitation must be allocated among the transferor spouse's pro rata share of each loss or deduction, including disallowed losses and deductions carried over from the prior year.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrates the provisions of paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section:

# Example 1. A
owns all 100 shares in
X
, a calendar year S corporation. For
X
's taxable year ending December 31, 2006,
A
has zero basis in the shares and
X
does not have any indebtedness to
A.
For the 2006 taxable year,
X
had $100 in losses that
A
cannot use because of the basis limitation in section 1366(d)(1) and that are treated as incurred by the corporation with respect to
A
in the following taxable year. Halfway through the 2007 taxable year,
A
transfers 50 shares to
B, A
's former spouse in a transfer to which section 1041(a) applies. In the 2007 taxable year,
X
has $80 in losses. On
A
's 2007 individual income tax return,
A
may use the entire $100 carryover loss from 2006, as well as
A
's share of the $80 2007 loss determined under section 1377(a) ($60), assuming A acquires sufficient basis in the
X
stock. On
B
's 2007 individual income tax return,
B
may use
B
's share of the $80 2007 loss determined under section 1377(a) ($20), assuming
B
has sufficient basis in the
X
stock. If any disallowed 2006 loss is disallowed to
A
under section 1366(d)(1) in 2007, that loss is prorated between
A
and
B
based on their stock ownership at the beginning of 2008. On
B
's 2008 individual income tax return,
B
may use that loss, assuming
B
acquires sufficient basis in the
X
stock. If neither
A
nor
B
acquires any basis during the 2007 taxable year, then as of the beginning of 2008, the corporation will be treated as incurring $50 of loss with respect to
A
and $50 of loss with respect to
B
for the $100 of disallowed 2006 loss, and the corporation will be treated as incurring $60 of loss with respect to
A
and $20 with respect to
B
for the $80 of disallowed 2007 loss.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as
Example 1
, except that during the 2007 taxable year,
A
acquires $10 of basis in
A
's shares in
X.
For the 2007 taxable year,
A
may claim a $10 loss deduction, which represents $6.25 of the disallowed 2006 loss of $100 and $3.75 of
A
's 2007 loss of $60. The disallowed 2006 loss is reduced to $93.75. As of the beginning of 2008, the corporation will be treated as incurring
half of the remaining $93.75 of loss with respect to
A
and half of that loss with respect to
B
for the remaining $93.75 of disallowed 2006 loss, and if
B
does not acquire any basis during 2007, the corporation will be treated as incurring $56.25 of loss with respect to
A
and $20 with respect to
B
for the remaining disallowed 2007 loss.
(7)
Basis of stock acquired by gift.
For purposes of section 1366(d)(1)(A) and paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (3) of this section, the basis of stock in a corporation acquired by gift is the basis of the stock that is used for purposes of determining loss under section 1015(a).
(b)
Special rules for carryover of disallowed losses and deductions to post-termination transition period described in section 1377(b)
—(1)
In general.
If, for the last taxable year of a corporation for which it was an S corporation, a loss or deduction was disallowed to a shareholder by reason of the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, the loss or deduction is treated under section 1366(d)(3) as incurred by that shareholder on the last day of any post-termination transition period (within the meaning of section 1377(b)).
(2)
Limitation on losses and deductions.
The aggregate amount of losses and deductions taken into account by a shareholder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section cannot exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder's stock in the corporation determined at the close of the last day of the post-termination transition period. For this purpose, the adjusted basis of a shareholder's stock in the corporation is determined at the close of the last day of the post-termination transition period without regard to any reduction required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. If a shareholder disposes of a share of stock prior to the close of the last day of the post-termination transition period, the adjusted basis of that share is its basis as of the close of the day of disposition. Any losses and deductions in excess of a shareholder's adjusted stock basis are permanently disallowed. For purposes of section 1366(d)(3)(B) and this paragraph (b)(2), the basis of stock in a corporation acquired by gift is the basis of the stock that is used for purposes of determining loss under section 1015(a).
(3)
Limitation on losses and deductions allocated to each item.
If the aggregate amount of losses and deductions treated as incurred by the shareholder under paragraph (b)(1) of this section exceeds the adjusted basis of the shareholder's stock determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the limitation on losses and deductions under section 1366(d)(3)(B) must be allocated among each loss or deduction. The amount of the limitation allocated to each loss or deduction is an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of the limitation as the amount of each loss or deduction bears to the total of all the losses and deductions.
(4)
Adjustment to the basis of stock.
The shareholder's basis in the stock of the corporation is reduced by the amount allowed as a deduction by reason of this paragraph (b). For rules regarding adjustments to the basis of a shareholder's stock in an S corporation, see § 1.1367-1.
(c)
Carryover of disallowed losses and deductions in the case of liquidations, reorganizations, and divisions
—(1)
Liquidations and reorganizations.
If a corporation acquires the assets of an S corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, any loss or deduction disallowed under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to a shareholder of the distributor or transferor S corporation is available to that shareholder as a shareholder of the acquiring corporation. Thus, where the acquiring corporation is an S corporation, a loss or deduction of a shareholder of the distributor or transferor S corporation disallowed prior to or during the taxable year of the transaction is treated as incurred by the acquiring S corporation with respect to that shareholder if the shareholder is a shareholder of the acquiring S corporation after the transaction. Where the acquiring corporation is a C corporation, a post-termination transition period arises the day after the last day that an S corporation was in existence and the rules provided in paragraph (b) of this section apply with respect to any shareholder of the acquired S corporation that is also a shareholder of the acquiring C corporation after the transaction. See the special rules under section 1377 for the availability of the post-termination transition period if the acquiring corporation is a C corporation.
(2)
Corporate separations to which section 368(a)(1)(D) applies.
If an S corporation transfers a portion of its assets constituting an active trade or business to another corporation in a transaction to which section 368(a)(1)(D) applies, and immediately thereafter the stock and securities of the controlled corporation are distributed in a distribution or exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, any loss or deduction disallowed under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to a shareholder of the distributing S corporation immediately before the transaction is allocated between the distributing corporation and the controlled corporation with respect to the shareholder. Such allocation shall be made according to any reasonable method, including a method based on the relative fair market value of the shareholder's stock in the distributing and controlled corporations immediately after the distribution, a method based on the relative adjusted basis of the assets in the distributing and controlled corporations immediately after the distribution, or, in the case of losses and deductions clearly attributable to either the distributing or controlled corporation, any method that allocates such losses and deductions accordingly.
[T.D. 8852, 64 FR 71646, Dec. 22, 1999, as amended by T.D. 9422, 73 FR 47531, Aug. 14, 2008; T.D. 9682, 79 FR 42678, July 23, 2014]
§ 1.1366-3
Treatment of family groups.
(a)
In general.
Under section 1366(e), if an individual, who is a member of the family of one or more shareholders of an S corporation, renders services for, or furnishes capital to, the corporation without receiving reasonable compensation, the Commissioner shall prescribe adjustments to those items taken into account by the individual and the shareholders as may be necessary to reflect the value of the services rendered or capital furnished. For these purposes, in determining the reasonable value for services rendered, or capital furnished, to the corporation, consideration will be given to all the facts and circumstances, including the amount that ordinarily would be paid in order to obtain comparable services or capital from a person (other than a member of the family) who is not a shareholder in the corporation. In addition, for purposes of section 1366(e), if a member of the family of one or more shareholders of the S corporation holds an interest in a passthrough entity (e.g., a partnership, S corporation, trust, or estate), that performs services for, or furnishes capital to, the S corporation without receiving reasonable compensation, the Commissioner shall prescribe adjustments to the passthrough entity and the corporation as may be necessary to reflect the value of the services rendered or capital furnished. For purposes of section 1366(e), the term
family
of any shareholder includes only the shareholder's spouse, ancestors, lineal descendants, and any trust for the primary benefit of any of these persons.
(b)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The stock of an S corporation is owned 50 percent by F and 50 percent by T, the minor son of F. For the taxable year, the corporation has items of taxable income equal to $70,000. Compensation of $10,000 is paid by the corporation to F for services rendered during the taxable year, and no compensation is paid to T, who rendered no services. Based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, reasonable compensation for the services rendered by F would be $30,000. In the discretion of the Internal Revenue Service, up to an additional $20,000 of the $70,000 of the corporation's taxable income, for tax purposes, may be allocated to F as compensation for services rendered. If the Internal Revenue Service allocates $20,000 of the corporation's taxable income to F as compensation for services, taxable income of the corporation would be reduced by $20,000 to $50,000, of which F and T each would be allocated $25,000. F would have $30,000 of total compensation paid by the corporation for services rendered.

# Example 2.
The stock of an S corporation is owned by A and B. For the taxable year, the corporation has paid compensation to a partnership that rendered services to the corporation during the taxable year. The spouse of A is a partner in that partnership. Consequently, if based on all the relevant facts and circumstances the partnership did not receive reasonable compensation for the services rendered to the corporation, the Internal Revenue Service, in its discretion, may make adjustments to those items taken
into account by the partnership and the corporation as may be necessary to reflect the value of the services rendered.
[T.D. 8852, 64 FR 71648, Dec. 22, 1999]
§ 1.1366-4
Special rules limiting the passthrough of certain items of an S corporation to its shareholders.
(a)
Passthrough inapplicable to section 34 credit.
Section 1.1366-1(a) does not apply to any credit allowable under section 34 (relating to certain uses of gasoline and special fuels).
(b)
Reduction in passthrough for tax imposed on built-in gains.
For purposes of § 1.1366-1(a), if for any taxable year of the S corporation a tax is imposed on the corporation under section 1374, the amount of the tax imposed is treated as a loss sustained by the S corporation during the taxable year. The character of the deemed loss is determined by allocating the loss proportionately among the net recognized built-in gains giving rise to the tax and attributing the character of each net recognized built-in gain to the allocable portion of the loss.
(c)
Reduction in passthrough for tax imposed on excess net passive income.
For purposes of § 1.1366-1(a), if for any taxable year of the S corporation a tax is imposed on the corporation under section 1375, each item of passive investment income shall be reduced by an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of the tax as the net amount of the item bears to the total net passive investment income for that taxable year.

§ 1.1366-5
Effective/applicability date.
(a) Sections 1.1366-1, 1.1366-2(a)(1), and 1.1366-2(b) through 1.1366-4 apply to taxable years of an S corporation beginning on or after August 18, 1998.
(b) Section 1.1366-2(a)(2) applies to indebtedness between an S corporation and its shareholder resulting from any transaction occurring on or after July 23, 2014. In addition, S corporations and their shareholders may rely on § 1.1366-2(a)(2) with respect to indebtedness between an S corporation and its shareholder that resulted from any transaction that occurred in a year for which the period of limitations on the assessment of tax has not expired before July 23, 2014.
(c) Sections 1.1366-2(a)(3) through (7), and this section apply on and after July 23, 2014. For rules that apply before that date, see 26 CFR part 1 (revised as of April 1, 2014).

§ 1.1367-1
Adjustments to basis of shareholder's stock in an S corporation.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Adjustments under section 1367.
This section provides rules relating to adjustments required by section 1367 to the basis of a shareholder's stock in an S corporation. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules concerning increases in the basis of a shareholder's stock, and paragraph (c) of this section provides rules concerning decreases in the basis of a shareholder's stock.
(2)
Applicability of other Internal Revenue Code provisions.
In addition to the adjustments required by section 1367 and this section, the basis of stock is determined or adjusted under other applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
(b)
Increase in basis of stock
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in § 1.1367-2(c) (relating to restoration of basis of indebtedness to the shareholder), the basis of a shareholder's stock in an S corporation is increased by the sum of the items described in section 1367(a)(1). The increase in basis described in section 1367(a)(1)(C) for the excess of the deduction for depletion over the basis of the property subject to depletion does not include the depletion deduction attributable to oil or gas property. See section 613(A)(c)(11).
(2)
Amount of increase in basis of individual shares.
The basis of a shareholder's share of stock is increased by an amount equal to the shareholder's pro rata portion of the items described in section 1367(a)(1) that is attributable to that share, determined on a per share, per day basis in accordance with section 1377(a).
(c)
Decrease in basis of stock
—(1)
In general.
The basis of a shareholder's stock in an S corporation is decreased (but not below zero) by the sum of the items described in section 1367(a)(2).
(2)
Noncapital, nondeductible expenses.
For purposes of section 1367(a)(2)(D), expenses of the corporation not deductible in computing its taxable income and not properly chargeable to a capital account (
noncapital, nondeductible expenses
) are only those items for which no loss or deduction is allowable and do not include items the deduction for which is deferred to a later taxable year. Examples of noncapital, nondeductible expenses include (but are not limited to) the following: Illegal bribes, kickbacks, and other payments not deductible under section 162(c); fines and penalties not deductible under section 162(f); expenses and interest relating to tax-exempt income under section 265; losses for which the deduction is disallowed under section 267(a)(1); the portion of meals and entertainment expenses disallowed under section 274; and the two-thirds portion of treble damages paid for violating antitrust laws not deductible under section 162.For basis adjustments necessary to coordinate sections 1367 and 362(e)(2), see § 1.362-4(e)(2).
(3)
Amount of decrease in basis of individual shares.
The basis of a shareholder's share of stock is decreased by an amount equal to the shareholder's pro rata portion of the passthrough items and distributions described in section 1367(a)(2) attributable to that share, determined on a per share, per day basis in accordance with section 1377(a). If the amount attributable to a share exceeds its basis, the excess is applied to reduce (but not below zero) the remaining bases of all other shares of stock in the corporation owned by the shareholder in proportion to the remaining basis of each of those shares.
(d)
Time at which adjustments to basis of stock are effective
—(1)
In general.
The adjustments described in section 1367(a) to the basis of a shareholder's stock are determined as of the close of the corporation's taxable year, and the adjustments generally are effective as of that date. However, if a shareholder disposes of stock during the corporation's taxable year, the adjustments with respect to that stock are effective immediately prior to the disposition.
(2)
Adjustment for nontaxable item.
An adjustment for a nontaxable item is determined for the taxable year in which the item would have been includible or deductible under the corporation's method of accounting for Federal income tax purposes if the item had been subject to Federal income taxation.
(3)
Effect of election under section 1377(a)(2) or § 1.1368-1(g)(2).
If an election under section 1377(a)(2) (to terminate the year in the case of the termination of a shareholder's interest) or under § 1.1368-1(g)(2) (to terminate the year in the case of a qualifying disposition) is made with respect to the taxable year of a corporation, this paragraph (d) applies as if the taxable year consisted of separate taxable years, the first of which ends at the close of the day on which either the shareholder's interest is terminated or a qualifying disposition occurs, whichever the case may be.
(e)
Ordering rules for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1997.
For any taxable year of a corporation beginning before January 1, 1997, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the adjustments required by section 1367(a) are made in the following order—
(1) Any increase in basis attributable to the income items described in section 1367(a)(1) (A) and (B) and the excess of the deductions for depletion described in section 1367(a)(1)(C);
(2) Any decrease in basis attributable to noncapital, nondeductible expenses described in section 1367(a)(2)(D) and the oil and gas depletion deduction described in section 1367(a)(2)(E);
(3) Any decrease in basis attributable to items of loss or deduction described in section 1367(a)(2) (B) and (C); and
(4) Any decrease in basis attributable to a distribution by the corporation described in section 1367(a)(2)(A).
(f)
Ordering rules for taxable years beginning on or after August 18, 1998.
For any taxable year of a corporation beginning on or after August 18, 1998, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the adjustments required by section 1367(a) are made in the following order—
(1) Any increase in basis attributable to the income items described in section 1367(a)(1)(A) and (B), and the excess of the deductions for depletion described in section 1367(a)(1)(C);
(2) Any decrease in basis attributable to a distribution by the corporation described in section 1367(a)(2)(A);
(3) Any decrease in basis attributable to noncapital, nondeductible expenses described in section 1367(a)(2)(D), and the oil and gas depletion deduction described in section 1367(a)(2)(E); and
(4) Any decrease in basis attributable to items of loss or deduction described in section 1367(a)(2)(B) and (C).
(g)
Elective ordering rule.
A shareholder may elect to decrease basis under paragraph (e)(3) or (f)(4) of this section, whichever applies, prior to decreasing basis under paragraph (e)(2) or (f)(3) of this section, whichever applies. If a shareholder makes this election, any amount described in paragraph (e)(2) or (f)(3) of this section, whichever applies, that is in excess of the shareholder's basis in stock and indebtedness is treated, solely for purposes of this section, as an amount described in paragraph (e)(2) or (f)(3) of this section, whichever applies, in the succeeding taxable year. A shareholder makes the election under this paragraph by attaching a statement to the shareholder's timely filed original or amended return that states that the shareholder agrees to the carryover rule of the preceding sentence. Once a shareholder makes an election under this paragraph with respect to an S corporation, the shareholder must continue to use the rules of this paragraph for that S corporation in future taxable years unless the shareholder receives the permission of the Commissioner.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of § 1.1367-1. In each example, the corporation is a calendar year S corporation:

# Example 1. Adjustments to basis of stock for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1997.
(i) On December 31, 1994, A owns a block of 50 shares of stock with an adjusted basis per share of $6 in Corporation S. On December 31, 1994, A purchases for $400 an additional block of 50 shares of stock with an adjusted basis of $8 per share. Thus, A holds 100 shares of stock for each day of the 1995 taxable year. For S's 1995 taxable year, A's pro rata share of the amount of the items described in section 1367(a)(1)(A) (relating to increases in basis of stock) is $300, and A's pro rata share of the amount of the items described in section 1367(a)(2) (B) and (D) (relating to decreases in basis of stock) is $500. S makes a distribution to A in the amount of $100 during 1995.
(ii) Pursuant to the ordering rules of paragraph (e) of this section, A increases the basis of each share of stock by $3 ($300/100 shares) and decreases the basis of each share
of stock by $5 ($500/100 shares). Then A reduces the basis of each share by $1 ($100/100 shares) for the distribution. Thus, on January 1, 1996, A has a basis of $3 per share in his original block of 50 shares ($6 + $3−$5−$1) and a basis of $5 per share in the second block of 50 shares ($8 + $3−$5−$1).

# Example 2. Adjustments to basis of stock for taxable years beginning on or after August 18, 1998.
(i) On December 31, 2001, A owns a block of 50 shares of stock with an adjusted basis per share of $6 in Corporation S. On December 31, 2001, A purchases for $400 an additional block of 50 shares of stock with an adjusted basis of $8 per share. Thus, A holds 100 shares of stock for each day of the 2002 taxable year. For S's 2002 taxable year, A's pro rata share of the amount of items described in section 1367(a)(1)(A) (relating to increases in basis of stock) is $300, A's pro rata share of the amount of the items described in section 1367(a)(2)(B) (relating to decreases in basis of stock attributable to items of loss and deduction) is $300, and A's pro rata share of the amount of the items described in section 1367(a)(2)(D) (relating to decreases in basis of stock attributable to noncapital, nondeductible expenses) is $200. S makes a distribution to A in the amount of $100 during 2002.
(ii) Pursuant to the ordering rules of paragraph (f) of this section, A first increases the basis of each share of stock by $3 ($300/100 shares) and then decreases the basis of each share by $1 ($100/100 shares) for the distribution. A next decreases the basis of each share by $2 ($200/100 shares) for the noncapital, nondeductible expenses and then decreases the basis of each share by $3 ($300/100 shares) for the items of loss. Thus, on January 1, 2003, A has a basis of $3 per share in the original block of 50 shares ($6 + $3 − $1 − $2 − $3) and a basis of $5 per share in the second block of 100 shares ($8 + $3 − $1 − $2 − $3).

# Example 3. Adjustments attributable to basis of individual shares of stock.
(i) On December 31, 1993, B owns one share of S corporation's 10 outstanding shares of stock. The basis of B's share is $30. On July 2, 1994, B purchases from another shareholder two shares for $25 each. During 1994, S corporation has no income or deductions but incurs a loss of $365. Under section 1377(a)(1)(A) and paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the amount of the loss assigned to each day of S's taxable year is $1.00 ($365/365 days). For each day, $.10 is allocated to each outstanding share ($1.00 amount of loss assigned to each day/10 shares).
(ii) B owned one share for 365 days and, therefore, reduces the basis of that share by the amount of loss attributable to it, i.e., $36.50 ($.10 × 365 days). B owned two shares for 182 days and, therefore, reduces the basis of each of those shares by the amount of the loss attributable to each, i.e., $18.20 ($.10 × 182 days).
(iii) The bases of the shares are decreased as follows:
Share
Original basis
Decrease
Adjusted basis
Excess basis reduction
No. 1
$30.00
$36.50
$0
$6.50
No. 2
25.00
18.20
6.80
0
No. 3
25.00
18.20
6.80
0
Total remaining basis
13.60
(iv) Because the decrease in basis attributable to share No. 1 exceeds the basis of share No. 1 by $6.50 ($36.50 − $30.00), the excess is applied to reduce the bases of shares No. 2 and No. 3 in proportion to their remaining bases. Therefore, the bases of share No. 2 and share No. 3 are each decreased by an additional $3.25 ($6.50 × $6.80/$13.60). After this decrease, Share No. 1 has a basis of zero, Share No. 2 has a basis of $3.55, and Share No. 3 has a basis of $3.55.

# Example 4. Effects of section 1377(a)(2) election and distribution on basis of stock for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1997.
(i) On January 1, 1994, individuals B and C each own 50 of the 100 shares of issued and outstanding stock of Corporation S. B's adjusted basis in each share of stock is $120, and C's is $80. On June 30, 1994, S distributes $6,000 to B and $6,000 to C. On June 30, 1994, B sells all of her S stock for $10,000 to D. S elects under section 1377(a)(2) to treat its 1994 taxable year as consisting of two taxable years, the first of which ends at the close of June 30, the date on which B terminates her interest in S.
(ii) For the period January 1, 1994, through June 30, 1994, S has nonseparately computed income of $6,000 and a separately stated deduction item of $4,000. Therefore, on June 30, 1994, B and C, pursuant to the ordering rules of paragraph (e) of this section, increase the basis of each share by $60 ($6,000/100 shares) and decrease the basis of each share by $40 ($4,000/100 shares). Then B and C reduce the basis of each share by $120 ($12,000/100 shares) for the distribution.
(iii) The basis of B's stock is reduced from $120 to $20 per share ($120 + $60−$40−$120). The basis of C's stock is reduced from $80 to $0 per share ($80 + $60−$40−$120). See section 1368 and § 1.1368-1 (c) and (d) for rules relating to the tax treatment of the distributions.
(iv) Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the net reduction in the basis of B's shares of the S stock required by section 1367 and this section is effective immediately prior to B's sale of her stock. Thus, B's basis for determining gain or loss on the sale of the S stock is $20 per share, and B has a gain on the sale of $180 ($200−$20) per share.

# Example 5. Effects of section 1377(a)(2) election and distribution on basis of stock for taxable years beginning on or after August 18, 1998.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 4,
except that all of the events occur in 2001 rather than in 1994 and except as follows: On June 30, 2001, B sells 25 shares of her stock for $5,000 to D and 25 shares back to Corporation S for $5,000. Under section 1377(a)(2)(B) and § 1.1377-1(b)(2), B, C, and D are affected shareholders because B has transferred shares to Corporations S and D. Pursuant to section 1377(a)(2)(A) and § 1.1377-1(b)(1), B, C, and D, the affected shareholders, and Corporation S agree to treat the taxable year 2001 as if it consisted of two separate taxable years for all affected shareholders for the purposes set forth in § 1.1377-1(b)(3)(i).
(ii) On June 30, 2001, B and C, pursuant to the ordering rules of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, increase the basis of each share by $60 ($6,000/100 shares) for the nonseparately computed income. Then B and C reduce the basis of each share by $120 ($12,000/100 shares) for the distribution. Finally, B and C decrease the basis of each share by $40 ($4,000/100 shares) for the separately stated deduction item.
(iii) The basis of the stock of B is reduced from $120 to $20 per share ($120 + $60 − $120 − $40). Prior to accounting for the separately stated deduction item, the basis of the stock of C is reduced from $80 to $20 ($80 + $60 − $120). Finally, because the period from January 1 through June 30, 2001 is treated under § 1.1377-1(b)(3)(i) as a separate taxable year for purposes of making adjustments to the basis of stock, under section 1366(d) and § 1.1366-2(a)(3), C may deduct only $20 per share of the remaining $40 of the separately stated deduction item, and the basis of the stock of C is reduced from $20 per share to $0 per share. Under section 1366 and § 1.1366-2(a)(3), C's remaining separately stated deduction item of $20 per share is treated as having been incurred in the first succeeding taxable year of Corporation S, which, for this purpose, begins on July 1, 2001.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Adjustments for items of income in respect of a decedent.
The basis determined under section 1014 of any stock in an S corporation is reduced by the portion of the value of the stock that is attributable to items constituting income in respect of a decedent. For the determination of items realized by an S corporation constituting income in respect of a decedent, see sections 1367(b)(4)(A) and 691 and applicable regulations thereunder. For the determination of the allowance of a deduction for the amount of estate tax attributable to income in respect of a decedent, see section 691(c) and applicable regulations thereunder.

§ 1.1367-2
Adjustments to basis of indebtedness to shareholder.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Adjustments under section 1367.
This section provides rules relating to adjustments required by subchapter S to the basis of indebtedness (including open account debt as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) of an S corporation to a shareholder. The basis of indebtedness of the S corporation to a shareholder is reduced as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and restored as provided in paragraph (c) of this section in accordance with the timing rules in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Open Account Debt
—(i)
General rule.
The term
open account debt
means shareholder advances not evidenced by separate written instruments and repayments on the advances, the aggregate outstanding principal of which does not exceed $25,000 of indebtedness of the S corporation to the shareholder at the close of the S corporation's taxable year. Advances and repayments on open account debt are treated as a single indebtedness.
(ii)
Exception.
If the shareholder advances not evidenced by a separate written instrument, net of repayments, exceeds an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $25,000 at the close of the S corporation's taxable year, for any subsequent taxable year the aggregate principal amount of that indebtedness is treated in the same manner as indebtedness evidenced by a separate written instrument for purposes of this section. For any subsequent taxable year, that indebtedness is not open account debt and is subject to all basis adjustment rules applicable to basis of indebtedness of an S corporation to a shareholder in this section.
(b)
Reduction in basis of indebtedness
—(1)
General rule.
If, after making the adjustments required by section 1367(a)(1) for any taxable year of the S corporation, the amounts specified in section
1367(a)(2) (B), (C), (D), and (E) (relating to losses, deductions, noncapital, nondeductible expenses, and certain oil and gas depletion deductions) exceed the basis of a shareholder's stock in the corporation, the excess is applied to reduce (but not below zero) the basis of any indebtedness of the S corporation to the shareholder held by the shareholder at the close of the corporation's taxable year. Any such indebtedness that has been satisfied by the corporation, or disposed of or forgiven by the shareholder, during the taxable year, is not held by the shareholder at the close of that year and is not subject to basis reduction.
(2)
Termination of shareholder's interest in corporation during taxable year.
If a shareholder terminates his or her interest in the corporation during the taxable year, the rules of this paragraph (b) are applied with respect to any indebtedness of the S corporation held by the shareholder immediately prior to the termination of the shareholder's interest in the corporation.
(3)
Multiple indebtedness.
If a shareholder holds more than one indebtedness at the close of the corporation's taxable year or, if applicable, immediately prior to the termination of the shareholder's interest in the corporation, the reduction in basis is applied to each indebtedness in the same proportion that the basis of each indebtedness bears to the aggregate bases of the indebtedness to the shareholder.
(c)
Restoration of basis
—(1)
General rule.
If, for any taxable year of an S corporation beginning after December 31, 1982, there has been a reduction in the basis of an indebtedness of the S corporation to a shareholder under section 1367(b)(2)(A), any
net increase
in any subsequent taxable year of the corporation is applied to restore that reduction. For purposes of this section,
net increase
with respect to a shareholder means the amount by which the shareholder's pro rata share of the items described in section 1367(a)(1) (relating to income items and excess deduction for depletion) exceed the items described in section 1367(a)(2) (relating to losses, deductions, noncapital, nondeductible expenses, certain oil and gas depletion deductions, and certain distributions) for the taxable year. These restoration rules apply only to indebtedness held by a shareholder as of the beginning of the taxable year in which the net increase arises. The reduction in basis of indebtedness must be restored before any net increase is applied to restore the basis of a shareholder's stock in an S corporation. In no event may the shareholder's basis of indebtedness be restored above the adjusted basis of the indebtedness under section 1016(a), excluding any adjustments under section 1016(a)(17) for prior taxable years, determined as of the beginning of the taxable year in which the net increase arises.
(2)
Multiple indebtedness.
If a shareholder holds more than one indebtedness (including any open account debt and any debt treated as a single indebtedness under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) as of the beginning of an S corporation's taxable year, any net increase is applied first to restore the reduction of basis in any indebtedness repaid (in whole or in part) in that taxable year to the extent necessary to offset any gain that would otherwise be realized on the repayment. Any remaining net increase is applied to restore each outstanding indebtedness (including any open account debt and any debt treated as a single indebtedness under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) in proportion to the amount that the basis of each outstanding indebtedness has been reduced under section 1367(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section and not restored under section 1367(b)(2)(B) and this paragraph (c).
(d)
Time at which adjustments to basis of indebtedness are effective
—
(1)
In general.
The amounts of the adjustments to basis of indebtedness (including open account debt) provided in section 1367(b)(2) and this section are determined as of the close of the S corporation's taxable year, and the adjustments are generally effective as of the close of the S corporation's taxable year. However, if the shareholder is not a shareholder in the S corporation at that time, these adjustments are effective immediately before the shareholder terminates his or her interest in the S corporation. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if a debt is disposed of or repaid in whole or
in part before the close of the taxable year, the basis of that indebtedness is restored under paragraph (c) of this section, effective immediately before the disposition or the first repayment on the debt during the taxable year. To the extent any indebtedness of the S corporation to the shareholder is disposed of or repaid (in whole or in part) during the taxable year and the shareholder's basis in that indebtedness has been reduced under paragraph (b) of this section and is not restored completely under paragraph (c) of this section, the disposition or repayment is a recognition event effective immediately before the indebtedness is disposed of or repaid (in whole or in part).
(2)
Open account debt
—(i)
In general.
All advances and repayments on open account debt (as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) during the S corporation's taxable year are netted at the close of the S corporation's taxable year to determine the amount of any net advance or net repayment. The net advance or net repayment is combined with the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the existing open account debt and that amount is carried forward to the beginning of the subsequent taxable year as the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the open account debt (unless the aggregate principal amount meets the exception defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section at the close of the taxable year). However, if the shareholder in the S corporation is not a shareholder of the S corporation at the close of the S corporation's taxable year, such advances and repayments on open account debt are netted, and the basis of that indebtedness is restored under paragraph (c) of this section, effective immediately before the shareholder terminates his or her interest in the S corporation. If any open account debt is disposed of before or upon the close of the taxable year, the disposition is effective at the close of the S corporation's taxable year, and all advances and repayments are netted immediately prior to the disposition and the basis of that indebtedness is restored under paragraph (c) of this section, effective at the close of the S corporation's taxable year.
(ii)
Exception.
Shareholder indebtedness that is open account debt at the beginning of the taxable year but meets the exception defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section at the close of the taxable year, adjustments to the basis of the indebtedness for that taxable year follow the provisions for open account debt. The resulting aggregate principal amount of indebtedness is treated as the principal amount of a debt evidenced by a separate written instrument for any subsequent taxable year, and is no longer subject to the open account debt provisions of this section.
(3)
Effect of election under section 1377(a)(2) or § 1.1368-1(g)(2).
If an election is made under section 1377(a)(2) (to terminate the year in the case of the termination of a shareholder's interest) or under § 1.1368-1(g)(2) (to terminate the year in the case of a qualifying disposition), this paragraph (d) applies as if the taxable year consisted of separate taxable years, the first of which ends at the close of the day on which the shareholder either terminates his or her interest in the corporation or disposes of a substantial amount of stock, whichever the case may be.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of § 1.1367-2. In each example, the corporation is a calendar year S corporation. The lending transactions described in the examples do not result in foregone interest (within the meaning of section 7872(e)(2)), original issue discount (within the meaning of section 1273), or total unstated interest (within the meaning of section 483(b)).

# Example 1. Reduction in basis of indebtedness.
(i) A has been the sole shareholder in Corporation S since 1992. In 1993, A loans S $1,000 (Debt No. 1), which is evidenced by a ten-year promissory note in the face amount of $1,000. In 1996, A loans S $5,000 (Debt No. 2), which is evidenced by a demand promissory note. On December 31, 1996, the basis of A's stock is zero; the basis of Debt No. 1 has been reduced under paragraph (b) of this section to $0; and the basis of Debt No. 2 has been reduced to $1,000. On January 1, 1997, A loans S $4,000 (Debt No. 3), which is evidenced by a demand promissory note. For S's 1997 taxable year, the sum of the amounts specified in section 1367(a)(1) (in this case, nonseparately computed income and the excess deduction for depletion) is $6,000, and the sum of the amounts specified in section 1367(a)(2)
(B), (D), and (E) (in this case, items of separately stated deductions and losses, noncapital, nondeductible expenses, and certain oil and gas depletion deductions—there is no nonseparately computed loss) is $10,000. Corporation S makes no payments to A on any of the loans during 1997.
(ii) The $4,000 excess of loss and deduction items is applied to reduce the basis of each indebtedness in proportion to the basis of that indebtedness over the aggregate bases of the indebtedness to the shareholder (determined immediately before any adjustment under section 1367(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section is effective for the taxable year). Thus, the basis of Debt No. 2 is reduced in an amount equal to $800 ($4,000 (excess) × $1,000 (basis of Debt No. 2)/$5,000 (total basis of all debt)). Similarly, the basis in Debt No. 3 is reduced in an amount equal to $3,200 ($4,000 × $4,000/$5,000). Accordingly, on December 31, 1997, A's basis in his stock is zero and his bases in the three debts are as follows:
Debt
1/1/96 basis
12/31/96
reduction
1/1/97 basis
12/31/97

1/1/98 basis

# Example 2. Restoration of basis of indebtedness.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1.
On July 1, 1998, S completely repays Debt No. 3, and, for S's 1998 taxable year, the net increase (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section) with respect to A equals $4,500.
(ii) The net increase is applied first to restore the bases in the debts held on January 1, 1998, before any of the net increase is applied to increase A's basis in his shares of S stock. The net increase is applied to restore first the reduction of basis in indebtedness repaid in 1998. Any remaining net increase is applied to restore the bases of the outstanding debts in proportion to the amount that each of these outstanding debts have been reduced previously under paragraph (b) of this section and have not been restored. As of December 31, 1998, the total reduction in A's debts held on January 1, 1998 equals $9,000. Thus, the basis of Debt No. 3 is restored by $3,200 (the amount of the previous reduction) to $4,000. A's basis in Debt No. 3 is treated as restored immediately before that debt is repaid. Accordingly, A does not realize any gain on the repayment. The remaining net increase of $1,300 ($4,500−$3,200) is applied to restore the bases of Debt No. 1 and Debt No. 2. As of December 31, 1998, the total reduction in these outstanding debts is $5,800 ($9,000−$3,200). The basis of Debt No. 1 is restored in an amount equal to $224 ($1,300 × $1,000/$5,800). Similarly, the basis in Debt No. 2 is restored in an amount equal to $1,076 ($1,300 × $4,800/$5,800). On December 31, 1998, A's basis in his S stock is zero and his bases in the two remaining debts are as follows:
Original basis
Amount reduced
1/1/98 basis
Amount restored
12/31/98 basis

# Example 3. Full restoration of basis in indebtedness when debt is repaid in part during the taxable year.
(i) C has been a shareholder in Corporation S since 1992. In 1997, C loans S $1,000. S issues its note to C in the amount of $1,000, of which $950 is payable on March 1, 1998, and $50 is payable on March 1, 1999. On December 31, 1997, C's basis in all her shares of S stock is zero and her basis in the note has been reduced under paragraph (b) of this section to $900. For 1998, the net increase (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section) with respect to C is $300.
(ii) Because C's basis of indebtedness was reduced in a prior taxable year under § 1.1367-2(b), the net increase for 1998 is applied to restore this reduction. The restored basis cannot exceed the adjusted basis of the debt as of the beginning of the first day of 1998, excluding prior adjustments under section 1367, or $1,000. Therefore, $100 of the $300 net increase is applied to restore the basis of the debt from $900 to $1,000 effective immediately before the repayment on March 1, 1998. The remaining net increase of $200 increases C's basis in her stock.

# Example 4. Determination of net increase—distribution in excess of increase in basis.
(i) D has been the sole shareholder in Corporation S since 1990. On January 1, 1996, D loans S $10,000 in return for a note from S in the amount of $10,000 of which $5,000 is payable on each of January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2001. On December 31, 1997, the basis of D's shares of S stock is zero, and his basis in the note has been reduced under paragraph (b) of this section to $8,000. During 1998, the sum of the items under section 1367(a)(1) (relating to increases in basis of stock) with respect to D equals $10,000 (in this case, nonseparately computed income), and the sum of the items under section 1367(a)(2)(B), (C), (D), and (E) (relating to decreases in basis of stock) with respect to D equals $0. During 1998, S also makes distributions to D totaling $11,000. This distribution is an item that reduces basis of stock under section 1367(a)(2)(A) and must be taken into account for purposes of determining whether there is a net increase for the taxable year. Thus, for 1998, there is no net increase with respect to D because the amount of the items provided in section 1367(a)(1) do not exceed the amount of the items provided in section 1367(a)(2).
(ii) Because there is no net increase with respect to D for 1998, none of the 1997 reduction in D's basis in the indebtedness is restored. The $10,000 increase in basis under section 1367(a)(1) is applied to increase D's
basis in his S stock. Under section 1367(a)(2)(A), the $11,000 distribution with respect to D's stock reduces D's basis in his shares of S stock to $0. See section 1368 and § 1.1368-1 (c) and (d) for the tax treatment of the $1,000 distribution in excess of D's basis.

# Example 5. Distributions less than increase in basis.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 4,
except that in 1998 S makes distributions to D totaling $8,000. On these facts, for 1998, there is a net increase with respect to D of $2,000 (the amount by which the items provided in section 1367(a)(1) exceed the amount of the items provided in section 1367(a)(2)).
(ii) Because there is a net increase of $2,000 with respect to D for 1998, $2,000 of the $10,000 increase in basis under section 1367(a)(1) is first applied to restore D's basis in the indebtedness to $10,000 ($8,000 + $2,000). Accordingly, on December 31, 1998, D has a basis in his shares of S stock of $0 ($0 + $8,000 (increase in basis remaining after restoring basis in indebtedness)—$8,000 (distribution)) and a basis in the note of $10,000.

# Example 6. The $25,000 aggregate principal amount applies to each shareholder.
(i) A and B have been the two shareholders in Corporation S since 2000. As of the end of the 2008 taxable year, the bases of A's and B's stock are both zero. On June 1, 2009, A advances S $16,000, which is not evidenced by a written instrument. On August 1, 2009, B advances S $22,000, which is not evidenced by a written instrument. Both the $16,000 advance and the $22,000 advance are open account debt and remain outstanding at those amounts during 2009. There is no net increase under paragraph (c) of this section in year 2009.
(ii) At the close of the 2009 taxable year, A's open account debt does not exceed $25,000. A therefore carries forward to the beginning of the 2010 taxable year the $16,000 as open account debt.
(iii) At the close of the 2009 taxable year, B's open account debt does not exceed $25,000. B therefore carries forward to the beginning of the 2010 taxable year the $22,000 as open account debt.

# Example 7. Treatment of open account debt.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 6,
in addition to which, on December 31, 2009, A's basis in the open account debt is reduced under paragraph (b) of this section to $8,000. On April 1, 2010, S repays A $4,000 of the open account indebtedness. On September 1, 2010, A advances S an additional $1,000, which is not evidenced by a written instrument. There is no net increase under paragraph (c) of this section in year 2010.
(ii) The $4,000 April repayment S makes to A and A's $1,000 September advance are netted to result in a net repayment of $3,000 for the taxable year on A's $16,000 open account debt carried forward from 2009. Because there is no net increase in 2010, no basis of indebtedness is restored for the 2010 taxable year, and A realizes $1,500 of income on the $3,000 net repayment at the close of the 2010 taxable year.
(iii) At close of the 2010 taxable year, A's open account debt does not exceed $25,000. The net repayment of $3,000 for the taxable year on A's $16,000 open account debt carried forward from 2009, leaves A with an open account debt of $13,000 to carry forward as open account debt to the beginning of the 2011 taxable year.

# Example 8. Treatment of shareholder indebtedness not evidenced by a written instrument which exceeds $25,000.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7
, in addition to which, on February 1, 2011, S repays $5,000 of the open account debt and on March 1, 2011, A advances S $20,000, which is not evidenced by a written instrument.
(ii) At the close of the 2010 taxable year, A has an open account debt of $13,000 to carry forward as open account debt to the beginning of the 2011 taxable year.
(iii) The 2011 advances and repayments are netted to result in a net advance of $15,000 on A's $13,000 open account debt carried forward from 2010, increasing A's open account debt to $28,000 as of the close of the 2011 taxable year. Because A's open account debt exceeds $25,000, for any subsequent taxable year the $28,000 indebtedness will be treated in the same manner as indebtedness evidenced by a separate written instrument for the purposes of this section. Because there is no net increase in 2011, no basis of indebtedness is restored for the 2011 taxable year.

§ 1.1368-1
Distributions by S corporations.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules for distributions made by an S corporation with respect to its stock which, but for section 1368(a) and this section, would be subject to section 301(c) and other rules of the Internal Revenue Code that characterize a distribution as a dividend.
(b)
Date distribution made.
For purposes of section 1368, a distribution is taken into account on the date the corporation makes the distribution, regardless of when the distribution is treated as received by the shareholder.
(c)
S corporation with no earnings and profits.
A distribution made by an S corporation that has no accumulated earnings and profits as of the end of the taxable year of the S corporation in which the distribution is made is treated in the manner provided in section 1368(b).
(d)
S corporation with earnings and profits
—(1)
General treatment of distribution.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a distribution made with respect to its stock by an S
corporation that has accumulated earnings and profits as of the end of the taxable year of the S corporation in which the distribution is made is treated in the manner provided in section 1368(c). See section 316 and § 1.316-2 for provisions relating to the allocation of earnings and profits among distributions.
(2)
Previously taxed income.
This paragraph (d)(2) applies to distributions by a corporation that has both accumulated earnings and profits and previously taxed income (within the meaning of section 1375(d)(2), as in effect prior to its amendment by the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982, and the regulations thereunder) with respect to one or more shareholders. In the case of such a distribution, that portion remaining after the application of section 1368(c)(1) (relating to distributions from the accumulated adjustments account (AAA) as defined in § 1.1368-2(a)) is treated in the manner provided in section 1368(b) (relating to S corporations without earnings and profits) to the extent that portion is a distribution of money and does not exceed the shareholder's net share immediately before the distribution of the corporation's previously taxed income. The AAA and the earnings and profits of the corporation are not decreased by that portion of the distribution. Any distribution remaining after the application of this paragraph (d)(2) is treated in the manner provided in section 1368(c) (2) and (3).
(e)
Certain adjustments taken into account
—(1)
Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1997.
For any taxable year of the corporation beginning before January 1, 1997, paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are applied only after taking into account—
(i) The adjustments to the basis of the shares of a shareholder's stock described in section 1367 (without regard to section 1367(a)(2)(A) (relating to decreases attributable to distributions not includible in income)) for the S corporation's taxable year; and
(ii) The adjustments to the AAA required by section 1368(e)(1)(A) (but without regard to the adjustments for distributions under § 1.1368-2(a)(3)(iii)) for the S corporation's taxable year.
(2)
Taxable years beginning on or after August 18, 1998.
For any taxable year of the corporation beginning on or after August 18, 1998, paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are applied only after taking into account—
(i) The adjustments to the basis of the shares of a shareholder's stock described in section 1367(a)(1) (relating to increases in basis of stock) for the S corporation's taxable year; and
(ii) The adjustments to the AAA required by section 1368(e)(1)(A) (but without regard to the adjustments for distributions under § 1.1368-2(a)(3)(iii)) for the S corporation's taxable year. Any net negative adjustment (as defined in section 1368(e)(1)(C)(ii)) for the taxable year shall not be taken into account.
(f)
Elections relating to source of distributions
—(1)
In general.
An S corporation may modify the application of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section by electing (pursuant to paragraph (f)(5) of this section)—
(i) To distribute earnings and profits first as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section;
(ii) To make a deemed dividend as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section; or
(iii) To forego previously taxed income as described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(2)
Election to distribute earnings and profits first
—(i)
In general.
An S corporation with accumulated earnings and profits may elect under this paragraph (f)(2) for any taxable year to distribute earnings and profits first as provided in section 1368(e)(3). Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, distributions made by an S corporation making this election are treated as made first from earnings and profits under section 1368(c)(2) and second from the AAA under section 1368(c)(1). Any remaining portion of the distribution is treated in the manner provided in section 1368(b). This election is effective for all distributions made during the year for which the election is made.
(ii)
Previously taxed income.
If a corporation to which paragraph (d)(2) of this section (relating to corporations with previously taxed income) applies makes the election provided in this
paragraph (f)(2) for the taxable year, and does not make the election to forego previously taxed income under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, distributions by the S corporation during the taxable year are treated as made first, from previously taxed income under paragraph (d)(2) of this section; second, from earnings and profits under section 1368(c)(2); and third, from the AAA under section 1368(c)(1). Any portion of a distribution remaining after the previously taxed income, earnings and profits, and the AAA are exhausted is treated in the manner provided in section 1368(b).
(iii)
Corporation with subchapter C and subchapter S earnings and profits.
If an S corporation that makes the election provided in this paragraph (f)(2) has both subchapter C earnings and profits (as defined in section 1362(d)(3)(B)) and subchapter S earnings and profits in a taxable year of the corporation in which the distribution is made, the distribution is treated as made first from subchapter C earnings and profits, and second from subchapter S earnings and profits.
Subchapter S earnings and profits
are earnings and profits accumulated in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1983 (or in the case of a qualified casualty insurance electing small business corporation or a qualified oil corporation, earnings and profits accumulated in any taxable year), for which an election under subchapter S of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code was in effect.
(3)
Election to make a deemed dividend.
An S corporation may elect under this paragraph (f)(3) to distribute all or part of its subchapter C earnings and profits through a deemed dividend. If an S corporation makes the election provided in this paragraph (f)(3), the S corporation will be considered to have made the election provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (relating to the election to distribute earnings and profits first). The amount of the deemed dividend may not exceed the subchapter C earnings and profits of the corporation on the last day of the taxable year, reduced by any actual distributions of subchapter C earnings and profits made during the taxable year. The amount of the deemed dividend is considered, for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, as if it were distributed in money to the shareholders in proportion to their stock ownership, received by the shareholders, and immediately contributed by the shareholders to the corporation, all on the last day of the corporation's taxable year.
(4)
Election to forego previously taxed income.
An S corporation may elect to forego distributions of previously taxed income. If such an election is made, paragraph (d)(2) of this section (relating to corporations with previously taxed income) does not apply to any distribution made during the taxable year. Thus, distributions by a corporation that makes the election to forego previously taxed income for a taxable year under this paragraph (f)(4) and does not make the election to distribute earnings and profits first under paragraph (f)(2) of this section are treated in the manner provided in section 1368(c) (relating to distributions by corporations with earnings and profits). Distributions by a corporation that makes both the election to distribute earnings and profits first under paragraph (f)(2) of this section and the election to forego previously taxed income under this paragraph (f)(4), are treated in the manner provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
(5)
Time and manner of making elections
—(i)
For earnings and profits.
If an election is made under paragraph (f)(2) of this section to distribute earnings and profits first, see section 1368(e)(3) regarding the consent required by shareholders.
(ii)
For previously taxed income and deemed dividends.
If an election is made to forego previously taxed income under paragraph (f)(4) of this section or to make a deemed dividend under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, consent by each “affected shareholder,” as defined in section 1368(e)(3)(B), is required.
(iii)
Corporate statement regarding elections.
A corporation makes an election for a taxable year under § 1.1368-1(f) by attaching a statement to a timely filed (including extensions) original or amended return required to be filed under section 6037 for that taxable year. In the statement, the corporation must identify the election it is making under § 1.1368-1(f) and must state that
each shareholder consents to the election. In the case of elections for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, an officer of the corporation must sign under penalties of perjury the statement on behalf of the corporation. In the case of elections for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, the statement described in this paragraph (f)(5)(iii) shall be verified by signing the return. A statement of election to make a deemed dividend under § 1.1368-1(f) must include the amount of the deemed dividend that is distributed to each shareholder.
(iv)
Irrevocable elections.
The elections under this paragraph (f) are irrevocable and are effective only for the taxable year for which they are made. In applying the preceding sentence to elections under this paragraph (f), an election to terminate the taxable year under section 1377(a)(2) or § 1.1368-1(g)(2) is disregarded.
(g)
Special rule
—(1)
Election to terminate year under § 1.1368-1(g)(2).
If an election is made under paragraph (g)(2) of this section to terminate the year when there is a qualifying disposition, this section applies as if the taxable year consisted of separate taxable years, the first of which ends at the close of the day on which there is a qualifying disposition of stock.
(2)
Election in case of a qualifying disposition
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a qualifying disposition, a corporation may elect under this paragraph (g)(2)(i) to treat the year as if it consisted of separate taxable years, the first of which ends at the close of the day on which the qualifying disposition occurs. A
qualifying disposition
is—
(A) A disposition by a shareholder of 20 percent or more of the outstanding stock of the corporation in one or more transactions during any thirty-day period during the corporation's taxable year;
(B) A redemption treated as an exchange under section 302(a) or section 303(a) of 20 percent or more of the outstanding stock of the corporation from a shareholder in one or more transactions during any thirty-day period during the corporation's taxable year; or
(C) An issuance of an amount of stock equal to or greater than 25 percent of the previously outstanding stock to one or more new shareholders during any thirty-day period during the corporation's taxable year.
(ii)
Effect of the election.
A corporation making an election under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section must treat the taxable year as separate taxable years for purposes of allocating items of income and loss; making adjustments to the AAA, earnings and profits, and basis; and determining the tax effect of distributions under section 1368 (b) and (c). An election made under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section may be made upon the occurrence of any qualifying disposition. Dispositions of stock that are taken into account as part of a qualifying disposition are not taken into account in determining whether a subsequent qualifying disposition has been made. In the case of a taxable year for which an election is made under paragraph (g)(2)(i), for purposes of section 163(j), a separate section 163(j) limitation (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(36)) applies to each separate taxable year. Any items necessary to determine the amount of business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(3)) that are deducted in each separate taxable year must be allocated between the two separate taxable years in accordance with an allocation methodology provided in this paragraph (g).
(iii)
Time and manner of making election.
A corporation makes an election under § 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i) for a taxable year by attaching a statement to a timely filed (including extensions) original or amended return required to be filed under section 6037 for a taxable year (without regard to the election under § 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i)). In the statement, the corporation must state that it is electing for the taxable year under § 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i) to treat the taxable year as if it consisted of separate taxable years. The corporation also must set forth facts in the statement relating to the qualifying disposition (
e.g.
, sale, gift, stock issuance, or redemption), and state that each shareholder who held stock in the corporation during the taxable year (without regard to the election under § 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i)) consents to this election. For purposes of this election, a shareholder of the
