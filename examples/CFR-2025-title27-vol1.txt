# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

sound, ripe grapes (including restored or unrestored pure condensed grape must), with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed grape must and with or without added spirits of the type authorized for natural wine under 26 U.S.C. 5382, but without other addition or abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment of the type authorized for natural wine under 26 U.S.C. 5382.
(2) Still grape wine may be ameliorated, or sweetened, before, during, or after fermentation, in a way that is consistent with the limits set forth in 26 U.S.C. 5383 for natural grape wine.
(3) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and exclusive of sulfur dioxide is 0.14 gram per 100 mL (20 degrees Celsius) for red wine and 0.12 gram per 100 mL (20 degrees Celsius) for other grape wine, provided that the maximum volatile acidity for wine produced from unameliorated juice of 28 or more degrees Brix is 0.17 gram per 100 mL for red wine and 0.15 gram per 100 mL for white wine.
(4) Grape wine deriving its characteristic color or lack of color from the presence or absence of the red coloring matter of the skins, juice, or pulp of grapes may be designated as “red wine,” “pink (or rose) wine,” “amber wine,” or “white wine” as the case may be. Any grape wine containing no added grape brandy or alcohol may be further designated as “natural.”
(5)
Table wine
is grape wine having an alcoholic content not in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such wine may also be designated as “light wine,” “red table wine,” “light white wine,” “sweet table wine,” etc., as the case may be.
(6)
Dessert wine
is grape wine having an alcoholic content in excess of 14 percent but not in excess of 24 percent by volume. Dessert wine having the taste, aroma and characteristics generally attributed to sherry and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, of not less than 17 percent by volume, may be designated as “sherry”. Dessert wines having the taste, aroma and characteristics generally attributed to angelica, madeira, muscatel and port and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, of not less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as “angelica,” “madeira,” “muscatel,” or “port” respectively. Dessert wines having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to any of the above products and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, in excess of 14 percent by volume but, in the case of sherry, less than 17 percent, or, in other cases, less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as “light sherry,” “light angelica,” “light madeira,” “light muscatel” or “light port,” respectively.

is a type of sparkling light wine which derives its effervescence solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within glass containers of not greater than one gallon capacity, and which possesses the taste, aroma, and other characteristics attributed to champagne as made in the champagne district of France.
(3)(i) A sparkling light wine having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to champagne but not otherwise conforming to the standard for “champagne” may, in addition to but not in lieu of the class designation “sparkling wine,” be further designated as:
(A) “Champagne style;” or
(B) “Champagne type;” or
(C) “American (or New York State, Napa Valley, etc.) champagne,” along with one of the following terms: “Bulk process,” “fermented outside the bottle,” “secondary fermentation outside the bottle,” “secondary fermentation before bottling,” “not fermented in the bottle,” or “not bottle fermented.” The term “charmat method” or “charmat process” may be used as additional information.
(ii) Labels shall be so designed that all the words in such further designation are readily legible under ordinary conditions and are on a contrasting background. In the case of paragraph
(b)(3)(i)(C) of this section, TTB will consider whether the label as a whole provides the consumer with adequate information about the method of production and origin of the wine. TTB will evaluate each label for legibility and clarity, based on such factors as type size and style for all components of the further designation and the optional term “charmat method” or “charmat process,” as well as the contrast between the lettering and its background, and the placement of information on the label.
(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B) and (C) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer may authorize the use of a term on sparkling wine labels, as an alternative to those terms authorized in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, but not in lieu of the required class designation “sparkling wine,” upon a finding that such term adequately informs the consumer about the method of production of the sparkling wine.
(4)
Crackling wine, petillant wine, frizzante wine
(including cremant, perlant, reciotto, and other similar wine) is sparkling light wine normally less effervescent than champagne or other similar sparkling wine, but containing sufficient carbon dioxide in solution to produce, upon pouring under normal conditions, after the disappearance of air bubbles, a slow and steady effervescence evidenced by the formation of gas bubbles flowing through the wine. Crackling wine which derives its effervescence from secondary fermentation in containers greater than 1-gallon capacity shall be designated “crackling wine—bulk process,” and the words “bulk process” shall appear in lettering of substantially the same size as the words “crackling wine.”
(c)
Class 3; carbonated grape wine. “Carbonated grape wine”
(including

§ 4.27
Vintage wine.
(a)
General.
Vintage wine is wine labeled with the year of harvest of the grapes and made in accordance with the standards prescribed in classes 1, 2, or 3 of § 4.21. The wine must be labeled with an appellation of origin. The appellation must be shown in direct conjunction with the designation required by § 4.32(a)(2), in lettering substantially as conspicuous as that designation. In no event may the quantity of wine removed from the producing winery, under labels bearing a vintage date, exceed the volume of vintage wine produced in that winery during the year indicated by the vintage date. The following additional rules apply to vintage labeling:
(1) If an American or imported wine is labeled with a viticultural area appellation of origin (or its foreign equivalent), at least 95 percent of the wine must have been derived from grapes harvested in the labeled calendar year; or
(2) If an American or imported wine is labeled with an appellation of origin other than a viticultural area (or its foreign equivalent), at least 85 percent of the wine must have been derived from grapes harvested in the labeled calendar year.
(b)
American wine.
A permittee who produced and bottled or packed the wine, or a person other than the producer who repackaged the wine may show the year of vintage upon the label if the person possesses appropriate records from the producer substantiating the year of vintage and the appellation of origin; and if the wine is made in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Imported wine.
Imported wine may bear a vintage date if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) It is made in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section; and
(2) The wine is of the vintage shown, the laws of the country of origin regulate the appearance of vintage dates upon the labels of wine produced for consumption within the country of origin, the wine has been produced in conformity with those laws, and the wine would be entitled to bear the vintage date if it had been sold within the country of origin. The importer of the wine imported in bottles or the domestic bottler of wine imported in bulk and bottled in the United States must be able to demonstrate, upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer, that the wine is entitled to be labeled with the vintage date.

(i) Milk, egg, fish (for example, bass, flounder, or cod), Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts (for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and soybeans; or
(ii) A food ingredient that contains protein derived from a food specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, except:
(A) Any highly refined oil derived from a food specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil; or
(B) A food ingredient that is exempt from major food allergen labeling requirements pursuant to a petition for exemption approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(6) or pursuant to a notice submitted to FDA under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(7), provided that the food ingredient meets the terms or conditions, if any, specified for that exemption.
(2)
Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is derived. Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is derived
means the name of the food as listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, except that:
(i) In the case of a tree nut, it means the name of the specific type of nut (for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts);

§ 4.32b
Petitions for exemption from major food allergen labeling.
(a)
Submission of petition.
Any person may petition the appropriate TTB officer to exempt a particular product or class of products from the labeling requirements of § 4.32a. The burden is on the petitioner to provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the finished product or class of products, as derived by the method specified in the petition, either:
(1) Does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health; or
(2) Does not contain allergenic protein derived from one of the foods identified in § 4.32a(a)(1)(i), even though a major food allergen was used in production.
(b)
Decision on petition.
TTB will approve or deny a petition for exemption submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in writing within 180 days of receipt of the petition. If TTB does not provide a written response to the petitioner within that 180-day period, the petition will be deemed denied, unless an extension of time for decision is mutually agreed upon by the appropriate TTB officer and the petitioner. TTB may confer with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on petitions for exemption, as appropriate and as FDA resources permit. TTB may require the submission of product samples and other additional information in support of a petition; however, unless required by TTB, the submission of samples or additional information by the petitioner after submission of the petition will be treated as the withdrawal of the initial petition and the submission of a new petition. An approval or denial under this section will constitute a final agency action.
(c)
Resubmission of a petition.
After a petition for exemption is denied under this section, the petitioner may resubmit the petition along with supporting materials for reconsideration at any time. TTB will treat this submission as a new petition for purposes of the time frames for decision set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Availability of information
—(1)
General.
TTB will promptly post to its public Web site,
https://www.ttb.gov,
all petitions received under this section as well as TTB's responses to those petitions.

(2)
Requests for confidential treatment of business information.
A person who provides trade secrets or other commercial or financial information in connection with a petition for exemption under this section may request that TTB give confidential treatment to that information. A failure to request confidential treatment at the time the information in question is submitted to TTB will constitute a waiver of confidential treatment. A request for confidential treatment of information under this section must conform to the following standards:
(i) The request must be in writing;
(ii) The request must clearly identify the information to be kept confidential;
(iii) The request must relate to information that constitutes trade secrets or other confidential commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions of an interested person, the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of that person;
(iv) The request must set forth the reasons why the information should
not be disclosed, including the reasons the disclosure of the information would prejudice the competitive position of the interested person; and
(v) The request must be supported by a signed statement by the interested person, or by an authorized officer or employee of that person, certifying that the information in question is a trade secret or other confidential commercial or financial information and that the information is not already in the public domain.

In the case of wine which has a total solids content of more than 17 grams per 100 cubic centimeters the words “extra sweet”, “specially sweetened”, “specially sweet” or “sweetened with excess sugar” shall be stated as a part of the class and type designation. The last of these quoted phrases shall appear where required by part 24 of this chapter, on wines sweetened with sugar in excess of the maximum quantities specified in such regulations. If the class of the wine is not defined in subpart C, a truthful and adequate statement of composition shall appear upon the brand label of the product in lieu of a class designation. In addition to the mandatory designation for the wine, there may be stated a distinctive or fanciful name, or a designation in accordance with trade understanding. The statement of composition will not include any reference to a varietal (grape type) designation, type designation of varietal significance, semi-generic geographic type designation, or geographic distinctive designation. All parts of the designation of the wine, whether mandatory or optional, shall be in direct conjunction and in lettering substantially of the same size and kind.
(b) An appellation of origin such as “American,” “New York,” “Napa Valley,” or “Chilean,” disclosing the true place of origin of the wine, shall appear in direct conjunction with and in lettering substantially as conspicuous as the class and type designation if:
(1) A varietal (grape type) designation is used under the provisions of § 4.23;
(2) A type designation of varietal significance is used under the provisions of § 4.28;
(3) A semi-generic type designation is employed as the class and type designation of the wine pursuant to § 4.24(b);

(3) Equivalent volumes of 100 fluid ounces or more will be stated in fluid ounces only, accurate to the nearest whole fluid ounce; for example, 6 liters (203 fl. oz.).
(c)
Net contents marked in bottle.
The net contents need not be stated on any label if the net contents are displayed by having the same blown, etched, sand-blasted, marked by underglaze coloring, or otherwise permanently marked by any method approved by the appropriate TTB officer, in the sides, front, or back of the bottle, in letters and figures in such manner as to be plainly legible under ordinary circumstances, and such statement is not obscured in any manner in whole or in part.
(d)
Tolerances.
Statement of net contents shall indicate exactly the volume of wine within the container, except that the following tolerances shall be allowed:
(1) Discrepancies due exclusively to errors in measuring which occur in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial practice.
(2) Discrepancies due exclusively to differences in the capacity of containers, resulting solely from unavoidable difficulties in manufacturing such
containers so as to be of uniform capacity:
Provided,
That no greater tolerance shall be allowed in case of containers which, because of their design, cannot be made of approximately uniform capacity than is allowed in case of containers which can be manufactured so as to be of approximately uniform capacity.
(3) Discrepancies in measure due to differences in atmospheric conditions in various places and which unavoidably result from the ordinary and customary exposure of alcoholic beverages in containers to evaporation. The reasonableness to discrepancies under this paragraph shall be determined on the facts in each case.
(e)
Unreasonable shortages.
Unreasonable shortages in certain of the containers in any shipment shall not be compensated by overages in other containers in the same shipment.

[T.D. ATF-36, 41 FR 47425, Oct. 29, 1976]
§ 4.39
Prohibited practices.
(a)
Statements on labels.
Containers of wine, or any label on such containers, or any individual covering, carton, or other wrapper of such container, or any written, printed, graphic, or other matter accompanying such container to the consumer shall not contain:
(1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical matter, tends to create a misleading impression.
(2) Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's products.
(3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is obscene or indecent.
(4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
(5) Any statement, design, device or representation of or relating to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back guarantees are not prohibited.
(6) A trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, or is a name that is in simulation or is an abbreviation thereof, or any graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of any such individual or organization, if the use of such name or representation is likely falsely to lead the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of, such individual or organization;
Provided,
That this paragraph shall not apply to the use of the name of any person engaged in business as a producer, blender, rectifier, importer, wholesaler, retailer, bottler, or warehouseman of wine, nor to the use by any person of a trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual of public prominence or existing private or public organization, provided such trade or brand name was used by that person or their predecessors in interest prior to August 29, 1935.
(7) Any statement, design, device, or representation (other than a statement of alcohol content in conformity with
§ 4.36), which tends to create the impression that a wine:
(i) Contains distilled spirits;
(ii) Is comparable to a distilled spirit; or
(iii) Has intoxicating qualities.
However, if a statement of composition is required to appear as the designation of a product not defined in these regulations, such statement of composition may include a reference to the type of distilled spirits contained therein.
(8) Any coined word or name in the brand name or class and type designation which simulates, imitates, or which tends to create the impression that the wine so labeled is entitled to bear, any class, type, or permitted designation recognized by the regulations in this part unless such wine conforms to the requirements prescribed with respect to such designation and is in fact so designated on its labels.
(9) Any word in the brand name or class and type designation which is the name of a distilled spirits product or which simulates, imitates, or created the impression that the wine so labeled is, or is similar to, any product customarily made with a distilled spirits base. Examples of such words are: “Manhattan,” “Martini,” and “Daquiri” in a class and type designation or brand name of a wine cocktail; “Cuba Libre,” “Zombie,” and “Collins” in a class and type designation or brand name of a wine specialty or wine highball; “creme,” “cream,” “de,” or “of” when used in conjunction with “menthe,” “mint,” or “cacao” in a class and type designation or a brand name of a mint or chocolate flavored wine specialty.
(b)
Statement of age.
No statement of age or representation relative to age (including words or devices in any brand name or mark) shall be made, except (1) for vintage wine, in accordance with the provisions of § 4.27; (2) references relating to methods of wine production involving storage or aging in accordance with § 4.38(f); or (3) use of the word “old” as part of a brand name.
(c)
Statement of bottling dates.
The statement of any bottling date shall not be deemed to be a representation relative to age, if such statement appears in lettering not greater than 8-point Gothic caps and in the following form: “Bottled in __” (inserting the year in which the wine was bottled).
(d)
Statement of miscellaneous dates.
No date, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section with respect to statement of vintage year and bottling date, shall be stated on any label unless in addition thereto and in direct conjunction therewith in the same size and kind of printing, there shall be stated an explanation of the significance thereof such as “established” or “founded in”. If any such date refers to the date of establishment of any business or brand name, it shall not be stated, in the case of containers of a capacity of 5 liters or less, in any script, type, or printing larger than 2 millimeters, and shall be stated in direct conjunction with the name of the person, company, or brand name to which it refers if the appropriate TTB officer finds that this is necessary in order to prevent confusion as to the person, company, or brand name to which the establishment date is applicable.
(e)
Simulation of Government stamps.
(1) No labels shall be of such design as to resemble or simulate a stamp of the United States Government or any State or foreign government. No label, other than stamps authorized or required by the United States Government or any State or foreign government, shall state or indicate that the wine contained in the labeled container is produced, blended, bottled, packed, or sold under, or in accordance with, any municipal, State or Federal Government authorization, law, or regulation, unless such statement is required or specifically authorized by Federal, State or municipal law or regulation, or is required or specifically authorized by the laws or regulations of a foreign country. If the municipal, State, or Federal Government permit number is stated upon a label, it shall not be accompanied by any additional statement relating thereto.
(2) Bonded wine cellar and bonded winery numbers may be stated but only in direct conjunction with the name and address of the person operating such wine cellar or winery. Statement of bonded wine cellar or winery numbers may be made in the
following form: “Bonded Wine Cellar No. __”, “Bonded Winery No. __”, “B. W. C. No. __”, “B. W. No. __”. No additional reference thereto shall be made, nor shall any use be made of such statement that may convey the impression that the wine has been made or matured under Government supervision or in accordance with Government specifications or standards.
(3) If imported wines are covered by a certificate of origin and/or a certificate of vintage date issued by a duly authorized official of the appropriate foreign government, the label, except where prohibited by the foreign government, may refer to such certificate or the fact of such certification, but shall not be accompanied by any additional statements relating thereto. The reference to such certificate or certification shall be substantially in the following form:
This product accompanied at the time of the importation by a certificate issued by the

# (Name of government)
government indicating that the product is

# (Class and type as stated on the label)
and (if label bears a statement of vintage date) that the wine is of the vintage of

# (Year of vintage stated on the label)
(f)
Use of the word “Importer”, or similar words.
The word
Importer,
or similar words, shall not be stated on labels on containers of domestic wine except as part of the bona fide name of a permittee for or by whom, or of a retailer for whom, such wine is bottled, packed or distributed:
Provided,
That in all cases where such words are used as part of such name, there shall be stated on the same label the words “Product of the United States”, or similar words to negative any impression that the product is imported, and such negative statement shall appear in the same size and kind of printing as such name.
(g)
Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia.
Labels shall not contain, in the brand name or otherwise, any statement, design, device, or pictorial representation which the appropriate TTB officer finds relates to, or is capable of being construed as relating to, the armed forces of the United States, or the American flag, or any emblem, seal, insignia, or decoration associated with such flag or armed forces; nor shall any label contain any statement, design, device, or pictorial representation of or concerning any flag, seal, coat of arms, crest or other insignia, likely to mislead the consumer to believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of the government, organization, family, or individual with whom such flag, seal, coat of arms, crest, or insignia is associated.
(h)
Health-related statements
—(1)
Definitions.
When used in this paragraph (h), terms are defined as follows:
(i)
Health-related statement
means any statement related to health (other than the warning statement required by § 16.21 of this chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the wine, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.
(ii)
Specific health claim
is a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which
they are presented, that a relationship exists between wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, and a disease or health-related condition.
(iii)
Health-related directional statement
is a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption.
(2)
Rules for labeling
—(i)
Health-related statements.
In general, labels may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement.
(ii)
Specific health claims.
(A) TTB will consult with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health claim on a wine label. If FDA determines that the use of such a labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use of that specific health claim on a wine label.
(B) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a wine label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim.
(iii)
Health-related directional statements.
A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it—
(A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption; and
(B)(
1
) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;” or
(
2
) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.
(i)
Geographic brand names.
(1) Except as provided in subparagraph 2, a brand name of viticultural significance may not be used unless the wine meets the appellation of origin requirements for the geographic area named.
(2) For brand names used in existing certificates of label approval issued prior to July 7, 1986:
(i) The wine shall meet the appellation of origin requirements for the geographic area named; or
(ii) The wine shall be labeled with an appellation of origin in accordance with § 4.34(b) as to location and size of type of either:
(A) A county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears the name of a geographic area smaller than a state, or;
(B) A state, county or a viticultural area, if the brand name bears a state name; or
(iii) The wine shall be labeled with some other statement which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be sufficient to dispel the impression that the geographic area suggested by the brand name is indicative of the origin of the wine.
(3) A name has viticultural significance when it is the name of a state or county (or the foreign equivalents), when approved as a viticultural area in part 9 of this chapter, or by a foreign government, or when found to have viticultural significance by the appropriate TTB officer.
(j)
Product names of geographical significance (not mandatory before January 1, 1983).
The use of product names with specific geographical significance is prohibited unless the appropriate TTB officer finds that because of their long usage, such names are recognized by
consumers as fanciful product names and not representations as to origin. In such cases the product names shall be qualified with the word “brand” immediately following the product name, in the same size of type, and as conspicuous as the product name itself. In addition, the label shall bear an appellation of origin under the provisions of § 4.34(b), and, if required by the appropriate TTB officer, a statement disclaiming the geographical reference as a representation as to the origin of the wine.
(k)
Other indications of origin.
Other statements, designs, devices or representations which indicate or infer an origin other than the true place of origin of the wine are prohibited.
(l)
Foreign terms.
Foreign terms which: (1) Describe a particular condition of the grapes at the time of harvest (such as “Auslese,” “Eiswein,” and “Trockenbeerenauslese”); or (2) denote quality under foreign law (such as “Qualitatswein” and “Kabinett”) may not be used on the labels of American wine.
(m)
Use of a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch name.
When used in a brand name, a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch name having geographical or viticultural significance is subject to the requirements of §§ 4.33(b) and 4.39(i) of this part. Additionally, the name of a vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch shall not be used on a wine label, unless 95 percent of the wine in the container was produced from primary winemaking material grown on the named vineyard, orchard, farm or ranch.
(n)
Use of a varietal name, type designation of varietal significance, semi-generic name, or geographic distinctive designation.
Labels that contain in the brand name, product name, or distinctive or fanciful name, any varietal (grape type) designation, type designation of varietal significance, semi-generic geographic type designation, or geographic distinctive designation, are misleading unless the wine is made in accordance with the standards prescribed in classes 1, 2, or 3 of § 4.21. Any other use of such a designation on other than a class 1, 2, or 3 wine is presumed misleading.

# Subpart E—Requirements for Withdrawal of Wine From Customs Custody
§ 4.40
Label approval and release.
(a)
Certificate of label approval.
Wine, imported in containers, is not eligible for release from customs custody for consumption, and no person may remove such wine from customs custody for consumption, unless the person removing the wine has obtained and is in possession of a certificate of label approval (COLA) and the containers bear labels identical to the labels appearing on the face of the certificate, or labels with changes authorized by the form. Any person removing wine in containers from customs custody for consumption must first apply for and obtain a COLA covering the wine from the appropriate TTB officer, or obtain authorization to use the COLA from the person to whom the COLA is issued. Products imported under another person's COLA are eligible for release only if each bottle or individual container to be imported bears the name (or trade name) and address of the person to whom the COLA was issued by TTB, and only if the importer using the COLA to obtain release of a shipment can substantiate that the person to whom the COLA was issued has authorized its use by the importer. If filing electronically, the importer must file with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), at the time of filing the customs entry, the TTB-assigned number of the valid COLA that corresponds to the label on the brand or lot of wine to be imported. If the importer is not filing electronically, the importer must provide a copy of the COLA to CBP at time of entry. In addition, the importer must provide a copy of the applicable COLA, and proof of the COLA holder's authorization if applicable, upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer. The COLA requirement imposed by this
section applies only to wine that is removed for sale or any other commercial purpose. See 27 CFR 27.49, 27.74 and 27.75 for labeling exemptions applicable to certain imported samples of wine.
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Relabeling.
Imported wine in U.S. Customs custody which is not labeled in conformity with certificates of label approval issued by the appropriate TTB officer must be relabeled prior to release under the supervision and direction of customs officers of the port at which the wine is located.
(d)
Cross reference.

§ 4.45
Certificates of origin, identity and proper cellar treatment.
(a)
Certificate of origin and identity.
Wine imported in containers is not eligible for release from customs custody for consumption, and no person may remove such wine from customs custody for consumption, unless that person has obtained, and is in possession of an invoice accompanied by a certificate of origin issued by the appropriate foreign government if that country requires the issuance of such a certificate for wine exported from that country. The certificate must have been issued by an official duly authorized by the foreign government, and it must certify as to the identity of the wine and that the wine has been produced in compliance with the laws of the foreign country regulating the production of the wine for home consumption.
(b)
Certification of proper cellar treatment of natural wine
—(1)
General.
An importer of wine may be required to have in his or her possession at the time of release of the wine from customs custody a certification or may have to comply with other conditions prescribed in § 27.140 of this chapter regarding proper cellar treatment. If imported wine requires a certification under § 27.140, the importer must provide a copy of that certification to TTB as follows:
(i) The importer must attach a copy of the certification to the application for a certificate of label approval for the wine in question submitted under § 13.21 of this chapter; or
(ii) If a certification for the wine in question was not available when the importer submitted the application for label approval, the importer must submit a copy of the certification to the appropriate TTB officer prior to release from customs custody of the first shipment of the wine.
(2)
Validity of certification.
A certification submitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is valid as long as the wine is of the same brand and class or type, was made by the same producer, was subjected to the same cellar treatment, and conforms to the statements made on the certification. Accordingly, if the cellar treatment of the wine changes and a new certification under § 27.140 is required, an importer is required to submit a new certification for the wine even though it is subject to the same label approval.
(3)
Use of certification.
TTB may use the information from a certification for purposes of verifying the appropriate class and type designation of the wine under the labeling provisions of this part. TTB will make certifications submitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section available to the public on the TTB Internet Web site at
www.ttb.gov.
(c)
Retention of certificates.
The importer of wine imported in containers must retain for five years following the date of the removal of the bottled wine from customs custody copies of the certificates (and accompanying invoices, if required) required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and must provide them upon request of the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer.

# Subpart F—Requirements for Approval of Labels of Wine Domestically Bottled or Packed
§ 4.50
Certificates of label approval.
(a) No person shall bottle or pack wine, other than wine bottled or packed in U.S. Customs custody, or remove such wine from the plant where bottled or packed, unless an approved certificate of label approval, TTB Form 5100.31, is issued by the appropriate TTB officer.
(b) Any bottler or packer of wine shall be exempt from the requirements of this section if upon application the bottler or packer shows to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the wine to be bottled or packed is not to be sold, offered for sale, or shipped or delivered for shipment, or otherwise introduced in interstate or foreign commerce. Application for exemption shall be made on TTB Form 5100.31 in accordance with instructions on the form. If the application is approved, a certificate of exemption will be issued on the same form.

§ 4.51
Exhibiting certificates to Government officials.
Any bottler or packer holding an original or duplicate original of a certificate of label approval or a certificate of exemption shall, upon demand, exhibit such certificate to a duly authorized representative of the United States Government.
§ 4.52
Photoprints.
Photoprints or other reproductions of certificates of label approval or certificates of exemption are not acceptable, for the purposes of §§ 4.50 through 4.52, as substitutes for an original or duplicate original of a certificate of label approval, or a certificate of exemption. The appropriate TTB officer will, upon the request of the bottler or packer, issue duplicate originals of certificates of label approval or of certificates of exemption if wine under the same brand is bottled or packed at more than one plant by the same person, and if the necessity for the duplicate originals is shown and there is listed with the appropriate TTB officer the name and address of the additional bottling or packing plant where the particular label is to be used.
§ 4.53
Retention of certificates.
Wine that would be required under § 4.45 to be covered by a certificate of origin and identity and/or a certification of proper cellar treatment and that is imported in bulk for bottling in the United States may be removed for consumption from the premises where bottled only if the bottler possesses a certificate of origin and identity and/or a certification of proper cellar treatment of natural wine applicable to the wine, issued by the appropriate entity as set forth in §§ 4.45 and 27.140 of this chapter respectively, that provides the same information as a certificate required under § 4.45(a) and (b) would provide for like wine imported in bottles. The bottler of wine imported in bulk must retain for five years following the removal of such wine from the bonded wine cellar where bottled copies of the certificates required by § 4.45(a) and (b), and must provide them upon request of the appropriate TTB officer.

§ 4.54
Personalized labels.
(a)
General.
Applicants for label approval may obtain permission from TTB to make certain changes in order to personalize labels without having to resubmit labels for TTB approval. A personalized label is an alcohol beverage label that meets the minimum mandatory label requirements and is customized for customers. Personalized labels may contain a personal message, picture, or other artwork that is specific to the consumer who is purchasing the product. For example, a
winery may offer individual or corporate customers labels that commemorate an event such as a wedding or grand opening.
(b)
Application.
Any person who intends to offer personalized labels must submit a template for the personalized label as part of the application for label approval required under §§ 4.40 or 4.50 of this part, and must note on the application a description of the specific personalized information that may change.
(c)
Approval of personalized label.
If the application complies with the regulations, TTB will issue a certificate of label approval (COLA) with a qualification allowing the personalization of labels. The qualification will allow the certificate holder to add or change items on the personalized label such as salutations, names, graphics, artwork, congratulatory dates and names, or event dates without applying for a new COLA. All of these items on personalized labels must comply with the regulations of this part.
(d)
Changes not allowed to personalized labels.
Approval of an application to personalize labels does not authorize the addition of any information that discusses either the alcohol beverage or characteristics of the alcohol beverage or that is inconsistent with or in violation of the provisions of this part or any other applicable provision of law or regulations.

(i) Contains distilled spirits; or
(ii) Is comparable to a distilled spirit; or
(iii) Has intoxicating qualities.
However, if a statement of composition is required to appear as the designation of a product not defined in these regulations, such statement of composition may include a reference to the type of distilled spirits contained therein. Further, an approved wine label, which bears the statement of alcohol content may be depicted in any advertising media, or an actual wine bottle showing the approved label bearing the statement of alcoholic content may be displayed in any advertising media.
(9) Any word in the brand name or class and type designation which is the name of a distilled spirits product or which simulates, imitates, or creates the impression that the wine so labeled is, or is similar to, any product customarily made with a distilled spirits base.

(e)
Statement of miscellaneous dates.
No date, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, with respect to statement of vintage year and bottling date, shall be stated unless, in addition thereto, and in direct conjunction therewith, in the same size and kind of printing there shall be stated an explanation of the significance of such date:

(g)
Statements indicative of origin.

(h)
Use of the word “importer” or similar words.
The word
importer
or similar words shall not appear in advertisements of domestic wine except as part of the bona fide name of the permittee by or for whom, or of a retailer for whom, such wine is bottled, packed or distributed:
Provided,
That in all cases
where such words are used as part of such name, there shall be stated the words “Product of the United States” or similar words to negate any impression that the product is imported, and such negating statements shall appear in the same size and kind of printing as such name.
(i)
Health-related statements
—(1)
Definitions.
When used in this paragraph (i), terms are defined as follows:
(i)
Health-related statement
means any statement related to health and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, wine, or any substance found within the wine, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the wine, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.
(ii)
Specific health claim
is a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between wine, alcohol, or any substance found within the wine, and a disease or health-related condition.
(iii)
Health-related directional statement
is a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption.
(2)
Rules for advertising
—(i)
Health-related statements.
In general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must appear as prominent as the health-related statement.
(ii)
Specific health claims.
A specific health claim will not be considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.
(iii)
Health-related directional statements.
A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it—
(A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of wine or alcohol consumption; and
(B)(
1
) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;” or
(
2
) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression
conveyed by the health-related directional statement.
(j)
Confusion of brands.
Two or more different brands or lots of wine shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in two or more advertisements in one issue of a periodical or newspaper, or in one piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the advertisement tends to create the impression that representations made as to one brand or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such latter the representations contravene any provision of §§ 4.60 through 4.64 or are in any respect untrue.
(k)
Deceptive advertising techniques.
Subliminal or similar techniques are prohibited. “Subliminal or similar techniques,” as used in this part, refers to any device or technique that is used to convey, or attempts to convey, a message to a person by means of images or sounds of a very brief nature that cannot be perceived at a normal level of awareness.

§ 4.65
Comparative advertising.
(a)
General.

(a)
Applicability.
The certificate of label approval (COLA) requirements described in this section apply to distilled spirits bottled in the United States, outside of customs custody.
(b)
Distilled spirits shipped or sold in interstate commerce.
No person may bottle distilled spirits without first applying for and obtaining a COLA issued by the appropriate TTB officer. This requirement applies to distilled spirits produced and bottled in the United States and to distilled spirits imported in bulk, regardless of where produced, and bottled in the United States. Bottlers may obtain an exemption from this requirement only if they satisfy the conditions set forth in § 5.23.
(c)
Evidence of COLA.
Upon request by the appropriate TTB officer, a bottler or importer must provide evidence that a container of distilled spirits is covered by a COLA. This requirement may be satisfied by providing original COLAs, photocopies or electronic copies of COLAs, or records showing the TTB identification number assigned to the approved certificate.
§ 5.22
Rules regarding certificates of label approval (COLAs) for distilled spirits bottled in the United States.
(a)
What a COLA authorizes.
An approved TTB Form 5100.31 authorizes the bottling of distilled spirits covered by the certificate of label approval (COLA), as long as the container bears labels identical to the labels appearing on the face of the COLA, or labels with changes authorized by TTB on the COLA or otherwise (such as through the issuance of public guidance available on the TTB website at
https://www.ttb.gov
).
(b)
When to obtain a COLA.
The COLA must be obtained prior to bottling. No bottler may bottle distilled spirits, or remove distilled spirits from the premises where bottled, unless a COLA has been obtained.
(c)
Application for a COLA.
The bottler may apply for a COLA by submitting an application to TTB on Form 5100.31, in accordance with the instructions on the form. The bottler may apply for a COLA either electronically by accessing TTB's online system, COLAs Online, at
https://www.ttb.gov,
or by submitting the paper form. For procedures regarding the issuance of COLAs, see part 13 of this chapter.
§ 5.23
Application for exemption from label approval for distilled spirits bottled in the United States.
(a)
Exemption.
Any bottler of distilled spirits may apply to be exempt from the requirements of §§ 5.21, 5.22, and 5.30(h), by showing to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the distilled spirits to be bottled are not to be sold, offered for sale, or shipped or delivered for shipment, or otherwise introduced, in interstate or foreign commerce.
(b)
Application required.
The bottler must file an application on TTB Form 5100.31 for exemption from label approval before bottling the distilled spirits. The bottler may apply for a certificate of exemption from label approval either electronically, by accessing TTB's online system, COLAs Online, at
https://www.ttb.gov,
or by using
the paper form. For procedures regarding the issuance of certificates of exemption from label approval, see part 13 of this chapter.
(c)
Labeling of distilled spirits covered by certificate of exemption.
The application for a certificate of exemption from label approval requires that the applicant identify the State in which the product will be sold. As a condition of receiving exemption from label approval, the label covered by an approved certificate of exemption must include the statement “For sale in [name of State] only.” See §§ 19.517 and 19.518 of this chapter for additional labeling rules that apply to distilled spirits covered by a certificate of exemption.

(b)
Release of distilled spirits from customs custody.
Distilled spirits, imported in containers, are not eligible for release from customs custody for consumption, and no person may remove such distilled spirits from customs custody for consumption, unless the person removing the distilled spirits has obtained a COLA covering the distilled spirits and is able to provide it (either electronically or on paper) upon request. Products imported under another person's COLA are eligible for release only if each bottle or individual container to be imported bears the name (or trade name) and address of the person to whom the COLA was issued by TTB, and only if the importer using the COLA to obtain release of a shipment can substantiate that the person to whom the COLA was issued has authorized its use by the importer.

Filing requirements.
If filing electronically, the importer must file with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), at the time of filing the customs entry, the TTB-assigned identification number of the valid COLA that corresponds to the label on the product or lot of distilled spirits to be imported. If the importer is not filing electronically, the importer must provide a copy of the COLA to CBP at the time of entry. In addition, the importer must provide a copy of the applicable COLA, and proof of the COLA holder's authorization if applicable, upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer.
(d)
Evidence of COLA.
Upon request by the appropriate TTB officer, an importer must provide evidence that a container of distilled spirits is covered by a COLA.

§ 5.25
Rules regarding certificates of label approval (COLAs) for distilled spirits imported in containers.
(a)
What COLA authorizes.
An approved TTB Form 5100.31 authorizes the use of the labels covered by the certificate of label approval (COLA) on containers of distilled spirits, as long as the container bears labels identical to the labels appearing on the face of the COLA, or labels with changes authorized by the form or otherwise authorized by TTB (such as through the

(b) A formula may be filed electronically by using Formulas Online, or it may be submitted on paper on TTB Form 5100.51. See § 5.11 for more information on forms and Formulas Online.
§ 5.29
Personalized labels.
(a)
General.
Applicants for label approval may obtain permission from TTB to make certain changes in order to personalize labels without having to resubmit labels for TTB approval. A personalized label is an alcohol beverage label that meets the minimum mandatory label requirements and is customized for customers. Personalized labels may contain a personal message, picture, or other artwork that is specific to the consumer who is purchasing the product. For example, a distiller may offer individual or corporate customers labels that commemorate an event such as a wedding or grand opening.
(b)
Application.
Any person who intends to offer personalized labels must submit a template for the personalized label as part of the application for label approval required under §§ 5.21 or 5.24, and must note on the application a description of the specific personalized information that may change.
(c)
Approval of personalized label.
If the application complies with the regulations, TTB will issue a certificate of label approval (COLA) with a qualification allowing the personalization of labels. The qualification will allow the certificate holder to add or change items on the personalized label such as salutations, names, graphics, artwork, congratulatory dates and names, or event dates without applying for a new COLA. All of these items on personalized labels must comply with the regulations of this part.
(d)
Changes not allowed to personalized labels.
Approval of an application to personalize labels does not authorize the addition of any information that discusses either the alcohol beverage or characteristics of the alcohol beverage or that is inconsistent with or in violation of the provisions of this part or any other applicable provision of law or regulations.

The distilled spirits label must include a brand name. If the distilled spirits are not sold under a brand name, then the name of the bottler, distiller or importer, as applicable, appearing in the name and address statement is treated as the brand name.
(b)
Misleading brand names.
Labels may not include any misleading brand names. A brand name is misleading if it creates (by itself or in association with other printed or graphic matter) any erroneous impression or inference as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of the distilled spirits. A brand name that would otherwise be misleading may be qualified with the word “brand” or with some other qualification, if the appropriate TTB officer determines that the qualification dispels any misleading impression that might otherwise be created.
§ 5.65
Alcohol content.
(a)
General.
The alcohol content for distilled spirits must be stated on the label as a percentage of alcohol by volume. Products that contain a significant amount of material, such as solid fruit, that may absorb spirits after bottling must state the alcohol content at the time of bottling as follows: “Bottled at ____ percent alcohol by volume.”
(b)
How the alcohol content must be expressed.
The following rules apply to statements of alcohol content.
(1) A statement of alcohol content must be expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume.
(i) In addition, the alcohol content in degrees of proof may be stated on a label as long as it appears in the same field of vision as the mandatory statement of alcohol content as a percentage of alcohol by volume. Additional statements of proof may appear on the label without being in the same field of vision as the mandatory alcohol by volume statement.
(ii) Other truthful, accurate, and specific factual representations of alcohol content, such as alcohol by weight, may be made, as long as they appear together with, and as part of, the statement of alcohol content as a percentage of alcohol by volume.
(2)(i) The alcohol content statement must be expressed in one of the following formats:
(A) “Alcohol ____ percent by volume”;
(B) “____ percent alcohol by volume”; or
(C) “Alcohol by volume ____ percent.”
(ii) Any of the words or symbols may be enclosed in parentheses and authorized abbreviations may be used with or without a period. The alcohol content statement does not have to appear with quotation marks.
(3) The statements listed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section must appear as shown, except that the following abbreviations may be used: Alcohol may be abbreviated as “alc”; percent may be represented by the percent symbol “%”; alcohol and volume may be separated by a slash “/” in lieu of the word “by”; and volume may be abbreviated as “vol”.
(4) The following are examples of alcohol content statements that comply with the requirements of this part:
(i) “40% alc/vol”;
(ii) “Alc. 40 percent by vol.”;
(iii) “Alc 40% by vol”; and
(iv) “40% Alcohol by Volume.”
(c)
Tolerances.
A tolerance of plus or minus 0.3 percentage points is allowed for actual alcohol content that is above or below the labeled alcohol content.
§ 5.66
Name and address for domestically bottled distilled spirits that were wholly made in the United States.
(a)
General.
Domestically bottled distilled spirits that were wholly made in
the United States and contain no imported distilled spirits must be labeled in accordance with this section. (See §§ 5.67 and 5.68 for name and address requirements applicable to distilled spirits that are not wholly made in the United States.) For purposes of this section, a “processor” who solely bottles the labeled distilled spirits will be considered the “bottler.”
(b)
Form of statement.
The bottler, distiller, or processor of the distilled spirits must be identified by a phrase describing the function performed by that person. If that person performs more than one function, the label may (but is not required to) so indicate.
(1) If the name of the bottler appears on the label, it must be preceded by a phrase such as “bottled by,” “canned by,” “packed by,” or “filled by,” followed by the name and address of the bottler.
(2) If the name of the processor appears on the label, it must be preceded by a phrase such as “blended by,” “made by,” “prepared by,” “produced by,” or “manufactured by,” as appropriate, followed by the name and address of the processor. When applied to distilled spirits, the term “produced by” indicates a processing operation (formerly known as rectification) that involves a change in the class or type of the product through the addition of flavors or some other processing activity.
(3) If the name of the distiller appears on the label, it must be preceded by a phrase such as “distilled by,” followed by the name and address of the distiller. If the distilled spirits were bottled for the distiller thereof, the name and address of the distiller may be preceded by a phrase such as “distilled by and bottled for,” or “bottled for.”
(c)
Listing of more than one function.
If different functions are performed by more than one person, statements on the label may not create the misleading impression that the different functions were performed by the same person.
(d)
Form of address
—(1)
General.
The address consists of the city and State where the operation occurred, or the city and State of the principal place of business of the person performing the operation. This information must be consistent with the information on the basic permit. Addresses may, but are not required to, include additional information such as street names, counties, zip codes, phone numbers, and website addresses. The postal abbreviation of the State name may be used; for example, California may be abbreviated as CA.
(2)
More than one address.
If the bottler, distiller, or processor listed on the name and address statement is the actual operator of more than one distilled spirits plant engaged in bottling, distilling, or processing operations, as applicable, the label may state, immediately following the name of the permittee, the addresses of those other plants, in addition to the address of the plant at which the distilled spirits were bottled. In this situation, the address where the operation occurred must be indicated on the label or on the container by printing, coding, or other markings.
(3)
Principal place of business.
The label may provide the address of the bottler's, distiller's, or processor's principal place of business, in lieu of the place where the bottling, distilling, or other operation occurred, provided that the address where the operation occurred is indicated on the label or on the container by printing, coding, or other markings.
(4)
Distilled spirits bottled for another person.
(i) If distilled spirits are bottled for another person, other than the actual distiller thereof, the label may state, in addition to (but not in place of) the name and address of the bottler, the name and address of such other person, immediately preceded by the words “bottled for” or another similar appropriate phrase. Such statements must clearly indicate the relationship between the two persons (for example, contract bottling).
(ii) If the same brand of distilled spirits is bottled by two distillers that are not under the same ownership, the label for each distiller may set forth both locations where bottling takes place, as long as the label uses the actual location (and not the principal place of business) and as long as the nature of the arrangement is clearly set forth.
(5)
Additional addresses.
No additional places or addresses may be stated for the same person unless:
(i) That person is actively engaged in the conduct of an additional bona fide and actual alcohol beverage business at such additional place or address, and
(ii) The label also contains in direct conjunction therewith, appropriate descriptive material indicating the function occurring at such additional place or address in connection with the particular product (such as “distilled by.”)
(e)
Special rule for straight whiskies.
If “straight whiskies” (see § 5.143) of the same type are distilled in the same State by two or more different distillers and are combined (either at the time of bottling or at a warehouseman's bonded premises for further storage) and subsequently bottled and labeled as “straight whisky,” that “straight whisky” must bear a label that contains name and address information of the bottler. If that combined “straight whisky” is bottled by or for the distillers, in lieu of the name and address of the bottler, the label may contain the words “distilled by,” followed immediately by the names (or trade names) and addresses of the different distillers who distilled a portion of the “straight whisky” and the percentage of “straight whisky” distilled by each distiller, with a tolerance of plus or minus 2 percent. If “straight whisky” consists of a mixture of “straight whiskies” of the same type from two or more different distilleries of the same proprietor located within the same State, and if that “straight whisky” is bottled by or for that proprietor, in lieu of the name and address of the bottler, the “straight whisky” may bear a label containing the words “distilled by” followed by the name (or trade name) of the proprietor and the addresses of the different distilleries that distilled a portion of the “straight whisky.”
(f)
State of distillation for whisky.
(1) The State of distillation, which is the State in which original distillation takes place, must appear on the label of any type of whisky defined in § 5.143(c)(2) through (7), (15), and (16), which is distilled in the United States. The State of distillation may appear on any label and must be shown in at least one of the following ways:
(i) By including a “distilled by” (or “distilled and bottled by” or any other phrase including the word “distilled”) statement as part of the mandatory name and address statement, followed by a single location;
(ii) If the address shown in the “bottled by” statement includes the State in which distillation occurred, by including a “bottled by” statement as part of the mandatory name and address statement, followed by a single location;
(iii) By including the name of the State in which original distillation occurred immediately adjacent to the class or type designation (such as “Kentucky bourbon whisky”), as long as the product was both distilled and aged in that State in conformance with the requirements of § 5.143(b); or
(iv) By including a separate statement, such as “Distilled in [name of State].”
(2) The appropriate TTB officer may require that the State of distillation or other information appear on a label of any whisky subject to the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section (and may prescribe placement requirements for such information), even if that State appears in the name and address statement, if such additional information is necessary to negate any misleading or deceptive impression that might otherwise be created as regards the actual State of distillation.
(3) In the case of “light whisky,” the State name “Kentucky” or “Tennessee” may not appear on any label, except as a part of a name and address as specified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (4) of this section.
(g)
Trade or operating names.
The name of the person appearing on the label may be the trade name or the operating name, as long as it is identical to a trade or operating name appearing on the basic permit. In the case of a distillation statement for spirits bottled in bond, the name or trade name under which the spirits were distilled must be shown.
[T.D. TTB-176, 87 7579, Feb. 9, 2022, as amended at T.D. TTB-199, 89 FR 102735, Dec. 18, 2024]

Tolerances.
(1) The following tolerances are permissible for purposes of applying paragraph (a) of this section:
(i)
Errors in measuring.
Discrepancies due to errors in measuring that occur in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial practice;
(ii)
Differences in capacity.
Discrepancies due exclusively to differences in the capacity of containers, resulting solely from unavoidable difficulties in manufacturing the containers so as to be of uniform capacity, provided that the discrepancy does not result from a container design that prevents the manufacture of containers of an approximately uniform capacity; and
(iii)
Differences in atmospheric conditions.
Discrepancies in measure due to differences in atmospheric conditions in various places, including discrepancies resulting from the ordinary and customary exposure of alcohol beverage products in containers to evaporation, provided that the discrepancy is determined to be reasonable on a case by case basis.
(2)
Shortages and overages.
A contents shortage in certain of the containers in a shipment may not be counted against a contents overage in other containers in the same shipment for purposes of determining compliance with the requirements of this section.
§ 5.71
Neutral spirits and name of commodity.
(a) In the case of distilled spirits (other than cordials, liqueurs, flavored neutral spirits, including flavored vodka, and distilled spirits specialty products) manufactured by blending or other processing, if neutral spirits were used in the production of the spirits, the percentage of neutral spirits so used and the name of the commodity from which the neutral spirits were distilled must appear on a label. The statement of percentage and the name of the commodity must be in substantially the following form: “____% neutral spirits distilled from____ (insert grain, cane products, fruit, or other commodity as appropriate)”; or “____

§ 5.72
Coloring materials.
The words “artificially colored” must appear on a label of any distilled spirits product containing synthetic or natural materials that primarily contribute color, or when information on a label conveys the impression that a color was derived from a source other than the actual source of the color, except that:
(a) If no coloring material other than a color exempt from certification under FDA regulations has been added, a truthful statement of the source of the color may appear in lieu of the words “artificially colored,” for example, “Contains Beta Carotene” or “Colored with beet extract.” See 21 CFR parts 73 and 74 for the list of such colors under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations;
(b) If no coloring material has been added other than one certified as suitable for use in foods by the FDA, the words “(to be filled in with name of) certified color added” or “Contains Certified Color” may appear in lieu of the words “artificially colored”; and
(c) If no coloring material other than caramel has been added, the words “colored with caramel,” “contains caramel color,” or another statement specifying the use of caramel color, may appear in lieu of the words “artificially colored.” However, no statement of any type is required for the use of caramel color in brandy, rum, or Tequila, or in any type of whisky other than straight whisky if used at not more than 2.5 percent by volume of the finished product. Provided, if any amount of caramel color is used in American single malt whisky, or in straight American single malt whisky, a statement specifying the use of caramel color must appear on the label.
(d) As provided in § 5.61, the use of FD
C Yellow No. 5, carmine, or cochineal extract must be specifically stated on the label even if the label also contains a phrase such as “contains certified color” or “artificially colored.”
[T.D. TTB-176, 87 7579, Feb. 9, 2022, as amended by T.D. TTB-199, 89 FR 102735, Dec. 24, 2024]
§ 5.73
Treatment of whisky or brandy with wood.
The words “colored and flavored with wood____ ” (inserting “chips,” “slabs,” etc., as appropriate) must appear immediately adjacent to, and in the same size of type as, the class and type designation under subpart I of this part for whisky and brandy treated, in whole or in part, with wood through percolation or otherwise during distillation or storage, other than through contact with an oak barrel. However, the statement specified in this section is not required in the case of brandy treated with an infusion of oak chips in accordance with § 5.155(b)(3)(B).
§ 5.74
Statements of age, storage, and percentage.
(a)
General.
(1) As defined in § 5.1, age is the length of time during which, after distillation and before bottling, the distilled spirits have been stored in oak barrels. For bourbon whisky, rye whisky, wheat whisky, malt whisky, or rye malt whisky, and straight whiskies other than straight corn whisky and straight American single malt whisky, aging must occur in charred new oak barrels.
(2) If an age statement is used, it is permissible to understate the age of a product, but overstatements of age are prohibited. However, the age statement may not conflict with the standard of identity, if aging is required as part of the standard of identity. For example, the standard of identity for straight rye whisky requires that the whisky be aged for a minimum of 2 years, so the age statement “Aged 1 year,” would be prohibited for a product designated as
“straight” rye whisky, even if the spirits were actually aged for more than 2 years, because it is inconsistent with the standard of identity.
(3)The age may be stated in years, months, or days.
(b)
Age statements and percentage of type statements for whisky.
For all domestic or foreign whiskies that are aged less than 4 years, including blends containing a whisky that is aged less than 4 years, an age statement and percentage of types of whisky statement is required to appear on a label, unless the whisky is labeled as “bottled in bond” in conformity with § 5.88. For all other whiskies, the statements are optional, but if used, they must conform to the formatting requirements listed below. Moreover, if the bottler chooses to include a statement of age or percentage on the label of a product that is 4 years old or more and that contains neutral spirits, the statement must appear immediately adjacent to the neutral spirits statement required by § 5.70. The following are the allowable formats for the age and percentage statements for whisky:
(1)(i) In the case of whisky, whether or not mixed or blended but containing no neutral spirits, the age of the youngest whisky in the product. The age statement must appear substantially as follows: “____ years old”; and
(ii) If a whisky is aged in more than one container, the label may optionally indicate the types of oak containers used.
(2) In the case of whisky containing neutral spirits, whether or not mixed or blended, if any straight whisky or other whisky in the product is less than 4 years old, the percentage by volume of each such whisky and the age of each such whisky (the age of the youngest of the straight whiskies or other whiskies if the product contains two or more of either). The age and percentage statement for a straight whisky and other whisky must appear immediately adjacent to the neutral spirits statement required by § 5.70 and must read substantially as follows:
(i) If the product contains only one straight whisky and no other whisky: “____ percent straight whisky ____ years old;”
(ii) If the product contains more than one straight whisky but no other whisky: “____ percent straight whiskies ____ years or more old.” In this case the age blank must state the age of the youngest straight whisky in the product. However, in lieu of the foregoing statement, the following statement may appear on the label: “____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, ____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, and ____ percent straight whisky ____ years old”;
(iii) If the product contains only one straight whisky and one other whisky: “____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, ____ percent whisky ____ years old”; or
(iv) If the product contains more than one straight whisky and more than one other whisky: “____ percent straight whiskies ____ years or more old, ____ percent whiskies ____ years or more old.” In this case, the age blanks must state the age of the youngest straight whisky and the age of the youngest other whisky. However, in lieu of the foregoing statement, the following statement may appear on the label: “____ percent straight whisky ____ years old, percent straight whisky ____ years old, ____ percent whisky ____ years old, and ____ percent whisky ____ years old”;
(3) In the case of an imported rye whisky, wheat whisky, malt whisky, or rye malt whisky, a label on the product must state each age and percentage in the manner and form that would be required if the whisky had been made in the United States;
(4) In the case of whisky made in the United States and stored in reused oak barrels, other than corn whisky, light whisky, American single malt whisky, and straight American single malt whisky, in lieu of the words “__ years old” specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the period of storage in the reused oak barrels must appear on the label as follows: “stored __ years in reused cooperage.”
(c)
Statements of age for rum, brandy, and agave spirits.
A statement of age on labels of rums, brandies, and agave spirits is optional, except that, in the case of brandy (other than immature brandies, fruit brandies, marc brandy, pomace brandy, Pisco brandy, Singani
brandy, and grappa brandy, which are not customarily stored in oak barrels) not stored in oak barrels for a period of at least two years, a statement of age must appear on the label. Any statement of age authorized or required under this paragraph must appear substantially as follows: “____ years old,” with the blank to be filled in with the age of the youngest distilled spirits in the product.
(d)
Statement of storage for grain spirits.
In the case of grain spirits, the period of storage in oak barrels may appear on a label immediately adjacent to the percentage statement required under § 5.73, for example: “____ % grain spirits stored ____ years in oak barrels.”
(e)
Other distilled spirits.
(1) Statements regarding age or maturity or similar statements or representations on labels for all other spirits, except neutral spirits, are permitted only when the distilled spirits are stored in an oak barrel and, once dumped from the barrel, subjected to no treatment besides mixing with water, filtering, and bottling. If batches are made from barrels of spirits of different ages, the label may only state the age of the youngest spirits.
(2) Statements regarding age or maturity or similar statements of neutral spirits (except for grain spirits as stated in paragraph (c) of this section) are prohibited from appearing on any label.
(f)
Other age representations.
(1) If a representation that is similar to an age or maturity statement permitted under this section appears on a label, a statement of age, in a manner that is conspicuous and in characters at least half the type size of the representation must also appear on each label that carries the representation, except in the following cases:
(i) The use of the word “old” or another word denoting age as part of the brand name of the product is not deemed to be an age representation that requires a statement of age; and
(ii) Labels of whiskies and brandies (other than immature brandies, pomace brandy, marc brandy, Pisco brandy, Singani brandy, and grappa brandy) not required to bear a statement of age, and rum and agave spirits aged for not less than four years, may contain general inconspicuous age, maturity or similar representations without the label having to bear an age statement.
(2) Distillation dates (which may be an exact date or a year) may appear on a label of spirits where the spirits are manufactured solely through distillation. A distillation date may only appear if an optional or mandatory age statement is used on the label and must appear in the same field of vision as the age statement.
[T.D. TTB-176, 87 7579, Feb. 9, 2022, as amended by T.D. TTB-187 88 FR 2227, Jan. 13, 2023; T.D. TTB-199, 89 FR 102735, Dec. 18, 2024]

Submission of petition.
Any person may petition the appropriate TTB officer to exempt a particular product or class of products from the labeling requirements of § 5.82. The burden is on the petitioner to provide scientific evidence (as well as the analytical method used to produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the finished product or class of products, as derived by the method specified in the petition, either:
(1) Does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health; or
(2) Does not contain allergenic protein derived from one of the foods identified in § 5.82(a)(1)(i), even though a major food allergen was used in production.
(b)
Decision on petition.
TTB will approve or deny a petition for exemption submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in writing within 180 days of receipt of the petition. If TTB does not provide a written response to the petitioner within that 180-day period, the petition will be deemed denied, unless an extension of time for decision is mutually agreed upon by the appropriate TTB officer and the petitioner. TTB may confer with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on petitions for exemption, as appropriate and as FDA resources permit. TTB may require the submission of product samples and other additional information in support of a petition; however, unless required by TTB, the submission of samples or additional information by the
petitioner after submission of the petition will be treated as the withdrawal of the initial petition and the submission of a new petition. An approval or denial under this section will constitute final agency action.
(c)
Resubmission of a petition.
After a petition for exemption is denied under this section, the petitioner may resubmit the petition along with supporting materials for reconsideration at any time. TTB will treat this submission as a new petition.
(d)
Availability of information
—(1)
General.
TTB will promptly post to its website (
https://www.ttb.gov
) all petitions received under this section, as well as TTB's responses to those petitions. Any information submitted in support of the petition that is not posted to the TTB website will be available to the public pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, at 5 U.S.C. 552, except where a request for confidential treatment is granted under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Requests for confidential treatment of business information.
A person who provides trade secrets or other commercial or financial information in connection with a petition for exemption under this section may request that TTB give confidential treatment to that information. A failure to request confidential treatment at the time the information in question is submitted to TTB will constitute a waiver of confidential treatment. A request for confidential treatment of information under this section must conform to the following standards:
(i) The request must be in writing;
(ii) The request must clearly identify the information to be kept confidential;
(iii) The request must relate to information that constitutes trade secrets or other confidential commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions of an interested person, the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of that person;
(iv) The request must set forth the reasons why the information should not be disclosed, including the reasons why the disclosure of the information would prejudice the competitive position of the interested person; and
(v) The request must be supported by a signed statement by the interested person, or by an authorized officer or employee of that person, certifying that the information in question is a trade secret or other confidential commercial or financial information and that the information is not already in the public domain.

# Production Claims
§ 5.84
Use of the term “organic.”
Use of the term “organic” is permitted if any such use complies with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Organic Program rules (7 CFR part 205), as interpreted by the USDA.
§ 5.85
[Reserved]
§ 5.86
[Reserved]

# Other Label Terms
§ 5.87
“Barrel Proof” and similar terms.
(a) The term “barrel proof” or “cask strength” may be used to refer to distilled spirits stored in wood barrels only when the bottling proof is not more than two degrees lower than the proof of the spirits when the spirits are dumped from the barrels.
(b) The term “original proof,” “original barrel proof,” “original cask strength,” or “entry proof” may be used only if the distilled spirits were stored in wooden barrels and the proof of the spirits entered into the barrel and the proof of the bottled spirits are the same.
§ 5.88
Bottled in bond.
(a) The term “bond,” “bonded,” “bottled in bond,” or “aged in bond,” or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, may be used (including as part of the brand name) only if the distilled spirits are:
(1) Composed of the same kind (type, if one is applicable to the spirits, otherwise class) of spirits distilled from the same class of materials;
(2) Distilled in the same distilling season (as defined in § 5.1) by the same distiller at the same distillery.
(3) Stored for at least 4 years in wooden containers wherein the spirits
have been in contact with the wood surface, except for vodka, which must be stored for at least 4 years in wooden containers coated or lined with paraffin or other substance which will preclude contact of the spirits with the wood surface, and except for gin, which must be stored in paraffin-lined or unlined wooden containers for at least 4 years;
(4) Unaltered from their original condition or character by the addition or subtraction of any substance other than by filtration, chill proofing, or other physical treatments (which do not involve the addition of any substance which will remain in the finished product or result in a change in class or type);
(5) Reduced in proof by the addition of only pure water to 50 percent alcohol by volume (100 degrees of proof); and
(6) Bottled at 50 percent alcohol by volume (100 degrees of proof).
(b) Imported spirits labeled as “bottled in bond” or other synonymous term described above must be manufactured in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section and may only be so labeled if the laws and regulations of the country in which the spirits are manufactured authorize the bottling of spirits in bond and require or specifically authorize such spirits to be so labeled. The “bottled in bond” or synonymous statement must be immediately followed, in the same font and type size, by the name of the country under whose laws and regulations such distilled spirits were so bottled.
(c) Domestically manufactured spirits labeled as “bottled in bond” or with some other synonymous statement must bear the real name of the distillery or the trade name under which the distiller distilled and warehoused the spirits, and the number of the distilled spirits plant in which distilled, and the number of the distilled spirits plant in which bottled. The label may also bear the name or trade name of the bottler.
§ 5.89
Multiple distillation claims.
(a) Truthful statements about the number of distillations, such as “double distilled,” “distilled three times,” or similar terms to convey multiple distillations, may be used if they are truthful statements of fact. For the purposes of this section only, the term “distillation” means a single run through a pot still or a single run through a column of a column (reflux) still. For example, if a column still has three separate columns, one complete additional run through the system would constitute three additional distillations.
(b) The number of distillations may be understated but may not be overstated.
§ 5.90
Terms related to Scotland.
(a) The words “Scotch,” “Scots,” “Highland,” or “Highlands,” and similar words connoting, indicating, or commonly associated with Scotland, may be used to designate only distilled spirits wholly manufactured in Scotland, except that the term “Scotch whisky” may appear in the designation for a flavored spirit (“Flavored Scotch Whisky”) or in a truthful statement of composition (“Scotch whisky with natural flavors”) where the base distilled spirit meets the requirements for a Scotch whisky designation, regardless of where the finished product is manufactured.
(b) In accordance with § 5.127, statements relating to government supervision may appear on Scotch whisky containers only if such labeling statements are required or specifically authorized by the applicable regulations of the United Kingdom.
§ 5.91
Use of the term “pure.”
Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not bear the word “pure” unless it:
(a) Refers to a particular ingredient used in the production of the distilled spirits, and is a truthful representation about that ingredient;
(b) Is part of the bona fide name of a permittee or retailer for which the distilled spirits are bottled; or
(c) Is part of the bona fide name of the permittee that bottled the distilled spirits.

# Subpart H—Labeling Practices That Are Prohibited If They Are Misleading
§ 5.121
General.
(a)
Application.
The labeling practices that are prohibited if misleading set forth in this subpart apply to any distilled spirits label, container, or packaging. For purposes of this subpart:
(1) The term “label” includes all labels on distilled spirits containers on which mandatory information may appear, as set forth in § 5.61(a), as well as any other label on the container;
(2) The term “container” includes all parts of the distilled spirits container, including any part of a distilled spirits container on which mandatory information may appear, as well as those parts of the container on which information does not satisfy mandatory labeling requirements, as set forth in § 5.61(b); and
(3) The term “packaging” includes any carton, case, carrier, individual covering or other packaging of such containers used for sale at retail, but does not include shipping cartons or cases that are not intended to accompany the container to the consumer.
(b)
Statement or representation.
For purposes of this subpart, the term “statement or representation” includes any statement, design, device, or representation, and includes pictorial or graphic designs or representations as well as written ones. The term “statement or representation” includes explicit and implicit statements and representations.
§ 5.122
Misleading statements or representations.
(a)
General prohibition.
Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any statement or representation, irrespective of falsity, that is misleading to consumers as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of the distilled spirits, or with regard to any other material factor.
(b)
Ways in which statements or representations may be found to be misleading.
(1) A statement or representation is prohibited, irrespective of falsity, if it directly creates a misleading impression, or if it does so indirectly
through ambiguity, omission, inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific, or technical matter. For example, an otherwise truthful statement may be misleading because of the omission of material information, the disclosure of which is necessary to prevent the statement from being misleading.
(2) All claims, whether implicit or explicit, must have a reasonable basis in fact. Any claim on distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging that does not have a reasonable basis in fact, or cannot be adequately substantiated upon the request of the appropriate TTB officer, is considered misleading.
§ 5.123
Guarantees.
Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any statement relating to guarantees if the appropriate TTB officer finds it is likely to mislead the consumer. However, money-back guarantees are not prohibited.
§ 5.124

§ 5.125
Tests or analyses.
Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any statement or representation of or relating to analyses, standards, or tests, whether or not it is true, that is likely to mislead the consumer. An example of such a misleading statement is “tested and approved by our research laboratories” if the testing and approval does not in fact have any significance.
§ 5.126
Depictions of government symbols.
Representations of the armed forces and flags.
Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not show an image of any government's flag or any representation related to the armed forces of the United States if the representation, standing alone or considered together with any additional language or symbols on the label, creates a false or misleading impression that the product was endorsed by, made by, used by, or made under the supervision of, the government represented by that flag or by the armed forces of the United States. This section does not prohibit the use of a flag as part of a claim of American origin or another country of origin.
§§ 5.127-5.128
[Reserved]
§ 5.129
Health-related statements.
(a)
Definitions.
When used in this section, the following terms have the meaning indicated:
(1)
Health-related statement
means any statement related to health (other than the warning statement required under part 16 of this chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within the distilled spirits product, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the distilled spirits, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (for example, statements of vitamin content).
(2)
Specific health claim
means a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, to a disease or
health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, and a disease or health-related condition.
(3)
Health-related directional statement
means a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption.
(b)
Rules for labeling
—(1)
Health-related statements.
In general, distilled spirits may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement.
(2)
Specific health claims.
(i) TTB will consult with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health claim on the distilled spirits. If FDA determines that the use of such a labeling claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use of that specific health claim on the distilled spirits.
(ii) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a distilled spirits label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; is sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim.
(3)
Health-related directional statements.
A health-related directional statement is presumed misleading unless it:
(i) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption; and
(ii)(A) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;” or
(B) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.
§ 5.130
Appearance of endorsement.
(a)
General.
Distilled spirits labels, containers, or packaging may not include the name, or the simulation or abbreviation of the name, of any living individual of public prominence, or an existing private or public organization, or any graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of the individual or organization, if its use is likely to lead a consumer to falsely believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of, such individual or organization. This section does not prohibit the use of such names where the individual or organization has provided authorization for their use.
(b)
Disclaimers.
Statements or other representations do not violate this section if, taken as a whole, they create no misleading impression as to an implied endorsement either because of the context in which they are presented or because of the use of an adequate disclaimer.
(c)
Exception.
This section does not apply to the use of the name of any person engaged in business as a distiller, rectifier (processor), blender, or other producer, or as an importer, wholesaler, retailer, bottler, or warehouseman of distilled spirits. This section also does not apply to the use by any person of a trade or brand name
that is the name of any living individual of public prominence or existing private or public organization, provided such trade or brand name was used by the industry member or its predecessors in interest prior to August 29, 1935.

# Subpart I—Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits
§ 5.141
The standards of identity in general.
(a)
General.
Distilled spirits are divided, for labeling purposes, into classes, which are further divided into specific types. As set forth in § 5.63, a distilled spirits product label must bear the appropriate class, type or other designation. The standards that define the classes and types are known as the “standards of identity.” The classes and types of distilled spirits set forth in this subpart apply only to distilled spirits for beverage or other nonindustrial purposes.
(b)
Rules.
(1) Unless otherwise specified, when a standard of identity states that a mash is of a particular ingredient (such as “fermented mash of grain”), the mash must be made entirely of that ingredient without the addition of other fermentable ingredients.
(2) Some distilled spirits products may conform to the standards of identity of more than one class. Such products may be designated with any single class designation defined in this subpart to which the products conform.
(c)
Designating with both class and type.
If a product is designated with both the class and the type, the type designation must be as conspicuous as the class designation, and must appear in the same field of vision.
(d)
Words in a designation.
All words in a designation must be similarly conspicuous and must appear together.
§ 5.142
Neutral spirits or alcohol.
(a)
The class neutral spirits.
“Neutral spirits” or “alcohol” are distilled spirits distilled from any suitable material at or above 95 percent alcohol by volume (190° proof), and, if bottled, bottled at not less than 40 percent alcohol by volume (80° proof). Neutral spirits other than the type “grain spirits” may be designated as “neutral spirits” or “alcohol” on a label. Neutral spirits (other than the type “grain spirits”) may not be aged in wood barrels at any time.
(b)
Types.
The following chart lists the types of neutral spirits and the rules that apply to the type designation.
Type designation
Standards
(1) Vodka
Neutral spirits which may be treated with up to two grams per liter of sugar and up to one gram per liter of citric acid. Products to be labeled as vodka may not be aged or stored in wood barrels at any time except when stored in paraffin-lined wood barrels and labeled as bottled in bond pursuant to § 5.88. Vodka treated and filtered with not less than one ounce of activated carbon or activated charcoal per 100 wine gallons of spirits may be labeled as “charcoal filtered.” Addition of any other flavoring or blending materials changes the classification to flavored vodka or to a distilled spirits specialty product, as appropriate. Vodka must be designated on the label as “neutral spirits,” “alcohol,” or “vodka”.
(2) Grain spirits
Neutral spirits distilled from a fermented mash of grain and stored in oak barrels. “Grain spirits” must be designated as such on the label. Grain spirits may not be designated as “neutral spirits” or “alcohol” on the label.
§ 5.143
Whisky.
(a)
The class whisky.
“Whisky” or “whiskey” is distilled spirits that is an alcoholic distillate from a fermented mash of any grain distilled at less than 95 percent alcohol by volume (190° proof) having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to whisky, stored in oak barrels (except that corn whisky need not be so stored), and bottled at not less than 40 percent alcohol by volume (80° proof), and also includes mixtures of such distillates for which no specific standards of identity are prescribed.
(b)
Label designations.
The word whisky may be spelled as either “whisky” or “whiskey”. The place, State, or region where the whisky was distilled may appear as part of the designation
on the label if the distillation and any required aging took place in that location (
e.g.,
“New York Bourbon Whisky” must be distilled and aged in the State of New York); however, blending and bottling need not have taken place in the same place, State, or region. However, if any whisky is made partially from whisky distilled in a country other than that indicated by the type designation, the label must indicate the percentage of such whisky and the country where that whisky was distilled. Additionally, the label of whisky that does not meet one of the standards for specific types of whisky and that is comprised of components distilled in more than one country must contain a statement of composition indicating the country of origin of each component (such as “Whisky—50% from Japan, 50% from the United States”). The word “bourbon” may not be used to describe any whisky or whisky-based distilled spirits not distilled and aged in the United States. The whiskies defined in paragraphs (c)(2) through (6) and (10) through (14) of this section are distinctive products of the United States and must have the country of origin stated immediately adjacent to the type designation if it is distilled outside of the United States, or the whisky designation must be proceeded by the term “American type” if the country of origin appears elsewhere on the label. For example, “Brazilian Corn Whisky,” “Rye Whisky distilled in Sweden,” and “Blended Whisky—Product of Japan” are statements that meet this country of origin requirement. “Light whisky”, “Blended light whisky”, and “Whisky distilled from bourbon (rye, wheat, malt, rye malt, or other named grain) mash” may only be produced in the United States.
(c)
Types of whisky.
The following tables set out the designations for whisky. Table 1 sets forth the standards for whisky that are defined based on production, storage, and processing standards, while Table 2 sets forth rules for the types of whisky that are defined as distinctive products of certain foreign countries. For the whiskies listed in Table 1, a domestic whisky may be labeled with the designation listed, when it complies with the production standards in the subsequent columns. The “source” column indicates the source of the grain mash used to make the whisky. The “distillation proof” indicates the allowable distillation proof for that type. The “storage” column indicates the type of packages (barrels) in which the spirits must be stored and limits for the proof of the spirits when entering the packages. The “neutral spirits permitted” column indicates whether neutral spirits may be used in the product in their original state (and not as vehicles for flavoring materials), and if so, how much may be used. The “harmless coloring, flavoring, blending materials permitted” column indicates whether harmless coloring, flavoring, or blending materials, other than neutral spirits in their original form, described in § 5.142, may be used in the product. The use of the word “straight” is a further designation of a type, and is optional.

§ 5.155
Alteration of class and type.
(a)
Definitions
—(1)
Coloring, flavoring, or blending material.
For the purposes of this section, the term “coloring, flavoring, or blending material” means a harmless substance that is an essential component of the class or type of distilled spirits to which it is added; or a harmless substance, such as caramel, straight malt or straight rye malt whiskies, fruit juices, sugar, infusion of oak chips when approved by the Administrator, or wine, that is not an essential component part of the distilled spirits product to which it is added but which is customarily employed in the product in accordance with established trade usage.
(2)
Certified color.
For purposes of this section, the term “certified color” means a color additive that is required to undergo batch certification in accordance with part 74 or part 82 of the Food and Drug Administration regulations (21 CFR parts 74 and 82). An example of a certified color is FD
C Blue No. 2.
(b)
Allowable additions.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the following may be added to distilled spirits without changing the class or type designation:
(1) Coloring, flavoring, and blending materials that are essential components of the class or type of distilled spirits to which added;
(2) Coloring, flavoring, and blending materials that are not essential component parts of the distilled spirits to which added, provided that such coloring, flavoring, or blending materials do not total more than 2.5 percent by volume of the finished product; and
(3) Wine, when added to Canadian whisky in Canada in accordance with the laws and regulations of Canada governing the manufacture of Canadian whisky.
(c)
Special rules.
The addition of the following will require a redesignation
of the class or type of the distilled spirits product to which added:

(2) Any material, other than caramel, infusion of oak chips, and sugar, added to Cognac brandy;
(3) Any material whatsoever added to neutral spirits or straight whisky, except that vodka may be treated with sugar, in an amount not to exceed two grams per liter, and with citric acid, in an amount not to exceed one gram per liter;
(4) Certified colors, carmine, or cochineal extract;
(5) Any material that would render the product to which it is added an imitation, as defined in § 5.152; or
(6) For products that are required to be stored in oak barrels in accordance with a standard of identity, the storing of the product in an additional barrel made of another type of wood.
(d)
Extractions from distilled spirits.
The removal of any constituents from a distilled spirits product to such an extent that the product no longer possesses the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to that class or type of distilled spirits will alter the class or type of the product, and the resulting product must be redesignated appropriately. In addition, in the case of straight whisky, the removal of more than 15 percent of the fixed acids, volatile acids, esters, soluble solids, or higher alcohols, or the removal of more than 25 percent of the soluble color, constitutes an alteration of the class or type of the product and requires a redesignation of the product.

(a)
General.
A bottler or importer of distilled spirits in distinctive liquor bottles may apply for a distinctive liquor bottle approval from the appropriate TTB officer.

Application.
No person engaged in business as a distiller, rectifier (processor), importer, wholesaler, bottler, or warehouseman and bottler of distilled spirits, directly or indirectly or through an affiliate, shall publish or disseminate or cause to be published or disseminated by radio or television broadcast, or in any newspaper, periodical, or any publication, by any sign or outdoor advertisement, or by electronic or internet media, or any other printed or graphic matter, any advertisement of distilled spirits, if such advertising is in, or is calculated to induce sales in, interstate or foreign commerce, or is disseminated by mail, unless such advertisement is in conformity with this subpart:
Provided,
That such sections shall not apply to outdoor advertising in place on September 7, 1984, but shall apply upon replacement, restoration, or renovation of any such advertising;
and provided further,
that such sections shall not apply to a retailer or the publisher of any newspaper, periodical, or other publication, or radio or television or internet broadcast, unless such retailer or publisher or broadcaster is engaged in business as a distiller, rectifier (processor), importer, wholesaler, or warehouseman and bottler of distilled spirits, directly or indirectly, or through an affiliate.
§ 5.232
Definition.
As used in this subpart, the term “advertisement” “or advertising” includes any written or verbal statement, illustration, or depiction which is in, or calculated to induce sales in, interstate or foreign commerce, or is disseminated by mail, whether it appears in a newspaper, magazine, trade booklet, menu, wine card, leaflet, circular, mailer, book insert, catalog, promotional material, sales pamphlet, internet or other electronic site or social network, or in any written, printed, graphic, or other matter (such as hang tags) accompanying, but not firmly affixed to, the bottle, representations made on shipping cases or in any billboard, sign, other outdoor display, public transit card, other periodical literature, publication, or in a radio or television broadcast, or in any other media; except that such term shall not include:
(a) Any label affixed to any bottle of distilled spirits; or any individual covering, carton, or other container of the bottle which constitute a part of the labeling under this part.
(b) Any editorial or other reading material (such as a news release) in any periodical or publication or newspaper for the publication of which no money or valuable consideration or thing of value is paid or promised, directly or indirectly, by any permittee, and which is not written by or at the direction of the permittee.
§ 5.233
Mandatory statements.
(a)
Responsible advertiser.
The advertisement must display the responsible advertiser's name, city, and State or the name and other contact information (such as, telephone number, website, or email address) where the responsible advertiser may be contacted.
(b)
Class and type.
The advertisement shall contain a conspicuous statement of the class to which the product belongs and the type thereof corresponding with the statement of class and type which is required to appear on the label of the product.
(c)
Alcohol content
—(1)
Mandatory statement.
The alcohol content for distilled spirits must be stated as a percentage of alcohol by volume, in the manner set forth in § 5.65 of this chapter for labels. Products that contain a significant amount of material, such as solid fruit, that may absorb spirits after bottling must state the alcohol content at the time of bottling as follows: “Bottled at ____ percent-alcohol-by-volume.”
(2)
Optional statement.
In addition, the advertisement may also state the alcohol content in degrees of proof if this information appears in the same field of vision as the statement expressed in percent-alcohol-by-volume.
(d)
Percentage of neutral spirits and name of commodity.
(1) In the case of distilled spirits (other than cordials, liqueurs, flavored neutral spirits, including flavored vodka, and distilled spirits specialty products) produced by blending or rectification, if neutral spirits have been used in the production thereof, there shall be stated the percentage of neutral spirits so used and the name of the commodity from which such neutral spirits have been distilled. The statement of percentage and the name of the commodity shall be made in substantially the following form: “____% neutral spirits distilled from ____ (insert grain, cane products, or fruit, or other products as appropriate)”; or ____% neutral spirits (vodka) distilled from ____ (insert grain, cane product, fruit, or other commodity, as appropriate)”; or “____% grain (cane products), (fruit) neutral spirits”; or “____% grain spirits”. The statement used under this paragraph must be identical to that on the label of distilled spirits to which the advertisement refers.
(2) In the case of gin manufactured by a process of continuous distillation or in the case of neutral spirits, there shall be stated the name of the commodity from which such gin or neutral spirits were distilled. The statement of the name of the commodity shall be made in substantially the following form: “Distilled from grain”, or “Distilled from cane products”, or “Distilled from fruit.” The statement used under this paragraph must be identical to that on the label of distilled spirits to which the advertisement refers.
(e)
Exception.
(1) If an advertisement refers to a general distilled spirits line or all of the distilled spirits products of one company, whether by the company name or by the brand name common to all the distilled spirits in the line, the only mandatory information necessary is the responsible advertiser's name, city, and State or the name and other contact information (such as telephone number, website, or email address) where the responsible advertiser may be contacted. This exception does not apply where only one type of distilled spirits is marketed under the specific brand name advertised.
(2) On consumer specialty items (such as T-shirts, hats, bumper stickers, or refrigerator magnets), the only information necessary is the company name of the responsible advertiser or brand name of the product.
§ 5.234
Legibility of mandatory information.

§ 5.235
Prohibited practices.
(a)
Restrictions.
An advertisement of distilled spirits shall not contain:
(1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any material particular, or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical matter tends to create a misleading impression.
(2) Any false or misleading statement that explicitly or implicitly disparages a competitor's product. This does not prevent truthful and accurate comparisons between products (such as, “Our
liqueur contains more strawberries than Brand X”) or statements of opinion (such as, “We think our rum tastes better than any other distilled spirits on the market”).
(3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is obscene or indecent.
(4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating to analyses, standards or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
(5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back guarantees are not prohibited.
(6) The words “bond”, “bonded”, “bottled in bond”, “aged in bond”, or phrases containing these or synonymous terms, unless such words or phrases appear, pursuant to § 5.88, on labels of the distilled spirits advertised, and are stated in the advertisement in the manner and form in which they are permitted to appear on the label.
(7) The word “pure” unless:
(i) It refers to a particular ingredient used in the production of the distilled spirits, and is a truthful representation about the ingredient; or
(ii) It is part of the bona fide name of a permittee or retailer for whom the distilled spirits are bottled; or
(iii) It is part of the bona fide name of the permittee who bottled the distilled spirits.
(8) The words “double distilled” or “triple distilled” or any similar terms unless it is a truthful statement of fact. For purposes of this paragraph only, a distillation means a single run through a pot still or a single run through a column of a column (reflux) still. The number of distillations may be understated but may not be overstated.
(b)
Statements inconsistent with labeling.
(1) Advertisements shall not contain any statement concerning a brand or lot of distilled spirits that is inconsistent with any statement on the labeling thereof.
(2) Any label depicted on a container in an advertisement shall be a reproduction of an approved label.
(c)
Statement of age.
The advertisement shall not contain any statement, design, or device directly or by implication concerning age or maturity of any brand or lot of distilled spirits unless a statement of age appears on the label of the advertised product. When any such statement, design, or device concerning age or maturity is contained in any advertisement, it shall include (in direct conjunction therewith and with substantially equal conspicuousness) all parts of the statement, if any, concerning age and percentages required to be made on the label under the provisions of § 5.74. An advertisement for any whisky or brandy (except immature brandies, pomace brandy, marc brandy, Pisco brandy, Singani brandy, and grappa brandy) which is not required to bear a statement of age on the label or an advertisement for any rum or agave spirits, which has been aged for not less than 4 years may, however, contain inconspicuous, general representations as to age, maturity or other similar representations even though a specific age statement does not appear on the label of the advertised product and in the advertisement itself.
(d)
Health-related statements
—(1)
Definitions.
When used in this paragraph (d), terms are defined as follows:
(i)
Health-related statement
means any statement related to health and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, distilled spirits, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the distilled spirits, as well as statements and
claims of nutritional value (
e.g.,
statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.
(ii)
Specific health claim
is a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between distilled spirits, alcohol, or any substance found within the distilled spirits, and a disease or health-related condition.
(iii)
Health-related directional statement
is a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption.
(2)
Rules for advertising
—(i)
Health-related statements.
In general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must appear as prominent as the health-related statement.
(ii)
Specific health claims.
A specific health claim will not be considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.
(iii)
Health-related directional statements.
A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it—
(A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of distilled spirits or alcohol consumption; and
(B)(
1
) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;” or
(
2
) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.
(e)
Place of origin.
The advertisement shall not represent that the distilled spirits were manufactured in or imported from a place or country other than that of their actual origin, or were produced or processed by one who was not in fact the actual producer or processor.
(f)
Confusion of brands.
Two or more different brands or lots of distilled spirits shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in two or more advertisements in one issue of a periodical or newspaper, or in one piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the advertisement tends to create the impression that representations made as to one brand or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such latter the representations contravene any provisions of this subpart or are in any respect untrue.
(g)
Representations of the armed forces or flags.
Advertisements may not show an image of any government's flag or any representation related to the
armed forces of the United States if the representation, standing alone or considered together with any additional language or symbols, creates a false or misleading impression that the product was endorsed by, made by, used by, or made under the supervision of, the government represented by that flag or by the armed forces of the United States. This section does not prohibit the use of a flag as part of a claim of American origin or another country of origin.
(h)
Deceptive advertising techniques.
Subliminal or similar techniques are prohibited. “Subliminal or similar techniques,” as used in this subpart, refers to any device or technique that is used to convey, or attempts to convey, a message to a person by means of images or sounds of a very brief nature that cannot be perceived at a normal level of awareness.
(i) Any use of the term “organic” in the advertising of distilled spirits must comply with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Organic Program rules, 7 CFR part 205, as interpreted by the USDA.
T.D. TTB-176, 87 7579, Feb. 9, 2022, as amended by T. D.TTB-187, 88 FR 2228, Jan. 13, 2023; T.D. TTB-196, 89 FR 87935, Nov. 6, 2024]
§ 5.236
Comparative advertising.
(a)
General.
Comparative advertising shall not be disparaging of a competitor's product in a manner that is false or misleading.
(b)
Taste tests.
(1) Taste test results may be used in advertisements comparing competitors' products unless they are disparaging in a false or misleading manner; deceptive; or likely to mislead the consumer.
(2) The taste test procedure used shall meet scientifically accepted procedures. An example of a scientifically accepted procedure is outlined in the Manual on Sensory Testing Methods, ASTM Special Technical Publication 434, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, ASTM, 1968, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 68-15545.
(3) A statement shall appear in the advertisement providing the name and address of the testing administrator.

(d) The act by an industry member of requiring a retailer to purchase one alcoholic beverage product in order to be allowed to purchase another alcoholic beverage product at the same time.
§ 6.153
Criteria for determining retailer independence.
The criteria specified in this section are indications that a particular practice, other than those in § 6.152, places retailer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of the criteria specified in this section in order to place retailer independence at risk.
(a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a retailer to decide which products to purchase or the quantity in which to purchase them for sale to consumers.
(b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.
(c) The retailer has a continuing obligation to purchase or otherwise promote the industry member's product.
(d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase of the industry member's products.
(e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day operations of the retailer. For example, the industry member controls the retailer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be displayed on the retailer's premises.
(f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all retailers in the local market on the same terms without business reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.

Subject to the requirements and exceptions set forth in the regulations in subpart C of this part, it is unlawful to alter, mutilate, destroy, obliterate, or remove labels on malt beverage containers. This prohibition applies to any person, including retailers, holding malt beverages for sale in interstate or foreign commerce or any person holding malt beverages for sale after shipment in interstate or foreign commerce.
(c)
Labeling requirements for malt beverages.
Subject to the jurisdictional limits of the FAA Act, as set forth in § 7.4, it is unlawful for any person engaged in business as a brewer, wholesaler, or importer of malt beverages, directly or indirectly, or through an affiliate, to sell or ship, or deliver for sale or shipment, or otherwise introduce or receive in interstate or foreign commerce, or remove from customs custody, any malt beverages in containers unless such containers are marked, branded, labeled, and packaged in conformity with the regulations in this part.
(d)
Labeled in accordance with this part.
In order to be labeled in accordance with the regulations in this part, a container of malt beverages must be in compliance with the following requirements:
(1) It must bear one or more labels meeting the standards for “labels” set forth in subpart D of this part;
(2) One or more of the labels on the container must include the mandatory information set forth in subpart E of this part;
(3) Claims on any label, container, or packaging (as defined in § 7.81) must comply with the rules for restricted label statements, as applicable, set forth in subpart F of this part;

(5) The class and type designation on any label, as well as any designation appearing on containers or packaging, must comply with the standards for classes and types set forth in subpart I of this part.
§ 7.4
Jurisdictional limits of the FAA Act.
(a)
Malt beverages sold in interstate or foreign commerce
—(1)
General.
The labeling provisions of this part apply to malt beverages sold or shipped or delivered for shipment, or otherwise introduced into or received in any State from any place outside thereof, only to the extent that the laws or regulations of such State impose requirements similar to the requirements of the regulations in this part, with respect to the labels and labeling of malt beverages not sold or shipped or delivered for shipment or otherwise introduced into or received in such State from any place outside thereof.
(2)
Similar State law.
For purposes of this section, a “similar” State law may be found in State laws or regulations that apply specifically to malt beverages or in State laws or regulations that provide general labeling requirements that are not specific to malt beverages but that do apply to malt beverages. In order to be “similar” to the Federal requirements, the State requirements need not be identical to the Federal requirements. Nonetheless, if the label in question does not violate the laws or regulations of the State or States into which the brewer, wholesaler, or importer is shipping the malt beverages, it does not violate this part.
(b)
Malt beverages not sold in interstate or foreign commerce.
The labeling regulations in this part do not apply to domestically bottled malt beverages that are not and will not be sold, or offered for sale, or shipped or delivered for shipment, or otherwise introduced in interstate or foreign commerce.
§ 7.5
Ingredients and processes.
(a)
Use of nonbeverage flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol.
(1) Nonbeverage flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol may be used in producing a malt beverage (sometimes referred to as a “flavored malt beverage”). Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no more than 49 percent of the overall alcohol content (determined without regard to any tolerance otherwise allowed by this part) of the finished product may be derived from the addition of nonbeverage flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol. For example, a finished malt beverage that contains 5.0 percent alcohol by volume must derive a minimum of 2.55 percent alcohol by volume from the fermentation of barley malt and other materials and may derive not more than 2.45 percent alcohol by volume from the addition of nonbeverage flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol.
(2) In the case of malt beverages with an alcohol content of more than 6 percent by volume (determined without regard to any tolerance otherwise allowed by this part), no more than 1.5 percent of the volume of the malt beverage may consist of alcohol derived from added nonbeverage flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol.
(b)
Processing.
Malt beverages may be filtered or otherwise processed in order to remove color, taste, aroma, bitterness, or other characteristics derived from fermentation.
§ 7.6
Brewery products not covered by this part.
Certain fermented products that are regulated as “beer” under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) do not fall within the definition of a “malt beverage” under the FAA Act and thus are not subject to this part. See § 7.7 for related TTB regulations that may apply to these products. See §§ 25.11 and 27.11 of this chapter for the definition of “beer” under the IRC.
(a)
Saké and similar products.
Saké and similar products (including products that fall within the definition of “beer” under parts 25 and 27 of this chapter) that fall within the definition of a “wine” under the FAA Act are covered by the labeling regulations for wine in 27 CFR part 4.
(b)
Other beers not made with both malted barley and hops.
The regulations
in this part do not cover beer products that are not made with both malted barley and hops, or their parts or their products, or that do not fall within the definition of a “malt beverage” under § 7.1 for any other reason. Bottlers and importers of alcohol beverages that do not fall within the definition of malt beverages, wine, or distilled spirits under the FAA Act should refer to the applicable labeling regulations for foods issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. See 21 CFR part 101.
§ 7.7
Other TTB labeling regulations that apply to malt beverages.
In addition to the regulations in this part, malt beverages must also comply with the following TTB labeling regulations:
(a)
Health warning statement.
Alcoholic beverages, including malt beverages, that contain at least 0.5 percent alcohol by volume, must be labeled with a health warning statement in accordance with the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1988 (ABLA). The regulations implementing the ABLA are contained in 27 CFR part 16.
(b)
Internal Revenue Code requirements.
The labeling and marking requirements for beer under the Internal Revenue Code are found in 27 CFR part 25, subpart J (for domestic breweries) and 27 CFR part 27, subpart E (for importers).
§ 7.8
Malt beverages for export.
The regulations in this part shall not apply to malt beverages exported in bond.
§ 7.9
[Reserved]
§ 7.10
Other related regulations.
(a)
TTB regulations.

(b)
Malt beverages shipped or sold in interstate commerce.
Persons bottling malt beverages (other than malt beverages in customs custody) for shipment, or delivery for sale or shipment, into a State (from outside of that State) are required to obtain a COLA covering those malt beverages only if the laws or regulations of the State require that all malt beverages sold or otherwise disposed of in such State be labeled in conformity with the requirements of subparts D through I of this part. This requirement applies when the State has either adopted subparts D through I of this part in their entireties or has adopted requirements that are identical in effect to those set forth in subparts D through I of this part. In accordance with §§ 7.3 and 7.4, malt beverages that are not subject to the COLA requirements of this section may still be subject to the substantive labeling provisions of subparts D through I of this part to the extent that the State into which the malt beverages are being shipped has similar State laws or regulations.
(c)
Products not shipped or sold in interstate commerce.
Persons bottling malt beverages that will not be shipped or delivered for sale or shipment in interstate or foreign commerce are not required to obtain a COLA or a certificate of exemption from label approval. (Note: A certificate of exemption from label approval is a certificate issued by TTB to cover a wine or distilled spirits product that will not be sold, offered for sale, shipped, delivered for shipment, or otherwise introduced, in interstate or foreign commerce.)
(d)
Evidence of COLA.
Upon request by the appropriate TTB officer, a bottler or importer must provide evidence of label approval for a label used on a container of malt beverages that is subject to the COLA requirements of this part. This requirement may be satisfied by providing original COLAs, photocopies, or electronic copies of COLAs, or records showing the TTB identification number assigned to the approved COLA.
§ 7.22
Rules regarding certificates of label approval (COLAs) for malt beverages bottled in the United States.
(a)
What a COLA authorizes.
An approved TTB Form 5100.31 authorizes the bottling of malt beverages covered by the certificate of label approval (COLA), as long as the container bears labels identical to the labels appearing on the face of the COLA, or labels with changes authorized by TTB on the COLA or otherwise, (such as through the issuance of public guidance available on the TTB website at
https://www.ttb.gov
).
(b)
When to obtain a COLA.
The COLA must be obtained prior to bottling. No brewer or wholesaler may bottle malt beverages or remove malt beverages
from the premises where bottled unless a COLA has been obtained.
(c)
Application for a COLA.
The bottler may apply for a COLA by submitting an application to TTB on Form 5100.31, in accordance with the instructions on the form. The bottler may apply for a COLA either electronically by accessing TTB's online system, COLAs Online, at
https://www.ttb.gov,
or by submitting the paper form. For procedures regarding the issuance of COLAs, see part 13 of this chapter.
§ 7.23
[Reserved]

# Requirements for Malt Beverages Imported in Containers
§ 7.24
Certificates of label approval (COLAs) for malt beverages imported in containers.
(a)
Application requirement.
Any person removing malt beverages in containers from customs custody for consumption must first apply for and obtain a certificate of label approval (COLA) covering the malt beverages from the appropriate TTB officer, or obtain authorization to use the COLA from the person to whom the COLA is issued.
(b)
Release of malt beverages from customs custody.
Malt beverages, imported in containers, are not eligible for release from customs custody for consumption, and no person may remove such malt beverages from customs custody for consumption, unless the person removing the malt beverages has obtained a COLA covering the malt beverages and is able to provide it (either electronically or on paper) upon request. Products imported under another person's COLA are eligible for release only if each bottle or individual container to be imported bears the name (or trade name) and address of the person to whom the COLA was issued by TTB, and only if the importer using the COLA to obtain release of a shipment can substantiate that the person to whom the COLA was issued has authorized its use by the importer.
(c)
Filing requirements.
If filing electronically, the importer must file with U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP), at the time of filing the customs entry, the TTB-assigned identification number of the valid COLA that corresponds to the label on the product or lot of malt beverages being imported. If the importer is not filing electronically, the importer must provide a copy of the COLA to CBP at the time of entry. In addition, the importer must provide a copy of the applicable COLA, and proof of the COLA holder's authorization if applicable, upon request by the appropriate TTB officer or a customs officer.
(d)
Evidence of COLA.
Upon request by the appropriate TTB officer, an importer must provide evidence of label approval for a label used on a container of malt beverages that is subject to the COLA requirements of this part. This requirement may be satisfied by providing original COLAs, photocopies, or electronic copies of COLAs, or records showing the TTB identification number assigned to the approved COLA.
(e)
Scope of this section.
The COLA requirement imposed by this section applies only to malt beverages that are removed for sale or any other commercial purpose. See 27 CFR 27.49, 27.74, and 27.75 for labeling exemptions applicable to certain imported samples of malt beverages.
(f)
Relabeling in customs custody.
Containers of malt beverages in customs custody that are required to be covered by a COLA but are not labeled in conformity with a COLA must be relabeled, under the supervision and direction of customs officers, prior to their removal from customs custody for consumption.
(g)
State law.
Paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section apply only if the laws or regulations of the State in which the malt beverages are withdrawn require that all malt beverages sold or otherwise disposed of in such State be labeled in conformity with the requirements of subparts D through I of this part. A State requires that malt beverages be labeled in conformity with the requirements of subparts D through I of this part when the State has either adopted subparts D through I of this part in their entireties or has adopted requirements identical in effect to those set forth in subparts D through I in this part. In accordance with §§ 7.3 and 7.4, malt beverages that
are not subject to the COLA requirements of this section may still be subject to the substantive labeling provisions of subparts D through I of this part to the extent that the State into which the malt beverages are being shipped has similar State law or regulation.
§ 7.25
Rules regarding certificates of label approval (COLAs) for malt beverages imported in containers.
(a)
What a COLA authorizes.
An approved TTB Form 5100.31 authorizes the use of the labels covered by the certificate of label approval (COLA) on containers of malt beverages, as long as the container bears labels identical to the labels appearing on the face of the COLA, or labels with changes authorized by the form or otherwise authorized by TTB (such as through the issuance of public guidance available on the TTB website at
https://www.ttb.gov
).
(b)
When to obtain a COLA.
The COLA must be obtained prior to the removal of malt beverages in containers from customs custody for consumption.
(c)
Application for a COLA.
The person responsible for the importation of malt beverages must obtain approval of the labels by submitting an application to TTB on Form 5100.31. A person may apply for a COLA either electronically by accessing TTB's online system, COLAs Online, at
https://www.ttb.gov

(b) A formula may be filed electronically by using Formulas Online, or it may be submitted on paper on TTB Form 5100.51. See § 7.11 for more information on forms and Formulas Online.
§ 7.29
Personalized labels.
(a)
General.
Applicants for label approval may obtain permission from TTB to make certain changes in order to personalize labels without having to resubmit labels for TTB approval. A personalized label is an alcohol beverage label that meets the minimum mandatory label requirements and is customized for customers. Personalized labels may contain a personal message, picture, or other artwork that is specific to the consumer who is purchasing the product. For example, a brewer may offer individual or corporate customers labels that commemorate an event such as a wedding or grand opening.
(b)
Application.
Any person who intends to offer personalized labels must submit a template for the personalized label as part of the application for label approval required under §§ 7.21 or 7.24, and must note on the application a description of the specific personalized information that may change.
(c)
Approval of personalized label.
If the application complies with the regulations, TTB will issue a certificate of label approval (COLA) with a qualification allowing the personalization of labels. The qualification will allow the certificate holder to add or change items on the personalized label such as salutations, names, graphics, artwork, congratulatory dates and names, or event dates without applying for a new COLA. All of these items on personalized labels must comply with the regulations of this part.
(d)
Changes not allowed to personalized labels.
Approval of an application to personalize labels does not authorize
the addition of any information that discusses either the alcohol beverage or characteristics of the alcohol beverage or that is inconsistent with or in violation of the provisions of this part or any other applicable provision of law or regulations.

# Subpart C—Alteration of Labels, Relabeling, and Adding Information to Containers
§ 7.41
Alteration of labels.
(a)
Prohibition.
It is unlawful for any person to alter, mutilate, destroy, obliterate or remove any mark, brand, or label on malt beverages in containers held for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or held for sale after shipment in interstate or foreign commerce, except as authorized by §§ 7.42, 7.43, or 7.44, or as otherwise authorized by Federal law.
(b)
Authorized relabeling.
For purposes of the relabeling activities authorized by this subpart, the term “relabel” includes the alteration, mutilation, destruction, obliteration, or removal of any existing mark, brand, or label on the container, as well as the addition of a new label (such as a sticker that adds information about the product or information engraved on the container) to the container, and the replacement of a label with a new label bearing identical information.
(c)
Obligation to comply with other requirements.
Authorization to relabel under this subpart:
(1) In no way authorizes the placement of labels on containers that do not accurately reflect the brand, bottler, identity, or other characteristics of the product;
(2) Does not relieve the person conducting the relabeling operations from any obligation to comply with the regulations in this part and with State or local law: and,
(3) Does not relieve the person conducting the relabeling operations from any obligation to obtain permission from the owner of the brand where otherwise required.
§ 7.42
Authorized relabeling activities by brewers and importers.
(a)
Relabeling at brewery premises.
A brewer may relabel domestically bottled malt beverages prior to removal from, and after return to bond at, the brewery premises, with labels covered by a certificate of label approval (COLA) without obtaining separate permission from TTB for the relabeling activity, provided that the brewer is the certificate holder (and bottler).
(b)
Relabeling after removal from brewery premises.
A brewer may relabel domestically bottled malt beverages (or direct the relabeling of such malt beverages by an authorized agent) after removal from brewery premises with labels covered by a COLA, without obtaining separate permission from TTB for the relabeling activity, provided that the brewer is the certificate holder (and bottler).
(c)
Relabeling in customs custody.
Under the supervision of U.S. customs officers, imported malt beverages in containers in customs custody may be relabeled without obtaining separate permission from TTB for the relabeling activity. Such containers must bear labels covered by a certificate of label approval (COLA) upon their removal from customs custody for consumption. See § 7.24(b).
(d)
Relabeling after removal from customs custody.
The importer of malt beverages in containers may relabel such malt beverages (or direct the relabeling of such malt beverages by an authorized agent) after removal from customs custody without obtaining separate permission from TTB for the relabeling activity, as long as the labels are covered by a COLA.
§ 7.43
Relabeling activities that require separate written authorization from TTB.
(a)
General.
Any permittee or brewer holding malt beverages for sale who needs to relabel the containers but is not the original bottler may apply for written permission for the relabeling of malt beverage containers. The appropriate TTB officer may permit relabeling of malt beverages in containers if the facts show that the relabeling is for the purpose of compliance with the requirements of this part or State law, or for the purpose of replacing damaged labels.
(b)
Application.
The written application must include:
(1) Copies of the original and proposed new labels;
(2) The circumstances of the request, including the reason for relabeling;
(3) The number of containers to be relabeled;

§ 7.44
Adding a label or other information to a container that identifies the wholesaler, retailer, or consumer.
Any label or other information that identifies the wholesaler, retailer, or consumer of the malt beverage may be added to containers (by the addition of stickers, engraving, stenciling, etc.) without prior approval from TTB and without being covered by a certificate of label approval. Such information may be added before or after the containers are removed from brewery premises or released from customs custody. The information added:
(a) May not violate the provisions of subparts F, G, and H of this part;
(b) May not contain any reference to the characteristics of the product; and
(c) May not be added to the container in such a way that it obscures any other label on the container.

# Subpart D—Label Standards
§ 7.51
Requirement for firmly affixed labels.
(a)

(c)
Contrasting background.
Mandatory information must appear in a color that contrasts with the background on which it appears, except that if the net contents or the name and address are blown into a glass container, they need not be contrasting. The color of the container and of the malt beverages must be taken into account if the label is transparent or if mandatory label information is etched, engraved, sandblasted, or otherwise
carved into the surface of the container or is branded, stenciled, painted, printed, or otherwise directly applied on to the surface of the container. Examples of acceptable contrasts are:
(1) Black lettering appearing on a white or cream background; or
(2) White or cream lettering appearing on a black background.
(d)
Capitalization.
Except for the aspartame statement when required by § 7.63(b)(4), which must appear in all capital letters, mandatory information may appear in all capital letters, in all lower case letters, or in mixed-case using both capital and lower-case letters.
§ 7.53
Type size of mandatory information and alcohol content statements.
(a) All capital and lowercase letters in statements of mandatory information on labels must meet the following type size requirements.
(1)

Malt beverages for consumption in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
Mandatory information may be stated solely in the Spanish language on labels of malt beverages bottled for consumption within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
§ 7.56
Additional information.

# Subpart E—Mandatory Label Information
§ 7.61
What constitutes a label for purposes of mandatory information.
(a)
Label.
Certain information, as outlined in § 7.63, must appear on a label. When used in this part for purposes of determining where mandatory information must appear, the term “label” includes:
(1) Material affixed to the container, whether made of paper, plastic, metal, or other matter;
(2) For purposes of the net contents statement and the name and address statement only, information blown, embossed, or molded into the container as part of the process of manufacturing the container;
(3) Information etched, engraved, sandblasted, or otherwise carved into the surface of the container;
(4) Information branded, stenciled, painted, printed, or otherwise directly applied on to the surface of the container; and
(5) Information on a keg collar or a tap cover of a keg, only if it includes mandatory information that is not repeated elsewhere on a label firmly affixed to the container and only if it meets the requirements of § 7.51.
(b)
Information appearing elsewhere on the container.
Information appearing on the following parts of the container is subject to all of the restrictions and prohibitions set forth in subparts F, G, and H of this part, but will not satisfy any requirements in this part for mandatory information that must appear on labels:
(1) Material affixed to, or information appearing on, the bottom surface of the container;
(2) Caps, corks, or other closures unless authorized to bear mandatory information by the appropriate TTB officer; and
(3) Foil or heat shrink bottle capsules.
(c)
Materials not firmly affixed to the container.
Any materials that accompany the container to the consumer but are not firmly affixed to the container, including booklets, leaflets, and hang tags, are not “labels” for purposes of this part. Such materials are instead subject to the advertising regulations in subpart N of this part.
§ 7.62
Packaging (cartons, coverings, and cases).
(a)
General.
The term “packaging” includes any covering, carton, case, carrier, or other packaging of malt beverage containers used for sale at retail, but does not include shipping cartons or cases that are not intended to accompany the container to the consumer.
(b)
Prohibition.
Any packaging of malt beverage containers may not contain any statement, design, device, or graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation that is prohibited on labels by regulations in subpart F, G, or H of this part.
(c)
Other information on packaging.
The following requirements apply to optional information on packaging.
(1) The packaging may display any information that is not in conflict with the labeling on the container or containers within the packaging.
(2) If the packaging displays a brand name, it must display the brand name in its entirety. For example, if a brand name is required to be modified with additional information on the container or containers within the packaging, the packaging must also display the same modifying language.
(3) If the packaging displays a class or type designation it must be identical to the class or type designation appearing on the container or containers within the packaging. For example, if the packaging displays a class or type designation for a specialty product for which a statement of composition is required on the container, the packaging must include the statement of composition as well.
(d)
Labeling of containers within the packaging.
The container or containers within the packaging are subject to all labeling requirements of this part, including mandatory labeling information requirements, regardless of whether the packaging bears such information.
§ 7.63
Mandatory label information.
(a)
Mandatory information.
Malt beverage containers must bear a label or labels (as defined in § 7.61(a)) containing the following information:
(1) Brand name, in accordance with § 7.64;
(2) Class, type, or other designation, in accordance with subpart I of this part;
(3) Alcohol content, in accordance with § 7.65, for malt beverages that contain any alcohol derived from added nonbeverage flavors or other added nonbeverage ingredients (other than hops extract) containing alcohol;
(4) Name and address of the bottler or importer (which may be blown, embossed, or molded into the container as
part of the process of manufacturing the container), in accordance with § 7.66, 7.67, or 7.68, as applicable; and
(5) Net contents (which may be blown, embossed, or molded into the container as part of the process of manufacturing the container), in accordance with § 7.70.
(b)
Disclosure of certain ingredients.
Certain ingredients must be declared on a label without the inclusion of any additional information as part of the statement as follows:
(1)
FD
C Yellow No. 5.
If a malt beverage contains the coloring material FD
C Yellow No. 5, the label must include a statement to that effect, such as “FD
C Yellow No. 5” or “Contains FD
C Yellow No. 5.”
(2)
Cochineal extract or carmine.
If a malt beverage contains the color additive cochineal extract or the color additive carmine, the label must include a statement to that effect, using the respective common or usual name (such as, “contains cochineal extract” or “contains carmine”). This requirement applies to labels when either of the coloring materials is used in a malt beverage that is removed from bottling premises or from customs custody on or after April 16, 2013.
(3)
Sulfites.
If a malt beverage contains 10 or more parts per million of sulfur dioxide or other sulfiting agent(s) measured as total sulfur dioxide, the label must include a statement to that effect. Examples of acceptable statements are “Contains sulfites” or “Contains (a) sulfiting agent(s)” or a statement identifying the specific sulfiting agent. The alternative terms “sulphites” or “sulphiting” may be used.
(4)
Aspartame.
If the malt beverage contains aspartame, the label must include the following statement, in capital letters, separate and apart from all other information: “PHENYLKETONURICS: CONTAINS PHENYLALANINE.”
§ 7.64
Brand name.
(a)
Requirement.
The malt beverage label must include a brand name. If the malt beverage is not sold under a brand name, then the name of the bottler or importer, as applicable, appearing in the name and address statement is treated as the brand name.
(b)
Misleading brand names.
Labels may not include any misleading brand names. A brand name is misleading if it creates (by itself or in association with other printed or graphic matter) any erroneous impression or inference as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of the malt beverage. A brand name that would otherwise be misleading may be qualified with the word “brand” or with some other qualification if the appropriate TTB officer determines that the qualification dispels any misleading impression that might otherwise be created.
§ 7.65
Alcohol content.
(a)
General.
Alcohol content and the percentage and quantity of the original gravity or extract may be stated on any malt beverage label, unless prohibited by State law. When alcohol content is stated, and the manner of statement is not required under State law, it must be stated as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
How the alcohol content must be expressed.
The following rules apply to both mandatory and optional statements of alcohol content.
(1) A statement of alcohol content must be expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume. Other truthful, accurate, and specific factual representations of alcohol content, such as alcohol by weight, may be made, as long as they appear together with, and as part of, the statement of alcohol content as a percentage of alcohol by volume.
(2) For malt beverages containing one half of one percent (0.5 percent) or more alcohol by volume, statements of alcohol content must be expressed to the nearest one-tenth of a percentage point, subject to the tolerance permitted by paragraph (c) of this section. For malt beverages containing less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume, alcohol content may be expressed either to the nearest one-tenth or the nearest one-hundredth of a percentage point, and such statements are not subject to any tolerance. See paragraph (e) of this section for the rules applicable to such statements.
(3)(i) The alcohol content statement must be expressed in one of the following formats:
(A) “Alcohol percent by volume”;
(B) “percent alcohol by volume”; or
(C) “Alcohol by volume: percent.”
(ii) Any of the words or symbols may be enclosed in parentheses and authorized abbreviations may be used with or without a period. The alcohol content statement does not have to appear with quotation marks.
(4) The statements listed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section must appear as shown, except that the following abbreviations may be used: Alcohol may be abbreviated as “alc”; percent may be represented by the percent symbol “%”; alcohol and volume may be separated by a slash “/” in lieu of the word “by”; and volume may be abbreviated as “vol”.
(5)
Examples.
The following are examples of alcohol content statements that comply with the requirements of this part:
(i) “4.2% alc/vol”;
(ii) “Alc. 4.0 percent by vol.”;
(iii) “Alc 4% by vol”; and
(iv) “5.9% Alcohol by Volume.”
(c)
Tolerances.
Except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section, a tolerance of 0.3 percentage points will be permitted, either above or below the stated alcohol content, for malt beverages containing 0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume. However, any malt beverage that is labeled as containing 0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume may not contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume, regardless of any tolerance. The tolerance provided by this paragraph does not apply in determining compliance with the provisions of § 7.5 regarding the percentage of alcohol derived from added nonbeverage flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol.
(d)
Low alcohol and reduced alcohol.
The terms “low alcohol” or “reduced alcohol” may be used only on labels of malt beverages containing less than 2.5 percent alcohol by volume. The actual alcohol content may not equal or exceed 2.5 percent alcohol by volume, regardless of any tolerance permitted by paragraph (c) of this section.
(e)
Non-alcoholic.
The term “non-alcoholic” may be used on labels of malt beverages only if the statement “contains less than 0.5 percent (or .5%) alcohol by volume” appears immediately adjacent to it, in readily legible printing, and on a completely contrasting background. No tolerances are permitted for malt beverages labeled as “non-alcoholic” and containing less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume. A malt beverage may not be labeled with an alcohol content of 0.0 percent alcohol by volume, unless it is also labeled as “alcohol free” in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, and contains no alcohol.
(f)
Alcohol free.
The term “alcohol free” may be used only on malt beverages containing no alcohol. No tolerances are permitted for “alcohol free” malt beverages.
§ 7.66
Name and address for domestically bottled malt beverages that were wholly fermented in the United States.
(a)
General.
Domestically bottled malt beverages that were wholly fermented in the United States and contain no imported malt beverages must be labeled in accordance with this section. (See §§ 7.67 and 7.68 for name and address requirements applicable to malt beverages that are not wholly fermented in the United States.)
(b)
Mandatory statement.
A label on the container must state the name and address of the bottler, in accordance with the rules set forth in this section.
(c)
Form of address.
The address consists of the city and State and must be consistent with the information reflected on the brewer's notice required under part 25 of this chapter. Addresses may, but are not required to, include additional information such as street names, counties, zip codes, phone numbers, and website addresses. The postal abbreviation of the State name may be used; for example, California may be abbreviated as CA.
(d)
Optional statements.
The bottler may, but is not required to, be identified by a phrase describing the function performed by that person, such as “bottled by,” “canned by,” “packed by,” or “filled by,” followed by the name and address of the bottler. If one
person performs more than one function, the label may so indicate (for example, “brewed and bottled by XYZ Brewery.”) If different functions are performed by more than one person, statements on the label may not create the misleading impression that the different functions were performed by the same person. The appropriate TTB officer may require specific information about the functions performed if necessary to prevent a misleading impression on the label.
(e)
Principal place of business.
The bottler's principal place of business may be shown in lieu of the actual place where the malt beverage was bottled if the address shown is a location where a bottling operation takes place. The appropriate TTB officer may disapprove the listing of a principal place of business if its use would create a false or misleading impression as to the geographic origin of the malt beverage. See 27 CFR 25.141 and 25.142 for coding requirements applicable in these circumstances.
(f)
Multiple breweries under the same ownership.
If two or more breweries are owned or operated by the same person, the place where the malt beverage is bottled within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section may be shown in one of the following two ways:
(1)
Listing of where bottled.
The place where the malt beverage is bottled may be shown as the only location on the label; or
(2)
Listing of all brewer's locations.
The place where the malt beverage is bottled may appear in a listing of the locations of breweries owned by that person if the place of bottling is not given less emphasis than any of the other locations. See 27 CFR 25.141 and 25.142 for coding requirements applicable in these circumstances.
(g)
Malt beverages bottled for another person.
(1) If malt beverages are bottled for another person, the label may state, in addition to (but not in lieu of) the name and address of the bottler, the name and address of such other person, immediately preceded by the words “brewed and bottled for” or “bottled for” or another similar appropriate phrase. Such statements must clearly indicate the relationship between the two persons (for example, contract brewing).
(2) If the same brand of malt beverage is brewed and bottled by two or more breweries that are not under the same ownership, the label for each brewery may set forth all the locations where bottling takes place, as long as the label uses the actual location (and not the principal place of business) and as long as the nature of the arrangement is clearly set forth.
(h)
Use of trade names.
The name of the person appearing on the label may be the trade name or the operating name, as long as it is identical to a trade or operating name appearing on the brewer's notice.
§ 7.67
Name and address for domestically bottled malt beverages that were bottled after importation.
(a)
General.
This section applies to domestically bottled malt beverages that were bottled after importation.

(b)
Malt beverages that were subject to blending or other production activities after importation.
Malt beverages that were subject, after importation, to blending or other production may not bear an “imported by” statement on the label, but must instead be labeled in accordance with the rules set forth in § 7.66 with regard to mandatory and optional labeling statements.
(c)
Malt beverages bottled after importation without blending or other production activities.
The label on malt beverages that are bottled without being subject to blending or other production activities in the United States after the malt beverages were imported must state the words “imported by” or a similar appropriate phrase, followed by the name and address of the importer. The label must also state the words “bottled by” or “packed by,” followed by the name and address of the bottler, except that the following phrases are acceptable in lieu of the name and address of the bottler under the circumstances set forth below:
(1) If the malt beverages were bottled for the person responsible for the importation, the words “imported and bottled (canned, packed or filled) in the United States for” (or a similar appropriate phrase) followed by the name and address of the principal place of business in the United States of the person responsible for the importation;
(2) If the malt beverages were bottled by the person responsible for the importation, the words “imported and bottled (canned, packed or filled) in the United States by” (or a similar appropriate phrase) followed by the name and address of the principal place of business in the United States of the person responsible for the importation;
(3) In the situations set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the address shown on the label may be that of the principal place of business of the importer who is also the bottler, provided that the address shown is a location where bottling takes place.
(d)

(1) For purposes of this section, the importer is the holder of the importer's basic permit that either makes the original customs entry or is the person for whom such entry is made, or the holder of the importer's basic permit that is the agent, distributor, or franchise holder for the particular brand of imported alcohol beverages and that places the order abroad.
(2) The address of the importer must be stated as the city and State of the principal place of business and must be consistent with the address reflected on the importer's basic permit. Addresses may, but are not required to, include additional information such as street names, counties, zip codes, phone numbers, and website addresses. The postal abbreviation of the State name may be used; for example, California may be abbreviated as CA.
§ 7.69
Country of origin.

(B) A food ingredient that is exempt from major food allergen labeling requirements pursuant to a petition for exemption approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(6) or pursuant to a notice submitted to the FDA under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(7), provided that the food ingredient meets the terms or conditions, if any, specified for that exemption.
(2)
Name of the food source from which each major food allergen is derived
means the name of the food as listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, except that:
(i) In the case of a tree nut, it means the name of the specific type of nut (for example, almonds, pecans, or walnuts);
(ii) In the case of Crustacean shellfish, it means the name of the species of Crustacean shellfish (for example, crab, lobster, or shrimp); and
(iii) The names “egg” and “peanuts,” as well as the names of the different types of tree nuts, may be expressed in either the singular or plural form, and the names “soy,” “soybean,” or “soya” may be used instead of “soybeans.”
(b)
Voluntary labeling standards.
Major food allergens used in the production of a malt beverage product may, on a voluntary basis, be declared on a label. However, if any one major food allergen is voluntarily declared, all major food allergens used in production of the malt beverage product, including major food allergens used as fining or processing agents, must be declared, except when covered by a petition for exemption approved by the appropriate TTB officer under § 7.83. The major food allergens declaration must consist of the word “Contains” followed by a colon and the name of the food source from which each major food allergen is derived (for example, “Contains: egg”).
(c)
Cross reference.
For mandatory labeling requirements applicable to malt beverage products containing FD
C Yellow No. 5, sulfites, aspartame, and cochineal extract or carmine, see § 7.63(b).
§ 7.83
Petitions for exemption from major food allergen labeling.
(a)
Submission of petition.
Any person may petition the appropriate TTB officer to exempt a particular product or class of products from the labeling requirements of § 7.82. The burden is on the petitioner to provide scientific evidence (as well as the analytical method used to produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the finished product or class of products, as derived by the method specified in the petition, either:
(1) Does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health; or
(2) Does not contain allergenic protein derived from one of the foods identified in § 7.82(a)(1)(i), even though a major food allergen was used in production.
(b)
Decision on petition.
TTB will approve or deny a petition for exemption submitted under paragraph (a) of this section in writing within 180 days of receipt of the petition. If TTB does not provide a written response to the petitioner within that 180-day period, the petition will be deemed denied unless an extension of time for decision is mutually agreed upon by the appropriate TTB officer and the petitioner. TTB may confer with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on petitions for exemption, as appropriate and as FDA resources permit. TTB may require the submission of product samples and other additional information in support of a petition; however, unless required by TTB, the submission of samples or additional information by the petitioner after submission of the petition will be treated as the withdrawal of the initial petition and the submission of a new petition. An approval or denial under this section will constitute final agency action.
(c)
Resubmission of a petition.
After a petition for exemption is denied under this section, the petitioner may resubmit the petition along with supporting materials for reconsideration at any time. TTB will treat this submission as a new petition.
(d)
Availability of information
—(1)
General.
TTB will promptly post to its website (
https://www.ttb.gov
) all petitions received under this section as well as TTB's responses to those petitions. Any information submitted in support of the petition that is not posted to the TTB website will be available to the public pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), except where a request for confidential treatment is granted under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Requests for confidential treatment of business information.
A person who provides trade secrets or other commercial or financial information in connection with a petition for exemption under this section may request that TTB give confidential treatment to that information. A failure to request confidential treatment at the time the information in question is submitted to TTB will constitute a waiver of confidential treatment. A request for confidential treatment of information under this section must conform to the following standards:
(i) The request must be in writing;
(ii) The request must clearly identify the information to be kept confidential;
(iii) The request must relate to information that constitutes trade secrets or other confidential, commercial, or financial information regarding the business transactions of an interested person, the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of that person;
(iv) The request must set forth the reasons why the information should not be disclosed, including the reasons the disclosure of the information would prejudice the competitive position of the interested person; and
(v) The request must be supported by a signed statement by the interested person, or by an authorized officer or employee of that person, certifying that the information in question is a trade secret or other confidential, commercial, or financial information and that the information is not already in the public domain.

§ 7.122
Misleading statements or representations.
(a)
General prohibition.
Malt beverage labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any statement or representation, irrespective of falsity, that is misleading to consumers as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of the malt beverage, or with regard to any other material factor.
(b)
Ways in which statements or representations may be found to be misleading.
(1) A statement or representation is prohibited, irrespective of falsity, if it directly creates a misleading impression or if it does so indirectly
through ambiguity, omission, inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific, or technical matter. For example, an otherwise truthful statement may be misleading because of the omission of material information, the disclosure of which is necessary to prevent the statement from being misleading.

§ 7.126
Depictions of government symbols.
Representations of the armed forces or flags.
Malt beverage labels, containers, or packaging may not show an image of any government's flag or any representation related to the armed forces of the United States if the representation, standing alone or considered together with any additional language or symbols on the label, creates a false or misleading impression that the product was endorsed by, made by, used by, or made under the supervision of the government represented by that flag or by the armed forces of the United States. This section does not prohibit the use of a flag as part of a claim of American origin or another country of origin.
§ 7.127
[Reserved]
§ 7.128
Claims related to distilled spirits.
(a)
General.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, containers of malt beverages, or any labels on such containers, or any carton, case, or individual covering of such containers, used for sale at retail, or any written, printed, graphic, or other material accompanying such containers to the consumer, must not contain any statement, design, device, or representation that tends to create a false or misleading impression that the malt beverage contains distilled spirits or is a distilled spirits product.

§ 7.129
Health-related statements.
(a)
Definitions.
When used in this section, the following terms have the meaning indicated:
(1)
Health-related statement
means any statement related to health (other than the warning statement required under part 16 of this chapter) and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, a malt beverage, or any substance found within the malt beverage product, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the alcohol beverage product, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (for example, statements of vitamin content). Numerical statements of the calorie, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content of the product do not constitute claims of nutritional value.
(2)
Specific health claim
means a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of malt beverages, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, and a disease or health-related condition.
(3)
Health-related directional statement
means a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption.
(b)
Rules for malt beverage labels, containers, and packaging
—(1)
Health-related statements.
In general, malt beverage labels, containers, or packaging may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement.
(2)
Specific health claims.
(i) TTB will consult with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as needed on the use of specific health claims on labels, containers, or packaging. If FDA determines that the use of such a claim is a drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, TTB will not approve the use of that specific health claim on the malt beverage label.
(ii) TTB will approve the use of a specific health claim on a malt beverage label only if the claim is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; is sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim.
(3)
Health-related directional statements.
A health-related directional statement is presumed misleading unless it:
(i) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption; and
(ii)(A) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons”; or
(B) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement some other
qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.
§ 7.130
Appearance of endorsement.
(a)
General.
Malt beverage labels, containers, or packaging may not include the name, or the simulation or abbreviation of the name, of any living individual of public prominence or an existing private or public organization, or any graphic, pictorial, or emblematic representation of the individual or organization if its use is likely to lead a consumer to falsely believe that the product has been endorsed, made, or used by, or produced for, or under the supervision of, or in accordance with the specifications of, such individual or organization. This section does not prohibit the use of such names where the individual or organization has provided authorization for their use.
(b)
Disclaimers.
Statements or other representations do not violate this section if, taken as a whole, they create no misleading impression as to an implied endorsement either because of the context in which they are presented or because of the use of an adequate disclaimer.
(c)
Exception.
This section does not apply to the use of the name of any person engaged in business as a producer, importer, bottler, packer, wholesaler, retailer, or warehouseman, of malt beverages. This section also does not apply to the use by any industry member of a trade or brand name that is the name of any living individual of public prominence, or existing private or public organization, provided such trade or brand name was used by the industry member or its predecessors in interest prior to August 29, 1935.

§ 7.132
[Reserved]

# Subpart I—Classes and Types of Malt Beverages
§ 7.141
Class and type.
(a)
Products known to the trade.
The class of the malt beverage must be stated on the label (see § 7.63). The type of the malt beverage may be stated, but is not required to appear on the label. Statements of class and type must conform to the designation of the product as known to the trade. All parts of the designation must appear together.
(b)
Malt beverage specialty products
—(1)
General.
A malt beverage specialty product is a malt beverage that does not fall under any of the class designations set forth in §§ 7.142 through 7.144 and is not known to the trade under a particular designation, usually because of the addition of ingredients such as colorings, flavorings, or food materials or the use of certain types of production processes where the appropriate TTB officer has not determined that such ingredients or processes are generally recognized as traditional in the production of a fermented beverage designated as “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” or “malt liquor.”
(2)
Designation.
A malt beverage specialty product must be designated with a distinctive or fanciful name, together with a statement of the composition of the product, in accordance with § 7.147. This statement will be considered the class designation for the purposes of this part. All parts of the designation must appear together.
§ 7.142
Class designations.
The following class designations may be used in accordance with this section:
(a) Any malt beverage, as defined in § 7.1, may be designated simply as a “malt beverage.”
(b)(1) The class designations “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” and “malt liquor” may be used to designate malt beverages that contain at least 0.5 percent alcohol by volume and that conform to the trade understanding of those designations. These designations may be preceded or followed by descriptions of the color of the product (such as “amber,” “brown,” “red,” or “golden”) as well as descriptive terms such as “dry,” “export,” “cream,” and “pale.”
(2) No product other than a malt beverage fermented at a comparatively high temperature, possessing the characteristics generally attributed to
“ale,” “porter,” or “stout” and produced without the use of coloring or flavoring materials (other than those recognized in standard brewing practices) may bear any of these class designations.
§ 7.143
Class and type—special rules.
The following special rules apply to specified class and type designations:
(a)
Reconstituted malt beverages.
Malt beverages that have been concentrated by the removal of water therefrom and reconstituted by the addition of water and carbon dioxide must for the purpose of this part be labeled in the same manner as malt beverages which have not been concentrated and reconstituted, except that there must appear immediately adjacent to, and as a part of, the class designation the statement “PRODUCED FROM____ __CONCENTRATE” (the blank to be filled in with the appropriate class designation). All parts of the class designation must appear in lettering of substantially the same size and kind. However, ice beers, described in paragraph (c) of this section, which are produced by the removal of less than 0.5 percent of the volume of the beer in the form of ice crystals and that retain beer character are not considered concentrated.
(b)
Half and half.
No product may be designated with the type designation “half and half” unless it is in fact composed of equal parts of two classes of malt beverages, the names of which are conspicuously stated immediately adjacent to the designation “half and half” (for example, “Half and Half, Porter and Stout”). This does not preclude the use of terms such as “half and half” as part of a distinctive or fanciful name that refers to flavors added to a malt beverage designated in accordance with trade understanding or with a statement of composition.
(c)
Ice beer.
Malt beverages supercooled during the brewing process to form ice crystals may be labeled with the type designation “ice” preceding the class designation (beer, ale, etc.).
(d)
Black and tan.
A product composed of two classes of malt beverages may be designated with the type designation “black and tan,” and the class and type designation is the names of the two classes of malt beverages in conjunction with “black and tan” (for example, “Black and Tan, Stout and Ale”).
(e)
Wheat beer.
Any “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” “malt liquor,” or other malt beverage made from a fermentable base that consists of at least 25 percent by weight malted wheat may be designated with the type designation “wheat” preceding the applicable class designation.
(f)
Rye beer.
Any “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” “malt liquor,” or other malt beverage made from a fermentable base that consists of at least 25 percent by weight malted rye may be designated with the type designation “rye” preceding the applicable class designation.
(g)
Barley wine ale.
The term “barley (or wheat or rye) wine ale” or “barley (or wheat or rye) wine style ale” may be used in accordance with trade understanding.
(h)
Malt beverages aged in barrels
—(1)
General.
Label designations for malt beverages aged in barrels or with woodchips, spirals, or staves derived from barrels may, but are not required to, include a description of how the product was aged. Thus, for example, acceptable designations for a standard beer aged in an oak barrel would include “beer,” “oak aged beer,” and “beer aged in an oak barrel.”
(2)
Barrels previously used in the production or storage of wine or distilled spirits.
Malt beverages aged in barrels previously used in the production or storage of wine or distilled spirits, or with woodchips, spirals, or staves derived from barrels previously used in the production or storage of wine or distilled spirits, or from woodchips previously used in the aging of distilled spirits or wine may, but are not required to, include a description of how the product was aged.
(i) Examples of acceptable designations for a standard beer aged in a wine barrel include “beer,” “beer aged in a wine barrel,” and “wine barrel aged beer.”
(ii) Examples of acceptable designations for an ale brewed with honey and aged in a bourbon barrel include “honey ale” and “bourbon barrel aged
honey ale” but not simply “ale” or “bourbon barrel aged ale.”
(3)
Misleading designations.
Designations that create a misleading impression as to the identity of the product by emphasizing certain words or terms are prohibited. As set forth in § 7.122, designations may not mislead consumers as to the age, origin, identity, or other characteristics of the malt beverage. Examples of designations that would be prohibited under this provision are “bourbon ale,” “bourbon-flavored lager,” “Chardonnay lager,” or “lager with whisky flavors.”
(i)
Other designations.
Other type designations (such as “milk” preceding the class designation “stout”) may be applied in conformance with trade understanding.
§ 7.144
Malt beverages fermented or flavored with certain traditional ingredients.
(a)
General.
Any malt beverage that has been fermented or flavored only with one or more ingredients (such as honey or certain fruits) that the appropriate TTB officer has determined are generally recognized as traditional ingredients in the production of a fermented beverage designated as “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” or “malt liquor” may be labeled in accordance with trade understanding following the rules set forth in this section.
(1) A list of such traditional ingredients may be found on the TTB website (
https://www.ttb.gov
).
(2) If the malt beverage has also been fermented or flavored with ingredients that the appropriate TTB officer has not determined are generally recognized as traditional ingredients in the production of a fermented beverage designated as “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” or “malt liquor,” it is a malt beverage specialty and must be labeled in accordance with the statement of composition rules in § 7.147.
(b)
Rules for designation.
(1) A designation in accordance with trade understanding must identify the base product, such as “malt beverage,” “beer,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” “lager,” or “malt liquor” along with a modifier or explanation that provides the consumer with adequate information about the fruit, honey, or other food ingredient used in production of the malt beverage. The label may include additional information about the production process (such as “beer fermented with cherry juice”).
(2) Where more than one exempted ingredient is included, a designation in accordance with trade understanding may identify each ingredient (such as “Ale with cherry juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg”), refer to the ingredients by category (such as “Fruit ale,” “Spiced ale,” or “Ale with natural flavors”), or simply include the ingredient or ingredients that the bottler or importer believes best identify the product (such as “Cherry ale,” “Cinnamon ale,” or “Nutmeg ale”). The designation must distinguish the product from a malt beverage, beer, ale, porter, stout, lager, or malt liquor that is not brewed or flavored with any of these ingredients; thus, unmodified designations such as “beer,” “stout,” or “ale” would not be acceptable.
(c)
Other requirements.
All parts of the designation must appear together and must be readily legible on a contrasting background. Designations that create a misleading impression as to the identity of the product by emphasizing certain words or terms are prohibited.
§ 7.145
Malt beverages containing less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume.
(a) Products containing less than 0.5 percent of alcohol by volume must bear the class designation “malt beverage,” “cereal beverage,” or “near beer.”
(b) If the designation “near beer” is used, both words must appear in the same size and style of type, in the same color of ink, and on the same background.
(c) No product containing less than 0.5 percent of alcohol by volume may bear the class designations “beer,” “lager beer,” “lager,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” or any other class or type designation commonly applied to malt beverages containing 0.5 percent or more of alcohol by volume.
§ 7.146
Geographical names.
(a) Geographical names for distinctive types of malt beverages (other
than names found under paragraph (b) of this section to have become generic) shall not be applied to malt beverages produced in any place other than the particular region indicated by the name unless:
(1) In direct conjunction with the name there appears the word “type” or the word “American”, or some other statement indicating the true place of production in lettering substantially as conspicuous as such name; and
(2) The malt beverages to which the name is applied conform to the type so designated. The following are examples of distinctive types of beer with geographical names that have not become generic; Dortmund, Dortmunder, Vienna, Wien, Wiener, Bavarian, Munich, Munchner, Salvator, Kulmbacher, Wurtzburger, Pilsen (Pilsener and Pilsner):
Provided,
That notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, beer which is produced in the United States may be designated as “Pilsen,” “Pilsener,” or “Pilsner” without further modification, if it conforms to such type.
(b) Only such geographical names for distinctive types of malt beverages as the appropriate TTB officer finds have by usage and common knowledge lost their geographical significance to such an extent that they have become generic shall be deemed to have become generic,
e.g.,
India Pale Ale.
(c) Except as provided in § 7.64(b), geographical names that are not names for distinctive types of malt beverages shall not be applied to malt beverages produced in any place other than the particular place or region indicated in the name.
§ 7.147
Statement of composition.
(a) A statement of composition is required to appear on the label for malt beverage specialty products, as defined in § 7.141(b), which are not known to the trade under a particular designation. For example, the addition of flavoring materials, colors, or artificial sweeteners may change the class and type of the malt beverage. The statement of composition along with a distinctive or fanciful name serves as the class and type designation for these products.
(b) When required by this part, a statement of composition must contain all of the following information, as applicable:
(1)
Identify the base class and/or type designation.
The statement of composition must clearly identify the base class and/or type designation of the malt beverage product (
e.g.,
“beer,” “lager beer,” “lager,” “ale,” “porter,” “stout,” or “malt beverage”).
(2)
Identify added flavoring material(s) used before, during, and after fermentation.
The statement of composition must disclose fermentable or non-fermentable flavoring materials added to the malt beverage base class.
(i) If the flavoring material is used before or during the fermentation process, the statement of composition must indicate that the malt beverage was fermented or brewed with the flavoring material (such as “Beer Fermented with grapefruit juice” or “Grapefruit Ale”). If the flavoring material is added after fermentation, the statement of composition must describe that process, using terms such as “added,” “with,” “infused,” or “flavored” (such as “Grapefruit-flavored ale.”).
(ii) If a single flavoring material is used in the production of the malt beverage product, the flavoring material may be specifically identified (such as “Ale Fermented with grapefruit juice”) or generally referenced (such as “Ale with natural flavor”). If two or more flavoring materials are used in the production of the malt beverage, each flavoring material may be specifically identified (such as “lemon juice, kiwi juice” or “lemon and kiwi juice”) or the characterizing flavoring material may be specifically identified and the remaining flavoring materials may be generally referenced (such as “kiwi and other natural and artificial flavor(s)”), or all flavors may be generally referenced (such as “with artificial flavors”).
(3)
Identify added coloring material(s).
The statement of composition must disclose the addition of coloring material(s), whether added directly or through flavoring material(s). The coloring materials may be identified specifically (such as “caramel color,” “FD
C Red #40,” “annatto,” etc.) or as a general statement, such as “Contains certified color” for colors approved
under 21 CFR subpart 74 or “artificially colored” to indicate the presence of any one or a combination of coloring material(s). However, FD
C Yellow No. 5, carmine, and cochineal extract require specific disclosure in accordance with § 7.63(b)(1) and (2) and that specific disclosure may appear either in the statement of composition or elsewhere in accordance with those sections.
(4)
Identify added artificial sweeteners.
The statement of composition must disclose any artificial sweetener that is added to a malt beverage product, whether the artificial sweetener is added directly or through flavoring material(s). The artificial sweetener may be identified specifically by either generic name or trademarked brand name, or as a general statement (such as “artificially sweetened”) to indicate the presence of any one or combination of artificial sweeteners. However, if aspartame is used, an additional warning statement is required in accordance with § 7.63(b)(4).

(a)
General prohibition.
An advertisement of malt beverages must not contain:
(1) Any statement that is false or untrue in any material particular, or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical matter, tends to create a misleading impression.
(2) Any false or misleading statement that explicitly or implicitly disparages a competitor's product. This does not prevent truthful and accurate comparisons between products (such as “Our
ale contains more hops than Brand X”) or statements of opinion (such as “We think our beer tastes better than any other beer on the market”).
(3) Any statement, design, device, or representation which is obscene or indecent.
(4) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.
(5) Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer. Money-back guarantees are not prohibited.
(6) [Reserved].
(7) [Reserved].
(8) Any statement, design, device, or representation that tends to create a false or misleading impression that the malt beverage contains distilled spirits or is a distilled spirits product. Advertisements may include the types of statements that are listed as being not prohibited on labels in § 7.128(b).
(b)
Statements inconsistent with labeling.
(1) Advertisements shall not contain any statement concerning a brand or lot of malt beverages that is inconsistent with any statement on the labeling thereof.

(2) No product other than a malt beverage fermented at comparatively high temperature, possessing the characteristics generally attributed to “ale,” “porter,” or “stout” and produced without the use of coloring or flavoring materials (other than those recognized in standard brewing practices) shall be designated in any advertisement by any of these class designations.
(e)
Health-related statements
—(1)
Definitions.
When used in this paragraph (e), terms are defined as follows:
(i)
Health-related statement
means any statement related to health and includes statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, and health benefits or effects on health. The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the malt beverage, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (
e.g.,
statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.
(ii)
Specific health claim
is a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the malt beverage, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, to a disease or health-related condition. Implied specific health claims include statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between malt beverages, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, and a disease or health-related condition.
(iii)
Health-related directional statement
is a type of health-related statement that directs or refers consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption.
(2)
Rules for advertising
—(i)
Health-related statements.
In general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer or some other qualifying statement to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must appear as prominent as the health-related statement.
(ii)
Specific health claims.
A specific health claim will not be considered misleading if it is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientific or medical evidence; sufficiently detailed and qualified with respect to the categories of individuals to whom the claim applies; adequately discloses the health risks associated with both moderate and heavier levels of alcohol consumption; and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any levels of alcohol consumption may cause health risks. This information must appear as part of the specific health claim and in a manner as prominent as the specific health claim.
(iii)
Health-related directional statements.
A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it—
(A) Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption; and
(B)(
1
) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, the following disclaimer: “This statement should not encourage you to drink or increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;” or
(
2
) Includes as part of the health-related directional statement, and in a manner as prominent as the health-related directional statement, some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.
(f)
Confusion of brands.
Two or more different brands or lots of malt beverages shall not be advertised in one advertisement (or in two or more advertisements in one issue of a periodical or a newspaper or in one piece of other written, printed, or graphic matter) if the advertisement tends to create the impression that representations made as to one brand or lot apply to the other or others, and if as to such latter the representations contravene any provision of this subpart or are in any respect untrue.
(g)
Representations of the armed forces or flags.
Advertisements may not show an image of any government's flag or any representation related to the armed forces of the United States if the representation, standing alone or considered together with any additional language or symbols, creates a false or misleading impression that the product was endorsed by, made by, used by, or made under the supervision of, the government represented by that flag or by the armed forces of the United States. This section does not prohibit the use of a flag as part of a claim of American origin or another country of origin.
(h)
Deceptive advertising techniques.
Subliminal or similar techniques are prohibited. “Subliminal or similar techniques,” as used in this part, refers to any device or technique that is used to convey, or attempts to convey, a message to a person by means of images or sounds of a very brief nature that cannot be perceived at a normal level of awareness.
(i)
Organic.
Any use of the term “organic” in the advertising of malt beverages must comply with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Organic Program rules, 7 CFR part 205, as interpreted by the USDA.
§ 7.236
Comparative advertising.
(a)
General.
Comparative advertising shall not be disparaging of a competitor's product in a manner that is false or misleading.
(b)
Taste tests.
(1) Taste test results may be used in advertisements comparing competitors' products unless they are disparaging in a false or misleading manner, deceptive, or likely to mislead the consumer.
(2) The taste test procedure used shall meet scientifically accepted procedures. An example of a scientifically accepted procedure is outlined in the Manual on Sensory Testing Methods, ASTM Special Technical Publication 434, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, ASTM, 1968, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 68-15545.
(3) A statement shall appear in the advertisement providing the name and address of the testing administrator.

# Subpart C—Prohibited Practices
§ 8.21
General.
It is unlawful for an industry member to require, by agreement or otherwise, that any retailer purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages from the industry member to the exclusion, in whole or in part, of products sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce. This prohibition includes purchases coerced by industry members, through acts or threats of physical or economic harm, as well as voluntary industry member-retailer purchase agreements.
§ 8.22
Contracts to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages.
Any contract or agreement, written or unwritten, which has the effect of requiring the retailer to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages from the industry member beyond a single sales transaction is prohibited. Examples of such contracts are:
(a) An advertising contract between an industry member and a retailer with the express or implied requirement of the purchase of the advertiser's products; or
(b) A sales contract awarded on a competitive bid basis which has the effect of prohibiting the retailer from purchasing from other industry members by:
(1) Requiring that for the period of the agreement, the retailer purchase a
product or line of products exclusively from the industry member; or
(2) Requiring that the retailer purchase a specific or minimum quantity during the period of the agreement.
§ 8.23
Third party arrangements.
Industry member requirements, by agreement or otherwise, with non-retailers which result in a retailer being required to purchase the industry member's products are within the exclusive outlet provisions. These industry member requirements are covered whether the agreement or other arrangement originates with the industry member or the third party. For example, a supplier enters into a contractual agreement or other arrangement with a third party. This agreement or arrangement contains an industry member requirement as described above. The third party, a ballclub, or municipal or private corporation, not acting as a retailer, leases the concession rights and is able to control the purchasing decisions of the retailer. The third party, as a result of the requirement, by agreement or otherwise, with the industry member, requires the retailer to purchase the industry member's products to the exclusion, in whole or in part, of products sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce. The business arrangements entered into by the industry member and the third party may consist of such things as sponsoring radio or television broadcasting, paying for advertising, or providing other services or things of value.

# Subpart D—Exclusion

# Source:
T.D. ATF-364, 60 FR 20425, Apr. 26, 1995, unless otherwise noted.
§ 8.51
Exclusion, in general.
(a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:
(1) When a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, or through an affiliate, places (or has the potential to place) retailer independence at risk by means of a tie or link between the industry member and retailer or by any other means of industry member control over the retailer, and
(2) Such practice results in the retailer purchasing less than it would have of a competitor's product.
(b) Section 8.52 lists practices that result in exclusion. Section 8.53 lists practices not resulting in exclusion. Section 8.54 lists the criteria used for determining whether other practices can put retailer independence at risk.
§ 8.52
Practices which result in exclusion.
The practices specified in this section result in exclusion under section 105(a) of the Act. The practices specified here are examples and do not constitute a complete list of such practices:
(a) Purchases of distilled spirits, wine or malt beverages by a retailer as a result, directly or indirectly, of a threat or act of physical or economic harm by the selling industry member.
(b) Contracts between an industry member and a retailer which require the retailer to purchase distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages from that industry member and expressly restrict the retailer from purchasing, in whole or in part, such products from another industry member.
§ 8.53
Practice not resulting in exclusion.
The practice specified in this section is deemed not to result in exclusion under section 105(a) of the Act: a supply contract for one year or less between the industry member and retailer under which the industry member agrees to sell distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages to the retailer on an “as needed” basis provided that the retailer is not required to purchase any minimum quantity of such product.
§ 8.54
Criteria for determining retailer independence.
The criteria specified in this section are indications that a particular practice, other than those in §§ 8.52 and 8.53, places retailer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of the criteria specified in this section in order to place retailer independence at risk.
(a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a retailer
to decide which products to purchase or the quantity in which to purchase them for sale to consumers.
(b) The industry member obligates the retailer to participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.
(c) The retailer has a continuing obligation to purchase or otherwise promote the industry member's product.
(d) The retailer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase of the industry member's products.
(e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day operations of the retailer. For example, the industry member controls the retailer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be displayed on the retailer's premises.
(f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all retailers in the local market on the same terms without business reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.

# Source:
T.D. TTB-90, 76 FR 3500, Jan. 20, 2011, unless otherwise noted.
§ 9.11
Submission of AVA petitions.
(a)
Procedure for petitioner.
Any person may submit an AVA petition to TTB to establish a grape-growing region as a new AVA, to change the boundary of an existing AVA, or to change the name of an existing AVA. The petitioner is responsible for including with the petition all of the information specified in § 9.12.

Nothing in this chapter shall, or shall be interpreted to, compel any Department of the Treasury official to proceed to rulemaking in response to a submitted petition.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1513-0127)
[T.D. TTB-90, 76 FR 3500, Jan. 20, 2011, as amended T.D. TTB-196, 89 FR 87936, Nov. 7, 2024
§ 9.12
AVA petition requirements.
(a)
Establishment of an AVA in general.
A petition for the establishment of a new AVA must include all of the evidentiary materials and other information specified in this section. The petition must contain sufficient information, data, and evidence such that no independent verification or research is required by TTB.
(1)
Name evidence.
The name identified for the proposed AVA must be currently and directly associated with an
area in which viticulture exists. All of the area within the proposed AVA boundary must be nationally or locally known by the name specified in the petition, although the use of that name may extend beyond the proposed AVA boundary. The name evidence must conform to the following rules:
(i)
Name usage.
The petition must completely explain, in narrative form, the manner in which the name is used for the area covered by the proposed AVA.
(ii)
Source of name and name evidence.
The name and the evidence in support of it must come from sources independent of the petitioner. Appropriate name evidence sources include, but are not limited to, historical and modern government or commercial maps, books, newspapers, magazines, tourist and other promotional materials, local business or school names, and road names. Whenever practicable, the petitioner must include with the petition copies of the name evidence materials, appropriately cross-referenced in the petition narrative. Although anecdotal information by itself is not sufficient, statements taken from local residents with knowledge of the name and its use may also be included to support other name evidence.
(2)
Boundary evidence.
The petition must explain in detail the basis for defining the boundary of the proposed AVA as set forth in the petition. This explanation must have reference to the name evidence and other distinguishing features information required under this section. In support of the proposed boundary, the petition must outline the commonalities or similarities within that boundary and must explain with specificity how those elements are different in the adjacent areas outside that boundary.
(3)
Distinguishing features.
The petition must provide, in narrative form, a description of the common or similar features of the proposed AVA affecting viticulture that make it distinctive. The petition must also explain with specificity in what way these features affect viticulture and how they are distinguished viticulturally from features associated with adjacent areas outside the proposed AVA boundary. For purposes of this section, information relating to distinguishing features affecting viticulture includes the following:
(i)
Climate.
Temperature, precipitation, wind, fog, solar orientation and radiation, and other climate information;
(ii)
Geology.
Underlying formations, landforms, and such geophysical events as earthquakes, eruptions, and major floods;
(iii)
Soils.
Soil series or phases of a soil series, denoting parent material, texture, slope, permeability, soil reaction, drainage, and fertility;
(iv)
Physical features.
Flat, hilly, or mountainous topography, geographical formations, bodies of water, watersheds, irrigation resources, and other physical features; and
(v)
Elevation.
Minimum and maximum elevations.
(4)
Maps and boundary description.
—(i)
Maps.
The petitioner must submit with the petition, in an appropriate scale, the U.S.G.S. map(s) showing the location of the proposed AVA. The exact boundary of the AVA must be prominently and clearly drawn on the maps without obscuring the underlying features that define the boundary line. U.S.G.S. maps may be obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey, Branch of Distribution. If the map name is not known, the petitioner may request a map index by State.
(ii)
Boundary description.
The petition must include a detailed narrative description of the proposed AVA boundary based on U.S.G.S. map markings. This description must have a specific beginning point, must proceed unbroken from that point in a clockwise direction, and must return to that beginning point to complete the boundary description. The boundary description must refer to easily discernable reference points on the U.S.G.S. maps. The proposed AVA boundary description may rely on any of the following map features:
(A) State, county, township, forest, and other political entity lines;
(B) Highways, roads (including unimproved roads), and trails;
(C) Contour or elevation lines;
(D) Natural geographical features, including rivers, streams, creeks, ridges, and marked elevation points (such as summits or benchmarks);
(E) Human-made features (such as bridges, buildings, windmills, or water tanks); and
(F) Straight lines between marked intersections, human-made features, or other map points.
(b)
AVAs within AVAs.
If the petition proposes the establishment of a new AVA entirely within, or overlapping, an existing AVA, the evidence submitted under paragraph (a) of this section must include information that both identifies the attributes of the proposed AVA that are consistent with the existing AVA and explains how the proposed AVA is sufficiently distinct from the existing AVA and therefore appropriate for separate recognition. If the petition proposes the establishment of a new AVA that is larger than, and encompasses, all of one or more existing AVAs, the evidence submitted under paragraph (a) of this section must include information addressing whether, and to what extent, the attributes of the proposed AVA are consistent with those of the existing AVA(s). In any case in which an AVA would be created entirely within another AVA, whether by the establishment of a new, larger AVA or by the establishment of a new AVA within an existing one, the petition must explain why establishment of the AVA is acceptable. When a smaller AVA has name recognition and features that so clearly distinguish it from a larger AVA that surrounds it, TTB may determine in the course of the rulemaking that it is not part of the larger AVA and that wine produced from grapes grown within the smaller AVA would not be entitled to use the name of the larger AVA as an appellation of origin or in a brand name.
(c)
Modification of an existing AVA
—(1)
Boundary change.
If a petition seeks to change the boundary of an existing AVA, the petitioner must include with the petition all relevant evidence and other information specified for a new AVA petition in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. This evidence or information must include, at a minimum, the following:
(i)
Name evidence.
If the proposed change involves an expansion of the existing boundary, the petition must show how the name of the existing AVA also applies to the expansion area. If the proposed change would result in a decrease in the size of an existing AVA, the petition must explain, if so, the extent to which the AVA name does not apply to the excluded area.
(ii)
Distinguishing features.
The petition must demonstrate that the area covered by the proposed change has, or does not have, distinguishing features affecting viticulture that are essentially the same as those of the existing AVA. If the proposed change involves an expansion of the existing AVA, the petition must demonstrate that the area covered by the expansion has the same distinguishing features as those of the existing AVA and has different features from those of the area outside the proposed, new boundary. If the proposed change would result in a decrease in the size of an existing AVA, the petition must explain how the distinguishing features of the excluded area are different from those within the boundary of the smaller AVA. In all cases the distinguishing features must affect viticulture.
(iii)
Boundary evidence and description.
The petition must explain how the boundary of the existing AVA was incorrectly or incompletely defined or is no longer accurate due to new evidence or changed circumstances, with reference to the name evidence and distinguishing features of the existing AVA and of the area affected by the proposed boundary change. The petition must include the appropriate U.S.G.S. maps with the proposed boundary change drawn on them and must provide a detailed narrative description of the changed boundary.
(2)
Name change.
If a petition seeks to change the name of an existing AVA, the petition must establish the suitability of that name change by providing the name evidence specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1513-0127)
[T.D. TTB-90, 76 FR 3500, Jan. 20, 2011, as amended by T.D. TTB-196 , 89 FR 87936, Nov. 6, 2024
§ 9.13
Initial processing of AVA petitions.
(a)
TTB notification to petitioner of petition receipt.
The appropriate TTB officer will acknowledge receipt of a submitted petition. This notification will be in a letter sent to the petitioner within 30 days of receipt of the petition.
(b)
Acceptance of a perfected petition or return of a deficient petition to the petitioner.
The appropriate TTB officer will perform an initial review of the petition to determine whether it is a perfected petition. If the petition is not perfected, the appropriate TTB officer will return it to the petitioner without prejudice to resubmission in perfected form. If the petition is perfected, TTB will decide whether to proceed with rulemaking under § 9.14 and will advise the petitioner in writing of that decision. If TTB decides to proceed with rulemaking, TTB will advise the petitioner of the date of receipt of the perfected petition. If TTB decides not to proceed with rulemaking, TTB will advise the petitioner of the reasons for that decision.
(c)
Notice of pending petition.
When a perfected petition is accepted for rulemaking, TTB will place a notice to that effect on the TTB Web site.
§ 9.14
AVA rulemaking process.
(a)
Notice of proposed rulemaking.
If TTB determines that rulemaking in response to a petition is appropriate, TTB will prepare and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the
Federal Register
to solicit public comments on the petitioned-for AVA action.
(b)
Final action.
Following the close of the NPRM comment period, TTB will review any submitted comments and any other available relevant information and will take one of the following actions:
(1) Prepare a final rule for publication in the
Federal Register
adopting the proposed AVA action, with or without changes;
(2) Prepare a notice for publication in the
Federal Register
withdrawing the proposal and setting forth the reasons for the withdrawal. Reasons for withdrawal of a proposal must include at least one of the following:
(i) The extent of viticulture within the proposed boundary is not sufficient to constitute a grape-growing region as specified in § 9.11(a); or
(ii) The name, boundary, or distinguishing features evidence does not meet the standards for such evidence set forth in § 9.12; or
(iii) The petitioned-for action would be inconsistent with one of the purposes of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act or any other Federal statute or regulation or would be otherwise contrary to the public interest;
(3) Prepare a new NPRM for publication in the
Federal Register
setting forth a modified AVA action for public comment; or
(4) Take any other action deemed appropriate by TTB as authorized by law.

(1) The beginning point is the intersection of Euclid Avenue and 24th Street on the Mt. Baldy, Calif. U.S.G.S. map;
(2) From the beginning point, the boundary follows 24th Street east for approximately 0.3 mile, until it reaches the intersection of 24th Street with two unnamed light-duty streets to the north;
(3) The boundary then diverges from 24th Street and goes straight north for approximately 0.3 mile, until it reaches the 2,000 foot contour line;
(4) The boundary then follows the 2,000 foot contour line in a generally easterly direction across the Cucamonga Peak, Calif., U.S.G.S. map and onto the Devore, Calif., U.S.G.S. map until it reaches Lytle Creek Wash;
(5) The boundary follows the intermittent stream in Lytle Creek Wash in a southeasterly direction to the end of the intermittent stream on the Devore, Calif., U.S.G.S. map;
(6) The boundary then continues through Lytle Creek Wash, proceeding southeast in a straight line from the end of the intermittent stream, across the southwest corner of the San Bernardino North, Calif., U.S.G.S. map and onto the San Bernardino, South, Calif., U.S.G.S. map, to the northernmost point of the flood control basin at the end of the Lytle Creek Wash, a distance of approximately 4.3 miles;
(7) The boundary then proceeds in a straight line south-southeast across the flood control basin to the point where Lytle Creek Channel exits the basin;
(8) The boundary continues along Lytle Creek Channel until it empties into Warm Creek;
(9) The boundary then follows Warm Creek until it meets the Santa Ana River;
(10) The boundary then follows the western edge of the Santa Ana River in a generally southwesterly direction until it meets the San Bernardino—Riverside County line;
(11) The boundary follows the county line west, crossing onto the Guasti, Calif., U.S.G.S. map, until it reaches the unnamed channel between Etiwanda and Mulberry Avenues (identified by the petitioner as Etiwanda Creek Channel);
(12) The boundary then follows Etiwanda Creek Channel in a southerly direction until it parallels Bain Street;
(13) The boundary then diverges from Etiwanda Creek Channel and follows Bain Street south until it ends at Limonite Avenue in the northeast corner of the Corona North, Calif., U.S.G.S. map;
(14) The boundary then continues south in a straight line until it reaches the northern shore of the Santa Ana River;
(15) The boundary then follows the north shore of the Santa Ana River until it intersects the 560 foot contour line in Section 1 T3S/R7W;
(16) The boundary then follows the 560′ contour line to the north of the Santa Ana River in a generally westerly direction until it reaches Euclid Avenue on the Prado Dam, Calif., U.S.G.S. map;
(17) The boundary then follows Euclid Avenue north to the point of beginning.
