(ii) Spray concentration for spot treatment shall be limited to a maximum of 0.5 percent of the active ingredient by weight. A course, low-pressure spray shall be used to avoid atomization or splashing of the spray.
(iii) Paint-on application for spot treatment shall be limited to a maximum of 2 percent of the active ingredient by weight.
(iv) Crack and crevice treatment shall be limited to a maximum of 2 percent of the active ingredient by weight. Equipment capable of delivering a pin-stream of insecticide shall be used.
(v) Application via adhesive strips shall contain a maximum of 10% by weight of the controlled-release product in food-handling establishments where food and food products are held, processed, prepared, or served. A maximum of 36 strips (or 5.15 grams of chlorpyrifos) is to be used per 100 square feet of floor space. The strips are not to be placed in exposed areas where direct contact with food, utensils, and food-contact surfaces would be likely to occur.
(vi) To assure safe use of the insecticide, its label and labeling shall conform to that registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and it shall be used in accordance with such label and labeling.
(3) A tolerance of 0.1 part per million is established for residues of chlorpyrifos, per se, in or on food commodities (other than those already covered by a higher tolerance as a result of use on growing crops) in food service establishments where food and food products are prepared and served, as a result of the application of chlorpyrifos in microencapsulated form.
(i) Application of a microencapsulated product shall be limited solely
to spot and/or crack and crevice treatment in food handling establishments where food and food products are prepared and served. All treatments shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid contamination of food or food contact surfaces.
(ii) Spray concentrations shall be limited to a maximum of 0.5 percent of the active ingredient by weight.
(iii) For crack and crevice treatment, equipment capable of delivering a pin stream of spray directly into cracks and crevices or capable of applying small amounts of insecticide into cracks and crevices shall be used.
(iv) For spot treatment, an individual spot shall not exceed 2 square feet.

(2) A tolerance of 0.05 ppm is established for residues of the insecticide cyfluthrin (cyano(4-fluoro-3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate; CAS Reg. No. 69359-37-5) in food commodities exposed to the insecticide during treatment of food-handling establishments where food and food products are held, processed, prepared, or served. Treatments may be made by general surface, spot, and/or crack and crevice applications.
(i) General surface treatments shall be limited to a maximum of 3.8 grams of active ingredient per 1,000 square feet, applying to walls, floors, and ceilings with a low-pressure system. Cover or remove all food processing and/or handling equipment during application. Do not apply directly to food products. Reapplications may be made at 10-day intervals.
(ii) Crack and crevice or spot treatments shall be limited to a maximum of 0.1 percent of the active ingredient weight, applied with a low-pressure system with a pinpoint or variable-pattern nozzle. Dust formulation shall be limited to a maximum of 0.1 percent of the active ingredient by weight, applied using a hand duster, power duster, or other equipment capable of applying dust insecticide directly into voids and cracks and crevices. Dust applications should be made in a manner to avoid deposits on exposed surfaces or introducing the material into the air. Cover exposed food or remove food from premises. Do not apply directly to food. Reapplications may be made at 10-day intervals.
(iii) To ensure safe use of the insecticide, its label and labeling shall conform to that registered by the Environmental Protection Agency, and it shall be used in accordance with such label and labeling.
(3) A tolerance of 0.05 part per million is established for residues of the insecticide cyfluthrin (cyano(4-fluoro-3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl-3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate; CAS Reg.
