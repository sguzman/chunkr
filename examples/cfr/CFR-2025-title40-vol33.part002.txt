(ii)
Hazard communication program.
Requirements as specified in § 721.72 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) (concentration set at 0.1 percent), (f), and (g)(5). The following statements shall appear on each label as specified in § 721.72(b) and the SDS as specified in § 721.72(c): Warnings. Exposure to diisocyanates may cause the following human health effects: Skin irritation and allergic reactions, respiratory irritation, respiratory sensitization, and lung toxicity; some diisocyanates also may cause cancer. The likelihood that these effects will occur depends on a number of factors; among them, the level of exposure, frequency of exposure, part of the body exposed, and sensitivity of the exposed individual. Symptoms of allergic reaction and respiratory sensitization include rashes, cough, shortness of breath, asthma, chest tightness and other breathing difficulties. There is uncertainty as to the mechanism by which sensitization occurs. In sensitized individuals, exposure to even small amounts of diisocyanates (below government-recommended workplace exposure levels) may cause allergic respiratory reactions like asthma and severe breathing difficulties. It is especially important to note that contact with skin may lead to respiratory sensitization or cause other allergic reactions. In some cases, the effects of diisocyanate exposure may be immediate and life-threatening; in others, the effects may be delayed and occur hours after the exposure has ended. Repeated or prolonged exposure to diisocyanates may also cause irritation to eyes, skin, respiratory tract and lungs, as well as adverse chronic lung effects, like decreased lung capacity and function. Individuals experiencing shortness of breath, tightness in the chest or other problems breathing should seek immediate medical attention. When using this substance the following protective measures should be used: In workplaces where individuals handle diisocyanates or coatings or other formulations that contain
them, an industrial hygiene and safety program should be operative. Important components of this program include: Hazard communication and training on safe handling practices; use of efficient and well-maintained application equipment, engineering controls and personal protective equipment; housekeeping procedures including spill prevention and cleanup practices; and, if feasible, means to measure airborne levels of polyisocyanates and diisocyanates. During spray applications, workers should take precautions to avoid breathing vapors, mists or aerosols. Inhalation exposures should be limited to
0.05 mg/m
3
as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) for combined polyisocyanates and diisocyanates. Engineering controls should serve as the first, most effective means of reducing airborne polyisocyanate and diisocyanate concentrations; an appropriate National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health/Mine Safety and Health Administration (NIOSH/MSHA) approved respirator should be used as a secondary tool to lower exposures. Currently, downdraft spray booths and high-volume low-pressure (HVLP) spray guns appear to offer the most efficient technology to reduce inhalation exposures; a maintenance program should always be used to ensure optimal operating efficiencies. To limit dermal contact, individuals should wear impermeable gloves, protective clothing and goggles or glasses with side shields.

(2) The significant new uses are:
(i)
Protection in the workplace.
Requirements as specified in § 721.63 (a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5)(iii), (a)(5)(iv), (a)(5)(v), (a)(5)(vi), (a)(6)(i), (b) (concentration set at 1.0 percent), and (c). The imperviousness of the gloves selected pursuant to (a)(2)(i) of this section must be demonstrated by actual testing under (a)(3)(i) of this section and not by manufacturer specifications. In addition, there must be no permeation of the chemical substance greater than 15 µg/day-cm
2
as a daily cumulative total when tested in accordance with the most current version of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F739 “Standard Test Method for Resistance of Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation by Liquids or Gases” or ASTM F1383 “Standard Test Method for Resistance of Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation by Liquids or Gases Under Conditions of Intermittent Contact.”
(A) For conditions of exposure which are intermittent, gloves may be tested in accordance with the most current version of ASTM F1383 “Standard Test Method for Resistance of Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation by Liquids or Gases Under Conditions of Intermittent Contact,” provided the contact time in testing is greater than or equal to the expected duration of dermal contact, and the purge time used in the testing is less than or equal to the expected duration of non-contact during the intermittent cycle of dermal exposure in the workplace. If ASTM F1383 is used for testing, the company must submit to the Agency a description of worker activities involving the chemical substance which includes daily frequencies and durations of potential worker exposures.
(B) The results of all glove permeation testing must be reported in accordance with the most current version of (ASTM) F1194 “Guide for Documenting the Results of Chemical Permeation Testing of Protective Clothing Materials.” The company must submit all test data to the Agency and must receive written Agency approval for each type of glove tested prior to use of such gloves. Gloves must be discarded and replaced with such frequency as to ensure that they will reliably provide an impervious barrier to the chemical substances under normal and expected conditions of exposure within the work area. Gloves that have been damaged or are defective shall not be used. For PMNs P-94-1871 through P-94-1874, EPA has approved North Safety Butyl Rubber gloves (32 mils thick). For P-93-204 and P-94-1870, EPA has approved North Safety Butyl Rubber gloves (32 mils thick) only if used in combination with a chemical-resistant glove that has been demonstrated (EPA review not required) impermeable to the solvent, e.g., North Silvershield gloves and North 4H gloves.
