EPA revised the nonattainment boundary in response to a court decision, which did not vacate any designations for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, but which remanded the designation for the identified county. Because this additional area is part of a previously designated nonattainment area, the implementation dates for the overall nonattainment area (
e.g.,
the August 3, 2021 attainment date) remain unchanged regardless of this later designation date.

The listed designation does not reflect EPA action under section 107(d)(4)(A). At the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments, Jefferson County, Ohio; Brooke County, West Virginia; and Hancock County, West Virginia, were designated Unclassifiable/attainment, by operation of law, under section 107(d)(1)(C) of the Clean Air Act. However, these States and EPA are reviewing whether to confirm or reverse that designation under the process set out under section 107(d)(4)(A) and will publish a separate notice to that effect.
