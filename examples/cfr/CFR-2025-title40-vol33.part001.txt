§ 721.11
Applicability determination when the specific chemical identity is confidential.
(a) A person who intends to manufacture or process a chemical substance which is subject to a significant new use rule in subpart E of this part may ask EPA whether the substance or a proposed use is subject to the requirements of this part if that substance is described by a generic chemical name or if the significant new use is confidential and therefore not described specifically in the rule. EPA will answer such an inquiry only if EPA determines that the person has a
bona fide
intent to manufacture or process the chemical substance for commercial purposes.
(b) To establish a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) or process a chemical substance, the person who proposes to manufacture (including import) or process the substance must submit the request to EPA via CDX. Prior to submission to EPA via CDX, such
bona fide
intents to manufacture (including import) or process must be generated and completed using e-PMN software. See 40 CFR 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to access the e-PMN software. A
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) or process must contain:
(1) The specific chemical identity of the chemical substance that the person intends to manufacture (including import) or process.
(2) A signed statement that the person intends to manufacture (including import) or process the chemical substance for commercial purposes.
(3) A description of the research and development activities conducted to date, and the purpose for which the person will manufacture (including import) or process the chemical substance.
(4) An elemental analysis.
(5) Either an X-ray diffraction pattern (for inorganic substances), a mass spectrum (for most other substances), or an infrared spectrum of the particular chemical substance, or, if such data do not resolve uncertainties with respect to the identity of the chemical substance, additional or alternative spectra or other data to identify the substance.
(c) If an importer or processor cannot provide all the information required in paragraph (b) of this section because it is claimed as confidential business information by the importer's or processor's manufacturer or supplier, the manufacturer or supplier may supply the information directly to EPA.
(d) EPA will review the information submitted by the manufacturer (including importer) or processor under paragraph (b) of this section to determine whether that person has shown a bona fide intent to manufacture (including import) or process the chemical substance.

§ 721.72
Hazard communication program.
Whenever a substance is identified in subpart E of this part as being subject to this section, a significant new use of that substance is any manner or method of manufacture (including import) or processing associated with any use of that substance without establishing a hazard communication program as described in this section. Paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section apply to SNURs issued July 5, 2022. Paragraphs (i) and (j) of his section apply to SNURs issued on or after July 5, 2022. Any person subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section have the option of following the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section or using the statements specified in paragraphs (g) or (h) of this section.
(a)
Written hazard communication program.
Each employer shall develop and implement a written hazard communication program for the substance in each workplace. The written program will, at a minimum, describe how the requirements of this section for labels, SDSs, and other forms of warning material will be satisfied. The employer must make the written hazard communication program available, upon request, to all employees, contractor employees, and their designated representatives. The employer may rely on an existing hazard communication program, including an existing program established under the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard in 29 CFR 1910.1200 of 2012 to comply with this paragraph provided that the existing hazard communication program satisfies the requirements of this paragraph. The written program shall include the following:
(1) A list of each substance identified in subpart E of this part as subject to this section known to be present in the work area. The list must be maintained in the work area and must use the identity provided on the appropriate SDS for each substance required under paragraph (c) of this section. The list may be compiled for the workplace or for individual work areas.
(2) The methods the employer will use to inform employees of the hazards of non-routine tasks involving the substance, for example, the cleaning of reactor vessels, and the hazards associated with the substance contained in unlabeled pipes in their work area.
(3) The methods the employer will use to inform contractors of the presence of the substance in the employer's workplace and of the provisions of this
part applicable to the substance if employees of the contractor work in the employer's workplace and are reasonably likely to be exposed to the substance while in the employer's workplace.
(b)
Labeling.
(1) Each employer shall ensure that each container of the substance in the workplace is labeled in accordance with this paragraph (b)(1).
(i) The label shall, at a minimum, contain the following information:
(A) A statement of health hazard(s) and precautionary measure(s) for the substance, if any, identified in subpart E of this part or by the employer.
(B) The identity by which the substance may be commonly recognized.
(C) A statement of environmental hazard(s) and precautionary measure(s) for the substance, if any, identified in subpart E of this part or by the employer.
(D) A statement of exposure and precautionary measure(s), if any, identified in subpart E of this part or by the employer.
(ii) The employer may use signs, placards, process sheets, batch tickets, operating procedures, or other such written materials in lieu of affixing labels to individual stationary process containers, as long as the alternative method identifies the containers to which it is applicable and conveys information specified by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any written materials must be readily accessible to the employees in their work areas throughout each work shift.
(iii) The employer need not label portable containers into which the substance is transferred from labeled containers, and which are intended only for the immediate use of the employee who performs the transfer.
(iv) The employer shall not remove or deface an existing label on incoming containers of the substance unless the container is immediately relabeled with the information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(2) Each employer shall ensure that each container of the substance leaving its workplace for distribution in commerce is labeled in accordance with this paragraph.
(i) The label shall, at a minimum, contain the following information:
(A) The information required under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(B) The name and address of the manufacturer or a responsible party who can provide additional information on the substance for hazard evaluation and any appropriate emergency procedures.
(ii) The label shall not conflict with the requirements of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (18 U.S.C. 1801 et. seq.) and regulations issued under that Act by the Department of Transportation.
(3) The label, or alternative forms of warning, shall be legible and prominently displayed.
(4) The label, or alternative forms of warning, shall be in English; however, the information may be repeated in other languages.
(5) If the label or alternative form of warning is to be applied to a mixture containing a substance identified in subpart E of this part as subject to this section in combination with another substance identified in subpart E of this part and/or a substance defined as a “hazardous chemical” under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200), the employer may prescribe on the label, SDS, or alternative form of warning, the measures to control worker exposure or environmental release which the employer determines provide the greatest degree of protection. However, should these control measures differ from the applicable measures required under subpart E of this part, the employer must seek a determination of equivalency for such alternative control measures pursuant to § 721.30 before prescribing them under this paragraph (b)(5).
(c)
Safety data sheets.
(1) Each employer must obtain or develop a SDS for the substance.
(2) Each SDS shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:
(i) The identity used on the container label of the substance under this section, and, if not claimed confidential, the chemical and common name of the substance. If the chemical and common name are claimed confidential, a generic chemical name must be used.
(ii) Physical and chemical characteristics of the substance known to the employer (such as vapor pressure, flash point).
(iii) The physical hazards of the substance known to the employer, including the potential for fire, explosion, and reactivity.
(iv) The potential human and environmental hazards as specified in subpart E of this part for the substance.

(vii) Precautionary measures to control worker exposure and/or environmental release identified in subpart E of this part for the substance, or alternative control measures which EPA has determined under § 721.30 provide substantially the same degree of protection as the identified control measures.
(viii) Any generally applicable precautions for safe handling and use of the substance which are known to the employer, including appropriate hygienic practices, protective measures during repair and maintenance of contaminated equipment, and procedures for response to spills and leaks.
(ix) Any generally applicable control measures which are known to the employer, such as appropriate engineering controls, work practices, or personal protective equipment.
(x) Emergency first aid procedures known to the employer.
(xi) The date of preparation of the SDS or of its last revision.
(xii) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual preparing or distributing the SDS, or a responsible party who can provide additional information on the substance for hazard evaluation and any appropriate emergency procedures.
(3) If no relevant information is found or known for any given category on the SDS, the employer must mark the SDS to indicate that no applicable information was found.
(4) Where multiple mixtures containing the substance have similar compositions (i.e., the chemical ingredients are essentially the same, but the specific composition varies from mixture to mixture) and similar hazards, the employer may prepare one SDS to apply to all of these multiple mixtures.
(5) If the employer becomes aware of any significant new information regarding the hazards of the substance or ways to protect against the hazards, this new information must be added to the SDS within 3 months from the time the employer becomes aware of the new information. If the substance is not currently being manufactured, processed, or used in the employer's workplace, the employer must add the new information to the SDS before the substance is reintroduced into the workplace.
(6) The employer must ensure that persons receiving the substance from the employer are provided an appropriate SDS with their initial shipment and with the first shipment after an SDS is revised. The employer may either provide the SDS with the shipped containers or send it to the person prior to or at the time of shipment.
(7) The employer must maintain a copy of the SDS in its workplace, and must ensure that it is readily accessible during each work shift to employees when they are in their work areas. (Easy and immediate electronic access and other alternatives to maintaining paper copies of the safety data sheets are permitted as long as complete and accurate versions of the SDS are available immediately to employees in each workplace by such options.)
(8) The SDS may be kept in any form, including as operating procedures, and may be designed to cover groups of substances in a work area where it may be more appropriate to address the potential hazards of a process rather than individual substances. However, in all cases, the required information must be provided for each substance and must be readily accessible during each work shift to employees when they are in their work areas.
(9) The SDS must be in English; however, the information may be repeated in other languages.
(d)

§ 721.90
Release to water.
Whenever a substance is identified in subpart E of this part as being subject to this section, a significant new use of the substance is:
(a) Any predictable or purposeful release of a manufacturing stream associated with any use of the substance, from any site:
(1) Into the waters of the United States.
(2) Into the waters of the United States without application of one or more of the following treatment technologies as specified in subpart E of this part either by the discharger or, in the case of a release through publicly-owned treatment works, by a combination of treatment by the discharger and the publicly-owned treatment works:
(i) Chemical precipitation and settling.
(ii) Biological treatment (activated sludge or equivalent) plus clarification.
(iii) Steam stripping.
(iv) Resin or activated carbon adsorption.
(v) Chemical destruction or conversion.
(vi) Primary wastewater treatment.
(3) Into the waters of the United States without primary wastewater treatment, and secondary wastewater treatment as defined in 40 CFR part 133.
(4) Into the waters of the United States if the quotient from the following formula:
ER25SE06.006
exceeds the level specified in subpart E of this part when calculated using the methods described in § 721.91. In lieu of calculating the above quotient, monitoring or alternative calculations may be used to predict the surface water concentration which will result from the intended release of the substance, if the monitoring procedures or calculations have been approved for such purpose by EPA. EPA will review and act on written requests to approve monitoring procedures or alternative calculations within 90 days after such requests are received. EPA will inform submitters of the disposition of such requests in writing, and will explain the reasons therefor when they are denied.
(b) Any predictable or purposeful release of a process stream containing the substance associated with any use of the substance from any site:
(1) Into the waters of the United States.
(2) Into the waters of the United States without application of one or more of the following treatment technologies as specified in subpart E of this part either by the discharger or, in the case of a release through publicly-owned treatment works, by a combination of treatment by the discharger and the publicly-owned treatment works:
(i) Chemical precipitation and settling.
(ii) Biological treatment (activated sludge or equivalent) plus clarification.
(iii) Steam stripping.
(iv) Resin or activated carbon adsorption.
(v) Chemical destruction or conversion.
(vi) Primary wastewater treatment.
(3) Into the waters of the United States without primary wastewater treatment, and secondary wastewater treatment as defined in 40 CFR part 133.
(4) Into the waters of the United States if the quotient from the following formula:
ER25SE06.006
exceeds the level specified in subpart E of this part when calculated using the methods described in § 721.91. In lieu of calculating the above quotient, monitoring or alternative calculations may be used to predict the surface water concentration which will result from the intended release of the substance, if the monitoring procedures or calculations have been approved for such purpose by EPA. EPA will review and act on written requests to approve monitoring procedures or alternative calculations within 90 days after such requests are received. EPA will inform submitters of the disposition of such requests in writing, and will explain the reasons therefor when they are denied.
(c) Any predictable or purposeful release of a use stream containing the substance associated with any use of the substance from any site:
(1) Into the waters of the United States.
(2) Into the waters of the United States without application of one or
more of the following treatment technologies as specified in subpart E of this part either by the discharger or, in the case of a release through publicly-owned treatment works, by a combination of treatment by the discharger and the publicly-owned treatment works:
(i) Chemical precipitation and settling.
(ii) Biological treatment (activated sludge or equivalent) plus clarification.
(iii) Steam stripping.
(iv) Resin or activated carbon adsorption.
(v) Chemical destruction or conversion.
(vi) Primary wastewater treatment.
(3) Into the waters of the United States without primary wastewater treatment, and secondary wastewater treatment as defined in 40 CFR part 133.

ER25SE06.006
exceeds the level specified in subpart E of this part, when calculated using the methods described in § 721.91. In lieu of calculating the above quotient, however, monitoring or alternative calculations may be used to predict the surface water concentration expected to result from intended release of the substance, if the monitoring procedures or calculations have been approved for such purpose by EPA. EPA will review and act on written requests to approve monitoring procedures or alternative calculations within 90 days after such requests are received. EPA will inform submitters of the disposition of such requests in writing, and will explain the reasons therefor when they are denied.
§ 721.91
Computation of estimated surface water concentrations: Instructions.
These instructions describe the use of the equation specified in § 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) to compute estimated surface water concentrations which will result from release of a substance identified in subpart E of this part. The equation shall be computed for each site using the stream flow rate appropriate for the site according to paragraph (b) of this section, and the highest number of kilograms calculated to be released for that site on a given day according to paragraph (a) of this section. Two variables shall be considered in computing the equation, the number of kilograms released, and receiving stream flow.
(a)
Number of kilograms released.
(1) To calculate the number of kilograms of substance to be released from manufacturing, processing, or use operations, as specified in the numerator of the equation, develop a process description diagram which describes each manufacturing, processing, or use operation involving the substance. The process description must include the major unit operation steps and chemical conversions. A unit operation is a functional step in a manufacturing, processing, or use operation where substances undergo chemical changes and/or changes in location, temperature, pressure, physical state, or similar characteristics. Include steps in which the substance is formulated into mixtures, suspensions, solutions, etc.
(2) Indicate on each diagram the entry point of all feedstocks (e.g., reactants, solvents, and catalysts) used in the operation. Identify each feedstock and specify its approximate weight regardless of whether the process is continuous or batch.
(3) Identify all release points from which the substance or wastes containing the substance will be released into air, land, or water. Indicate these release points on the diagram. Do not include accidental releases or fugitive emissions.
(4) For releases identified in the diagram that are destined for water, estimate the amount of substance that will be released before the substance enters control technology. The kilograms of
substance released may be estimated based on:
(i) The mass balance of the operation, i.e., totaling inputs and outputs, including wastes for each part of the process such that outputs equal inputs. The amount released to water may be the difference between the amount of the substance in the starting material (or formed in a reaction) minus the amount of waste material removed from each part of the process and not released to water and the amount of the substance in the final product.
(ii) Physical properties such as water solubility where a known volume of water being discharged is assumed to contain the substance at concentrations equal to its solubility in water. This approach is particularly useful where the waste stream results from separation of organic/water phases or filtration of the substance from an aqueous stream to be discharged.
(iii) Measurements of flow rates of the process/use stream and known concentrations of the substance in the stream.
(5) After releases of a substance to water are estimated for each operation on a site, total the releases of the substance to water from all operations at that site. The value (number of kilograms) specified in the numerator of the equation should reflect total kilograms of substance released to water per day from all operations at a single site.
(6) Use the highest expected daily release of the substance for each site.
(7) When a substance is designated in subpart E of this part with a specific control technology and a percentage removal of the substance from wastewater resulting from use of the specified control technology, you may subtract that percentage from the highest expected daily release if that control technology is applied.
(b)
Receiving stream flow.
(1) The receiving stream flow shall be expressed in million liters per day (MLD). The flow rate data to be used must be for the point of release on the water body that first receives release of the substance whether by direct discharge from a site, or by indirect discharge through a Publicly-Owned Treatment Works (POTW) for each site. The flow rate reported shall be the lowest 7-day average stream flow with a recurrence interval of 10 years (7-Q-10). If the 7-Q-10 flow rate is not available for the actual point of release, the stream flow rate should be used from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauging station that is nearest the point of release that is expected to have a flow rate less than or equal to the receiving stream flow at the point of release.
(2) Receiving stream flow data may be available from the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for the site or the POTW releasing the substance to surface water, from the NPDES permit-writing authority for the site or the POTW, or from USGS publications, such as the water-data report series.
(3) If receiving stream flow data are not available for a stream, either the value of 10 MLD or the daily flow of wastewater from the site or the POTW releasing the substance must be used as an assumed minimum stream flow. Similarly, if stream flow data are not available because the location of the point of release of the substance to surface water is a lake, estuary, bay, or ocean, then the flow rate to be used must be the daily flow of wastewater from the site or the POTW releasing the substance to surface water. Wastewater flow data may be available from the NPDES permit or NPDES authority for the site or the POTW releasing the substance to water.

[54 FR 31313, July 27, 1989, as amended at 87 FR 39769, July 5, 2022]
§ 721.125
Recordkeeping requirements.
At the time EPA adds a substance to subpart E of this part, EPA will specify appropriate recordkeeping requirements which correspond to the significant new use designations for the substance selected from subpart B of this part. Each manufacturer and processor of the substance shall maintain the records for 5 years from the date of their creation. In addition to the records specified in § 721.40, the records whose maintenance this section requires may include the following:
(a) Records documenting the manufacturing volume of the substance and the corresponding dates of manufacture.
(b) Records documenting volumes of the substance purchased in the United States by processors of the substance, names and addresses of suppliers, and corresponding dates of purchase.
(c) Records documenting the names and addresses (including shipment destination address, if different) of all persons outside the site of manufacture or processing to whom the manufacturer or processor directly sells or transfers the substance, the date of each sale or transfer, and the quantity of the substance sold or transferred on such date.
(d) Records documenting establishment and implementation of a program for the use of any applicable personal protective equipment required under § 721.63.
(e) Records documenting the determinations required by § 721.63(a)(3) that chemical protective clothing is impervious to the substance.
(f) Records documenting establishment and implementation of the hazard communication program required under § 721.72.

(h) Copies of safety data sheets required under § 721.72(c).
(i) Records documenting compliance with any applicable industrial, commercial, and consumer use limitations under § 721.80.
(j) Records documenting compliance with any applicable disposal requirements under § 721.85, including the method of disposal, location of disposal sites, dates of disposal, and volume of the substance disposed. Where the estimated disposal volume is not known to or reasonably ascertainable by the manufacturer or processor, that person must maintain other records which demonstrate establishment and implementation of a program that ensures compliance with any applicable disposal requirements.
(k) Records documenting establishment and implementation of procedures that ensure compliance with any applicable water discharge limitations under § 721.90.

Notification requirements for selected new chemical substances that have completed pre­manu­facture review.
(a)
Selection of substances.
In accordance with the expedited process specified in this section, EPA may issue significant new use notification and recordkeeping requirements for any new chemical substance for which a premanufacture notice has been submitted under part 720 of this chapter if EPA determines that activities other than those described in the premanufacture notice may result in significant changes in human exposure or environmental release levels and/or that concern exists about the substance's health or environmental effects.
(b)
Concern criteria.
EPA may determine that concern exists about a substance's health or environmental effects if EPA makes any one of the following findings:
(1)(i) The substance may cause carcinogenic effects because the substance:
(A) Has been shown by valid test data to cause carcinogenic effects in humans or in at least one species of laboratory animal.
(B) Has been shown to be a possible carcinogen based on the weight of the evidence in short-term tests indicative of the potential to cause carcinogenic effects.
(C) Is closely analogous, based on toxicologically relevant similarities in molecular structure and physical properties, to another substance that has been shown by test data to cause carcinogenic effects in humans or in at least one species of laboratory animal, provided that if there is more than one
such analogue, the greatest weight will be given to the relevant data for the most appropriate analogues.
(D) Is known or can reasonably be anticipated, based on valid scientific data or established scientific principles, to be metabolized in humans or transformed in the environment to a substance which may have the potential to cause carcinogenic effects under the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) of this section.
(ii) No substance may be regulated based on a finding under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless EPA has also made the finding under § 721.170(c)(2)(ii).

(3) The substance may cause serious chronic effects, serious acute effects, or developmentally toxic effects under reasonably anticipated conditions of exposure because the substance:
(i) Has been shown by valid test data to cause serious chronic effects, serious acute effects, or developmentally toxic effects in humans or in at least one species of laboratory animal at dose levels that could be of concern under reasonably anticipated conditions of exposure.
(ii) Is closely analogous, based on toxicologically relevant similarities in molecular structure and physical properties, to another chemical substance that has been shown by valid test data to cause serious chronic effects, serious acute effects, or developmentally toxic effects in humans or in at least one species of laboratory animal at dose levels that could be of concern under reasonably anticipated conditions of exposure, provided that if there is more than one such analogue, the greatest weight will be given to the relevant data for the most appropriate analogues.
(iii) Is known or can reasonably be anticipated, based on valid scientific data or established scientific principles, to be metabolized in humans or transformed in the environment to a substance which may have the potential to cause serious chronic effects, serious acute effects, or developmentally toxic effects under the criteria in paragraph (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section.
(iv) Has been shown to potentially cause developmentally toxic effects based on the weight of the evidence in short-term tests indicative of the potential to cause developmentally toxic effects.
(4) The substance may cause significant adverse environmental effects under reasonably anticipated conditions of release because the substance:
(i) Has been shown by valid test data to cause significant adverse environmental effects at dose levels that could be of concern under reasonably anticipated conditions of release.
(ii) Is closely analogous, based on toxicologically relevant similarities in molecular structure and physical properties, to another substance that has been shown by valid test data to cause significant adverse environmental effects at dose levels that could be of concern under reasonably anticipated conditions of release, provided that if there is more than one such analogue, the greatest weight will be given to the relevant data for the most appropriate analogues.
(iii) Has been determined, based on calculations using the substance's physical and chemical properties, to be potentially able to cause significant adverse environmental effects at dose levels that could be of concern under reasonably anticipated conditions of release.
(iv) Is known or can reasonably be anticipated, based on valid scientific data or established scientific principles, to be environmentally transformed to a substance which may have the potential to cause significant adverse environmental effects under the criteria in paragraph (b)(4) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section.
(5) Concern exists about the health or environmental effects of one or more
impurities or byproducts of the substance because the impurity or byproduct meets one or more of the criteria in paragraph (b) (1) through (4) of this section and either:
(i) The impurity or byproduct is a new chemical substance and may be present in concentrations that could cause adverse health or environmental effects under reasonably anticipated conditions of exposure or release.
(ii) Reasonably anticipated manufacture, processing, or use activities involving the substance for which a premanufacture notice has been submitted may result in significantly increased human exposure to or environmental release of the impurity or byproduct compared to exposure or release levels resulting from existing activities involving the impurity or byproduct.
(c)
Designation of requirements.
(1) When EPA decides to establish significant new use reporting requirements under this section, EPA may designate as a significant new use any one or more of the activities set forth in subpart B of this part. In addition, EPA may designate specific recordkeeping requirements described under subpart C of this part that are applicable to the substance.

If ASTM F1383 is used for testing, manufacturers, importers, and processors must submit to the Agency a description of worker activities involving the substance which includes daily frequencies and durations of potential worker exposures. The results of all glove permeation testing must be reported in accordance with the most current version of ASTM F1194 “Guide for Documenting the Results of Chemical Permeation Testing of Protective Clothing Materials.” Manufacturers, importers, and processors must submit all test data to the Agency and must receive written Agency approval for each type of glove tested prior to use of such gloves.
