# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# Appendix to 19 CFR Part 0—Treasury Department Order No. 100-16
Delegation from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Secretary of Homeland Security of general authority over Customs revenue functions vested in the Secretary of the Treasury as set forth in the Homeland Security Act of 2002.
Treasury Department, Washington, DC,
May 15, 2003.
By virtue of the authority vested in me as the Secretary of the Treasury, including the authority vested by 31 U.S.C. 321(b) and section 412 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-296) (Act), it is hereby ordered:
1. Consistent with the transfer of the functions, personnel, assets, and liabilities of the United States Customs Service to the Department of Homeland Security as set forth in section 403(1) of the Act, there is hereby delegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority related to the Customs revenue functions vested in the Secretary of the Treasury as set forth in sections 412 and 415 of the Act, subject to the following exceptions and to paragraph 6 of this Delegation of Authority:
(a)(i) The Secretary of the Treasury retains the sole authority to approve any regulations concerning import quotas or trade bans, user fees, marking, labeling, copyright and trademark enforcement, and the completion of entry or substance of entry summary including duty assessment and collection, classification, valuation, application of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedules, eligibility or requirements for preferential trade programs, and the establishment of recordkeeping requirements relating thereto. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of all regulations so approved to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance every six months.
(ii) The Secretary of the Treasury shall retain the authority to review, modify, or revoke any determination or ruling that falls within the criteria set forth in paragraph 1(a)(i), and that is under consideration pursuant to the procedures set forth in sections 516 and 625(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1516 and 1625(c)). The Secretary of Homeland Security periodically shall identify and describe for the Secretary of the Treasury such determinations and rulings that are under consideration under sections 516 and 625(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, in an appropriate and timely manner, with consultation as necessary, prior to the Secretary of Homeland Security's exercise of such authority. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of these identifications and descriptions so made to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance every six months. The Secretary of the Treasury shall list any case where Treasury modified or revoked such a determination or ruling.
(b) Paragraph 1(a) notwithstanding, if the Secretary of Homeland Security finds an overriding, immediate, and extraordinary security threat to public health and safety, the Secretary of Homeland Security may take action described in paragraph 1(a) without the prior approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. However, immediately after taking any such action, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall certify in writing to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance the specific reasons therefor. The action shall terminate within 14 days or as long as the overriding, immediate, and extraordinary security threat exists, whichever is shorter, unless the Secretary of the Treasury approves the continued action and provides notice of such approval to the Secretary of Homeland Security.
(c) The Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of the Customs Service (COAC) shall be jointly appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security. Meetings of COAC shall be presided over jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security. The COAC shall advise the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security jointly.
2. Any references in this Delegation of Authority to the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary of Homeland Security are deemed to include their respective delegees, if any.
3. This Delegation of Authority is not intended to create or confer any right, privilege, or benefit on any private person, including any person in litigation with the United States.
4. Treasury Order No. 165-09, “Maintenance of delegation in respect to general authority over Customs Revenue functions vested in the Secretary of the Treasury, as set forth and defined in the Homeland Security Act of 2002,” dated February 28, 2003, is rescinded. To the extent this Delegation of Authority
requires any revocation of any other prior Order or Directive of the Secretary of the Treasury, such prior Order or Directive is hereby revoked.
5. This Delegation of Authority is effective May 15, 2003. This Delegation is subject to review on May 14, 2004. By March 15, 2004, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance to discuss the upcoming review of this Delegation.
6. The Secretary of the Treasury reserves the right to rescind or modify this Delegation of Authority, promulgate regulations, or exercise authority at any time based upon the statutory authority reserved to the Secretary by the Act.
John W. Snow,
Secretary of the Treasury.

# Arrival and Entry of Vessels
§ 4.0
General definitions.
For the purposes of this part:
(a)
Vessel.
The word
vessel
includes every description of water craft or other contrivance used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, but does not include aircraft. (19 U.S.C. 1401.)
(b)
Vessel of the United States.
The term
vessel of the United States
means any vessel documented under the laws of the United States.
(c)
Documented.
The term
documented
vessel means a vessel for which a valid Certificate of Documentation, form CG 1270, issued by the U.S. Coast Guard is outstanding. Upon qualification and proper application to the appropriate Coast Guard office, the Certificate of Documentation may be endorsed with a: (1) Registry endorsement (generally, available to a vessel to be employed in foreign trade, trade with Guam, American Samoa, Wake, Midway, or Kingman Reef, and other employments for which another endorsement is not required), (2) coastwise endorsement (generally, entitles a vessel to employment in the coastwise trade, and other employments for which another endorsement is not required), (3) fishery endorsement (generally, subject to federal and state laws regulating the fisheries, entitles a vessel to fish within the Exclusive Economic Zone (16 U.S.C. 1811) and landward of that zone and to land its catch) or (4) recreational endorsement (entitles a vessel to recreational use only). Any other terminology used elsewhere in this part to describe the particular documentation of a vessel shall be read as synonymous with the applicable terminology contained in this paragraph. Generally, any vessel of at least 5 net tons and wholly owned by a United States citizen or citizens is eligible for documentation except that for a coastwise, or fisheries endorsement a vessel must also be built in the United States. Detailed Coast Guard regulations on documentation are set forth in Title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, § 67.01-67.45.
(d)
Noncontiguous territory of the United States.
The term
noncontiguous territory of the United States
includes all the island territories and possessions of the United States, but does not include the Canal Zone.
(e)
Citizen.
The word
citizen
is as defined by the U.S. Coast Guard for purposes of vessel documentation (see subpart 67.03 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations.)
(f)
Arrival of a vessel.
The phrase “arrival of a vessel” means that time when the vessel first comes to rest, whether at anchor or at a dock, in any harbor within the Customs territory of the U.S.
(g)
Departure of a vessel.
The phrase “departure of a vessel” means that time when the vessel gets under way on its outward voyage and proceeds on the voyage without thereafter coming to
rest in the harbor from which it is going.
[T.D. 69-266, 34 FR 20422, Dec. 31, 1969, as amended by T.D. 83-214, 48 FR 46511, Oct. 13, 1983; T.D. 93-78, 58 FR 50256, Sept. 27, 1993; T.D. 93-96, 58 FR 67315, Dec. 21, 1993; CBP Dec. 08-25, 73 FR 40725, July 16, 2008]
§ 4.1
Boarding of vessels.
(a) Every vessel arriving at a CBP port will be subject to such supervision while in port as the port director considers necessary. The port director may detail CBP officers to remain on board a vessel to secure enforcement of the requirements set forth in this part. CBP may determine to board as many vessels as considered necessary to ensure compliance with the laws it enforces.
1-27
[Reserved]
(b)(1) No person, with or without the consent of the master, except a pilot in connection with the navigation of the vessel, personnel from another vessel in connection with the navigation of an unmanned barge, an officer of CBP or the Coast Guard, an immigration or health officer, an inspector of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or an agent of the vessel or consular officer exclusively for purposes relating to customs formalities, shall go on board any vessel arriving from outside the customs territory of the United States without permission of the port director or the CBP officer in charge until the vessel has been taken in charge by a CBP officer.
(2) A person may leave the vessel for the purpose of reporting its arrival as required by law (see § 4.2), but no other person, except those designated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall leave any vessel arriving from outside the customs territory of the United States, with or without the consent of the master, without the permission of the port director or the CBP officer in charge until the vessel has been properly inspected by CBP and brought into the dock or anchorage at which cargo is to be unladen and until all passengers have been landed from the vessel (19 U.S.C. 1433).
(3) Every person permitted to go on board or to leave without the consent of a CBP officer under the provisions of this paragraph shall be subject to CBP and quarantine regulations.
(4) The master of any vessel shall not authorize the boarding or leaving of his vessel by any person in violation of this paragraph.
(c) Persons seeking to board an incoming vessel after it has been inspected by the quarantine authorities and taken in charge by a CBP officer must comply with any applicable Coast Guard regulations regarding the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC)/personal identification requirements as prescribed in 33 CFR 101.105 and 101.514-515.
(d) No person in charge of a tugboat, rowboat, or other vessel shall bring such conveyance alongside an incoming vessel heretofore described and put on board thereof any person, except as authorized by law or regulations.

§ 4.2
Reports of arrival of vessels.
(a) Upon arrival in any port or place within the U.S., including, for purposes of this section, the U.S. Virgin Islands, of any vessel from a foreign port or place, any foreign vessel from a port or place within the U.S., or any vessel of the U.S. carrying foreign merchandise for which entry has not been made, the master of the vessel must immediately report that arrival to the nearest CBP facility or other location designated by the port director. The report of arrival, except as supplemented in local instructions issued by the port director and made available to interested parties by posting in CBP offices, publication in a newspaper of general circulation, and other appropriate means, may be made by any means of communication to the port director or to a CBP officer assigned to board the vessel. The CBP officer may require the production of any documents or papers deemed necessary for the proper inspection/examination of the vessel, cargo, passenger, or crew.
(b) For purposes of this part, “foreign port or place” includes a hovering vessel, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1401(k), and any point in customs waters beyond the territorial sea or on the high seas at which a vessel arriving in a port or place in the U.S. has received merchandise.
(c) In the case of certain vessels arriving either in distress or for the limited purpose of taking on certain supplies and departing within a 24-hour time period without having landed or taken on any passengers or other merchandise (see section 441(4), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended), the report must be filed by either the master, owner, or agent, and must be in the form and give the information required by that statute, except that the report need not be under oath. A derelict vessel will be considered one in distress and any person bringing it into port must report its arrival.
(d) The report of baggage and merchandise required to be made by certain passenger vessels making three or more trips a week between U.S. and foreign ports and vessels used exclusively as ferryboats carrying passengers, baggage, or merchandise (see section 441(2), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended), is in addition to the required report of arrival, and must be made within 24 hours of arrival.
[T.D. 93-96, 58 FR 67315, Dec. 21, 1993, as amended by T.D. 94-44, 59 FR 23795, May 9, 1994; CBP Dec. 10-33, 75 FR 69585, Nov. 15, 2010]
§ 4.3
Vessels required to enter; place of entry.
(a)
Formal entry required.
Unless specifically excepted by law, within 48 hours after the arrival at any port or place in the United States, the following vessels are required to make formal entry:
(1) Any vessel from a foreign port or place;
(2) Any foreign vessel from a domestic port;
(3) Any vessel of the United States having foreign merchandise on board for which entry has not been made; or
(4) Any vessel which has visited a hovering vessel as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1401(k), or has delivered or received merchandise or passengers while outside the territorial sea.
(b)
Completion of entry.
(1) When vessel entry is to be made at the customhouse, either the master, licensed deck officer, or purser may appear in person during regular working hours to complete preliminary or formal vessel entry; or necessary documents properly executed by the master or other authorized officer may be delivered at the customhouse by the vessel agent or other personal representative of the master.
(2) The appropriate CBP port director may permit the entry of vessels to be accomplished at locations other than the customhouse, and services may be requested outside of normal business hours. CBP may take local resources into consideration in allowing formal entry to be transacted on board vessels or at other mutually convenient approved sites and times within or outside of port limits. When services are requested to be provided outside the limits of a CBP port, the appropriate port director to whom an application must be submitted is the director of the port located nearest to the point where the proposed services would be provided. That port director must be satisfied that the place designated for formal entry will be sufficiently under CBP control at the time of entry, and that the expenses incurred by CBP will be reimbursed as authorized. It may be required that advance notice of vessel arrival be given as a condition for granting requests for optional entry locations. A master, owner, or agent of a vessel who desires that entry be made at an optional location will file with the appropriate port director an application on CBP Form 3171 and a single entry or continuous bond on CBP Form 301 containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.64 of this chapter, in such amount as that port director deems appropriate but not less than $1,000. If the application is approved, the port director or a designated CBP officer will formally enter the vessel. Nothing in this paragraph relieves any person or vessel from any requirement as to how, when and where they are to report, be inspected or receive clearance from other
Federal agencies upon arrival in the United States.
[T.D. 00-4, 65 FR 2872, Jan. 19, 2000, as amended at CBP Dec. 10-33, 75 FR 69585, Nov. 15, 2010]
§ 4.3a
Penalties for violation of vessel reporting and entry requirements.
Violation of the arrival or entry reporting requirements provided for in this part may result in the master being liable for certain civil and criminal penalties, as provided under 19 U.S.C. 1436, in addition to other penalties applicable under other provisions of law. The penalties include civil monetary penalties for failure to report arrival or make entry, and any conveyance used in connection with any such violation is subject to seizure and forfeiture. Further, if any merchandise (other than sea stores or the equivalent for conveyances other than a vessel) is involved in the failure to report arrival or entry, additional penalties equal to the value of merchandise may be imposed, and the merchandise may be seized and forfeited unless properly entered by the importer or consignee. The criminal penalties, applicable upon conviction, include fines and imprisonment if the master intentionally commits any violation of these reporting and entry requirements or if prohibited merchandise is involved in the failure to report arrival or make entry.
[T.D. 93-96, 58 FR 67316, Dec. 21, 1993]
§ 4.4
Panama Canal; report of arrival required.
Vessels which merely transit the Panama Canal without transacting any business there shall be required to report their arrival because of such transit. The report of arrival shall be made in accordance with § 4.2(a).
[T.D. 79-276, 44 FR 61956, Oct. 29, 1979]
§ 4.5
Government vessels.
(a) No report of arrival or entry shall be required of any vessel owned by, or under the complete control and management of the United States or any of its agencies, if such vessel is manned wholly by members of the uniformed services of the United States, by personnel in the civil service of the United States, or by both, and is transporting only property of the United States or passengers traveling on official business of the United States, or it is ballast. In addition, any vessel chartered by, and transporting only cargo that is the property of, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) will be treated as a Government vessel for the purpose of being exempt from entry, where the DoD-chartered vessel is manned entirely by the civilian crew of the vessel carrier under contract to DoD. Notwithstanding § 4.60(b)(3) of this part, such DoD-chartered vessel is not exempt from vessel clearance requirements. However, if any cargo is on board, the master or commander of each such vessel arriving from abroad shall file a Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, or an equivalent form issued by the Department of Defense, in duplicate. The original of each Cargo Declaration or equivalent form required under this paragraph shall be filed with the port director within 48 hours after the arrival of the vessel. The other copy shall be made available for use by the discharging inspector at the pier. See § 148.73 of this chapter with respect to baggage on carriers operated by the Department of Defense.
(b) The arrival of every vessel owned or controlled and manned as described in paragraph (a) of this section but transporting other property or passengers, and every vessel so owned or controlled but not so manned, whether in ballast or transporting cargo or passengers, shall be reported in accordance with § 4.2 and the vessel shall be entered in accordance with § 4.9.
(c) Every vessel owned by, or under the complete control and management of, any foreign nation shall be exempt from or subject to the laws relating to report of arrival and entry under the same conditions as a vessel owned or controlled by the United States.
[28 FR 14596, Dec. 31, 1963, as amended by 39 FR 10897, Mar. 22, 1974; T.D. 83-213, 48 FR 46978, Oct. 17, 1983; CBP Dec. 03-32, 68 FR 68168, Dec. 5, 2003]
§ 4.6
Departure or unlading before report or entry.
(a) No vessel which has arrived within the limits of any Customs port from a foreign port or place shall depart or attempt to depart, except from stress
of weather or other necessity, without reporting and making entry as required in this part. These requirements shall not apply to vessels merely passing through waters within the limits of a Customs port in the ordinary course of a voyage.
(b) The “limits of any Customs port” as used herein are those described in § 101.3(b) of this chapter, including the marginal waters to the 3-mile limit on the seaboard and the waters to the boundary line on the northern and southern boundaries.
(c) Violation of this provision may result in the master being liable for certain civil penalties and the vessel to arrest and forfeiture, as provided under 19 U.S.C. 1436, in addition to other penalties applicable under other provisions of law.
[T.D. 93-96, 58 FR 67316, Dec. 21, 1993, as amended by T.D. 98-74, 63 FR 51287, Sept. 25, 1998]
§ 4.7
Inward foreign manifest; production on demand; contents and form; advance filing of cargo declaration.
(a) The master of every vessel arriving in the United States and required to make entry must have on board the vessel a manifest, as required by section 431, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1431), and by this section. The manifest must be legible and complete. If it is in a foreign language, an English translation must be furnished with the original and with any required copies. The required manifest consists of a Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, CBP Form 1300, and the following documents: (1) Cargo Declaration, CBP Form 1302, (2) Ship's Stores Declaration, CBP Form 1303, and (3) Crew's Effects Declaration, CBP Form 1304, to which are attached crewmembers' declarations on CBP Form 5129, if the articles will be landed in the United States. Unless the exception at 8 CFR 251.1(a)(6) applies and a paper form is submitted, the master must also electronically submit the data elements required on CBP Form I-418 via an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP, which will be considered part of the manifest. Any document which is not required may be omitted from the manifest provided the word “None” is inserted in items 16, 18, and/or 19 of the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, as appropriate. If a vessel arrives in ballast and therefore the Cargo Declaration is omitted, the legend “No merchandise on board” must be inserted in item 16 of the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement.
(b)(1) With the exception of any Cargo Declaration that has been filed in advance as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the original and one copy of the manifest must be ready for production on demand. The master shall deliver the original and one copy of the manifest to the CBP officer who shall first demand it. If the vessel is to proceed from the port of arrival to other United States ports with residue foreign cargo or passengers, an additional copy of the manifest shall be available for certification as a traveling manifest (see § 4.85). The port director may require an additional copy or additional copies of the manifest, but a reasonable time shall be allowed for the preparation of any copy which may be required in addition to the original and one copy.
(2) In addition to the vessel stow plan requirements pursuant to § 4.7c of this part and the container status message requirements pursuant to § 4.7d of this part, and with the exception of any bulk or authorized break bulk cargo as prescribed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) must receive from the incoming carrier, for any vessel covered under paragraph (a) of this section, the CBP-approved electronic equivalent of the vessel's Cargo Declaration (CBP Form 1302), 24 hours before the cargo is laden aboard the vessel at the foreign port (
see
§ 4.30(n)). The electronic cargo declaration information must be transmitted through the CBP Automated Manifest System (AMS) or any electronic data interchange system approved by CBP to replace the AMS system for this purpose. Any such system change will be announced by notice in the
Federal Register.
(3)(i) Where a non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC), as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, delivers cargo to the vessel carrier for lading aboard the vessel at the foreign
port, the NVOCC, if licensed by or registered with the Federal Maritime Commission and in possession of an International Carrier Bond containing the provisions of § 113.64 of this chapter, may electronically transmit the corresponding required cargo declaration information directly to CBP through the vessel AMS system (or other system approved by CBP for this purpose). The information must be received 24 or more hours before the related cargo is laden aboard the vessel at the foreign port (see § 113.64(c) of this chapter), as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section applicable to exempted bulk and break bulk cargo. In the alternative, the NVOCC must fully disclose and present the required cargo declaration information for the related cargo to the vessel carrier which is required to present this information to CBP, in accordance with this section, via the vessel AMS system (or other CBP-approved system).
(ii) A non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC) means a common carrier that does not operate the vessels by which the ocean transportation is provided, and is a shipper in its relationship with an ocean common carrier. The term “non-vessel operating common carrier” does not include freight forwarders as defined in part 112 of this chapter.
(iii) Where the party electronically presenting to CBP the cargo information required in § 4.7a(c)(4) receives any of this information from another party, CBP will take into consideration how, in accordance with ordinary commercial practices, the presenting party acquired such information, and whether and how the presenting party is able to verify this information. Where the presenting party is not reasonably able to verify such information, CBP will permit the party to electronically present the information on the basis of what the party reasonably believes to be true.
(4) Carriers of bulk cargo as specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section and carriers of break bulk cargo to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section are exempt, with respect only to the bulk or break bulk cargo being transported, from the requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section that an electronic cargo declaration be received by CBP 24 hours before such cargo is laden aboard the vessel at the foreign port. With respect to exempted carriers of bulk or break bulk cargo operating voyages to the United States, CBP must receive the electronic cargo declaration covering the bulk or break bulk cargo they are transporting 24 hours prior to the vessel's arrival in the United States (see § 4.30(n)). However, for any containerized or non-qualifying break bulk cargo these exempted carriers will be transporting, CBP must receive the electronic cargo declaration 24 hours in advance of loading.
(i) Bulk cargo is defined for purposes of this section as homogeneous cargo that is stowed loose in the hold and is not enclosed in any container such as a box, bale, bag, cask, or the like. Such cargo is also described as bulk freight. Specifically, bulk cargo is composed of either:
(A) Free flowing articles such as oil, grain, coal, ore, and the like, which can be pumped or run through a chute or handled by dumping; or
(B) Articles that require mechanical handling such as bricks, pig iron, lumber, steel beams, and the like.
(ii) A carrier of break bulk cargo may apply for an exemption from the filing requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this section with respect to the break bulk cargo it will be transporting. For purposes of this section, break bulk cargo is cargo that is not containerized, but which is otherwise packaged or bundled.
(A) To apply for an exemption, the carrier must submit a written request for exemption to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, National Targeting Center, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20229. Until an application for an exemption is granted, the carrier must comply with the 24 hour advance cargo declaration requirement set out in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The written request for exemption must clearly set forth information such that CBP may assess whether any security concerns exist, such as: The carrier's IRS number; the source, identity and means of the packaging or
bundling of the commodities being shipped; the ports of call, both foreign and domestic; the number of vessels the carrier uses to transport break bulk cargo, along with the names of these vessels and their International Maritime Organization numbers; and the list of the carrier's importers and shippers, identifying any who are members of C-TPAT (The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism).
(B) CBP will evaluate each application for an exemption on a case by case basis. If CBP, by written response, provides an exemption to a break bulk carrier, the exemption is only applicable under the circumstances clearly set forth in the application for exemption. If circumstances set forth in the approved application change, it will be necessary to submit a new application.
(C) CBP may rescind an exemption granted to a carrier at any time.
(c) No Passenger List or Crew List shall be required in the case of a vessel arriving from Canada, otherwise than by sea, at a port on the Great Lakes or their connecting or tributary waters.
(d)(1) The master or owner of—
(i) A vessel documented under the laws of the United States with a registry, coastwise license, or a vessel not so documented but intended to be employed in the foreign, or coastwise trade, or
(ii) A documented vessel with a fishery license endorsement which has a permit to touch and trade (see § 4.15) or a vessel with a fishery license endorsement lacking a permit to touch and trade but intended to engage in trade—
at the port of first arrival from a foreign country shall declare on CBP Form 226 any equipment, repair parts, or materials purchased for the vessel, or any expense for repairs incurred, outside the United States, within the purview of section 466, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1466). If no equipment, repair parts, or materials have been purchased, or repairs made, a declaration to that effect shall be made on CBP Form 226.
(2) If the vessel is at least 500 gross tons, the declaration shall include a statement that no work in the nature of a rebuilding or alteration which might give rise to a reasonable belief that the vessel may have been rebuilt within the meaning of the second proviso to section 27, Merchant Marine Act, 1920, as amended (46 U.S.C. 883), has been effected which has not been either previously reported or separately reported simultaneously with the filing of such declaration. The port director shall notify the U.S. Coast Guard vessel documentation officer at the home port of the vessel of any work in the nature of a rebuilding or alteration, including the construction of any major component of the hull or superstructure of the vessel, which comes to his attention unless the port director is satisfied that the owner of the vessel has filed an application for rebuilt determination as required by 46 CFR 67.27-3.
(3) The declaration shall be ready for production on demand for inspection and shall be presented as part of the original manifest when formal entry of the vessel is made.
(e)
Failure to provide manifest information; penalties/liquidated damages.
Any master who fails to provide manifest information as required by this section, or who presents or transmits electronically any document required by this section that is forged, altered or false, or who fails to present or transmit the information required by this section in a timely manner, may be liable for civil penalties as provided under 19 U.S.C. 1436, in addition to damages under the international carrier bond of $5,000 for each violation discovered. In addition, if any non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC) as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section elects to transmit cargo declaration information to CBP electronically and fails to do so in the manner and in the time period required by paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, or electronically transmits any false, forged or altered document, paper, cargo declaration information to CBP, such NVOCC may be liable for the payment of liquidated damages as provided in § 113.64(c) of this chapter, of $5,000 for each violation discovered.
(f)

The forms designated by § 4.7(a) as comprising the inward manifest shall be completed as follows:
(a)
Ship's Stores Declaration.
Articles to be retained aboard as sea or ship's stores shall be listed on the Ship's Stores Declaration, CBP Form 1303. Less than whole packages of sea or ship's stores may be described as “sundry small and broken stores.”
(b)
Crew's Effects Declaration. (CBP Form 1304).
(1) The declaration number of the Crew Member's Declaration, CBP Form 5129, prepared and signed by any officer or crewmember who intends to land articles in the United States, or the word “None,” shall be shown in item No. 7 on the Crew's Effects Declaration, CBP Form 1304 opposite the respective crewmember's name.
(2) For requirements concerning the preparation of CBP Form 5129, see subpart G of part 148 of this chapter.
(3) Any articles which are required to be manifested and are not manifested shall be subject to forfeiture and the master shall be subjected to a penalty equal to the value thereof, as provided in section 584, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.
(c)
Cargo Declaration.
(1) The Cargo Declaration (CBP Form 1302 submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(4) of this section) must list all the inward foreign cargo on board the vessel regardless of the U.S. port of discharge, and must separately list any other foreign cargo remaining on board (“FROB”). For the purposes of this part, “FROB” means cargo which is laden in a foreign port, is intended for discharge in a foreign port, and remains aboard a vessel during either direct or indirect stops at one or more intervening United States ports. The block designated “Arrival” at the top of the form shall be checked. The name of the shipper shall be set forth in the column calling for such information and on the same line where the bill of lading is listed for that shipper's merchandise. When more than one bill of lading is listed for merchandise from the same shipper, ditto marks or the word “ditto” may be used to indicate the same shipper. The cargo described in column Nos. 6 and 7, and either column No. 8
or
9, shall refer to the respective bills of lading. Either column No. 8
or
column No. 9 shall be used, as appropriate. The gross weight in column No. 8 shall be expressed in either pounds or kilograms. The measurement in column No. 9 shall be expressed according to the unit of measure specified in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202).
(2)(i) When inward foreign cargo is being shipped by container, each bill of lading shall be listed in the column headed “B/L Nr.” in numerical sequence according to the bill of lading number. The number of the container which contains the cargo covered by that bill of lading and the number of the container seal shall be listed in column No. 6 opposite the bill of lading number. The number of any other bill of lading for cargo in that container also shall be listed in column No. 6 immediately under the container and seal numbers. A description of the cargo shall be set forth in column No. 7 only if the covering bill of lading is listed in the column headed “B/L Nr.”
(ii) As an alternative to the procedure described in paragraph (i), a separate list of the bills of lading covering each container on the vessel may be submitted on CBP Form 1302 or on a separate sheet. If this procedure is used:
(A) Each container number shall be listed in alphanumeric sequence by port of discharge in column No. 6 of CBP Form 1302, or on the separate sheet; and
(B) The number of each bill of lading covering cargo in a particular container, identifying the port of lading, shall be listed opposite the number of the container with that cargo in the column headed “B/L Nr.” if CBP Form 1302 is used, or either opposite or under the number of the container if a separate sheet is used.
(iii) All bills of lading, whether issued by a carrier, freight forwarder, or other issuer, shall contain a unique identifier consisting of up to 16 characters in length. The unique bill of lading number will be composed of two elements. The first element will be the first four characters consisting of the carrier or issuer's four digit Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) assigned to the carrier in the National Motor Freight Traffic Association, Inc., Directory of Standard Multi-Modal Carrier and Tariff Agent Codes, applicable supplements thereto and reissues thereof. The second element may be up to 12 characters in length and may be either alpha and/or numeric. The unique identifier shall not be used by the carrier, freight forwarder or issuer for another bill of lading for a period of 3 years after issuance. CBP processing of the unique identifier will be limited to checking the validity of the Standard Carrier Alpha Codes (SCAC) and ensuring that the identifier has not been duplicated within a 3-year period. Carriers and broker/importers will be responsible for reconciliation of discrepancies between cargo declarations and entries. CBP will not perform any reconciliation except in a post-audit process.
(3) For shipment of containerized or palletized cargo, CBP officers shall accept a Cargo Declaration which indicates that it has been prepared on the basis of information furnished by the shipper. The use of words of qualification shall not limit the responsibility of a master to submit accurate Cargo Declarations or qualify the oath taken by the master as to the accuracy of his declaration.
(i) If Cargo Declaration covers only containerized or palletized cargo, the following statement may be placed on the declaration:
The information appearing on the declaration relating to the quantity and description of the cargo is in each instance based on the shipper's load and count. I have no knowledge or information which would lead me to believe or to suspect that the information furnished by the shipper is incomplete, inaccurate, or false in any way.
(ii) If the Cargo Declaration covers conventional cargo and containerized or palletized cargo, or both, the use of the abbreviation “SLAC” for “shipper's load and count,” or an appropriate abbreviation if similar words are used, is approved:
Provided,
That abbreviation is placed next to each containerized or palletized shipment on the declaration and the following statement is placed on the delaration:
The information appearing on this declaration relating to the quantity and description of cargo preceded by the abbreviation “SLAC” is in each instance based on the shipper's load and count. I have no information which would lead me to believe or to suspect that the information furnished by the shipper is incomplete, inaccurate, or false in any way.
(iii) The statements specified in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section shall be placed on the last page of the Cargo Declaration. Words similar to “the shipper's load and count” may be substituted for those words in the statements. Vague expressions such as “said to contain” or “accepted as containing” are not acceptable. The use of an asterisk or other character instead of appropriate abbreviations, such as “SLAC”, is not acceptable.
(4) In addition to the cargo declaration information required in paragraphs (c)(1)-(c)(3) of this section, for all inward foreign cargo, the Cargo Declaration, must state the following:
(i) The last foreign port before the vessel departs for the United States;
(ii) The carrier SCAC code (the unique Standard Carrier Alpha Code assigned for each carrier; see paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section);
(iii) The carrier-assigned voyage number;
(iv) The date the vessel is scheduled to arrive at the first U.S. port in CBP territory;
(v) The numbers and quantities from the carrier's ocean bills of lading, either master or house, as applicable (this means that the carrier must transmit the quantity of the lowest external packaging unit; containers and pallets are not acceptable manifested quantities; for example, a container containing 10 pallets with 200 cartons should be manifested as 200 cartons);
(vi) The first foreign port where the carrier takes possession of the cargo destined to the United States;
(vii) A precise description (or the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) numbers to the 6-digit level under which the cargo is classified if that information is received from the shipper) and weight of the cargo or, for a sealed container, the shipper's declared description and weight of the cargo. Generic descriptions, specifically those such as “FAK” (“freight of all kinds”), “general cargo”, and “STC” (“said to contain”) are not acceptable;
(viii) The shipper's complete name and address, or identification number, from all bills of lading. (At the master bill level, for consolidated shipments, the identity of the Non Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC), freight forwarder, container station or other carrier is sufficient; for non-consolidated shipments, and for each house bill in a consolidated shipment, the identity of the foreign vendor, supplier, manufacturer, or other similar party is acceptable (and the address of the foreign vendor, etc., must be a foreign address); by contrast, the identity of the carrier, NVOCC, freight forwarder or consolidator is not acceptable; the identification number will be a unique number assigned by CBP upon the implementation of the Automated Commercial Environment);
(ix) The complete name and address of the consignee, or identification number, from all bills of lading. (For consolidated shipments, at the master bill level, the NVOCC, freight forwarder, container station or other carrier may be listed as the consignee. For non-consolidated shipments, and for each house bill in a consolidated shipment, the consignee is the party to whom the cargo will be delivered in the United States, with the exception of “FROB” (foreign cargo remaining on board). However, in the case of cargo shipped “to order of [a named party],” the carrier must report this named “to order” party as the consignee; and, if there is any other commercial party listed in the bill of lading for delivery or contact purposes, the carrier must also report this other commercial party's identity and contact information (address) in the “Notify Party” field of the advance electronic data transmission to CBP, to the extent that the CBP-approved electronic data interchange system is capable of receiving this data. The identification number will be a unique number assigned by CBP upon implementation of the Automated Commercial Environment);
(x) The vessel name, country of documentation, and official vessel number. (The vessel number is the International Maritime Organization number assigned to the vessel);
(xi) The foreign port where the cargo is laden on board;
(xii) Internationally recognized hazardous material code when such materials are being shipped;
(xiii) Container numbers (for containerized shipments);
(xiv) The seal numbers for all seals affixed to containers; and
(xv) Date of departure from foreign, as reflected in the vessel log (this element relates to the departure of the vessel from the foreign port with respect to which the advance cargo declaration is filed (see § 4.7(b)(2) or § 4.7(b)(4)); the time frame for reporting this data element will be either:
(A) No later than 24 hours after departure from the foreign port of lading, for those vessels that will arrive in the United States more than 24 hours after sailing from that foreign port; or
(B) No later than the presentation of the permit to unlade (CBP Form 3171, or electronic equivalent), for those vessels that will arrive less than 24 hours after sailing from the foreign port of lading); and
(xvi) Time of departure from foreign, as reflected in the vessel log (see § 4.7a(c)(4)(xv) for the applicable foreign port and the time frame within which this data element must be reported to CBP).
(5) Unaccompanied baggage must be listed on CBP Form 1302, or transmitted via an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP.

Vessels seeking preliminary entry in advance of arrival must do so: By presenting to Customs the electronic equivalent of a complete CBP Form 1302 (Cargo Declaration), in the manner provided in § 4.7(b)(2) or (4), showing all cargo on board the vessel; and by presenting CBP Form 3171 electronically no less than 48 hours prior to vessel arrival. The CBP Form 3171 will also serve as notice of intended date of arrival. The port director may allow for the presentation of the CBP Form 1302 and CBP Form 3171 less than 48 hours prior to arrival in order to grant advanced preliminary entry if a vessel voyage takes less than 48 hours to complete from the last foreign port to the first U.S. port, or if other reasonable circumstances warrant. Preliminary entry granted in advance of arrival will become effective upon arrival at the port granting preliminary entry. Additionally, Customs must receive confirmation of a vessel's estimated time of arrival in a manner acceptable to the port director.

§ 4.9
Formal entry.
(a)
General.
Section 4.3 provides which vessels are subject to formal entry and where and when entry must be made. The formal entry of an American vessel is governed by section 434, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1434). The term “American vessel” means a vessel of the United States (see § 4.0(b)) as well as, when arriving by sea, a vessel entitled to be documented except for its size (see § 4.0(c)). The formal entry of a foreign vessel arriving within the limits of any CBP port is also governed by section 434, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1434). Alternatively, information necessary for formal entry may be transmitted electronically pursuant to a system authorized by CBP.
(b)
Procedures for American vessels.
Under certain circumstances, American vessels arriving in ports of the United States directly from other United States ports must make entry. Entry of such vessels is required when they have unentered foreign merchandise aboard. Report of arrival as provided in § 4.2 of this part, together with presenting a completed CBP Form 1300 (Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement), satisfies all entry requirements for the subject vessels.
(c)
Delivery of foreign vessel document.
The master of any foreign vessel will exhibit the vessel's document to the port director on or before the entry of the vessel. After the net tonnage has been noted, the document may be delivered to the consul of the nation to which such vessel belongs, in which event the vessel master will certify to the port director the fact of such delivery (see section 434, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1434), as applied through section 438, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1438)). If not delivered to the consul, the document will be deposited in the customhouse. Whether delivered to the foreign consul or deposited at the customhouse, the document will not be delivered to the master of the foreign vessel until clearance is granted under § 4.61. It will not be lawful for any foreign consul to deliver to the master of any foreign vessel the register, or document in lieu thereof, deposited with him in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1434 until such master will produce to him a clearance in due form from the director of the port where such vessel has been entered. Any consul violating the provisions of this section is liable to a fine of not more than $5,000 (section 438, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended; 19 U.S.C. 1438).
(d)
Failure to make required entry; penalties.
Any master who fails to make entry as required by this section or who presents or transmits electronically any document required by this section that is forged, altered, or false, may be liable for certain civil penalties as provided under 19 U.S.C. 1436, in addition to penalties applicable under other provisions of law. Further, any vessel used in connection with any
such violation is subject to seizure and forfeiture.

§ 4.10
Request for overtime services.
Request for overtime services in connection with entry or clearance of a vessel, including the boarding of a vessel in accordance with § 4.1 shall be made on Customs Form 3171. (See § 24.16 of this chapter regarding pleasure vessels.) Such request for overtime services must specify the nature of the services desired and the exact times when they will be needed, unless a term special license (unlimited or limited to the service requested) has been issued (see § 4.30(g)) and arrangements are made locally so that the proper Customs officer will be notified during official hours in advance of the rendering of the services as to the nature of the services desired and the exact times they will be needed. Such request shall not be approved (previously issued term special licenses shall be revoked) unless the carrier complies with the provisions of paragraphs (l) and (m) of § 4.30 regarding terminal facilities and employee lists, respectively, and the required cash deposit or bond, on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.64 of this chapter, has been received. Separate bonds shall be required if overtime services are requested by different principals.

§ 4.11
Sealing of stores.
Upon the arrival of a vessel from a foreign port, or a vessel engaged in the foreign trade from a domestic port, sea stores and ship's stores not required for immediate use or consumption on board while the vessel is in port and articles acquired abroad by officers and members of the crew, for which no permit to land has been issued, shall be placed under seal, unless the Customs officer is of the opinion that the circumstances do not require such action. Customs inspectors in charge of the vessel, from time to time, as in their judgment the necessity of the case requires, may issue stores from under seal for consumption on board the vessel by its passengers and crew. (See § 4.39.)
§ 4.12
Explanation of manifest discrepancy.
(a)(1) Vessel masters or agents shall notify the port director on Customs Form 5931 of shortages (merchandise manifested, but not found) or overages (merchandise found, but not manifested) of merchandise.
(2) Shortages shall be reported to the port direct by the master or agent of the vessel by endorsement on the importer's claim for shortage on Customs Form 5931 as provided for in § 158.3 of this chapter, or within 60 days after the date of entry of the vessel, whichever is later. Satisfactory evidence to support the claim of nonimportation or of proper disposition or other corrective action (see § 4.34) shall be obtained by the master or agent and shall be retained in the carrier's file for one year.
(3) Overages shall be reported to the port director within 60 days after the date of entry of the vessel by completion of a post entry or suitable explanation of corrective action (see § 4.34) on the Customs Form 5931.
(4) The port director shall immediately advise the master or agent of those discrepancies which are not reported by the master or agent. Notification may be in any appropriate manner, including the furnishing of a copy of Customs Form 5931 to the master or agent. The master or agent shall satisfactorily resolve the matter within 30 days after the date of such notification, or within 60 days after entry of the vessel, whichever is later.
(5) Unless the required notification and explanation is made timely and the port director is satisfied that the discrepancies resulted from clerical error or other mistake and that there has been no loss of revenue (and in the case of a discrepancy not initially reported by the master or agent that there was a valid reason for failing to so report), applicable penalties under section 584, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1584), shall be assessed (see § 162.31 of this chapter). For purposes of this section, the term “clerical error”
is defined as a non-negligent, inadvertent, or typographical mistake in the preparation, assembly, or submission (electronically or otherwise) of the manifest. However, repeated similar manifest discrepancies by the same parties may be deemed the result of negligence and not clerical error or other mistake. For the purpose of assessing applicable penalties, the value of the merchandise shall be determined as prescribed in § 162.43 of this chapter. The fact that the master or owner had no knowledge of a discrepancy shall not relieve him from the penalty.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a correction in the manifest shall not be required in the case of bulk merchandise if the port director is satisfied that the difference between the manifested quantity and the quantity unladen, whether the difference constitutes an overage or a shortage, is an ordinary and usual difference properly attributable to absorption of moisture, temperature, faulty weighing at the port of lading, or other similar reason. A correction in the manifest shall not be required because of discrepancies between marks or numbers on packages of merchandise and the marks or numbers for the same packages as shown on the manifest of the importing vessel when the quantity and description of the merchandise in such packages are correctly given.
(c) Manifest discrepancies (shortages and overages) of petroleum and petroleum products imported in bulk shall be reported on Customs Form 5931, if the discrepancy exceeds one percent.

§ 4.13
[Reserved]
§ 4.14
Equipment purchases for, and repairs to, American vessels.
(a)
General provisions and applicability
—(1)
General.
Under section 466, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1466), purchases for or repairs made to certain vessels while they are outside the United States are subject to declaration, entry, and payment of ad valorem duty. These requirements are effective upon the first arrival of affected vessels in the United States or Puerto Rico. The vessels subject to these requirements include those documented under the U.S. law for the foreign or coastwise trades, as well as those which were previously documented under the laws of some foreign nation or are undocumented at the time that foreign shipyard repairs are performed, but which exhibit an intent to engage in those trades under CBP interpretations. Duty is based on actual foreign cost. This includes the original foreign purchase price of articles that have been imported into the United States and are later sent abroad for use.
(2)
Expenditures not subject to declaration, entry, or duty.
The following vessel repair expenditures are not subject to declaration, entry, or duty:
(i) Expenditures made in American Samoa, the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands because they are considered to have been made in the United States;
(ii) Reimbursements paid to members of the regular crew of a vessel for labor expended in making repairs to vessels; and
(iii) The cost of equipment, repair parts, and materials that are installed on a vessel documented under the laws of the United States and engaged in the foreign or coasting trade, if the installation is done by members of the regular crew of such vessel while the vessel is on the high seas, in foreign waters, or in a foreign port, and does not involve foreign shipyard repairs by foreign labor.
(3)
Expenditures subject to declaration and entry but not duty.
Under separate provisions of law, the cost of labor performed, and of parts and materials produced and purchased in Israel are not subject to duty under the vessel repair statute. Additionally, expenditures made in Canada or in Mexico are not subject to any vessel repair duties. Furthermore, certain free trade agreements between the United States and other countries also may reduce the duties on vessel repair expenditures made in foreign countries that are parties to those agreements, although the final duty amount may depend on each
agreement's schedule for phasing in those reductions. In these situations and others where there is no liability for duty, it is still required, except as otherwise required by law, that all repairs and purchases be declared and entered.
(b)
Applicability to specific types of vessels
—(1)
Fishing vessels.
As provided in § 4.15, vessels documented under U.S. law with a fishery endorsement are subject to vessel repair duties for covered foreign expenditures. Undocumented American fishing vessels which are repaired, or for which parts, nets or equipment are purchased outside the U.S. are also liable for duty.
(2)
Government-owned or chartered vessels.
Vessels normally subject to the vessel repair statute because of documentation or intended use are not excused from duty liability merely because they are either owned or chartered by the U.S. Government.
(3)
Vessels continuously away for two years or longer
—(i)
Liability for expenditures throughout entire absence from U.S.
Vessels that continuously remain outside the United States for two years or longer are liable for duty on any fish nets and netting purchased at any time during the entire absence. Vessels designed and used primarily for transporting passengers or merchandise, which depart the United States for the sole purpose of obtaining equipment, parts, materials or repairs remain fully liable for duty regardless of the duration of their absence from the United States.
(ii)
Liability for expenditures made during first six months of absence.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, vessels that continuously remain outside the United States for two years or longer are liable for duty only on those expenditures which are made during the first six months of their absence. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section. However, even though some costs might not be dutiable because of the six-month rule, all repairs, materials, parts and equipment-related expenditures must be declared and entered.
(c)
Estimated duty deposit and bond requirements.
Generally, the person authorized to submit a vessel repair declaration and entry must either deposit or transmit estimated duties or produce evidence of a bond on CBP Form 301 at the first United States port of arrival before the vessel will be permitted to depart from that port. A continuous or single entry bond of sufficient value to cover all potential duty on the foreign repairs and purchases must be identified by surety, number and amount on the vessel repair declaration which is submitted at the port of first arrival. At the time the vessel repair entry is submitted by the vessel operator to the Vessel Repair Unit (VRU) as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, that same identifying information must be included on the entry form. Sufficiency of the amount of the bond is within the discretion of CBP at the arrival port with claims for reduction in duty liability necessarily being subject to full consideration of evidence by CBP. CBP officials at the port of arrival may consult the VRU as identified in paragraph (g) of this section or the staff of the Cargo Security, Carriers
Restricted Merchandise Branch, Office of Trade in CBP Headquarters in setting sufficient bond amounts. These duty, deposit, and bond requirements do not apply to vessels which are owned or chartered by the United States Government and are actually being operated by employees of an agency of the Government. If operated by a private party for a Federal agency under terms whereby that private party is liable under the contract for payment of the duty, there must be a deposit or a bond filed in an amount adequate to cover the estimated duty.
(d)
Declaration required.
When a vessel subject to this section first arrives in the United States following a foreign voyage, the owner, master, or authorized agent must submit a vessel repair declaration on CBP Form 226, a dual-use form used both for declaration and entry purposes, or must transmit its electronic equivalent. The declaration must be ready for presentation in the event that a CBP officer boards the vessel. If no foreign repair-related expenses were incurred, that fact must be reported either on the declaration form or by approved electronic means. The CBP port of arrival receiving either a positive or negative vessel repair declaration or electronic equivalent will immediately forward it to the VRU as
identified in paragraph (g) of this section.
(e)
Entry required.
The owner, master, or authorized representative of the owner of any vessel subject to this section for which a positive declaration has been filed must submit a vessel repair entry on CBP Form 226 or transmit its electronic equivalent. The entry must show all foreign voyage expenditures for equipment, parts of equipment, repair parts, materials and labor. The entry submission must indicate whether it provides a complete or incomplete account of covered expenditures. The entry must be presented or electronically transmitted by the vessel operator to the VRU as identified in paragraph (g) of this section, so that it is received within ten calendar days after arrival of the vessel. Claims for relief from duty should be made generally as part of the initial submission, and evidence must later be provided to support those claims. Failure to submit full supporting evidence of cost within stated time limits, including any extensions granted under this section, is considered to be a failure to enter.
(f)
Time limit for submitting evidence of cost.
A complete vessel repair entry must be supported by evidence showing the cost of each item entered. If the entry is incomplete when submitted, evidence to make it complete must be received by the VRU as identified in paragraph (g) of this section within 150 calendar days from the date of vessel arrival. That evidence must include the final cost of repairs. In the event that all final cost evidence is not furnished within 150 days, or is of doubtful authenticity, the VRU may refer the matter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to begin procedures to obtain the needed evidence. That agency may also investigate the reason for a failure to file or for an untimely submission. Unexplained or unjustified delays in providing CBP with sufficient information to properly determine duty may result in penalty action as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
(g)
Location and jurisdiction of vessel repair unit port of entry.
The VRU, located in New Orleans, Louisiana, processes vessel repair entries received from all United States ports of arrival.
(h)
Justifications for relief from duty.
Claims for relief from the assessment of vessel repair duties may be submitted to CBP. Relief may be sought under paragraphs (a), (d), (e), or (h) of the vessel repair statute (19 U.S.C. 1466(a), (d), (e), or (h)), each paragraph of which relates to a different type of claim as further specified in paragraphs (h)(1)-(h)(4) of this section.
(1)
Relief under 19 U.S.C. 1466(a).
Requests for relief from duty under 19 U.S.C. 1466(a) consist of claims that a foreign shipyard operation or expenditure is not considered to be a repair or purchase within the terms of the vessel repair statute or as determined under judicial or administrative interpretations. Example: a claim that the shipyard operation is a vessel modification.
(2)
Relief from duty under 19 U.S.C. 1466(d).
Requests for relief from duty under 19 U.S.C. 1466(d) consist of claims that a foreign shipyard operation or expenditure involves any of the following:
(i)
Stress of weather or other casualty.
Relief will be granted if good and sufficient evidence supports a finding that the vessel, while in the regular course of its voyage, was forced by stress of weather or other casualty, while outside the United States, to purchase such equipment or make those repairs as are necessary to secure the safety and seaworthiness of the vessel in order to enable it to reach its port of destination in the United States. For the purposes of this paragraph, a “casualty” does not include any purchase or repair made necessary by ordinary wear and tear, but does include the failure of a part to function if it is proven that the specific part was repaired, serviced, or replaced in the United States immediately before the start of the voyage in question, and then failed within six months of that date.
(ii)
U.S. parts installed by regular crew or residents.
Relief will be granted if equipment, parts of equipment, repair parts, or materials used on a vessel were manufactured or produced in the United States and were purchased in the United States by the owner of the vessel. It is required under the statute
that residents of the United States or members of the regular crew of the vessel perform any necessary labor in connection with such installations.
(iii)
Dunnage.
Relief will be granted if any equipment, equipment parts, materials, or labor were used for the purpose of providing dunnage for the packing or shoring of cargo, for erecting temporary bulkheads or other similar devices for the control of bulk cargo, or for temporarily preparing tanks for carrying liquid cargoes.
(3)
Relief under 19 U.S.C. 1466(e).
Requests for relief from duty under 19 U.S.C. 1466(e) relate in pertinent part to matters involving vessels normally subject to the vessel repair statute, but that continuously remain outside the United States for two years or longer. Vessels that continuously remain outside the United States for two years or longer may qualify for relief from duty on expenditures made later than the first six months of their absence. See paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Relief under 19 U.S.C. 1466(h).
Requests for relief from duty under 19 U.S.C. 1466(h) consist of claims that a foreign shipyard operation or expenditure involves any of the following:
(i)
Expenditures on LASH barges.
Relief will be granted with respect to the cost of equipment, parts, materials, or repair labor for Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH) operations accomplished abroad.
(ii)
Certain spare repair parts or materials.
Relief will be granted with respect to the cost of spare repair parts or materials which are certified by the vessel owner or master to be for use on a cargo vessel, but only if duty was previously paid under the appropriate commodity classification(s) as found in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States when the article first entered the United States.
(iii)
Certain spare parts necessarily installed on a vessel prior to their first entry into the United States.
Relief will be granted with respect to the cost of spare parts only, which have been necessarily installed prior to their first entry into the United States with duty payment under the appropriate commodity classification(s) as found in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.
(i)
General procedures for seeking relief
—(1)
Applications for Relief.
Relief from the assessment of vessel repair duty will not be granted unless an Application for Relief is filed with CBP. Relief will not be granted based merely upon a claim for relief made at the time of entry under paragraph (e) of this section. If relief is sought, an Application is not required to be presented in any particular format, but it must clearly present the legal basis for granting relief, as specified in paragraph (h) of this section. An Application must also state that all repair operations performed aboard a vessel during the one-year period prior to the current submission have been declared and entered. A valid Application is required to be supported by complete evidence as detailed in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (vi) and (i)(2) of this section. Except as further provided in this paragraph, the deadline for receipt of an Application and supporting evidence is 150 calendar days from the date that the vessel first arrived in the United States following foreign operations. Applications must be addressed and submitted by the vessel operator to the VRU and will be decided in that unit. The VRU may seek the advice of the Cargo Security, Carriers
Restricted Merchandise Branch, Office of Trade, in CBP Headquarters with regard to any specific item or issue which has not been addressed by clear precedent. If no Application is filed or if a submission which does not meet the minimal standards of an Application for Relief is received, the duty amount will be determined without regard to any potential claims for relief from duty assessment (see paragraph (h) of this section). Each Application for Relief must include copies of:
(i) Itemized bills, receipts, and invoices for items shown in paragraph (e) of this section. The cost of items for which a request for relief is made must be segregated from the cost of the other items listed in the vessel repair entry;
(ii) Photocopies of relevant parts of vessel logs, as well as of any classification society reports which detail damage and remedies;
(iii) A certification by the senior officer with personal knowledge of all relevant circumstances relating to casualty damage (time, place, cause, and nature of damage);
(iv) A certification by the senior officer with personal knowledge of all relevant circumstances relating to foreign repair expenditures (time, place, and nature of purchases and work performed);
(v) A certification by the master that casualty-related expenditures were necessary to ensure the safety and seaworthiness of the vessel in reaching its United States port of destination; and
(vi) Any permits or other documents filed with or issued by any United States Government agency other than CBP regarding the operation of the vessel that are relevant to the request for relief.
(2)
Additional evidence.
In addition, copies of any other evidence and documents the applicant may wish to provide as evidentiary support may be submitted. Elements of applications which are not supported by required evidentiary elements will be considered fully dutiable. All documents submitted must be certified by the master, owner, or authorized corporate officer to be originals or copies of originals, and if in a foreign language, they must be accompanied by an English translation, certified by the translator to be accurate. Upon receipt of an Application for Relief by the VRU within the prescribed time limits, a determination of duties owed will be made. After a decision is made on an Application for Relief by the VRU, the applicant will be notified of the right to protest any adverse decision.
(3)
Application for Relief; failure to file or denial in whole or in part.
If no Application for Relief is filed, or if a timely filed Application for Relief is denied in whole or in part, the VRU will determine the amount of duty due and issue a bill to the party who filed the vessel repair entry. If the bill is not timely paid, interest will accrue as provided in § 24.3a(b)(1) of this chapter.
(4)
Administrative protest.
Following the determination of duty owing on a vessel repair entry, a protest may be filed under 19 U.S.C. 1514(a)(2) as the only and final administrative appeal. The procedures and time limits applicable to protests filed in connection with vessel repair entries are the same as those provided in part 174 of this chapter. In particular, the applicable protest period will begin on the date of the issuance of the decision giving rise to the protest as reflected on the relevant correspondence from the VRU.
(j)
Penalties
—(1)
Failure to report, enter, or pay duty.
It is a violation of the vessel repair statute if the owner or master of a vessel subject to this section willfully or knowingly neglects or fails to report, make entry, and pay duties as required; makes any false statements regarding purchases or repairs described in this section without reasonable cause to believe the truth of the statements; or aids or procures any false statements regarding any material matter without reasonable cause to believe the truth of the statement. If a violation occurs, the vessel, its tackle, apparel, and furniture, or a monetary amount up to their value as determined by CBP, is subject to seizure and forfeiture and is recoverable from the owner (see § 162.72 of this chapter). The owner or master of the vessel who fails to timely pay the duty determined to be due is liable for interest as provided in § 24.3a(b)(1) of this chapter.
(2)
False declaration.
If any person required to file a vessel repair declaration or entry under this section, knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement, that person will be subject to the criminal penalties provided for in 18 U.S.C. 1001.

§ 4.15
Fishing vessels touching and trading at foreign places.
(a) Before any vessel documented with a fishery license endorsement shall touch and trade at a foreign port
or place, the master shall obtain from the port director a permit on Customs Form 1379 to touch and trade.
When a fishing vessel departs from the United States and there is an intent to stop at a foreign port (1) to lade vessel equipment which was preordered, (2) to purchase and lade vessel equipment, or (3) to purchase and lade vessel equipment to replace existing vessel equipment, the master of the vessel must either clear for that foreign port or obtain a permit to touch and trade, whether or not the vessel will engage in fishing on that voyage.
28
Purchases of such equipment, whether intended at the time of departure or not, are subject to declaration, entry, and payment of duty pursuant to section 466 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1466). The duty may be remitted if it is established that the purchases resulted from stress of weather or other casualty.
28
If such a vessel puts into a foreign port or place and only obtains bunkers, stores, or supplies suitable for a fishing voyage, it is not considered to have touched and traded there. Fish nets and netting are considered vessel equipment and not vessel supplies.
29-61
[Reserved]
(b) Upon the arrival of a documented vessel with a fishery endorsement which has put into a foreign port or place, the master shall report its arrival, make entry, and conform in all respects to the regulations applicable in the case of a vessel arriving from a foreign port.
(c) If a vessel which has been granted a permit to touch and trade arrives at a port in the United States, whether or not the vessel has touched at a foreign port or place, such permit shall forthwith be surrendered to the port director.
(d) No permit to touch and trade shall be issued to a vessel which does not have a Certificate of Documentation with a fishery license endorsement.

(a) Except as specified in § 4.21, a regular tonnage tax or duty of 2 cents per net ton, not to exceed in the aggregate 10 cents per net ton in any 1 year, shall be imposed at each entry on all vessels which shall be entered in any port of the United States from any foreign port or place in North America, Central America, the West Indies, the Bahama Islands, the Bermuda Islands, the coast of South America bordering on the Caribbean Sea (considered to include the mouth of the Orinoco River), or the high seas adjacent to the U.S. or the above listed foreign locations, and on all vessels (except vessels of the U.S., recreational vessels, and barges, as defined in § 2101 of Title 46) that depart a U.S. port or place and return to the same port or place without being entered in the United States from another port or place, and regular tonnage tax of 6 cents per net ton, not to exceed 30 cents per net ton per annum, shall be imposed at each entry on all vessels which shall be entered in any port of the United States from any other foreign port. In determining the port of origin of a voyage to the United States and the rate of tonnage tax, the following shall be used as a guide:
(1) When the vessel has proceeded in ballast from a port to which the 6-cent rate is applicable to a port to which the 2-cent rate applies and there has
laden cargo or taken passengers, tonnage tax upon entry in the United States shall be assessed at the 2-cent rate.
(2) The same rate shall be applied in a case in which the vessel has transported cargo or passengers from a 6-cent port to a 2-cent port when all such cargo or passengers have been unladen or discharged at the 2-cent port, without regard to whether the vessel thereafter has proceeded to the United States in ballast or with cargo or passengers laden or taken on board at the 2-cent port.
(3) The 6-cent rate shall be applied when the vessel proceeds from a 2-cent port to a 6-cent port en route to the United States under circumstances similar to paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section.
(4) If the vessel arrives in the United States with cargo or passengers taken at two or more ports to which different rates are applicable, tonnage tax shall be collected at the higher rate.
(b) The tonnage year shall be computed from the date of the first entry of the vessel concerned, without regard to the rate of the payment made at that entry, and shall expire on the day preceding the corresponding date of the following year. There may be 5 payments at the maximum (6 cent) and 5 at the minimum (2-cent) rate during a tonnage year, so that the maximum assessment of tonnage duty may amount to 40 cent per net ton for the tonnage year of a vessel engaged in alternating trade.
(c) A vessel shall also be subject on every entry from a foreign port or place, whether or not regular tonnage tax is payable on the particular entry, to the payment of a special tonnage tax and to the payment of light money at the rates and under the circumstances specified in the following table:

This does not apply on the first arrival of a vessel in a port of the United States from a foreign or intercoastal voyage if all the officers who are not citizens are below the grade of master and are filling vacancies which occurred on the voyage.
2
This special tax and light money do not apply if the vessel is documented as a vessel of the United States before leaving the port.
3
This does not apply if the vessel is under a certificate of protection and the owner or master files with the port director the oath required by 46 U.S.C. App. 129. An unrecorded bill of sale is not such a document as will exempt a vessel from the payment of light money under 46 U.S.C. App. 128, and the recording of such bill of sale after the arrival of the vessel is not sufficient to relieve it from the payment of the tax.
3a
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), does not ordinarily permit vessels of the United States to enter and trade.
4
This is to be collected on each entry of a vessel from such a port or place.
(d) Tonnage tax shall be imposed upon a vessel even though she enters a port of the United States only for orders.
(e) The fact that a vessel passes through the Panama Canal does not affect the rate of tonnage tax otherwise applicable to the vessel.
(f) For the purpose of computing tonnage tax, the net tonnage of a vessel stated in the vessel's marine document shall be accepted unless (1) such statement is manifestly wrong, in which case the net tonnage shall be estimated, pending admeasurement of the vessel, or the tonnage reported for her
by any recognized classification society may be accepted, or (2) an appendix is attached to the marine document showing a net tonnage ascertained under the so-called “British rules” or the rules of any foreign country which have been accepted as substantially in accord with the rules of the United States, in which case the tonnage so shown may be accepted and the date the appendix was issued shall be noted on the tonnage tax certificate, Customs Form 1002, and on the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300. For the purpose of computing tonnage tax on a vessel with a tonnage mark and dual tonnages, the higher of the net tonnages stated in the vessel's marine document or tonnage certificate shall be used unless the Customs officer concerned is satisfied by report of the boarding officer, statement or certificate of the master, or otherwise that the tonnage mark was not submerged at the time of arrival. Whether the vessel has a tonnage mark, and if so, whether the mark was submerged on arrival, shall be noted on Customs Form 1300 by the boarding officer.
(g) The decision of the Commissioner of Customs is the final administrative decision on any question of interpretation relating to the collection of tonnage tax or to the refund of such tax when collected erroneously or illegally, and any question of doubt shall be referred to him for instructions.
(h) Any person adversely affected by a decision of the Commissioner of Customs relating to the collection of tonnage tax, or to the refund of such tax when collected erroneously or illegally, may appeal the decision in the Court of International Trade provided that the appeal action is commenced in accordance with the rules of the Court within 2 years after the cause of action first accrues.

§ 4.23
Certificate of payment and cash receipt.
Upon each payment of tonnage tax or light money, the master of the vessel shall be given a certificate on Customs Form 1002 on which the control number of the cash receipt (Customs Form 368 or 368A) upon which payment was recorded shall be written. This certificate shall constitute the official evidence of such payment and shall be presented upon each entry during the tonnage year to establish the date of commencement of the tonnage year and to insure against overpayment. In the absence of the certificate, evidence of payment of tonnage tax shall be obtained from the port director to whom the payment was made.
[T.D. 85-71, 50 FR 15415, Apr. 18, 1985, as amended by T.D. 92-56, 57 FR 24943, June 12, 1992]
§ 4.24
Application for refund of tonnage tax.
(a) The authority to make refunds in accordance with section 26 of the Act of June 26, 1884 (46 U.S.C. 8) of regular tonnage taxes described in § 4.20(a) is delegated to the Directors of the ports where the collections were made. If any doubt exists, the case shall first be referred to Headquarters, U.S. Customs Service for advice.
(b) Each application for refund of regular or special tonnage tax or light money prepared in accordance with this section shall be filed with the Customs officer to whom payment was made. After verification of the pertinent facts asserted in the claim, the application shall be forwarded with any necessary report or recommendation to the appropriate port director. Applications for refund of special tonnage tax and light money (see § 4.20(c)) with the reports and recommendations submitted therewith shall be forwarded by the port director to the Commissioner of Customs for decision. Any refund authorized by the Port Director under paragraph (a) of this section or any refund of special tonnae tax or light money authorized by the Commissioner of Customs shall be made by the appropriate Customs officer. The records of tonnage tax shall be clearly noted to show each refund authorized.
(c) The application shall be a direct request for the refund of a definite sum, showing concisely the reasons therefor, the nationality and name of the vessel, and the date, place, and amount of each payment for which refund is requested. The application shall be made within 1 year from date of the payment. A protest against a payment shall not be accepted as an application for its refund.
(d) When the application is based upon a claim that more than five payments of regular tax at either the 2-cent or the 6-cent rate have been made during a tonnage year, the application shall be supported by a statement from
the appropriate Customs officer at the port where the application is submitted and from the appropriate Customs officer at each port at which any claimed payment was made verifying the facts and showing in each case whether refunds have been authorized.
(e) The application shall include a certificate by the owner or by the owner's agent that payment of tonnage tax at the applicable rate has been or will be made for each entry of the vessel on a voyage on which that rate is applicable before the end of the current tonnage year, exclusive of any payment which has been refunded or which may be refunded as a result of such application.
(f) The owner or operator of the vessel involved, or other party in interest, may file with the port Director a petition addressed to the Commissioner of Customs for a review of the port director's decision on an application for refund of regular tonnage tax.

# Landing and Delivery of Cargo
§ 4.30
Permits and special licenses for unlading and lading.
(a) Except as prescribed in paragraph (f), (g), or (k) of this section or in § 123.8 of this chapter, and except in the case of a vessel exempt from entry or clearance fees under 19 U.S.C. 288, no passengers, cargo, baggage, or other article shall be unladen from a vessel which arrives directly or indirectly from any port or place outside the Customs territory of the U.S., including the adjacent waters (see § 4.6 of this part), or from a vessel which transits the Panama Canal and no cargo, baggage, or other article shall be laden on a vessel destined to a port or place outside the Customs territory of the U.S., including the adjacent waters (see § 4.6 of this part) if Customs supervision of such lading is required, until the port director shall have issued a permit or special license therefore on Customs Form 3171 or electronically pursuant to an authorized electronic data interchange system or other means of communication approved by the Customs Service.
(1) U.S. and foreign vessels arriving at a U.S. port directly from a foreign port or place are required to make entry, whether it be formal or, as provided in § 4.8, preliminary, before the port director may issue a permit or special license to lade or unlade.
(2) U.S. vessels arriving at a U.S. port from another U.S. port at which formal entry was made may be issued a permit or special license to lade or unlade without having to make either preliminary or formal entry at the second and subsequent ports. Foreign vessels arriving at a U.S. port from another U.S. port at which formal entry was made may be issued a permit or special license to lade or unlade at the second and subsequent ports prior to formal entry without the necessity of making preliminary entry. In these circumstances, after the master has reported arrival of the vessel, the port director may issue the permit or special license or may, in his discretion, require the vessel to be boarded, the master to make an oath or affirmation to the truth of the statements contained in the vessel's manifest to the Customs officer who boards the vessel, and require delivery of the manifest prior to issuing the permit.
(b) Application for a permit or special license will be made by the master, owner, or agent of the vessel on Customs Form 3171, or electronically pursuant to an authorized electronic data interchange system or other means of communication approved by the Customs Service, and will specifically indicate the type of service desired at that time, unless a term permit or term special license has been issued. Vessels that arrive in a Customs port with more than one vessel carrier sharing or leasing space on board the vessel (such as under a vessel sharing or slot charter arrangement) are required to indicate on the CF 3171 all carriers on board the vessel and indicate whether each carrier is transmitting its cargo declaration electronically or is presenting it on the Customs Form 1302. In
the case of a term permit or term special license, upon entry of each vessel, a copy of the term permit or special license must be submitted to Customs during official hours in advance of the rendering of services so as to update the nature of the services desired and the exact times they will be needed. Permits must also be updated to reflect any other needed changes including those in the name of the vessel as well as the slot charter or vessel sharing parties. An agent of a vessel may limit his application to operations involved in the entry and unlading of the vessel or to operations involved in its lading and clearance. Such limitation will be specifically noted on the application.
(c) The request for a permit or a special license shall not be approved (previously issued term permits or special licenses shall be revoked) unless the carrier complies with the provisions of paragraphs (l) and (m) of this section regarding terminal facilities and employee lists, and the required cash deposit or bond has been filed on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.64 of this chapter relating to international carriers.
62
When a carrier has on file a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.63 of this chapter relating to basic custodial bond conditions, no further bond shall be required solely by reason of the unlading or lading at night or on a Sunday or holiday of merchandise or baggage covered by bonded transportation entries. Separate bonds shall be required if overtime services are requested by different principals.
62
“Before any such special license to unlade shall be granted, the master, owner, or agent of such vessel or vehicle, or the person in charge of such vehicle, shall be required to deposit sufficient money to pay, or to give a bond in an amount to be fixed by the Secretary conditioned to pay, the compensation and expenses of the customs officers and employees assigned to duty in connection with such unlading at night or on Sunday or a holiday, in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the act of February 13, 1911, as amended (U.S.C. 1952 edition, title 19 sec. 267). In lieu of such deposit or bond the owner or agent of any vessel or vehicle or line of vessels or vehicles may execute a bond in an amount to be fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury to cover and include the issuance of special licenses for the unlading of such vessels or vehicles for a period not to exceed one year. * * *” (Tariff Act of 1930, section 451, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1451)
63-66
[Reserved]
(d) Except as prescribed in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, a separate application for a permit or special license shall be filed in the case of each arrival.
(e) Stevedoring companies and others concerned in lading or unlading merchandise, or in removing or otherwise securing it, shall ascertain that the applicable preliminary Customs requirements have been complied with before commencing such operation, since performance in the absence of such compliance render them severally liable to the penalties prescribed in section 453, Tariff Act of 1930, even though they may not be responsible for taking the action necessary to secure compliance.
(f) The port director may issue a term permit on Customs Form 3171, which will remain in effect until revoked by the port director, terminated by the carrier, or automatically cancelled by termination of the supporting continuous bond, to unlade merchandise, passengers, or baggage, or to lade merchandise or baggage during official hours.
(g) The port director may issue a term special license on Customs Form 3171, which will remain in effect until revoked by the port director, terminated by the carrier, or automatically cancelled by termination of the supporting continuous bond, to unlade merchandise, passengers, or baggage, or to lade merchandise or baggage during overtime hours or on a Sunday or holiday when Customs supervision is required. (See § 24.16 of this chapter regarding pleasure vessels.)
(h) A special license for the unlading or lading of a vessel at night or on a Sunday or holiday shall be refused by the port director if the character of the merchandise or the conditions or facilities at the place of unlading or lading render the issuance of such special license dangerous to the revenue. In no case shall a special license for unlading or lading at night or on a Sunday or holiday be granted except on the ground of commercial necessity.
(i) The port director shall not issue a permit or special license to unlade
cargo or equipment of vessels arriving directly or indirectly from any port or place outside the United States, except on compliance with one or more of the following conditions:
(1) The merchandise shall have been duly entered and permits issued; or
(2) A bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.64 of this chapter relating to international carriers, or cash deposit shall have been given; or
(3) The merchandise is to be discharged into the custody of the port director as provided for in section 490(b), Tariff Act of 1930.
(j) Bonds are not required under this section for vessels owned by the United States and operated for its account.
(k) In the case of vessels of 5 net tons or over which are used exclusively as pleasure vessels and which arrive from any country, the port director in his discretion and under such conditions as he deems advisable may allow the required application for unlading passengers and baggage to be made orally, and may authorize his inspectors to grant oral permission for unlading at any time, and to grant requests on Customs Form 3171 for overtime services.
(l) A permit to unlade pursuant to this part 4 or part 122 of this chapter shall not be granted unless the port director determines that the applicant provides or the terminal at which the applicant will unlade the cargo provides (1) sufficient space, capable of being locked, sealed, or otherwise secured, for the storage immediately upon unlading of cargo whose weight-to-value ratio renders it susceptible to theft or pilferage and of packages which have been broken prior to or in the course of unlading; and (2) an adequate number of vehicles, capable of being locked, sealed, or otherwise secured, for the transportation of such cargo or packages between the point of unlading and the point of storage. A term permit to unlade shall be revoked if the port director determines subsequent to such issuance that the requirements of this paragraph have not been met.
(m) A permit to unlade pursuant to this part 4 or part 122 of this chapter shall not be granted to an importing carrier, and a term permit to unlade previously granted to such a carrier shall be revoked, (1) if such carrier, within 30 days after the date of receipt of a written demand by the port director, does not furnish a written list of the names, addresses, social security numbers, and dates and places of birth of persons it employs in connection with the unlading, storage and delivery of imported merchandise; or (2) if, having furnished such a list, the carrier does not advise the port director in writing of the names, addresses, social security numbers, and dates and places of birth of any new personnel employed in connection with the unlading, storage and delivery of imported merchandise within 10 days after such employment. If the employment of any such person is terminated, the carrier shall promptly advise the port director. For the purposes of this part, a person shall not be deemed to be employed by a carrier if he is an officer or employee of an independent contractor engaged by a carrier to load, unload, transport or otherwise handle cargo.
(n) CBP will not issue a permit to unlade before it has received the cargo declaration information pursuant to § 4.7(b)(2) or (4) of this part. In cases in which CBP does not receive complete cargo declaration information from the carrier or a NVOCC in the manner, format, and time frame required by § 4.7(b)(2) or (4), as appropriate, CBP may delay issuance of the permit to unlade the entire vessel until all required information is received. CBP may also decline to issue a permit to unlade the specific cargo for which a cargo declaration is not received in a timely manner under § 4.7(b)(2) or (4). Further, where a carrier does not transmit a cargo declaration in the manner required by § 4.7(b)(2) or (4), preliminary entry pursuant to § 4.8(b) will be denied.

§ 4.31
Unlading or transshipment due to casualty.
(a) When any cargo or stores of a vessel have been unladen or transshipped
at any place in the United States or its Customs waters other than a port of entry because of accident, stress of weather, or other necessity, no penalty shall be imposed under section 453 or 586(a), Tariff Act of 1930, if due notice is given to the director of the port at which the vessel thereafter first arrives and satisfactory proof is submitted to him as provided for in section 586(f), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, regarding such accident, stress of weather, or other necessity. The port director may accept the certificates of the master and two or more officers or members of the crew of the vessel, of whom the person next to the master in command shall be one, as proof that the unlading or transshipment was necessary by reason of unavoidable cause.
(b) The port director may then permit entry of the vessel and its cargo and permit the unlading of the cargo in such place at the port as he may deem proper. Unless its transportation has been in violation of the coastwise laws, the cargo may be cleared through Customs at the port where it is discharged or forwarded to the port of original destination under an entry for immediate transportation or for transportation and exportation, as the case may be. All regulations shall apply in such cases as if the unlading and delivery took place at the port of original destination.

§ 4.32
Vessels in distress; landing of cargo.
(a) When a vessel from a foreign port arrives in distress at a port other than that to which it is destined, a permit to land merchandise or baggage may be issued if such action is necessary. Merchandise and baggage so unladen shall be taken into Customs custody and, if it has not been transported in violation of the coastwise laws, may be entered and disposed of in the same manner as any other imported merchandise or may be reladen without entry to be carried to its destination on the vessel from which it was unladen, subject only to charges for storage and safekeeping.
(b) A bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.64 of this chapter relating to international carriers shall be given in an amount to be determined by the port director to insure the proper disposition of the cargo, whether such cargo be dutiable or free.

§ 4.33
Diversion of cargo.
(a)
Unlading at other than original port of destination.
A vessel may unlade cargo or baggage at an alternative port of entry to the port of original destination if:
(1) It is compelled by any cause to put into the alternative port and the director of that port issues a permit for the unlading of cargo or baggage; or
(2) As a result of an emergency existing at the port of destination, the port director authorizes the vessel to proceed in accordance with the residue cargo bond procedure to the alternative port. The owner or agent of the vessel shall apply for such authorization in writing, stating the reasons and agreeing to hold the port director and the Government harmless for the diversion.
(b)
Disposition of cargo or baggage at emergency port.
Cargo and baggage unladen at the alternative port under the circumstances set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may be:
(1) Entered in the same manner as other imported cargo or baggage;
(2) Treated as unclaimed and stored at the risk and expense of its owner; or
(3) Reladen upon the same vessel without entry, for transportation to its original destination.
(c)
Substitution of ports of discharge on manifest.
After entry, the Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, of a vessel may be changed at any time to permit discharge of manifested cargo at any domestic port in lieu of any other port shown on the Cargo Declaration, if:
(1) A written application for the diversion is made on the amended Cargo Declaration by the master, owner, or agent of the vessel to the director of the port where the vessel is located, after entry of the vessel at that port;
(2) An amended Cargo Declaration, under oath, covering the cargo, which it is desired to divert, is furnished in
support of the application and is filed in such number of copies as the port director shall require for local Customs purposes; and
(3) The certified traveling manifest is not altered or added to in any way by the master, owner, or agent of the vessel. When an application under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is approved, the port director shall securely attach an approved copy of the amended manifest to the traveling manifest and shall send one copy of the amended Cargo Declaration to the director of the port where the vessel's bond was filed.
(d)
Retention of cargo on board for later return to the United States.
If, as the result of a strike or other emergency at a United States port for which inward foreign cargo is manifested, it is desired to retain the cargo on board the vessel for discharge at a foreign port but with the purpose of having the cargo returned to the United States, an application may be made by the master, owner, or agent of the vessel to amend the vessel's Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, under a procedure similar to that described in paragraph (c) of this section, except that a foreign port shall be substituted for the domestic port of discharge. If the application is approved, it shall be handled in the same manner as an application filed under paragraph (c) of this section. However, before approving the application, the port director is authorized to require such bond as he deems necessary to insure that export control laws and regulations are not circumvented.

§ 4.34
Prematurely discharged, overcarried, and undelivered cargo.
(a)
Prematurely landed cargo.
Upon receipt of a satisfactory written application from the owner or agent of a vessel establishing that cargo was prematurely landed and left behind by the importing vessel through error or emergency, the port director may permit inward foreign cargo remaining on the dock to be reladen on the next available vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel for transportation to the destination shown on the Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, of the first vessel, provided the importing vessel actually entered the port of destination of the prematurely landed cargo. Unless so forwarded within 30 days from the date of landing, the cargo shall be appropriately entered for Customs clearance or for forwarding in bond; otherwise, it shall be sent to general order as unclaimed. If the merchandise is so entered for Customs clearance at the port of unlading, or if it is so forwarded in bond, other than by the importing vessel or by another vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel, representatives of the importing vessel shall file at the port of unlading a Cargo Declaration in duplicate listing the cargo. The port director shall retain the original and forward the duplicate to the director of the originally intended port of discharge.
(b)
Overcarried cargo.
Upon receipt of a satisfactory written application by the owner or agent of a vessel establishing that cargo was not landed at its destination and was overcarried to another domestic port through error or emergency, the port director may permit the cargo to be returned in the importing vessel, or in another vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel, to the destination shown on the Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, of the importing vessel, provided the importing vessel actually entered the port of destination.
67
67
See § 141.69(c) of this chapter for the conditions under which such merchandise and goods removed from a port of intended entry under these or certain other circumstances may subsequently be cleared under a consumption entry which had been filed therefore before the merchandise was removed from the port of intended entry.
68-69
[Reserved]
(c)
Inaccessibly stowed cargo.
Cargo so stowed as to be inaccessible upon arrival at destination may be retained on board, carried forward to another domestic port or ports, and returned to the port of destination in the importing vessel or in another vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel in the same manner as other overcarried cargo.
(d)
Application for forwarding cargo.
When it is desired that prematurely landed cargo, overcarried cargo, or cargo so stowed as to be inaccessible,
be forwarded to its destination by the importing vessel or by another vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel in accordance with paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the required application shall be filed with the local director of the port of premature landing or overcarriage by the owner or agent of the vessel. The application shall be supported by a Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, in such number of copies as the port director may require. Whenever practicable, the application shall be made on the face of the Cargo Declaration below the description of the merchandise. The application shall specify the vessel on which the cargo was imported, even though the forwarding to destination is by another vessel owned or chartered by the owner of the importing vessel, and all ports of departure and dates of sailing of the importing vessel. The application shall be stamped and signed to show that it has been approved.
(e)
Manifesting prematurely landed or overcarried cargo.
One copy of the Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, shall be certified by Customs for use as a substitute traveling manifest for the prematurely landed or overcarried cargo being forwarded as residue cargo, whether or not the forwarding vessel is also carrying other residue cargo. If the application for forwarding is made on the Cargo Declaration, the new substitute traveling manifest shall be stamped to show the approval of the application. If the application is on a separate document, a copy thereof, stamped to show its approval, shall be attached to the substitute traveling manifest. An appropriate cross-reference shall be placed on the original traveling manifest to show that the vessel has one or more substitute traveling manifests. A permit to proceed endorsed on a Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300, issued to the vessel transporting the prematurely landed or overcarried cargo to its destination shall make reference to the nature of such cargo, identifying it with the importing vessel.
(f)
Residue cargo procedure.
A vessel with prematurely landed or overcarried cargo on board shall comply upon arrival at all domestic ports of call with all the requirements of part 4 relating to foreign residue cargo for domestic ports. The substitute traveling manifest, carried forward from port to port by the oncarrying vessel, shall be finally surrendered at the port where the last portion of the prematurely landed or overcarried cargo is discharged.
(g)
Cargo undelivered at foreign port and returned to the U.S.
Merchandise shipped from a domestic port, but undelivered at the foreign destination and returned, shall be manifested as “Undelivered-to be returned to original foreign destination,” if such a return is intended. The port director may issue a permit to retain the merchandise on board, or he may, upon written application of the steamship company, issue a permit on a Delivery Ticket, Customs Form 6043, allowing the merchandise to be transferred to another vessel for return to the original foreign destination. No charge shall be made against the bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions relating to international carriers set forth in § 113.64 of this chapter. The items shall be remanifested outward and an explanatory reference of the attending circumstances and compliance with export requirements noted.

§ 4.35
Unlading outside port of entry.
(a) Upon written application from the interested party, the port director concerned, if he considers it necessary, may permit any vessel laden with merchandise in bulk to proceed, after entry, to any place outside the port where the vessel entered which such port director may designate for the purpose of unlading such cargo.
(b) In such case a deposit of a sum sufficient to reimburse the Government for the compensation, travel, and subsistence expenses of the officers detailed to supervise the unlading and delivery of the cargo may be required by the port director.

§ 4.36
Delayed discharge of cargo.
(a) When pursuant to section 457, Tariff Act of 1930, customs officers are placed on a vessel which has retained merchandise on board more than 25 days after the date of the vessel's arrival, their compensation and subsistence expenses shall be reimbursed to the Government by the owner or master.
(b) The compensation of all Customs officers and employees assigned to supervise the discharge of a cargo within the purview of section 458, Tariff Act of 1930,
70
after the expiration of 25 days after the date of the vessel's entry shall be reimbursed to the Government by the owner or master of the vessel.
70
“The limitation of time for unlading shall not extend to vessels laden exclusively with merchandise in bulk consigned to one consignee and arriving at a port for orders, but if the master of such vessel requests a longer time to discharge its cargo, the compensation of the inspectors or other customs officers whose services are required in connection with the unlading shall, for every day consumed in unlading in excess of twenty-five (25) days from the date of the vessel's entry, be reimbursed by the master or owner of such vessel.” (Tariff Act of 1930, sec. 458; 19 U.S.C. 1458)
71-75
[Reserved]
(c) When cargo is manifested “for orders” upon the arrival of the vessel, no amendment of the manifest to show another port of discharge shall be permitted after 15 days after the date of the vessel's arrival, except as provided for in § 4.33.
(d) All reimbursements payable in accordance with this section shall be paid or secured to the port director before clearance is granted to the vessel.
[28 FR 14596, Dec. 31, 1963, as amended by T.D. 95-77, 60 FR 50010, Sept. 27, 1995; T.D. 98-74, 63 FR 51287, Sept. 25, 1998]
§ 4.37
General order.
(a) Any merchandise or baggage regularly landed but not covered by a permit for its release shall be allowed to remain at the place of unlading until the fifteenth calendar day after landing. No later than 20 calendar days after landing, the master or owner of the vessel or the agent thereof shall notify Customs of any such merchandise or baggage for which entry has not been made. Such notification shall be provided in writing or by any appropriate Customs-authorized electronic data interchange system. Failure to provide such notification may result in assessment of a monetary penalty of up to $1,000 per bill of lading against the master or owner of the vessel or the agent thereof. If the value of the merchandise on the bill is less than $1,000, the penalty shall be equal to the value of such merchandise.
(b) Any merchandise or baggage that is taken into custody from an arriving carrier by any party under a Customs-authorized permit to transfer or in-bond entry may remain in the custody of that party for 15 calendar days after receipt under such permit to transfer or 15 calendar days after arrival at the port of destination. No later than 20 calendar days after receipt under the permit to transfer or 20 calendar days after arrival under bond at the port of destination, the party shall notify Customs of any such merchandise or baggage for which entry has not been made. Such notification shall be provided in writing or by any appropriate Customs-authorized electronic data interchange system. If the party fails to notify Customs of the unentered merchandise or baggage in the allotted time, he may be liable for the payment of liquidated damages under the terms and conditions of his custodial bond (see § 113.63(c)(4) of this chapter).
(c) In addition to the notification to Customs required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the carrier (or any other party to whom custody of the unentered merchandise has been transferred by a Customs authorized permit to transfer or in-bond entry) shall provide notification of the presence of such unreleased and unentered merchandise or baggage to a bonded warehouse certified by the port director as qualified to receive general order merchandise. Such notification shall be provided in writing or by any appropriate Customs-authorized electronic data interchange system and shall be provided within the applicable 20-day period specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. It shall then be the responsibility of the bonded warehouse proprietor to arrange for the transportation and storage of the merchandise
or baggage at the risk and expense of the consignee. The arriving carrier (or other party to whom custody of the merchandise was transferred by the arriving carrier under a Customs-authorized permit to transfer or in-bond entry) is responsible for preparing a Customs Form (CF) 6043 (Delivery Ticket), or other similar Customs document designated by the port director or an electronic equivalent as authorized by Customs, to cover the proprietor's receiptof the merchandise and its transport to the warehouse from the custody of the arriving carrier (or other party to whom custody of the merchandise was transferred by the carrier under a Customs-authorized permit to transfer or in-bond entry) (
see
§ 19.9 of this chapter). Any unentered merchandise or baggage shall remain the responsibility of the carrier, master, or person in charge of the importing vessel or the agent thereof or party to whom the merchandise has been transferred under a Customs authorized permit to transfer or in-bond entry, until it is properly transferred from his control in accordance with this paragraph. If the party to whom custody of the unentered merchandise or baggage has been transferred by a Customs-authorized permit to transfer or in-bond entry fails to notify a Customs-approved bonded warehouse of such merchandise or baggage within the applicable 20-calendar-day period, he may be liable for the payment of liquidated damages of $1,000 per bill of lading under the terms and conditions of his international carrier or custodial bond (see §§ 113.63(b), 113.63(c) and 113.64(b) of this chapter).
(d) If a carrier or any other party to whom custody of the unentered merchandise has been transferred by means of a Customs-authorized permit to transfer or in-bond entry fails to timely relinquish custody of the merchandise to a Customs-approved bonded General Order warehouse, the carrier or other party may be liable for liquidated damages equal to the value of that merchandise under the terms and conditions of his international carrier or custodial bond, as applicable.
(e) If the bonded warehouse operator fails to take possession of unentered and unreleased merchandise or baggage within five calendar days after receipt of notification of the presence of such merchandise or baggage under this section, he may be liable for the payment of liquidated damages under the terms and conditions of his custodial bond (see § 113.63(a)(1) of this chapter). If the port director finds that the warehouse operator cannot accept the goods because they are required by law to be exported or destroyed (
see
§ 127.28 of this chapter), or for other good cause, the goods will remain in the custody of the arriving carrier or other party to whom the goods have been transferred under a Customs-authorized permit to transfer or in-bond entry. In this event, the carrier or other party will be responsible under bond for exporting or destroying the goods, as necessary (
see
§§ 113.63(c)(3) and 113.64(b) of this chapter).
(f) In ports where there is no bonded warehouse authorized to accept general order merchandise or if merchandise requires specialized storage facilities which are unavailable in a bonded facility, the port director, after having received notice of the presence of unentered merchandise or baggage in accordance with the provisions of this section, shall direct the storage of the merchandise by the carrier or by any other appropriate means.
(g) Whenever merchandise remains on board any vessel from a foreign port more than 25 days after the date on which report of arrival of such vessel was made, the port director, as prescribed in section 457, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1457), may take possession of such merchandise and cause it to be unladen at the expense and risk of the owners of the merchandise. Any merchandise so unladen shall be sent forthwith by the port director to a general order warehouse and stored at the risk and expense of the owners of the merchandise.
(h) Merchandise taken into the custody of the port director pursuant to section 490(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1490(b)), shall be sent to a general order warehouse after
1 day after the day the vessel was entered, to be held there at the risk and expense of the consignee.
[T.D. 98-74, 63 FR 51287, Sept. 25, 1998, as amended by T.D. 02-65, 67 FR 68032, Nov. 8, 2002]
§ 4.38
Release of cargo.
(a) No imported merchandise shall be released from Customs custody until a permit to release such merchandise has been granted. Such permit shall be issued by the port director only after the merchandise has been entered and, except as provided for in § 141.102(d) or part 142 of this chapter, the duties thereon, if any, have been estimated and paid. Generally, the permit shall consist of a document authorizing delivery of a particular shipment or an electronic equivalent. Alternatively, the permit may consist of a report which lists those shipments which have been authorized for release. This alternative cargo release notification may be used when the manifest is not filed by the carrier through the Automated Manifest System, the entry has been filed through the Automated Broker Interface, and Customs has approved the cargo for release without submission of paper documents after reviewing the entry data submitted electronically through ABI and its selectivity criteria (see § 143.34). The report shall be posted in a conspicuous area to which the public has access in the customhouse at the port of entry where the cargo was imported.
(1) Where the cargo arrives by vessel, the report shall consist of the following data elements:
(i) Vessel name or code, if transmitted by the entry filer;
(ii) Carrier code;
(iii) Voyage number, if transmitted by the entry filer;
(iv) Bill of lading number;
(v) Quantity released; and
(vi) Entry number (including filer code).
(2) Where the cargo arrives by air, the report shall consist of the following data elements:
(i) Air waybill number;
(ii) Quantity released;
(iii) Entry number (including filer code);
(iv) Carrier code; and
(v) Flight number, if transmitted by the entry filer.
(3) In the case of merchandise traveling via in-bond movement, the report will contain the following data elements:
(i) Immediate transportation bond number;
(ii) Carrier code;
(iii) Quantity released; and
(iv) Entry number (including filer code).
When merchandise is released without proper permit before entry has been made, the port director shall issue a written demand for redelivery. The carrier or facility operator shall redeliver the merchandise to Customs within 30 days after the demand is made. The port director may authorize unentered merchandise brought in by one carrier for the account of another carrier to be transferred within the port to the latter carrier's facility. Upon receipt of the merchandise the latter carrier assumes liability for the merchandise to the same extent as though the merchandise had arrived on its own vessel.
(b) When packages of merchandise bear marks or numbers which differ from those appearing on the Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, of the importing vessel for the same packages and the importer or a receiving bonded carrier, with the concurrence of the importing carrier, makes application for their release under such marks or numbers, either for consumption or for transportation in bond under an entry filed therefor at the port of discharge from the importing vessel, the port director may approve the application upon condition that (1) the contents of the packages be identified with an invoice or transportation entry as set forth below and (2) the applicant furnish at his own expense any bonded cartage or lighterage service which the granting of the application may require. The application shall be in writing in such number of copies as may be required for local Customs purposes. Before permitting delivery of packages under such an application, the port director shall cause such examination thereof to be made as will reasonably identify the contents with the invoice filed with the consumption entry. If
the merchandise is entered for transportation in bond without the filing of an invoice, such examination shall be made as will reasonably identify the contents of the packages with the transportation entry.
(c) If the port director determines that, in a port or portion of a port, the volume of cargo handled, the incidence of theft or pilferage, or any other factor related to the protection of merchandise in Customs custody requires such measures, he shall require as a condition to the granting of a permit to release imported merchandise that the importer or his agent present to the carrier or his agent a fully executed pickup order in substantially the following format, in triplicate, to obtain delivery of any imported merchandise:
EC14NO91.167
The pickup order shall contain a duly authenticated customhouse broker's signature, unless it is presented by a person properly identified as an employee or agent of the ultimate consignee. When delivered quantities are verified by a Customs officer, he shall certify all copies of the pickup order, returning one to the importer or his agent and two to the carrier making delivery.
(d) When the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section are invoked by the port director and verification of delivered quantities by Customs is required, a permit to release merchandise shall be effective as a release from Customs custody at the time that the delivery of the merchandise covered by the pickup order into the physical possession of a subsequent carrier or an importer or the agent of either is completed under the supervision of a Customs officer, and only to the extent of the actual delivery of merchandise described in such pickup order as verified by such Customs officer.

§ 4.39
Stores and equipment of vessels and crews' effects; unlading or lading and retention on board.
(a) The provisions of § 4.30 relating to unlading under a permit on Customs Form 3171 are applicable to the unlading of articles, other than cargo or baggage, which have been laden on a vessel outside the Customs territory of the
United States, regardless of the trade in which the vessel may be engaged at the time of unlading, except that such provisions do not apply to such articles which have already been entered.
(b) Any articles other than cargo or baggage landed for delivery for consumption in the United States shall be treated in the same manner as other imported articles. A notation as to the landing of such articles, together with the number of the entry made therefor, shall be made on the vessel's store list, but such notation shall not subject the articles to the requirement of being included in a post entry to the manifest.
(c) Bags or dunnage constituting equipment of a vessel may be landed temporarily and reladen on such vessel under Customs supervision without entry.
(d) Articles claimed to be sea or ships' stores which are in excess of the reasonable requirements of the vessel on which they are found shall be treated as cargo of such vessel.
(e) Under section 446, Tariff Act of 1930, port directors may permit narcotic drugs, except smoking opium, in reasonable quantities and properly listed as medical stores to remain on board vessels if satisfied that such drugs are adequately safeguarded and used only as medical supplies.
(f) Application for permission to transfer bunkers, stores or equipment as provided for in the proviso to section 446, Tariff Act of 1930, shall be made and the permit therefor granted on Customs Form 3171.
(g) Equipment of a vessel arriving either directly or indirectly from a foreign port or place, if in need of repairs in the United States, may be unladen from and reladen upon the same vessel under the procedures set forth in § 4.30 relating to the granting of permits and special licenses on Customs Form 3171 (CF 3171). Adequate protection of the revenue is insured under the appropriate International Carrier Bond during the period that equipment is temporarily landed for repairs (see § 113.64(b) of this chapter), and so resort to the procedures established for the temporary importation of merchandise under bond is unnecessary. Once equipment which has been unladen under the terms of a CF 3171 has been reladen on the same vessel, potential liability for that transaction existing under the bond will be extinguished.

§ 4.40
Equipment, etc., from wrecked or dismantled vessels.
Ship's or sea stores, supplies, and equipment of a vessel wrecked either in the waters of the United States or outside such waters, on being recovered and brought into a United States port, and like articles landed from a vessel dismantled in a United States port shall be subject to the same Customs treatment as would apply if the articles were landed from a vessel arriving in the ordinary course of trade. Parts of the hull and fittings recovered from a vessel which arrived in the United States in the course of navigation and was wrecked in the waters of the United States or was dismantled in this country are free of duties and import taxes, but if such articles are recovered from vessels outside the waters of the United States and brought into a United States port, they shall be treated as imported merchandise.
§ 4.41
Cargo of wrecked vessel.
(a) Any cargo landed from a vessel wrecked in the waters of the United States or on the high seas shall be subject at the port of entry to the same entry requirements and privileges as the cargo of a vessel regularly arriving in the foreign trade. In lieu of a Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, to cover such cargo, the owner, underwriter (if the merchandise has been abandoned to him), or the salvor of the merchandise shall make entry on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, and any such applicant shall be regarded as the consignee of the merchandise for Customs purposes.
76
76
“* * * The underwriters of abandoned merchandise and the salvors of merchandise saved from a wreck at sea or on or along a coast of the United States may be regarded as the consignees.”* * * (Tariff Act of 1930, sec. 483; 19 U.S.C. 1483)
(b) All such merchandise shall be taken into possession by the director of the port where it shall first arrive and
be retained in his custody pending entry. If it is not entered by the person entitled to make entry, or is not disposed of pursuant to court order, it shall be subject to sale as unclaimed merchandise.
(c) If such merchandise is from a vessel which has been sunk in waters of the United States for 2 years or more and has been abandoned by the owner, any person who has salvaged the cargo shall be permitted to enter the merchandise at the port where the vessel was wrecked free of duty upon the facts being established to the satisfaction of the director of the port of entry.
77
Any other such merchandise is subject to the same tariff classification as like merchandise regularly imported in the ordinary course of trade.
77
“Whenever any vessel laden with merchandise, in whole or in part subject to duty, has been sunk in any river, harbor, bay, or waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and within its limits, for the period of two years and is abandoned by the owner thereof, any person who may raise such vessel shall be permitted to bring any merchandise recovered therefrom into the port nearest to the place where such vessel was so raised free from the payment of any duty thereupon, but under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.” (Tariff Act of 1930, sec. 310; 19 U.S.C. 1310)
(d) If the merchandise is libeled for salvage,
78
the port director shall notify the United States attorney of the claim of the United States for duties, and request him to intervene for such duties.
78
Salvors have an uncertain interest in the goods salved, dependent upon the decree of a competent tribunal, and have a presumptive right without such decree to possession of merchandise salved by them from abandoned wrecks. The salvors are entitled in either case to make entry of derelict or wrecked goods.

§ 4.61
Requirements for clearance.
(a)
Application for clearance.
A clearance application for a vessel intending to depart for a foreign port must be made by filing CBP Form 1300 (Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement) executed by the vessel master or other proper officer. The master, licensed deck officer, or purser may appear in person to clear the vessel, or the properly executed CBP Form 1300 may be delivered to the customhouse by the vessel agent or other personal representative of the master. Necessary information may also be transmitted electronically pursuant to a system authorized by CBP. Clearance will be granted by CBP either on the CBP Form 1300 or by approved electronic means. CBP port directors may permit the clearance of vessels at locations other than the customhouse, and at times outside of normal business hours. CBP may take local resources into consideration in allowing clearance to be transacted on board vessels themselves or at other mutually convenient sites and times either within or outside of port limits. CBP must be satisfied that the place designated for clearance is sufficiently under CBP control at the time of clearance, and that the expenses incurred by CBP will be reimbursed as authorized. CBP may require that advance notice of vessel departure be given prior to granting requests for optional clearance locations.
(b)
When clearance required.
Under certain circumstances, American vessels departing from ports of the United States directly for other United States ports must obtain CBP clearance. The clearance of such vessels is required when they have merchandise aboard which is being transported in-bond, or when they have unentered foreign merchandise aboard. For the purposes of the vessel clearance requirements, merchandise transported in-bond does not include bonded ship's stores or supplies. While American vessels transporting unentered foreign merchandise must fully comply with usual clearance procedures, American vessels carrying no unentered foreign merchandise but that have in-bond merchandise aboard may satisfy vessel clearance requirements by reporting intended departure within 72 hours prior thereto by any means of communication that is satisfactory to the local CBP port director, and by presenting a completed CBP Form 1300 (Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement). Also, the CBP officer may require the production of any documents or papers deemed necessary for the proper inspection/examination of the vessel, cargo, passenger, or crew. Report of departure together with providing information to CBP as specified in this paragraph satisfies all clearance requirements for the subject vessels.
(c)
Verification of compliance.
Before clearance is granted to a vessel bound to a foreign port as provided in § 4.60 and this section, the port director will verify compliance with respect to the following matters:
(1) Accounting for inward cargo (see § 4.62).
(2) Outward Cargo Declarations; Electronic Export Information (EEI) (see § 4.63).
(3) Documentation (see § 4.0(c)).
(4) Verification of nationality and tonnage (see § 4.65).
(5) Verification of inspection (see § 4.66).
(6) Inspection under State laws (46 U.S.C. 60106).
(7) Closed ports or places (see § 4.67).
(8) Passengers (see § 4.68).
(9) Shipping articles and enforcement of Seamen's Act (see § 4.69).
(10) Medicine and slop chests.
(11) Load line regulations (see § 4.65a).
(12) Carriage of United States securities, etc. (46 U.S.C. 60109).
(13) Carriage of mail.
(14) Public Health regulations (see § 4.70).
(15) Inspection of vessels carrying livestock (see § 4.71).
(16) Inspection of meat, meat-food products, and inedible fats (see § 4.72).
(17) Neutrality exportation of arms and munitions (see § 4.73).
(18) Payment of all legal fees that have accrued on the vessel (46 U.S.C. 60107).
(19) Orders restricting shipping (see § 4.74).
(20) Estimated duties deposited or a bond given to cover duties on foreign repairs and equipment for vessels of the United States (see § 4.14).
(21) Illegal discharge of oil (see § 4.66a).
(22) Attached or arrested vessel.
(23) Immigration laws.
(24) Electronic receipt of required vessel cargo information (see § 192.14(c) of this chapter).
(d)
Vessel built for foreign account.
A new vessel built in the United States for foreign account will be cleared under a certificate of record, Coast Guard Form 1316, in lieu of a marine document.
(e)
Clearance not granted.
Clearance will not be granted to any foreign vessel using the flag of the United States or any distinctive signs or markings indicating that the vessel is an American vessel (22 U.S.C. 454(a)).
(f)
Clearance in order of itinerary.
Unless otherwise provided in this section, every vessel bound for a foreign port or ports will be cleared for a definite port or ports in the order of its itinerary, but an application to clear for a port or place for orders, that is, for instructions to masters as to destination of the vessel, may be accepted if the vessel is in ballast or if any cargo on board is to be discharged in a port of the same country as the port for which clearance is sought.

§ 4.76
Procedures and responsibilities of carriers filing outbound vessel manifest information via the AES.
(a)
The sea carrier's module.
The Sea Carrier's Module is a component of the Automated Export System (AES) (
see,
part 192, subpart B, of this chapter) that allows for the filing of outbound vessel manifest information electronically (
see,
15 CFR part 30). All sea carriers are eligible to apply for participation in the Sea Carrier's Module. Application and certification procedures for AES are found at 15 CFR 30.5. A sea carrier certified to use the module that adheres to the procedures set forth in this section and the Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Regulations (15 CFR part 30) concerning the electronic submission of an outbound vessel manifest information meets the outward cargo declaration filing requirements (CF 1302-A) of §§ 4.63 and 4.75, except as otherwise provided in §§ 4.75 and 4.84.
(b)
Responsibilities.
The performance requirements and operational standards and procedures for electronic submission of outbound vessel manifest information are detailed in the AES Trade Interface Requirements (AESTIR) available on the CBP Web site,
http://www.cbp.gov.
Carriers and their agents are responsible for reporting accurate and timely information and for responding to all notifications concerning the status of their transmissions and the detention and release of freight in accordance with the procedures set forth in the AESTIR. CBP will send messages to participant carriers regarding the accuracy of their transmissions. Carriers and their agents are required to comply with the recordkeeping requirements contained at § 30.10 of the Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Regulations (15 CFR 30.10) and any other applicable recordkeeping requirements. When the exporter submits Electronic Export Information (EEI) prior to departure, carriers will be responsible for annotating the manifest with the Internal Transaction Number (ITN) without change and submitting the manifest to CBP within four (4) business days after the departure of the vessel from each port unless a different time requirement is specified in § 4.75 or § 4.84.
(c)
Messages required to be filed within the sea carrier's module.
Participant carriers will be responsible for transmitting and responding to the following messages:
(1)
Booking.
Booking information identifies all the freight that is scheduled for export. Booking information will be transmitted to Customs via AES for each shipment as far in advance of departure as practical, but no later than seventy-two hours prior to
departure for all information available at that time. Bookings received within seventy-two hours of departure will be transmitted to Customs via AES as received;
(2)
Receipt of booking.
When the carrier receives the cargo or portion of the cargo that was booked, the carrier will inform Customs so that Customs can determine if an examination of the cargo is necessary. Customs will notify the carrier of shipments designated for examination. Customs will also notify the carrier when the shipment designated for inspection is released and may be loaded on the vessel;
(3)
Departure.
No later than the first calendar day following the actual departure of the vessel, the carrier will notify Customs of the date and time of departure; and
(4)
Manifest.
Within ten (10) calendar days after the departure of the vessel from each port, the carrier will submit the manifest information to Customs via AES for each booking loaded on the departed vessel. However, if the destination of the vessel is a foreign port listed in § 4.75(c), the carrier must transmit complete manifest information before vessel departure. Time requirements for transmission of complete manifest information for carriers destined to Puerto Rico and U.S. possessions are the same as the requirement for the submission of the complete manifest as found in § 4.84.
(d) All penalties and liquidated damages that apply to the submission of paper manifests (
see,
applicable provisions in this part) apply to the electronic submission of outbound vessel manifest information through the Sea Carrier's Module.
[T.D. 99-57, 64 FR 40986, July 28, 1999, as amended by CBP Dec. 17-06, 82 FR 32237, July 13, 2017]

# Coastwise Procedure
§ 4.80
Vessels entitled to engage in coastwise trade.
(a) No vessel shall transport, either directly or by way of a foreign port, any passenger or merchandise between points in the United States embraced within the coastwise laws, including points within a harbor, or merchandise for any part of the transportation between such points, unless it is:
(1) Owned by a citizen and is so documented under the laws of the United States as to permit it to engage in the coastwise trade;
(2) Owned by a citizen, is exempt from documentation, and is entitled to or, except for its tonnage, would be entitled to be documented with a coastwise endorsement.
(3) Owned by a partnership or association in which at least a 75 percent interest is owned by such a citizen, is exempt from documentation and is entitled to or, except for its tonnage, or citizenship of its owner, or both, would be entitled to be documented for the coastwise trade. The term “citizen” for vessel documentation purposes, whether for an individual, partnership, or corporation owner, is defined in 46 CFR 67.3.
(b)(1) The penalty imposed for the illegal transportation of merchandise between coastwise points is forfeiture of the merchandise or, in the discretion of the port director, forfeiture of a monetary amount up to the value of the merchandise to be recovered from the consignor, seller, owner, importer, consignee, agent, or other person or persons so transporting or causing the merchandise to be transported (46 U.S.C. 55102).
(2) The penalty imposed for the unlawful transportation of passengers between coastwise points is $300 for each passenger so transported and landed on or before November 2, 2015, and $996 for each passenger so transported and landed after November 2, 2015 (46 U.S.C. 55103, as adjusted by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015).
(c) Any vessel of the United States, whether or not entitled under paragraph (a) of this section to engage in the coastwise trade, and any foreign vessel may proceed between points in the United States embraced within the coastwise laws to discharge cargo or passengers laden at a foreign port, to lade cargo or passengers for a foreign port, in ballast, or to transport certain articles in accordance with § 4.93. Cargo laden at a foreign port may be retained onboard during such movements. Furthermore, certain barges of United
States or foreign flag may transport transferred merchandise between points in the United States embraced within the coastwise laws, excluding transportation between the continental United States and a noncontiguous point in the United States embraced within the coastwise laws, in accordance with § 4.81a.
(d) No vessel owned by a corporation which is a citizen of the United States under the Act of September 2, 1958 (46 U.S.C. 12118), shall be used in any trade other than the coastwise and shall not be used in that trade unless it is properly documented for such use or is exempt from documentation and is entitled to or, except for its tonnage, would be entitled to a coastwise license. Such a vessel shall not be documented for nor engage in the foreign trade or the fisheries and shall not transport merchandise or passengers coastwise for hire except as a service for a parent or a subsidiary corporation as defined in the aforesaid Act or while under demise or bareboat charter at prevailing rates for use otherwise than in trade with noncontiguous territory of the United States to a common or contract carrier subject to part III of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. 901 through 923), which otherwise qualifies as a citizen of the United States under section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended (46 U.S.C. 50501), and which is not connected, directly or indirectly, by way of ownership or control with such owning corporation.
(e) No vessel which has acquired the lawful right to engage in the coastwise trade, by virtue of having been built or documented under the laws of the United States, will have the right to engage in such trade if it:
(1) Thereafter has been sold foreign in whole or in part or placed under foreign registry, unless such vessel is 200 gross tons or less (as measured under chapter 143 of title 46, United States Code); or
(2) Has been rebuilt, unless the entire rebuilding, including the construction of any major components of the hull or superstructure of the vessel, was effected within the United States.
(f) No foreign-built vessel owned and documented as a vessel of the United States prior to February 1, 1920, by a citizen nor one owned by the United States on June 5, 1920, and sold to and owned by a citizen, shall engage in the American fisheries, but it is otherwise unlimited as to trade so long as it continues in such ownership (section 22, Merchant Marine Act, of June 5, 1920; 46 U.S.C. 13). No foreign-built vessel which is owned by a citizen, but which was not so owned and documented on February 1, 1920, or which was not owned by the United States on June 5, 1920, shall engage in the coastwise trade or the American fisheries. No foreign-built vessel which has been sold, leased, or chartered by the Secretary of Commerce to any citizen, shall engage in the American fisheries, but it is otherwise unlimited as to trade so long as it continues in such ownership, lease, or charter (section 9 of the Act of Sept. 7, 1916, as amended, 46 U.S.C. 56101 and 57109). A vessel engaged in taking out fishing parties for hire, unless it intends to proceed to a foreign port, is considered to be engaged in the coastwise trade and not the fisheries.
(g) Certain vessels not documented under the laws of the United States which are acquired by or made available to the Secretary of Commerce may be documented under section 3 of the Act of August 9, 1954 (50 U.S.C. 198). Such vessels shall not engage in the coastwise trade unless in possession of a valid unexpired permit to engage in that trade issued by the Secretary of Commerce under authority of section 3(c) of the said Act.
(h) A vessel which is at least 50 percent owned by a citizen as defined in 46 CFR subpart 68.05, and which, except for citizenship requirements, is otherwise entitled to be documented with a coastwise endorsement, may be documented with a limited coastwise endorsement, provided the vessel is owned by a not-for-profit oil spill response cooperative or by one or more members of such a cooperative who dedicate the vessel to the use of the cooperative (46 U.S.C. 12117). Notwithstanding 46 U.S.C. 55102, a vessel may be documented with such a limited endorsement even if formerly owned by a not-for-profit oil spill response cooperative or by one or more members thereof, as long as the citizenship criteria of 46 CFR subpart 68.05 are met. A vessel
so documented may operate on the navigable waters of the United States or in the Exclusive Economic Zone only for the purpose of training for oil spill cleanup operations; deploying equipment, supplies and personnel for cleanup operations; and recovering and/or transporting oil discharged in a spill. Such vessel may also engage in any other employment for which a registry or fishing endorsement is not required, and may qualify to operate for other purposes by meeting the applicable requirements of 46 CFR part 67.
(i) Any vessel, entitled to be documented and not so documented, employed in a trade for which a Certificate of Documentation is issued under the vessel documentation laws (see § 4.0(c)), other than a trade covered by a registry, is liable to a civil penalty of $500 for each port at which it arrives without the proper Certificate of Documentation on or before November 2, 2015, and $1,659 for each port at which it arrives without the proper Certificate of Documentation after November 2, 2015 (19 U.S.C. 1706a, as adjusted by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015). If such a vessel has on board any foreign merchandise (sea stores excepted), or any domestic taxable alcoholic beverages, on which the duty and taxes have not been paid or secured to be paid, the vessel and its cargo are subject to seizure and forfeiture.

§ 4.80a
Coastwise transportation of passengers.
(a) For the purposes of this section, the following terms will have the meaning set forth below:
(1)
Coastwise port
means a port in the U.S., its territories, or possessions embraced within the coastwise laws.
(2)
Nearby foreign port
means any foreign port in North America, Central America, the Bermuda Islands, or the West Indies (including the Bahama Islands, but not including the Leeward Islands of the Netherlands Antilles, i.e., Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao). A port in the U.S. Virgin Islands shall be treated as a nearby foreign port.
(3)
Distant foreign port
means any foreign port that is not a nearby port.
(4)
Embark
means a passenger boarding a vessel for the duration of a specific voyage and
disembark
means a passenger leaving a vessel at the conclusion of a specific voyage. The terms
embark
and
disembark
are not applicable to a passenger going ashore temporarily at a coastwise port who reboards the vessel and departs with it on sailing from the port.
(5)
Passenger
has the meaning defined in § 4.50(b).
(b) The applicability of the coastwise law (46 U.S.C. 55103) to a vessel not qualified to engage in the coastwise trade (i.e., either a foreign-flag vessel or a U.S.-flag vessel that is foreign-built or at one time has been under foreign-flag) which embarks a passenger at a coastwise port is as follows:
(1) If the passenger is on a voyage solely to one or more coastwise ports and the passenger disembarks or goes ashore temporarily at a coastwise port, there is a violation of the coastwise law.
(2) If the passenger is on a voyage to one or more coastwise ports and a nearby foreign port or ports (but at no other foreign port) and the passenger disembarks at a coastwise port other than the port of embarkation, there is a violation of the coastwise law.
(3) If the passenger is on a voyage to one or more coastwise ports and a distant foreign port or ports (whether or not the voyage includes a nearby foreign port or ports) and the passenger disembarks at a coastwise port, there is no violation of the coastwise law provided the passenger has proceeded with the vessel to a distant foreign port.
(c) An exception to the prohibition in this section is the transportation of passengers between ports in Puerto Rico and other ports in the U.S. on passenger vessels not qualified to engage in the coastwise trade. Such transportation is permitted until there is a finding under 46 U.S.C. 55104 that a
qualified U.S.-flag passenger vessel is available for such service.
(d) The owner or charterer of a foreign vessel or any other interested person may request from Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Cargo Security, Carriers
Immigration Branch, Office of International Trade, an advisory ruling as to whether a contemplated voyage would be considered to be coastwise transportation in violation of 46 U.S.C. 55103. Such a request shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of part 177, CBP Regulations (19 CFR part 177).
[T.D. 85-109, 50 FR 26984, July 1, 1985, as amended by T.D. 85-109, 50 FR 37519, Sept. 16, 1985; T.D. 99-27, 64 FR 13675, Mar. 22, 1999; CBP Dec. 12-21, 77 FR 73308, Dec. 10, 2012]
§ 4.80b
Coastwise transportation of merchandise.
(a)
Effect of manufacturing or processing at intermediate port or place.
A coastwise transportation of merchandise takes place, within the meaning of the coastwise laws, when merchandise laden at a point embraced within the coastwise laws (“coastwise point”) is unladen at another coastwise point, regardless of the origin or ultimate destination of the merchandise. However, merchandise is not transported coastwise if at an intermediate port or place other than a coastwise point (that is at a foreign port or place, or at a port or place in a territory or possession of the United States not subject to the coastwise laws), it is manufactured or processed into a new and different product, and the new and different product thereafter is transported to a coastwise point.
(b)
Request for ruling.
Interested parties may request an advisory ruling from Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Cargo Security, Carriers
Immigration Branch, Office of International Trade, as to whether a specific action taken or to be taken with respect to merchandise at the intermediate port or place will result in its becoming a new and different product for purposes of this section. The request shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of part 177 of this chapter.
[T.D. 79-193, 44 FR 42178, July 19, 1979, as amended by T.D. 91-77, 56 FR 46114, Sept. 10, 1991; 56 FR 47268, Sept. 18, 1991; T.D. 99-27, 64 FR 13675, Mar. 22, 1999]
§ 4.81
Reports of arrivals and departures in coastwise trade.
(a) No vessel which is documented with a coastwise license or registry endorsement or is owned by a citizen and exempt from documentation, and which is in ballast or laden only with domestic products or passengers being carried only between points in the United States shall be required to report arrival or to enter when coming into one port of the United States from any other such port, except as provided for in sections 4.83 and 4.84, nor to obtain a clearance, permit to proceed, or permission to depart when going from one port in the United States to any other such port except when transporting merchandise to a port in noncontinguous territory.
111
111
See § 4.84.
112-114
[Reserved]
(b) When the facts are as above stated except that the vessel is carrying bonded merchandise, the master shall report its arrival as provided for in § 4.2.
(c) [Reserved]
(d) The traveling Crew's Effects Declaration, Customs Form 1304 referred to in § 4.85 (b), (c), and (e) shall be deposited with the port director upon arrival at each port in the United States and finally surrendered to the appropriate Customs officer or director of the port where the vessel first departs directly for a foreign port.
(e) Before any foreign vessel departs in ballast, or solely with articles to be transported in accordance with § 4.93, from any port in the United States for any other such port, the master must apply to the port director for a permit to proceed by filing a Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300, in duplicate. If a vessel is proceeding in ballast and therefore the Cargo Declaration (Customs Form 1302) is omitted, the words “No merchandise on board” shall be inserted in item 16 of the Vessel Entrance or Clearance
Statement. However, articles to be transported in accordance with § 4.93 must be manifested on the Cargo Declaration, as required by § 4.93(c). Three copies of the Cargo Declaration must be filed with the port director. When the port director grants the permit by making an appropriate endorsement on the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement (see § 4.85(b)), the duplicate copy, together with two copies of the Cargo Declaration covering articles to be transported in accordance with § 4.93, must be returned to the master. The traveling Crew's Effects Declaration, Customs Form 1304, and all unused crewmembers' declarations on Customs Form 5129 will be placed in a sealed envelope addressed to the appropriate Customs officer at the next intended domestic port and returned to the master for delivery. The master must execute a receipt for all unused crewmembers' declarations which are returned to him. Immediately upon arrival at the next United States port the master must report his arrival to the port director. He must make entry within 48 hours by filing with the port director the permit to proceed on the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement received at the previous port, a newly executed Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, a Crew's Effects Declaration of all unentered articles acquired abroad by crewmembers which are still on board, a Ship's Stores Declaration, Customs Form 1303, in duplicate of the stores remaining on board, both copies of the Cargo Declaration covering articles transported in accordance with § 4.93, and the document of the vessel. The traveling Crew's Effects Declaration and all unused crewmembers' declarations on Customs Form 5129 returned at the prior port to the master must be delivered by him to the appropriate Customs officer.
(f) The master, licensed deck officer, or purser who enters or clears a vessel, or who obtains permission for a vessel to depart, when required under the provisions of this section or of § 4.82, § 4.84, § 4.85, § 4.87, § 4.89, or § 4.91 of the regulations of this part, may appear in person at the customhouse for that purpose, or any required oaths, related documents, and other papers properly executed by the master or other proper officer may be delivered at the customhouse by the vessel agent or other personal representative of the master.
(g) In lieu of the procedures stated in §§ 4.85 and 4.87 and at the option of the owner or operator, unmanned non-self-propelled barges specifically designed for carriage aboard a vessel and regularly carried aboard a vessel in the foreign trade, hereinafter referred to as LASH-type barges, may move under a simplified permit-to-proceed procedure as follows:
(1) At the port where a LASH-type barge begins a coastwise movement with inward foreign cargo, a permit to proceed on the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300, must be obtained. A single permit to proceed may be used for all the barges proceeding to the same port of unlading in the same town. An inward foreign manifest of the cargo in each barge, destined to the port of unlading shown on the permit to proceed, must be attached to each permit. At the port of unlading of the barge, report of arrival and entry must be made immediately upon arrival to the appropriate Customs officer by presentation of the permit to proceed, manifests, and a new Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300. If only part of the inward foreign cargo is unladen, a new permit to proceed must be obtained and the inward foreign manifests must be attached to it.
(2) At the port where a LASH-type barge begins a coastwise movement with export cargo, a permit to proceed on the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, CBP Form 1300, must be presented to the appropriate CBP officer. A single permit to proceed may be presented for all the barges proceeding from the same port of lading in the same tow. Required Electronic Export Information (EEI) for LASH-type barges must be filed at the port where the barges will be taken aboard a barge-carrying vessel. At the next port, a report of arrival must be made immediately upon arrival and entry must be made within 48 hours by presentation of the permit to proceed received upon departure from the prior port and a newly executed Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, CBP Form 1300.
(3) When foreign LASH-type barges are proceeding between ports of the United States under paragraph (e) of this section, a single permit to proceed may be used for all the barges proceeding to the same port in the same tow.
(4) In lieu of the master of the towing vessel executing and delivering documents required under permit-to-proceed procedures (see § 4.81(f)) at the port where a LASH-type barge begins a coastwise movement, the master of the towing vessel may designate in writing the owner or operator of the barges as his representative with authority to execute and deliver such documents at the customhouse. The owner or operator of the barges may designate representatives to perform such functions at ports or places where permit-to-proceed documents must be delivered. Documents obtained from Customs officers at one place by such a representative may be forwarded by any suitable means to the representative who must present them to Customs officers at another place, the only requirement being that the forms are properly completed and are presented within the prescribed time periods. Moreover, instead of a written designation from each master of a towing vessel, a blanket designation in writing from the owner or operator of one or more towing vessels on behalf of masters of their towing vessels, designating the owner or operator of the barges to be the representative of the master for purposes of executing and delivering permit-to-proceed documents, is authorized.
(5) [Reserved]
(6) When a LASH-type barge is proceeding to a place in the United States that is not a port of entry, § 101.4(a) and (b) of this chapter are applicable. No merchandise shall be unladen from a LASH-type barge until a permit or special license therefor is obtained in accordance with § 4.30 except that a single permit to unlade may be used for all barges that arrived at the port of unlading in the same tow.

Certain barges carrying merchandise transferred from another barge.
(a) A LASH-type barge (as defined in § 4.81(g)) documented as a vessel of the United States but not qualified to engage in the coastwise trade or a LASH-type barge of a nation found to grant reciprocal privileges to United States-flag LASH-type barges may transport inward foreign and export cargo between points embraced within the coastwise laws of the United States after the merchandise has been transferred to it from another LASH-type barge owned or leased by the same owner or operator. This section is not applicable to transportation between the continental United States and noncontiguous States, districts, territories, and possessions embraced within the coastwise laws. The permit to proceed shall include a statement that the unqualified LASH-type barge is owned or leased by the owner or operator of the LASH-type barge from which the merchandise was transferred.
(b) The following nations have been found to extend privileges reciprocal to those provided in paragraph (a) of this section to LASH-type barges of the United States:
Federal Republic of Germany.

§ 4.82
Touching at foreign port while in coastwise trade.
(a) A United States documented vessel with a registry or, coastwise endorsement, or both which, during a voyage between ports in the United States, touches at one or more foreign ports and there discharges or takes on merchandise, passengers, baggages, or mail shall obtain a permit to proceed or clearance at each port of lading in the United States for the foreign port or ports at which it is intended to touch. The Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms, Customs Form 1302-A (see § 4.63), shall show only
the cargo for foreign destination. (See §§ 4.61 and 4.87.)
(b) The master must also present to the port director a coastwise Cargo Declaration in triplicate of the merchandise to be transported via the foreign port or ports to the subsequent ports in the United States. It must describe the merchandise and show the marks and numbers of the packages, the names of the shippers and consignees, and the destinations. The port director will certify the two copies and return them to the master. Merchandise carried by the vessel in bond under a transportation entry pursuant to part 18 of this chapter is not to be shown on the coastwise Cargo Declaration.
(c) Upon arrival from the foreign port or ports at the subsequent port in the United States, a report of arrival and entry of the vessel shall be made, and tonnage taxes shall be paid.

§ 4.83
Trade between United States ports on the Great Lakes and other ports of the United States.
If a vessel proceeding from or to a port of the United States on the Great Lakes to or from any other port of the United States via the St. Lawrence River is intended to touch at any foreign port and does so touch, it will be subject to the usual requirements for manifesting, clearing, report of arrival, entry, payment of fees for entry and clearance, and tonnage taxes. Vessels which are boarded on the St. Lawrence River by Canadian authorities for the purposes of inspecting the vessel and taking a passing report are not deemed to have touched at a foreign port, provided that no ship's stores are landed or taken aboard and no other business is transacted at the port or place of boarding.

§ 4.84
Trade with noncontiguous territory.
(a) No foreign vessel will depart from a port in noncontiguous territory of the United States for any other port in noncontiguous territory or for any port in any State or the District of Columbia, nor from any port in any State or the District of Columbia for any port in noncontiguous territory, until a clearance for the vessel has been granted. Such a clearance will be granted in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 4.61 of the regulations of this part, including clearance of a vessel simultaneously engaged in one or more of the transactions listed in § 4.90(a)(4), (5), or (6) of this part. When merchandise is laden on a foreign vessel in noncontiguous territory other than Puerto Rico, for transportation on that vessel to a port in any State, the District of Columbia, or noncontiguous territory, and when this transportation is not forbidden by the coastwise laws, the merchandise may be laden and shipped without the filing of Electronic Export Information (EEI).
(b) The master of every foreign vessel arriving at a port in any State or the District of Columbia or in noncontiguous territory of the United States from a port in noncontiguous territory to which the coastwise laws do not apply (e.g., Virgin Islands and American Samoa), or arriving at any port in noncontiguous territory to which the coastwise laws do not apply from any place embraced within the coastwise laws, shall immediately report its arrival and make entry for the vessel within 48 hours after its arrival.
(c)(1) A vessel which is not required to clear but which is transporting merchandise from a port in any State or the District of Columbia to any noncontiguous territory of the United States (excluding Puerto Rico), or from Puerto Rico to any State or the District of Columbia, or any other noncontiguous territory, will not be permitted to depart without filing a complete manifest, when required by the Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Regulations (15 CFR part 30), and all required EEI, unless before the vessel departs an approved bond is filed for the timely production of the required documents, as specified in 15 CFR 30.47. Requests for permission to depart may be written or oral and permission to depart will be granted orally by the appropriate CBP officer. However, if the request is to depart prior to the filing of the required manifest and EEI, permission will not be granted unless the appropriate bond is on file. In the latter case, the CBP officer will keep a simplified record of the necessary information in order to assure that the manifest and EEI are filed within the required time period. The Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, CBP Form 1300 (see § 4.63(a)), required at the time of clearance is not required to be taken to obtain permission to depart.
(2) A vessel which is not required to clear but which is transporting merchandise from a port in any State or the District of Columbia to Puerto Rico must file a complete manifest, when required by the the Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Regulations (15 CFR part 30), and all required EEI within one business day after arrival, as defined in § 4.2(b) of this part, with the appropriate CBP officer in Puerto Rico. If the complete manifest and all required EEI are not filed with the appropriate CBP officer within that time frame, an appropriate bond must be filed with the CBP officer for the timely production of the required documents as specified in 15 CFR 30.47. In these instances when a bond is filed, the CBP officer will keep a simplified record of the necessary information in order to ensure that the manifest and EEI are filed not later than the seventh business day after arrival in Puerto Rico.
(d) Upon arrival of a vessel of the United States at a port in any State, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico from a port in noncontiguous territory other than Puerto Rico, the master must immediately report its arrival and must prepare, produce, and file a Cargo Declaration in the form and manner and at the times specified in §§ 4.7 and 4.9 but will not be required to make entry. If the vessel proceeds directly to another port in any State, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico, the master must prepare, produce, and file a Cargo Declaration in the form and manner and at the times specified in § 4.85 but no permit to proceed on the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, CBP Form 1300, will be required for the purposes of this paragraph. No cargo shall be unladen from any such vessel until Cargo Declarations have been filed and a permit to unlade has been issued in accordance with the procedure specified in § 4.30.
(e) No vessel shall bring guano to the United States from a guano island appertaining to the United States (see 48 U.S.C. 1411) unless such a vessel is entitled to engage in the coastwide trade.
(f) No vessel owned by a corporation which qualifies as a citizen under the Act of September 2, 1958 (46 U.S.C. 883-1) shall, while under demise or bareboat charter from such corporation, be granted clearance or permitted to depart in trade with noncontiguous territory.

§ 4.85
Vessels with residue cargo for domestic ports.
(a) Any foreign vessel or documented vessel with a registry endorsement, arriving from a foreign port with cargo or passengers manifested for ports in the United States other than the port of first arrival, may proceed with such cargo or passengers from port to port, provided a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.64 of this chapter relating to international carriers in a suitable
amount is on file with the director of the port of first entry.
115
No additional bond shall be required at subsequent ports of entry. Before the vessel departs from the port of first arrival, the master shall obtain from the port director a certified copy of the complete inward foreign manifest (hereinafter referred to as the traveling manifest). The certified copy shall have a legend similar to the following endorsed on the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300:

Certified to be a true copy of the original inward foreign manifest.
Signature and title
(b)(1) Before a vessel proceeds from one domestic port to another with cargo or passengers on board as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the master must present to the director of such port of departure an application in triplicate on Customs Form 1300 for a permit to proceed to the next port. When a port director grants the permit on Customs Form 1300, the following legend must be endorsed on the form:
Port

Permission is granted to proceed to the port named in item 12.
________
Signature and title
(2) The duplicate must be attached to the traveling manifest and the triplicate (the permit to proceed to be delivered at the next port) must be returned to the master, together with the traveling manifest and the vessel's document, if on deposit. If no inward foreign cargo or passengers are to be discharged at the next port, that fact must be indicated on Customs Form 1300 by inserting “To load only” in parentheses after the name of the port to which the vessel is to proceed. The traveling Crew's Effects Declaration covering articles acquired abroad by officers and members of the crew, together with the unused crewmembers' declarations prepared for such articles, will be placed in a sealed envelope addressed to the appropriate Customs officer at the next port and given to the master for delivery.
(c)(1) Upon the arrival of a vessel at the next and each succeeding domestic port with inward foreign cargo or passengers still on board, the master must immediately report its arrival and make entry within 48 hours. To make such entry, he must deliver to the port director the vessel's document, the permit to proceed (Customs Form 1300 endorsed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section), the traveling manifest, and the traveling Crew's Effects Declaration (Customs Form 1304), together with the crewmembers' declarations received on departure from the previous port. The master must also present an abstract manifest consisting of a newly executed Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300, a Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, and a Crew's Effects Declaration in duplicate of all unentered articles acquired abroad by officers and crewmembers which are still on board, a Ship's Stores Declaration, Customs Form 1303, in duplicate of the sea or ship's stores remaining on board, and if applicable, the Cargo Declaration required by § 4.86. The master must also update the data elements required on CBP Form I-418 that were electronically submitted via an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP for any passengers on board that are manifested for discharge at that port. If no inward foreign cargo or passengers are to be discharged, the Cargo Declaration or Passenger List may be omitted from the abstract manifest, and the following legend must be placed in item 15 of the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement:
Vessel on an inward foreign voyage with residue cargo/passengers for ________. No cargo or passengers for discharge at this port.
(2) The traveling manifest, together with a copy of the newly executed Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, will serve the purpose of a copy of an abstract manifest at the port where it is finally surrendered.
(d) If boarding is required before the port director will issue a permit or special license to lade or unlade, the abstract manifest described in paragraph (c) of this section shall be ready for presentation to the boarding officer.
(e) The traveling manifest shall be surrendered to the director of the final domestic port of discharge of the cargo, except that if residue foreign cargo remains on board for discharge at a foreign port or ports, the traveling manifest shall be surrendered at the final port of departure from the United States. However, it shall not be surrendered at the port from which the vessel departs for another United States port, via an intermediate foreign port, under § 4.89 if residue foreign cargo remains on board for discharge at a subsequent U.S. port. The traveling Crew's Effects Declaration shall be finally surrendered to the director of any port from which the vessel will depart directly for a foreign port.

without filing manifests and obtaining or delivering permits to proceed, and without the payment of entrance and clearance fees, or fees for receiving manifests and granting permits to proceed, duty on tonnage, tonnage tax, or light money. The license shall be granted subject to the condition that the vessel shall not engage in trade or violate the laws of the United States in any respect. Upon the vessel's arrival at any port or place within the U.S. or the U.S. Virgin Islands, the master shall comply with 19 U.S.C. 1433 by immediately reporting arrival at the nearest Customs facility or other place designated by the port director.

Warning:
This vessel is dutiable:

(2) If brought into the United States (including Puerto Rico) by a nonresident free of duty as part of personal effects and sold or chartered within one year from date of entry.
Any offer to sell or charter (for example, a listing with yacht brokers or agents) is considered evidence that the vessel was brought in for sale or charter to a resident or, if made within one year of entry of a vessel brought in free of duty as personal effects, that the vessel no longer is for the personal use of the non-resident.
If the vessel is sold or chartered, or offered for sale or charter, in the circumstances described, without the owner first having filed a consumption entry and having paid duty, the vessel may be subject to seizure or to a monetary claim equal to the value of the vessel. See Chapter 89, Additional U.S. Note 1, HTSUS, and subheadings 8903.10, 8903.91, 8903.92, 8903.99.10, 8903.99.20, and 8903.99.90, HTSUS.

§ 4.94a
Large yachts imported for sale.
(a)
General.
An otherwise dutiable vessel used primarily for recreation or pleasure and exceeding 79 feet in length that has been previously sold by a manufacturer or dealer to a retail consumer and that is imported with the intention to offer for sale at a boat show in the United States may qualify at the time of importation for a deferral of entry completion and deposit of duty. The following requirements and conditions will apply in connection with a deferral of entry completion and duty deposit under this section:
(1) The importer of record must certify to Customs in writing that the vessel is being imported pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1484b for sale at a boat show in the United States;
(2) The certification referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be accompanied by the posting of a single entry bond containing the terms and conditions set forth in appendix C of part 113 of this chapter. The bond will have a duration of 6 months after the
date of importation of the vessel, and no extensions of the bond period will be allowed;
(3) The filing of the certification and the posting of the bond in accordance with this section will permit Customs to determine whether the vessel may be released;
(4) All subsequent transactions with Customs involving the vessel in question, including any transaction referred to in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, must be carried out in the same port of entry in which the certification was filed and the bond was posted under this section; and
(5) The vessel in question will not be eligible for issuance of a cruising license under § 4.94 and must comply with the laws respecting vessel entry and clearance when moving between ports of entry during the 6-month bond period prescribed under this section.
(b)
Exportation within 6-month period.
If a vessel for which entry completion and duty payment are deferred under paragraph (a) of this section is not sold but is exported within the 6-month bond period specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the importer of record must inform Customs in writing of that fact within 30 calendar days after the date of exportation. The bond posted with Customs will be returned to the importer of record and no entry completion and duty payment will be required. The exported vessel will be precluded from reentry under the terms of paragraph (a) of this section for a period of 3 months after the date of exportation.
(c)
Sale within 6-month period.
If the sale of a vessel for which entry completion and duty payment are deferred under paragraph (a) of this section is completed within the 6-month bond period specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the importer of record within 15 calendar days after completion of the sale must complete the entry by filing an Entry Summary (Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent) and must deposit the appropriate duty (calculated at the applicable rates provided for under subheading 8903.91.00 or 8903.92.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and based upon the value of the vessel at the time of importation). Upon entry completion and deposit of duty under this paragraph, the bond posted with Customs will be returned to the importer of record.
(d)
Expiration of bond period.
If the 6-month bond period specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section expires without either the completed sale or the exportation of a vessel for which entry completion and duty payment are deferred under paragraph (a) of this section, the importer of record within 15 calendar days after expiration of that 6-month period must complete the entry by filing an Entry Summary (Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent) and must deposit the appropriate duty (calculated at the applicable rates provided for under subheading 8903.91.00 or 8903.92.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and based upon the value of the vessel at the time of importation). Upon entry completion and deposit of duty under this paragraph, the bond posted with Customs will be returned to the importer of record, and a new bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter, may be required by the Center director.

§ 4.96
Fisheries.
(a) As used in this section:
(1) The term “convention vessel” means a Canadian fishing vessel which, at the time of its arrival in the United States, is engaged only in the North Pacific halibut fishery and which is
therefore entitled to the privileges provided for by the Halibut Fishing Vessels Convention between the United States and Canada signed at Ottawa, Canada, on March 24, 1950 (T.D. 52862);
(2) The term “nonconvention fishing vessel” means any vessel other than a convention vessel which is employed in whole or in part in fishing at the time of its arrival in the United States and
(i) Which is documented under the laws of a foreign county,
(ii) Which is undocumented, of 5 net tons or over, and owned in whole or in part by a person other than a citizen of the United States, or
(iii) Which is undocumented, of less than 5 net tons, and owned in whole or in part by a person who is neither a citizen nor a resident of the United States;
(3) The term “nonconvention cargo vessel” means any vessel which is not employed in fishing at the time of its arrival in the United States, but which is engaged in whole or in part in the transportation of fish or fish products
131a
and
131a
Except as otherwise provided by treaty or convention to which the United States is a party, no foreign-flag vessel shall, whether documented as a cargo vessel or otherwise, land in a port of the United States its catch of fish taken on board such vessels on the high seas or fish products processed therefrom, or any fish or fish products taken on board such vessel on the high seas from a vessel engaged in fishing operations or in the processing of fish or fish products.” (46 U.S.C. 251)
132
[Reserved]
(i) Which is documented under the laws of a foreign country or
(ii) Which is undocumented and owned by a person other than a citizen of the United States;
(4) The term “treaty vessel” means a Canadian fishing vessel which at the time of its arrival in the United States is engaged in the albacore tuna fishery and which is therefore entitled to the privileges provided for by the treaty with Canada on Pacific Coast Albacore Tuna Vessels and Port Privileges, entered into force at Ottawa, Canada, on July 29, 1981 (T.D. 81-227); and
(5) The term “fishing” means the planting, cultivation, or taking of fish, shell fish, marine animals, pearls, shells, or marine vegetation, or the transportation of any of those marine products to the United States by the taking vessel or another vessel under the complete control and management of a common owner or bareboat charterer.
(b) Except as otherwise provided by treaty or convention to which the United States is a party (see paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section), no foreign-flag vessel shall, whether documented as a cargo vessel or otherwise, land in a port of the United States its catch of fish taken on board such vessel on the high seas or fish products processed therefrom, or any fish or fish products taken on board such vessel on the high seas from a vessel engaged in fishing operations or in the processing of fish or fish products. (46 U.S.C. 251). This prohibition applies regardless of the intended ultimate disposition of the fish or fish products (e.g., it applies to transshipments from the foreign vessel to another vessel in United States territorial waters; it applies to landing for transshipment in bond to Canada or Mexico; it applies to landing for exportation under bond; and it applies to landing in a Foreign Trade Zone). However, the prohibition is limited to fish, or fish products processed therefrom, taken on board the foreign vessel on the high seas.
(c) A vessel of the United States to be employed in the fisheries must have a Certificate of Documentation endorsed with a fishery license. “Fisheries” includes processing, storing, transporting (except in foreign commerce), planting, cultivating, catching, taking, or harvesting fish, shellfish, marine animals, pearls, shells, or marine vegetation in the navigable waters of the United States or the exclusive economic zone.
(d) A convention vessel may come into a port of entry on the Pacific coast of the United States, including Alaska, to land its catch of halibut and incidentally-caught sable fish, or to secure supplies, equipment, or repairs. Such a vessel may come into any other port of entry or, if properly authorized to do so under § 101.4(b) of this chapter, into any place other than a port of entry, for the purpose of securing supplies, equipment, or repairs only, but shall not land its catch. A convention vessel which comes into the United
States as provided for in this paragraph shall comply with the usual requirements applicable to foreign vessels arriving at and departing from ports of the United States.
(e) A nonconvention fishing vessel, other than a treaty vessel, may come into a port of entry in the United States or, if granted permission under § 101.4(b) of this chapter, into a place other than a port of entry for the purpose of securing supplies, equipment, or repairs, but shall not land its catch. A nonconvention fishing vessel which comes into the United States as provided for in this paragraph shall comply with the usual requirements applicable to foreign vessels arriving at and departing from ports of the United States.
(f) A nonconvention cargo vessel, although not prohibited by law from coming into the United States, shall not be permitted to land in the United States its catch of fish taken on the high seas or any fish or fish products taken on board on the high seas from a vessel employed in fishing or in the processing of fish or fish products, but may land fish taken on board at any place other than the high seas upon compliance with the usual requirements. Before any such fish may be landed the master shall satisfy the port director that the fish were not taken on board on the high seas by presenting declarations of the master and two or more officers or members of the crew of the vessel, of whom the person next in authority to the master shall be one, or other evidence acceptable to the port director which establishes the place of lading to his satisfaction.
(g) A treaty vessel may come into a port or place of the United States named in Annex B of the Treaty with Canada on Pacific Coast Albacore Tuna Vessels and Port Privileges to land its catch of albacore tuna, or to secure fuel, supplies, equipment and repairs. Such a vessel may come into any other port of entry or, if properly authorized to do so under § 101.4(b) of this chapter, into any place other than a port of entry, for the purpose of securing supplies, equipment, or repairs only, but shall not land its catch. A treaty vessel which comes into the United States as provided for in this paragraph shall comply with the usual requirements applicable to foreign vessels arriving at and departing from ports of the United States.
(h) A convention vessel, a nonconvention fishing vessel, a nonconvention cargo vessel, or a treaty vessel, which arrives in the United States in distress shall be subject to the usual requirements applicable to foreign vessels arriving in distress. While in the United States, supplies, equipment, or repairs may be secured, but, except as specified in the next sentence, fish shall not be landed unless the vessel's master, or other authorized representative of the owner, shows to the satisfaction of the port director that it will not be possible, by the exercise of due diligence, for the vessel to transport its catch to a foreign port without spoilage, in which event the port director may allow the vessel upon compliance with all applicable requirements, to land, transship, or otherwise dispose of its catch. Nothing herein shall prevent, upon compliance with normal Customs procedures, a convention vessel arriving in distress from landing its catch of halibut and incidentally-caught sable fish at a port of entry on the Pacific coast, including Alaska; a foreign cargo vessel arriving in distress from landing its cargo of fish taken on board at any place not on the high seas; or a treaty vessel arriving in distress from landing its catch of albacore tuna at a port of entry on the Pacific coast, including Alaska.

Salvage vessels.
(a) Only a vessel of the United States, a numbered motorboat owned by a citizen, or a vessel operating within the purview of paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, shall engage in any salvage operation in territorial waters of the United States unless an application addressed to the Commissioner of Customs to use another specified vessel in
a completely described operation has been granted.
133
133
“No foreign vessel shall, under penalty of forfeiture, engage in salvaging operations on the Atlantic or Pacific coast of the United States, in any portion of the Great Lakes or their connecting or tributary waters, including any portion of the Saint Lawrence River through which the international boundary line extends, or in territorial waters of the United States on the Gulf of Mexico, except when authorized by a treaty or in accordance with the provisions of section 725 of this title:
Provided, however,
That if, on investigation, the Secretary of the Treasury is satisfied that no suitable vessel wholly owned by a person who is a citizen of the United States and documented under the laws of the United States or numbered pursuant to section 288 of this title, is available in any particular locality he may authorize the use of a foreign vessel or vessels in salvaging operations in that locality and no penalty shall be incurred for such authorized use.” (46 U.S.C. 316(d))
“Nothing in this section shall be held or construed to prohibit or restrict any assistance to vessels or salvage operations authorized by Article II of the treaty between the United States and Great Britain ‘concerning reciprocal rights for United States and Canada in the conveyance of prisoners and wrecking and salvage’ signed at Washington, May 18, 1908 (35 Stat. 2036), or by the treaty between the United States and Mexico ‘to facilitate assistance to and salvage of vessels in territorial waters,’ signed at Mexico City, June 13, 1935 (49 Stat. 3359).” (46 U.S.C. 316(e))
(b) Upon receipt of such an application, the Commissioner of Customs will cause an investigation to be made immediately to determine whether a suitable vessel of the United States or a suitable numbered motorboat owned by a citizen is available for the operation. If he finds that no such vessel is available and that the facts otherwise warrant favorable action, he will grant the application.
(c) If the application is granted, the applicant shall make a full report of the operation as soon as possible to the director of the port nearest the place where the operation was conducted.
(d) A Canadian vessel may engage in salvage operations on any vessel in any territorial waters of the United States in which Canadian vessels are permitted to conduct such operations by article II of the treaty between the United States and Great Britain signed on May 18, 1908,
134
or by section 725, title 46, United States Code.
135
If any such vessel engages in a salvage operation in territorial waters of the United States, the owner or master of the vessel shall make a full report of the operation as soon as possible to the director of the port nearest the place where the operation was conducted.
134
“The High Contracting Parties agree that vessels and wrecking appliances, either from the United States or from the Dominion of Canada, may salve any property wrecked and may render aid and assistance to any vessels wrecked, disabled or in distress in the waters or on the shores of the other country in that portion of the St. Lawrence River through which the International Boundary line extends, and, in Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior, and in the Rivers Niagara, Detroit, St. Clair, and Ste. Marie, and the Canals at Sault Ste. Marie, and on the shores and in the waters of the other country along the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts within a distance of thirty miles from the International Boundary on such Coasts.
“It is further agreed that such reciprocal wrecking and salvage privileges shall include all necessary towing incident thereto, and that nothing in the Customs, Coasting or other laws or regulations of either country shall restrict in any manner the salving operations of such vessels or wrecking appliances.
“Vessels from either country employed in salving in the waters of the other shall, as soon as practicable afterwards, make full report at the nearest custom house of the country in whose waters such salving takes place.” (35 Stat. 2036)
135
“Canadian vessels and wrecking appurtenance may render aid and assistance to Canadian or other vessels and property wrecked, disabled, or in distress in the waters of the United States contiguous to the Dominion of Canada.
“This section shall be construed to apply to the canal and improvement of the waters between Lake Erie and Lake Huron, and to the waters of the Saint Mary's River and Canal: * * *.” (46 U.S.C. 725)
The waters of Lake Michigan are not contiguous to the Dominion of Canada within the meaning of this statute.

§ 7.2
Insular possessions of the United States other than Puerto Rico.
(a) Insular possessions of the United States other than Puerto Rico are also American territory but, because those insular possessions are outside the customs territory of the United States, goods imported therefrom are subject to the rates of duty set forth in column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) except as otherwise provided in § 7.3 or in part 148 of this chapter. The principal such insular possessions are the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island, Midway Islands, and Johnston Atoll. Pursuant to section 603(c) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union With the United States of America, Public Law 94-241, 90 Stat. 263, 270, goods imported from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are entitled to the same tariff treatment as imports from Guam and thus are also subject to the provisions of § 7.3 and of part 148 of this chapter.
(b) Importations into Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island, Midway Islands, Johnston Atoll, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are not governed by the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, or the regulations contained in this chapter. The customs administration of Guam is under the Government of Guam. The customs administration of American Samoa is under the Government of American Samoa. The customs administration of Wake Island is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Air Force (General Counsel). The customs administration of Midway Islands is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy. There is no customs authority on Johnston Atoll, which is under the operational control of the Defense Nuclear Agency. The customs administration of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is under the Government of the Commonwealth.
(c) The Secretary of the Treasury administers the customs laws of the U.S. Virgin Islands through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The importation of goods into the U.S. Virgin Islands is governed by Virgin Islands law; however, in situations where there is no applicable Virgin Islands law or no U.S. law specifically made applicable to the Virgin Islands, U.S. laws and regulations shall be used as a guide and be complied with as nearly as possible. Tariff classification of, and rates of duty applicable to, goods imported into the U.S. Virgin Islands are established by the Virgin Islands legislature.

§ 7.3
Duty-free treatment of goods imported from insular possessions of the United States other than Puerto Rico.
(a)
General.
Under the provisions of General Note 3(a)(iv), Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), the following goods may be eligible for duty-free treatment when imported into the customs territory of the United States from an insular possession of the United States:

possession, and goods which were manufactured or produced in any such insular possession from materials that were the growth, product or manufacture of any such insular possession or of the customs territory of the United States, or of both, provided that such goods:
(i) Do not contain foreign materials valued at either more than 70 percent of the total value of the goods or, in the case of goods described in section 213(b) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)), more than 50 percent of the total value of the goods; and
(ii) Come to the customs territory of the United States directly from any such insular possession; and

(ii) There was no remission, refund or drawback of such duties or taxes in connection with the shipment of the goods from the United States to the insular possession.
(b)
Origin of goods.
For purposes of this section, goods will be considered to be the growth or product of, or manufactured or produced in, an insular possession if:
(1) The goods are wholly the growth or product of the insular possession; or
(2) The goods became a new and different article of commerce as a result of production or manufacture performed in the insular possession.
(c)
Foreign materials.
For purposes of this section, the term “foreign materials” covers any material incorporated in goods described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section other than:
(1) A material which was wholly the growth or product of an insular possession or of the customs territory of the United States;
(2) A material which was substantially transformed in an insular possession or in the customs territory of the United States into a new and different article of commerce which was then used in an insular possession in the production or manufacture of a new and different article which is shipped directly to the United States; or
(3) A material which may be imported into the customs territory of the United States from a foreign country and entered free of duty either:
(i) At the time the goods which incorporate the material are entered; or
(ii) At the time the material is imported into the insular possession, provided that the material was incorporated into the goods during the 18-month period after the date on which the material was imported into the insular possession.
(d)
Foreign materials value limitation.
For purposes of this section, the determination of whether goods contain foreign materials valued at more than 70 or 50 percent of the total value of the goods will be made based on a comparison between:
(1) The landed cost of the foreign materials, consisting of:
(i) The manufacturer's actual cost for the materials or, where a material is provided to the manufacturer without charge or at less than fair market value, the sum of all expenses incurred in the growth, production, or manufacture of the material, including general expenses, plus an amount for profit; and
(ii) The cost of transporting those materials to the insular possession, but excluding any duties or taxes assessed on the materials by the insular possession and any charges which may accrue after landing; and
(2) The final appraised value of the goods imported into the customs territory of the United States, as determined in accordance with section 402 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a).
(e)
Direct shipment
—(1)
General.
For purposes of this section, goods will be considered to come to the United States directly from an insular possession, or to be shipped from the United States directly to an insular possession and returned from the insular possession to the United States by direct shipment, only if:
(i) The goods proceed directly to or from the insular possession without passing through any foreign territory or country;
(ii) The goods proceed to or from the insular possession through a foreign territory or country, the goods do not enter into the commerce of the foreign territory or country while en route to the insular possession or the United States, and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the insular possession or the United States as the final destination; or
(iii) The goods proceed to or from the insular possession through a foreign territory or country, the invoices and other shipping documents do not show the insular possession or the United States as the final destination, and the goods:
(A) Remained under the control of the customs authority of the foreign territory or country;
(B) Did not enter into the commerce of the foreign territory or country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the Center director is satisfied that the importation into the insular possession or the United States results from the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the latter's sales agent; and
(C) Were not subjected to operations in the foreign territory or country other than loading and unloading and other activities necessary to preserve the goods in good condition.
(2)
Evidence of direct shipment.
The Center director may require that appropriate shipping papers, invoices, or other documents be submitted within 60 days of the date of entry as evidence that the goods were shipped to the United States directly from an insular possession or shipped from the United States directly to an insular possession and returned from the insular possession to the United States by direct shipment within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and such evidence of direct shipment will be subject to such verification as deemed necessary by the Center director. Evidence of direct shipment will not be required when the Center director is otherwise satisfied, taking into consideration the kind and value of the merchandise, that the goods qualify for duty-free treatment under General Note 3(a)(iv), HTSUS, and paragraph (a) of this section.
(f)
Documentation.
(1) When goods are sought to be admitted free of duty as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an importer must have in his possession at the time of entry or entry summary a completed certificate of origin on CBP Form 3229, or its electronic equivalent, showing that the goods comply with the requirements for duty-free entry set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The importer must provide CBP Form 3229, or its electronic equivalent, upon request by the Center director or his delegate. Except in the case of goods which incorporate a material described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a certificate of origin will not be required for any shipment eligible for informal entry under § 143.21 of this chapter or in any case where the Center director is otherwise satisfied that the goods qualify for duty-free treatment under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(2) When goods in a shipment not eligible for informal entry under § 143.21 of this chapter are sought to be admitted free of duty as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the following declarations must be filed with the entry/entry summary unless the Center director is satisfied by reason of the nature of the goods or otherwise that the goods qualify for such duty-free entry:

§ 7.4
Watches and watch movements from U.S. insular possessions.
(a) The issuance of an International Trade Administration Form ITA-360, Certificate of Entitlement to Secure the Refund of Duties on Watches and Watch Movements, by the Department of Commerce, authorizes a producer of watches in the U.S. insular possessions to file requests with CBP for the refund of duties paid on imports of watches, watch movements (including solid state watches and watch movements), and watch parts (excepting separate watch cases and any articles containing any materials to which rates of duty set forth in Column 2, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202) apply). The amount of the refund requested may be up to the value specified in the certificate, provided that the articles for which refunds are requested were entered during a 3-year period beginning 2 years before the date of issuance of the Form ITA-360 certificate from the Department of Commerce.
(b) The Form ITA-360 may not be used to secure refunds. To secure a refund, the party requesting the refund of duties (claimant) must present to CBP Form ITA-361, Request for Refund of Duties on Watches and Watch Movements, properly executed, and authenticated by the Department of Commerce.
(c) By completing Form ITA-361, the insular producer may either:
(1) Transfer its entitlement, in whole or in part, to any other party for any consideration agreed to by the insular producer and the transferee, or
(2) Request the refund of duties to itself.
(d) A claimant must file Form ITA-361 with CBP at the same port where the watch import entry was originally filed and duties paid. The documentation accompanying Form ITA-361 shall include a copy of the import entry, providing proof that duty was paid on the watches and watch movements.
(e) When requesting the refund of duties on Form ITA-361, the claimant also must complete and submit to CBP the declaration on the form which reads as follows:
I declare that the information given above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief; that no notices of exportation of articles with benefit of drawback were filed upon exportation of this merchandise from the United States; that no liquidated refunds on the articles relating to the present claim have been paid; and that no protest or request for litigation for refund of duties paid and herewith claimed has been made.
(f) A fee of 1 percent will be deducted from each refund request as reimbursement to salaries and expenses of those CBP personnel processing the request.
(g) Form ITA-360 expires 1 year from its date of issuance. Any refund request on Form ITA-361 made by either the insular producer itself or any transferee named on Form ITA-360 must be filed within this 1-year period. This expiration date applies equally to all refund requests, whether a single request for the entire amount specified in the Form ITA-361 certificate or multiple requests for partial amounts. Refund requests will be accepted until either the amount specified in the certificate is depleted or until the certificate expires 1 year from its date of issuance.
(h) CBP will process only those refund requests made in accordance with the joint rules of the Departments of Commerce and the Interior governing the issuance and handling of certificates and the transfer of entitlements as contained in 15 CFR part 303.

§ 10.3
Drawback; internal-revenue tax.
(a) Except as prescribed in § 10.1(f) or in paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section, no free entry shall be allowed under Chapter 98, Subchapter 1, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), in the final liquidation of an entry unless the Center director is satisfied by the certificate of exportation or other evidence or information that no drawback was allowed in connection with the exportation from the United States, and unless no internal-revenue tax is imposed on the importation of like articles not previously exported from the United States or, if such tax is being imposed at the time of entry for consumption or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, the Center director is satisfied that an internal-revenue tax on production or importation was paid in respect of the imported article before it was exported from the United States and was not refunded. Except as provided for in § 10.1(f), when it is impracticable, because of the destruction of Customs
records or other circumstances, to determine whether drawback was allowed, or the amount of drawback allowed, with respect to an article established to be a returned product of the United States which has not been advanced in value or improved in condition while abroad, there shall be assessed on the returned article an amount of duty determined as follows:
(1) If there is any likelihood that drawback was allowable on the exportation of like articles at any time when the imported article may have been exported from the United States, the estimated amount of any drawback which would have been allowable if duty had been paid on any foreign merchandise likely to have been used in the manufacture of the returned article at the rate or rates applicable to such foreign merchandise on the date of importation of the returned article (see paragraph (b) of this section), and
(2) If there is any likelihood that a refund or remission of tax was allowed on the exportation of the returned article, the amount of any internal-revenue tax which would be payable at the time of importation if the returned article were wholly of foreign origin, but in no such case shall there be assessed more than an amount equal to the duty and tax that would apply if the returned article were wholly of foreign origin and originally imported. (See § 10.7(a).) Except as provided for in § 10.1(f), if the imported article is of a kind which would be subject to an internal-revenue tax if of foreign origin and payment of an internal-revenue tax before exportation without refund thereof is not established, duty shall be assessed on the imported article in an amount equal to the internal-revenue tax imposed at the time of entry for consumption or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption on like articles of foreign origin, plus the amount of any drawback allowed on the exportation of the article from the United States; but if no drawback was allowed, the duty equal to internal-revenue tax shall be the total duty to be assessed. If an allowance of drawback on the exportation from the United States of the imported article is established, duty shall be assessed in an amount equal to such drawback, plus an amount equal to any internal-revenue tax which may be assessable in accordance with this paragraph; but in no case shall duty equal to drawback, or to drawback and internal-revenue tax, be assessed in an amount in excess of the ordinary Customs duty and internal-revenue tax applicable to like articles of foreign origin. In any case, where payment of internal-revenue tax before exportation without refund thereof is established, no duty equal to an internal-revenue tax currently in force shall be assessed.
(b) In the absence of satisfactory evidence as to the nonallowance of drawback or the amount thereof allowed on the following articles of American manufacture or production, duty shall be assessed thereon in the amounts respectively indicated, the amount shown in each case being considered the fair average amount of drawback allowed on such articles:

(f) Whenever boxes or barrels alleged to have been manufactured from American shooks or staves are shipped to the United States from a person abroad other than the one to whom they were exported from the United States, the importer shall be required to obtain from the foreign consignee to whom the shooks or staves were originally exported from this country the certificate or certificates, Customs Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, covering the exportation of the shooks or staves from the United States, or an
extract therefrom signed by such consignee, showing the number of shooks or staves covered by such certificate or certificates, together with the number of superficial feet of such shooks or staves. Such Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, or extract therefrom, shall be filed by the importer in connection with the entry of the boxes or barrels.
(g) Accounts shall be kept by the director of the port of exportation of the shooks and staves as to each exportation thereof and as to the returns thereof in boxes, barrels, etc. Notifications of such returns shall be given to the port of exportation by the director of the port of importation.

(h) A record of cloth boards of domestic manufacture exported to be wrapped with foreign textiles shall be kept by the port director in a similar manner as for shooks and staves. Cloth boards of domestic manufacture are conditionally free of duty under Chapter 98, subchapter 1, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). If such boards are advanced in value or improved in condition while abroad, free entry shall be denied on importation.

An importer, seeking an exemption from duty on account of boxes or barrels made from American shooks or staves, must make such a claim on Customs Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, at the time of filing the entry. Upon receipt, from the director of the port of exportation of the shooks and staves, of corroboration that the records of exportation do not conflict materially with such a claim, the exemption may be allowed. If the claim for an exemption is disallowed in full or in part, the importer may file a request within 15 days of the date of the port director's notice to him of any disallowance, for referral of the question to the Commissioner of Customs for review.

# Articles Assembled Abroad With United States Components
§ 10.11
General.
(a) Sections 10.12 through 10.23 set forth definitions and interpretative regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Customs pertaining to the construction of subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202) and related provisions of law. These provisions concern claims for the exemption from duty provided by subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), for American-made fabricated components which are returned to the United States as parts of articles assembled abroad. The examples included in these sections describe specific situations in which the exemption may or may not be applicable. The definitions and regulations that follow are promulgated to inform the public of the constructions and interpretations that the United States Customs Service shall give to relevant statutory terms and to assure the impartial and uniform assessment of duties upon merchandise claimed to be partially exempt from duty under subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), at the various ports of entry. Nothing in these regulations purports or is intended to restrict the legal right of importers or others to a judicial review of the matters contained therein.
(b) Section 10.24 sets forth the documentary requirements applicable to the entry of assembled articles claimed to be subject to the exemption provided under subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202). Allowance of an importer's claim is dependent upon meeting the statutory requirements for the exemption under subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202) and his complying with the documentary requirements set forth in § 10.24.
[T.D. 75-230, 40 FR 43021, Sept. 18, 1975, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51247, Dec. 21, 1988; T.D. 97-82, 62 FR 51769, Oct. 3, 1997]
§ 10.12
Definitions.
As used in §§ 10.11 through 10.24, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
(a)
American-made.
The term “American-made” is used to refer to a product of the United States as defined in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Assembly.
“Assembly” means the fitting or joining together of fabricated components.
(c)
Exemption.
“Exemption” means the deduction of the cost or value of products of the United States which were assembled abroad in accordance with the requirements of subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202),
from the full value of the assembled article.
(d)
Fabricated component.
“Fabricated component” means a manufactured article ready for assembly in the condition as exported except for operations incidental to the assembly.
(e)
Product of the United States.
A “product of the United States” is an article manufactured within the Customs territory of the United States and may consist wholly of United States components or materials, of United States and foreign components or materials, or wholly of foreign components or materials. If the article consists wholly or partially of foreign components or materials, the manufacturing process must be such that the foreign components or materials have been substantially transformed into a new and different article, or have been merged into a new and different article.
[T.D. 75-230, 40 FR 43021, Sept. 18, 1975, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51247, Dec. 21, 1988]
§ 10.13
Statutory provision: Subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).
Subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), (19 U.S.C. 1202), provides that articles assembled abroad in whole or in part of fabricated components, the product of the United States, which (a) were exported in condition ready for assembly without further fabrication, (b) have not lost their physical identity in such articles by change in form, shape, or otherwise, and (c) have not been advanced in value or improved in condition abroad except by being assembled and except by operations incidental to the assembly process such as cleaning, lubricating, and painting, are subject to a duty upon the full value of the imported article, less the cost or, if no charge is made, the value of such products of the United States. The rate of duty which is assessed upon the dutiable portion of the imported article is that which is applicable to the imported article as a whole under the appropriate provision of the HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202) for such article. If that provision requires a specific or compound rate of duty, the total duties assessed on the imported article are reduced in such proportion as the cost or value of the returned United States components which qualify for the exemption bears to the full value of the assembled article.

# Example 1.
A transistor radio is assembled abroad from foreign-made components and American-made transistors. Upon importation, the transistor radio is subject to the ad valorem rate of duty applicable to transistor radios upon the value of the radio less the cost or value of the American-made transistors assembled therein.

# Example 2.
A solid-state watch movement is assembled abroad from foreign-made components and an American-made integrated circuit. If the movement in question is subject to the specific rate of duty of 75 cents if the value of the assembled movement is $30, and if the value of the American-made integrated circuit is $10, then the value of the integrated circuit represents one third of the total value of the assembled article and the duty on the assembled article will be reduced by one third ($.25). Therefore, the duty on the assembled movement is 50 cents.
[T.D. 75-230, 40 FR 43021, Sept. 18, 1975, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51247, Dec. 21, 1988]
§ 10.14
Fabricated components subject to the exemption.
(a)
Fabricated components, the product of the United States.
Except as provided in § 10.15, the exemption provided under subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), applies to fabricated components, the product of the United States. The components must be in condition ready for assembly without further fabrication at the time of their exportation from the United States to qualify for the exemption. Components will not lose their entitlement to the exemption by being subjected to operations incidental to the assembly either before, during, or after their assembly with other components. Materials undefined in final dimensions and shapes, which are cut into specific shapes or patterns abroad are not considered fabricated components.

# Example 1.
Articles identifiable in their exported condition as components or parts of the article into which they will be assembled, such as transistors, diodes, integrated circuits, machinery parts, or precut parts of
wearing apparel, are regarded as fabricated components.

# Example 2.
Prestamped metal lead frames for semiconductor devices exported in multiple unit strips in which the individual frame units are connected to each other, or integrated circuit wafers containing individual integrated circuit dice which have been scribed or scored in the United States, are regarded as fabricated components. The separation of the individual frames by cutting, or the segmentation of the wafer into individual dice by flexing and breaking along scribed or scored lines, is regarded as an operation incidental to the assembly process.

# Example 3.
Wires of various type, electrical conductors, metal foils, insulating tapes, ribbons, findings used in dressmaking, and similar products, which are in a finished state when exported from the United States, and are ready for use in the assembly of the imported article, are regarded as fabricated components if they are only cut to length or subjected to operations incidental to the assembly process while abroad.

# Example 4.
Uncut textile fabrics exported in bolts from which wearing apparel components will be cut according to a pattern are not regarded as fabricated components. Similarly, other materials, such as lumber, leather, sheet metal, plastic sheeting, exported in basic shapes and forms to be fabricated into components for assembly, are not eligible for treatment as fabricated components.
(b)
Substantial transformation of foreign-made articles or materials.
Foreign-made articles or materials may become products of the United States if they undergo a process of manufacture in the United States which results in their substantial transformation. Substantial transformation occurs when, as a result of manufacturing processes, a new and different article emerges, having a distinctive name, character, or use, which is different from that originally possessed by the article or material before being subject to the manufacturing process. The mere finishing or modification of a partially or nearly complete foreign product in the United States will not result in the substantial transformation of such product and it remains the product of a foreign country.

# Example 1.
A cast metal housing for a valve is made in the United States from imported copper ingots, the product of a foreign country. The housing is a product of the United States because the manufacturing operations performed in the United States to produce the housing resulted in a substantial transformation of the foreign copper ingots.

# Example 2.
An integrated circuit device is assembled in a foreign country and imported into the United States where its leads are formed by bending them to a specified angle. It is then tested and marked. The imported article does not become a product of the United States because the operations performed in the United States do not result in a substantial transformation of the foreign integrated circuit device.

# Example 3.
A circuit board assembly for a computer is assembled in the United States by soldering American-made and foreign-made components onto an American-made printed circuit board. The finished circuit board assembly has a distinct electronic function and is ready for incorporation into the computer. The foreign-made components have undergone a substantial transformation by becoming permanent parts of the circuit board assembly. The circuit board assembly, including all of its parts is regarded as a fabricated component, the product of the United States, for purposes of subheading 9802.00.80, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202).
[T.D. 75-230, 40 FR 43022, Sept. 18, 1975, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51247, Dec. 21, 1988]
§ 10.15
Fabricated components not subject to the exemption.
Fabricated components which are not products of the United States are excluded from the exemption. In addition, the exemption is not applicable to any component exported from the Customs territory of the United States:
(a) From continuous Customs custody with remission, abatement, or refund of duty;
(b) With benefit of drawback;
(c) To comply with any law of the United States or regulation of any Federal agency requiring exportation; or
(d) After manufacture or production in the United States under subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202).

# Example.
Partially completed components of an electric motor are imported in several separate shipments and are entered under a temporary importation bond to be manufactured into finished motors under the provisions of subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202). The components are completed and assembled into finished electric motors. The finished motors are exported and are assembled abroad into electric fans which are subsequently imported into the United States. Irrespective of the fact that the assembly of the motors might involve such a substantial change that the motor could be
considered a product of the United States, no exemption may be given for the value of the electric motors, since they were exported after manufacture or production in the United States under the provision of subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202).
[T.D. 75-230, 40 FR 43023, Sept. 18, 1975, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51247, Dec. 21, 1988]
§ 10.16
Assembly abroad.
(a)
Assembly operations.
The assembly operations performed abroad may consist of any method used to join or fit together solid components, such as welding, soldering, riveting, force fitting, gluing, laminating, sewing, or the use of fasteners, and may be preceded, accompanied, or followed by operations incidental to the assembly as illustrated in paragraph (b) of this section. The mixing or combining of liquids, gases, chemicals, food ingredients, and amorphous solids with each other or with solid components is not regarded as an assembly.

# Example 1.
A television yoke is assembled abroad from American-made magnet wire. In the foreign assembly plant the wire is despooled and wound into a coil, the wire cut from the spool, and the coil united with other components, including a terminal panel and housing which are also American-made. The completed article upon importation would be subject to the ad valorem rate of duty applicable to television parts upon the value of the yoke less the cost or value of the American-made wire, terminal panel and housing, assembled therein. The winding and cutting of the wire are either assembly steps or steps incidental to assembly.

# Example 2.
An aluminum electrolytic capacitor is assembled abroad from American-made aluminum foil, paper, tape, and Mylar film. In the foreign assembly plant the aluminum foil is trimmed to the desired width, cut to the desired length, interleaved with paper, which may or may not be cut to length or despooled from a continuous length, and rolled into a cylinder wherein the foil and paper are cut and a section of sealing tape fastened to the surface to prevent these components from unwinding. Wire or other electric connectors are bonded at appropriate intervals to the aluminum foil of the cylinder which is then inserted into a metal can, and the ends closed with a protective washer. As imported, the capacitor is subject to the ad valorem rate of duty applicable to capacitors upon the value less the cost or value of the American-made foil, paper, tape, and Mylar film. The operations performed on these components are all either assembly steps or steps incidental to assembly.

# Example 3.
The manufacture abroad of cloth on a loom using thread or yarn exported from the United States on spools, cops, or pirns is not considered an assembly but a weaving operation, and the thread or yarn does not qualify for the exemption. However, American-made thread used to sew buttons or garment components is qualified for the exemption because it is used in an operation involving the assembly of solid components.
(b)
Operations incidental to the assembly process.
Operations incidental to the assembly process whether performed before, during, or after assembly, do not constitute further fabrication, and will not preclude the application of the exemption. The following are examples of operations which are incidental to the assembly process:
(1) Cleaning;
(2) Removal of rust, grease, paint, or other preservative coating;
(3) Application of paint or preservative coating, including preservative metallic coating, lubricants, or protective encapsulation;
(4) Trimming, filing, or cutting off of small amounts of excess materials;
(5) Adjustments in the shape or form of a component to the extent required by the assembly being performed abroad;
(6) Cutting to length of wire, thread, tape, foil, and similar products exported in continuous length; separation by cutting of finished components, such as prestamped integrated circuit lead frames exported in multiple unit strips; and
(7) Final calibration, testing, marking, sorting, pressing, and folding of assembled articles.
(c)
Operations not incidental to the assembly process.
Any significant process, operation, or treatment other than assembly whose primary purpose is the fabrication, completion, physical or chemical improvement of a component, or which is not related to the assembly process, whether or not it effects a substantial transformation of the article, will not be regarded as incidental to the assembly and will preclude the application of the exemption to such article. The following are examples of operations not considered incidental to
the assembly as provided under subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202):
(1) Melting of exported ingots and pouring of the metal into molds to produce cast metal parts;
(2) Cutting of garment parts according to pattern from exported material;
(3) Chemical treatment of components or assembled articles to impart new characteristics, such as showerproofing, permapressing, sanforizing, dying or bleaching of textiles;
(4) Machining, polishing, burnishing, peening, plating (other than plating incidental to the assembly), embossing, pressing, stamping, extruding, drawing, annealing, tempering, case hardening, and any other operation, treatment or process which imparts significant new characteristics or qualities to the article affected.
(d)
Joining of American-made and foreign-made components.
An assembly operation may involve the use of American-made components and foreign-made components. The various requirements for establishing entitlement to the exemption apply only to the American-made components of the assembly.

# Example.
Diodes are assembled abroad from American-made components. The process includes the encapsulation of the assembled components in a plastic shell. The plastic used for the encapsulation is in the form of a pellet, and is of foreign origin. After the prefabricated diode components are assembled, the assembled unit is placed in a transfer molding machine, where, by use of the pellet, molten epoxy is caused to flow around the perimeters of the assembled components, forming upon solidification a plastic body for the diode. Upon importation, exemption may be granted for the value of the American-made components, but not for the value of the plastic pellet. If the plastic pellet used for encapsulation was of United States origin, its value would still be a part of the dutiable value of the diode, because the plastic pellet is not a fabricated component of a type designed to be fitted together by assembly, but merely a premeasured quantity of material which was applied to the assembled unit by a process not constituting an assembly.
(e)
Subassembly.
An assembly operation may involve the joining or fitting of American-made components into a part or subassembly of an article, followed by the installation of the part or subassembly into the complete article.

# Example.
Rolls of foil and rolls of paper are exported and cut to specific length abroad and interleaved and rolled to form the electrodes and dielectric of a capacitor. Following this procedure, the rolls are assembled with cans and other parts to form a complete capacitor. The foil and paper are entitled to the exemption.
(f)
Packing.
The packing abroad of merchandise into containers does not in itself qualify either the containers or their contents for the exemption. However, assembled articles which otherwise qualify for the exemption and which are packaged abroad following their assembly will not be disqualified from the exemption by reason of their having been so packaged, whether for retail sale or for bulk shipment. The tariff status of the packing materials or containers will be determined in accordance with General Rule of Interpretation 5, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202).
[T.D. 75-230, 40 FR 43023, Sept. 18, 1975, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51248, Dec. 21, 1988; CBP Dec. 08-21, 73 FR 33300, June 12, 2008]
§ 10.17
Valuation of exempted components.
The value of fabricated components to be subtracted from the full value of the assembled article is the cost of the components when last purchased, f.o.b. United States port of exportation or point of border crossing as set out in the invoice and entry papers, or, if no purchase was made, the value of the components at the time of their shipment for exportation, f.o.b. United States port of exportation or point of border crossing, as set out in the invoice and entry papers. However, if the appraising officer concludes that the cost or value of the fabricated components so ascertained does not represent a reasonable cost or value, then the value of the components shall be determined in accordance with section 402 or section 402a, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a, 1402).
[T.D. 75-230, 40 FR 43024, Sept. 18, 1975]
§ 10.18
Valuation of assembled articles.
As in the case of the appraisement of any other import merchandise (see subpart C of part 152 of this chapter), the full value of assembled articles imported under subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), is determined in accordance with 19 CFR 152.100
et seq.
[T.D. 87-89, 52 FR 24445, July 1, 1987, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51248, Dec. 21, 1988]
§§ 10.19-10.20
[Reserved]
§ 10.21
Updating cost data and other information.
When a claim for the exemption is predicated on estimated cost data furnished either in advance of or at the time of entry, this fact should be clearly stated in writing at the time of entry, and suspension of liquidation may be requested by the importer or his agent pending the furnishing of actual cost data. Actual cost data must be submitted as soon as accounting procedures permit. To insure that information used for Customs purposes is reasonably current, the importer shall ordinarily be required to furnish updated cost and assembly data at least every six months, regardless of whether he considers that significant changes have occurred. The 6-month period for the submission of updated cost or other data may be extended by the Center director if such extension is appropriate for the type of merchandise involved, or because of the accounting period normally used in the trade, or because of other relevant circumstances.
[T.D. 75-230, 40 FR 43025, Sept. 18, 1975]
§ 10.23
Standards, quotas, and visas.
All requirements and restrictions applicable to imported merchandise, such as labeling, radiation standards, flame-retarding properties, quotas, and visas, apply to assembled articles eligible for the exemption in the same manner as they would apply to all other imported merchandise.
[T.D. 75-230, 40 FR 43025, Sept. 18, 1975]
§ 10.24
Documentation.
(a)
Documents required.
The following documents shall be filed in connection with the entry of assembled articles claimed to be subject to the exemption under subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202).
(1)
Declaration by the assembler.
A declaration by the person who performed the assembly operations abroad shall be filed in substantially the following form:
I, __________, declare that to the best of my knowledge and belief the __________ were assembled in whole or in part from fabricated components listed and described below, which are products of the United States:
Marks of identification, numbers
Description of component
Quantity
Unit value at time and place of export from United States
1
Port and date of export from United States
Name and address of manufacturer
1
In accordance with U.S. Note 4 to Subchapter II of Chapter 98, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).
Description of the operations performed abroad on the exported components (in sufficient detail to enable Customs officers to determine whether the operations performed are within the preview of subheading 9802.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202) (attach supplemental sheet if more space is required)):
Date Signature
Address Capacity
(2)
Endorsement by the importer.
An endorsement, in substantially the following form, shall be signed by the importer:
I declare that to the best of my knowledge and belief the (above), (attached) declaration, and any other information submitted herewith, or otherwise supplied or referred to, is correct in every respect and there has been compliance with all pertinent legal notes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).
Date Signature
Address Capacity
(b)
Revision of format.
In specific cases, the Center director may revise the format of either of the documents
specified in paragraph (a) of this section and may make such changes as conditions warrant, provided the data and information required to be supplied in these documents are presented. For example, if the components were furnished by the importer, the information on components may be supplied as part of the importer's endorsement, rather than as part of the assembler's declaration.
(c)
Reference to previously filed documents.
In lieu of filing duplicate lists of components and descriptions of assembly operations with each entry, the documents specified in paragraph (a) of this section may refer to assembly descriptions and lists of components previously filed with and approved by the Center director, or to records showing costs, names of manufacturers, and other necessary data on components, provided the importer has arranged with the Center director to maintain such records and keep them available for examination by authorized Customs officers.
(d)
Waiver of specific details for each entry.
There are cases where large quantities of United States components are purchased from various sources or exported at various ports and dates on a continuing basis, so that it is impractical to identify the exact source, port and date of export for each particular component included in an entry of merchandise claimed to be subject to the exemption under subheading 9802.00.80, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202). In these cases, specific details such as the port and date of export and the name of the manufacturer of the United States components may be waived if the Center director is satisfied that the importer and assembler have established reliable controls to insure that all components for which the exemption is claimed are in fact products of the United States. These controls shall include strict physical segregation of United States and foreign components, as well as records of United States components showing quantities, sources, costs, dates shipped abroad, and other necessary information. These records shall be maintained by the importer and assembler for 5 years from the date of the released entry in a manner so that they are readily available for audit, inspection, copying, reproduction or other official use by authorized Customs officers.
(e)
Waiver of documents.
When the Center director is satisfied that unusual circumstances make the production of either or both of the documents specified in paragraph (a) of this section, or of any of the information set forth therein, impractical and is further satisfied that the requirements of subheading 9802.00.80, HTSUS, and related legal notes have been met, he may waive the production of such document(s) or information.
(f)
Unavailability of documents at time of entry.
If either or both of the documents specified in paragraph (a) of this section are not available at the time of entry, a bond on Customs Form 301 containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter for the production of the document(s) may be given pursuant to §§ 113.41-113.46 and 141.66 of this chapter.
(g)
Responsibility of correctness.
Subject to the civil and criminal sanctions provided by law for false or fraudulent entries, the importer has the ultimate responsibility for supplying all information needed by the Customs Service to process an entry, and for the completeness and truthfulness of such information. If certain information cannot be supplied by the assembler, it must be provided by the importer.

§ 10.25
Textile components cut to shape in the United States and assembled abroad.
Where a textile component is cut to shape (but not to length, width, or both) in the United States from foreign fabric and exported to another country, territory, or insular possession for assembly into an article that is then returned to the United States and entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1996, the value of the textile component shall not be included in the dutiable value of the article. For purposes of determining whether a reduction in the
dutiable value of an imported article may be allowed under this section:
(a) The terms “textile component” and “fabric” have reference only to goods covered by the definition of “textile or apparel product” set forth in § 102.21(b)(5) of this chapter;
(b) The operations performed abroad on the textile component shall conform to the requirements and examples set forth in § 10.16 insofar as they may be applicable to a textile component; and
(c) The valuation and documentation provisions of §§ 10.17, 10.18, 10.21 and 10.24 shall apply.
[T.D. 95-69, 60 FR 46196, Sept. 5, 1995; T.D. 95-69, 60 FR 55995, Nov. 6, 1995]
§ 10.26
Articles assembled or processed in a beneficiary country in whole of U.S. components or ingredients; articles assembled in a beneficiary country from textile components cut to shape in the United States.
(a) No article (except a textile article, apparel article, or petroleum, or any product derived from petroleum, provided for in heading 2709 or 2710, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS)) shall be treated as a foreign article or as subject to duty:
(1) If the article is assembled or processed in a beneficiary country in whole of fabricated components that are a product of the United States; or
(2) If the article is processed in a beneficiary country in whole of ingredients (other than water) that are a product of the United States; and
(3) Neither the fabricated components, materials or ingredients after their exportation from the United States, nor the article before its importation into the United States, enters into the commerce of any foreign country other than a beneficiary country.
(b) No article (except a textile or apparel product) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1996, shall be treated as a foreign article or as subject to duty:
(1) If the article is assembled in a beneficiary country in whole of textile components cut to shape (but not to length, width, or both) in the United States from foreign fabric; or
(2) If the article is assembled in a beneficiary country in whole of both textile components described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and components that are products of the United States; and
(3) Neither the components after their exportation from the United States, nor the article before its importation into the United States, enters into the commerce of any foreign country other than a beneficiary country.
(c) For purposes of this section:
(1) The terms “textile article”, “apparel article”, and “textile or apparel product” cover all articles, other than footwear and parts of footwear, that are classifiable in an HTSUS subheading which carries a textile and apparel category number designation;
(2) The term “beneficiary country” has the meaning set forth in § 10.191(b)(1); and
(3) A component, material, ingredient, or article shall be deemed to have not entered into the commerce of any foreign country other than a beneficiary country if:
(i) The component, material, or ingredient was shipped directly from the United States to a beneficiary country, or the article was shipped directly to the United States from a beneficiary country, without passing through the territory of any non-beneficiary country; or
(ii) Where the component, material, ingredient, or article passed through the territory of a non-beneficiary country while en route to a beneficiary country or the United States:
(A) The invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents pertaining to the component, material, ingredient, or article show a beneficiary country or the United States as the final destination and the component, material, ingredient, or article was neither sold at wholesale or retail nor subjected to any processing or other operation in the non-beneficiary country; or
(B) The component, material, ingredient, or article remained under the control of the customs authority of the non-beneficiary country and was not subjected to operations in that non-beneficiary country other than loading and unloading and activities necessary to preserve the component, material, ingredient, or article in good condition.

# Temporary Importations Under Bond
§ 10.31
Entry; bond.
(a)(1) Entry of articles brought into the United States temporarily and claimed to be exempt from duty under Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), unless covered by an A.T.A. carnet or a TECRO/AIT carnet as provided in part 114 of this chapter, shall be made on Customs Form 3461 or 7533, supported by the documentation required by § 142.3 of this chapter. However, when § 10.36 or § 10.36a is applicable, or the aggregate value of the article is not over $250, the form prescribed for the informal entry of importations by mail, in baggage, or by other means, may be used. When entry is made on Customs Form 3461 or 7533, an entry summary, Customs Form 7501, shall be filed within 10 days after time of entry, in accordance with subpart B, part 142 of this chapter.
(2) If Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, is filed at time of entry, it shall serve as both the entry and entry summary, and Customs Form 3461, or its electronic equivalent, or 7533 shall not be required. Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, shall be in original only, except for entries under subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS, which require a duplicate copy for statistical purposes. When articles are entered under an A.T.A. carnet or a TECRO/AIT carnet, the importation voucher of the carnet shall serve as the entry.
(3) In addition to the data usually shown on a regular consumption entry summary, each temporary importation bond entry summary shall include:
(i) The HTSUS subheading number under which entry is claimed.
(ii) A statement of the use to be made of the articles in sufficient detail to enable the Center director to determine whether they are entitled to entry as claimed, and
(iii) A declaration that the articles are not to be put to any other use and that they are not imported for sale or sale on approval.
(b) The port director, if he is satisfied as to the importer's identity and good faith, may admit a vehicle or craft brought in by a nonresident to take part in a race or other specific contest for which no money purse is awarded, under the provisions of subheading 9813.00.35, HTSUS, without formal entry or security for exportation. If at the time of arrival it appears that the article is likely to remain in the United States beyond 90 days, formal entry and bond shall be taken.
(c) When any article has been admitted without formal entry or security for exportation and the importer thereafter desires to prolong his stay beyond 90 days, an entry covering the article and security for its exportation shall be accepted at any port where the article may be presented for entry. The time during which the imported article may remain in the United States under the entry shall be computed from the date of its original arrival in the United States. The estimated duties for the purpose of fixing the amount of any bond required by paragraph (f) of this section shall be the estimated duties which would have been required to be deposited had the article been entered under an ordinary consumption entry on the date of the original arrival.
(d) [Reserved]
(e) The entry or invoice shall: (1) Describe each article in detail; (2) set forth the value of each article; and (3) set forth any marks or numbers thereon or other distinguishing features thereof. In the case of a vehicle, aircraft, or pleasure boat entered under subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS and § 10.36a, the registration number, and engine or motor number, and the body number (if available) shall also be shown on the entry. Examination of the imported articles shall be made whenever the circumstances warrant, and occasionally in any event to an extent which will enable the Customs officer to determine that the importation is in agreement with the invoice or entry as to identity and quantity and for the purpose of accepting the entry under the applicable provisions of Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII, HTSUS. No examination for the purpose of appraisement and no appraisement of the articles shall be made.
(f) With the exceptions stated herein, a bond shall be given on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter, in an amount equal to double the duties and fees, which it is estimated would accrue (or such larger amount as the Center director shall state in writing or by the electronic equivalent to the entrant is necessary to protect the revenue) had all the articles covered by the entry been entered under an ordinary consumption entry. In the case of samples solely for use in taking orders entered under subheading 9813.00.20, HTSUS, motion-picture advertising films entered under subheading 9813.00.25, HTSUS, and professional equipment, tools of trade and repair components for such equipment or tools entered under subheading 9813.00.50, HTSUS, the bond required to be given shall be in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated duties and fees, determined at the time of entry. If appropriate, a carnet, under the provisions of part 114 of this chapter, may be filed in lieu of a bond on CBP Form 301 (containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter). Cash deposits in the amount of the bond may be accepted in lieu of sureties. When the articles are entered under subheading 9813.00.05, 9813.00.20, or 9813.00.50, HTSUS without formal entry, as provided for in §§ 10.36 and 10.36a, or the amount of the bond taken under any subheading of Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII, HTSUS, is less than $25, the bond shall be without surety or cash deposit, and the bond shall be modified to so indicate. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, in the case of professional equipment necessary for carrying out the business activity, trade or profession of a business person, equipment for the press or for sound or television broadcasting, cinematographic equipment, articles imported for sports purposes and articles intended for display or demonstration, if brought into the United States by a national of Canada or Mexico, or by a resident of Singapore, Chile, Morocco, Australia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, the Republic of Korea, Colombia, or Panama and entered under Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII, HTSUS, no bond or other security will be required if the entered article is a good originating, within the meaning of General Notes 11, 12, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35, HTSUS, in the country of which the importer is a national or resident, as applicable. In the case of articles imported for sports purposes and articles intended for display or demonstration, if brought into the United States by a national of Canada or Mexico, the bond shall be without surety or cash deposit in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated duties and fees determined at the time of entry, if the entered article is not originating, within the meaning of General Notes 11 and 12, HTSUS, in the country of which the importer is a national.
(g) Claim for free entry under Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII, HTSUS may be made for articles of any character described therein which have been previously entered under any other provision of law and the entry amended accordingly upon compliance with the requirements of this section, provided the articles have not been released from CBP custody, or even though released from CBP custody if it is established that the original entry was made on the basis of a clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence within the meaning of section 514(a), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and was brought to the attention of CBP within the time limits of that section. If an entry is so amended, the period of time during which the merchandise may remain in the customs territory of the United States under bond shall be computed from the date of importation. In the case of articles covered by an informal mail entry, such a claim may be made within a reasonable time either before or after the articles have been released from CBP custody.
(h) After the entry and bond have been accepted, the articles may be released to the importer. The entry shall not be liquidated as the transaction does not involve liquidated duties. However, a TIB importer may be required to file an entry for consumption and pay duties, or pay liquidated damages under its bond for a failure to do so, in the case of merchandise imported
under subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS, and subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico (
see
§ 181.53 or 182.53 of this chapter).

An application on Customs Form 3495 shall be filed in duplicate with the port director a sufficient length of time in advance of exportation to permit the examination and identification of the articles if circumstances warrant such action and, in such event, the applicant shall be notified on a copy of Customs Form 3495 where the articles are to be sent for identification. If a carnet was used for entry purposes, the reexportation voucher of the carnet shall be filed, in addition to Customs Form 3495, and the carnet shall be presented for certification.

(c) If exportation is to be made at a port other than the one at which the merchandise was entered, the application on Customs Form 3495 shall be filed in triplicate. There shall also be filed with the application a certified copy of the import entry or a certified copy of the invoice used on entry.
(d) If the goods are examined at one port and are to be exported from another port, they shall be forwarded to the port of exportation under a transportation and exportation entry. In such cases Customs Form 3495 shall be filed in triplicate. Articles entered under a carnet shall not be examined elsewhere than at the port from which they are to be exported.

§ 10.39
Cancellation of bond charges.
(a) Charges against bonds taken pursuant to Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, (HTSUS), may be canceled in the manner prescribed in § 113.55 of this chapter. A completed reexportation counterfoil on a carnet establishes that the articles covered by the carnet have been exported, and no claim shall be brought against the guaranteeing association under the carnet for failure to export, except under the provisions of § 114.26 of this chapter. In the case of articles entered under subheading 9813.00.30, HTSUS, which are destroyed because of their use for the purposes of importation, the bond charge shall not be canceled unless there is submitted to the Center director a certificate of the importer that the articles were destroyed during the course of a specifically described use, and the Center director is satisfied that the articles were so destroyed as articles of commerce within the period of time during which the articles may remain in the Customs territory of the United States under bond (including any lawful extension). Bonds covering articles entered under other provisions of law shall not be canceled upon proof of destruction, except as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, unless the articles are destroyed under Customs supervision in accordance with section 557, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and § 158.43 of this chapter.
(b) Where exportation has been made at a port other than the port of entry, the bond may be canceled upon the certificate of lading received from the port of exportation, showing that such exportation was made within the period of time during which the articles may remain in the Customs territory of the United States under bond. In addition, the Center director may require the production of a landing certificate signed by a revenue officer of the country to which the merchandise is exported.
(c) When articles entered temporarily free of duty under bond are destroyed within the bond period by death, accidental fire, or other casualty, petition for relief from liability under the bond shall be made to the United States Customs Service. The petition shall be accompanied by a statement of the importer, or other person having knowledge of the facts, setting forth the circumstances of the destruction of the articles.
(d)(1) If any article entered under Chapter 98, subchapter XIII, HTSUS, except those entered under a carnet, has not been exported or destroyed in accordance with the regulations in this part within the period of time during which the articles may remain in the Customs territory of the United States under bond (including any lawful extension), the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall make a demand in writing under the bond for the payment of liquidated damages equal to double the estimated duties applicable to such entry, unless a different amount is prescribed by § 10.31(f). The demand shall include a statement that a written petition for relief from the payment of the full liquidated damages may be filed with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer within 60 days
after the date of the demand. For purposes of this section, the term estimated duties shall include any merchandise processing fees applicable to such entry.
(2) If articles entered under a carnet have not been exported or destroyed in accordance with the regulations in this part within the carnet period, the port director shall promptly after expiration of that period make demand in writing upon the importer and guaranteeing association for the payment of liquidated damages in the amount of 110 percent of the estimated duties on the articles not exported or destroyed. The guaranteeing association shall have a period of 6 months from the date of claim in which to furnish proof of the exportation or destruction of the articles under conditions set forth in the Convention or Agreement under which the carnet is issued. If such proof is not furnished within the 6-month period, the guaranteeing association shall forthwith pay the liquidated damages provided for above. The payment shall be refunded if the guaranteeing association within 3 months from the date of payment furnishes the proof referred to above. No claim for payment under a carnet covering a temporary importation may be made against the guaranteeing association more than 1 year after the expiration of the period for which the carnet was valid.
(3) Demand for return to Customs custody. When the demand for return to Customs custody is made in the case of merchandise entered under Chapter 98, subchapter XIII, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), liquidated damages in an amount equal to double the estimated duties on the merchandise not returned shall be demanded, except that in the case of samples solely for use in taking orders, motion-picture advertising films, professional equipment, tools of trade, and repair components for professional equipment and tools of trade, the liquidated damages demanded shall be in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated duties.
(e) If there has been a default with respect to any or all of the articles covered by the bond and a written petition for relief is filed as provided in part 172 of this chapter, it will be reviewed by the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer having jurisdiction in the port where the entry was filed. If the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer is satisfied that the importation was properly entered under Chapter 98, subchapter XIII, and that there was no intent to defraud the revenue or delay the payment of duty, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may cancel the liability for the payment of liquidated damages in any case in his or her delegated authority as follows:
(1) If evidence is furnished which satisfies the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer that the article would have been entitled to free entry as domestic products exported and returned had the evidence been furnished at the time of entry, without the collection of liquidated damages.
(2) If the article has been exported or destroyed under Customs supervision but not within the period of time during which the articles may remain in the Customs territory of the United States under bond, upon the payment of such lesser amount as the port director may deem appropriate under the law and in view of the circumstances, or without the collection of liquidated damages if the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer is satisfied that the delay in exportation or destruction was for the benefit of the United States or was occasioned wholly by circumstances reasonably beyond the control of the parties concerned and which could not have been anticipated by a reasonably prudent person.
(3) If the article was exported or destroyed within the period of time during which the articles may remain in the Customs territory of the United States under bond but not under Customs supervision and satisfactory documentary evidence of actual exportation, such as a foreign landing certificate, or of death or other complete destruction, such as a veterinarian's certificate or certificates of two disinterested witnesses, are furnished together with a complete explanation by the applicant of the failure to obtain Customs supervision, upon the payment of such lesser amount as the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may deem appropriate under the law and in view of the circumstances,
or without the collection of liquidated damages if the port director is satisfied that the merchandise was destroyed under circumstances which precluded any arrangement to obtain Customs supervision. Satisfactory documentary evidence of exportation, in the case of carnets, would include the particulars regarding importation or reimportation entered in the carnet by the Customs authorities of another contracting party, or a certificate with respect to importation or reimportation issued by those authorities, based on the particulars shown on a voucher which was detached from the carnet on importation or reimportation into their territory, provided it is shown that the importation or reimportation took place after the exportation which it is intended to establish.
(4) Upon the payment of an amount equal to double the duty which would have accrued on the articles had they been entered under an ordinary consumption entry, or equal to 110 percent of such duties where that percentage is prescribed in § 10.31(f), if such amount is determined to be less than the full amount of the bond.
(f)
Anticipatory breach.
If an importer anticipates that the merchandise entered under a Temporary Importation Bond will not be exported or destroyed in accordance with the terms of the bond, the importer may indicate to Customs in writing before the bond period has expired of the anticipatory breach. At the time of written notification of the breach, the importer shall pay to Customs the full amount of liquidated damages that would be assessed at the time of breach of the bond, and the entry will be closed. The importer shall notify the surety in writing of the breach and payment. By this payment, the importer waives his right to receive a notice of claim for liquidated damages as required by § 172.1(a) of this chapter.
(g) If the petitioner is not satisfied with the port director's action under this section and submits a supplemental petition, both the original and the supplemental petitions shall be transmitted to the designated Headquarters official with a full report on the case.

(b) If any article entered under Chapter 98, subchapter XIII, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, is not exported or destroyed within the period of time during which articles may remain in the customs territory of the United States under bond (including any lawful extension), the Center director shall notify the importer in writing that the entire cash deposit will be transferred to the regular account as liquidated damages unless a written application for relief from the payment of the full liquidated damages is filed with the Center director within 60 days after the date of the notice. If such an application is timely filed, the transfer of the cash deposit to the regular account as liquidated damages shall be deferred pending the decision of the Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection or, in appropriate cases, the Center director on the application.

Lift vans, cargo vans, shipping tanks, skids, pallets, and similar instruments of international traffic; repair components.
(a)(1) Lift vans, cargo vans, shipping tanks, skids, pallets, caul boards, and cores for textile fabrics, arriving (whether loaded or empty) in use or to be used in the shipment of merchandise in international traffic are hereby designated as “instruments of international traffic” within the meaning of section 322(a), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. The Commissioner of Customs is authorized to designate as instruments of international traffic, in decisions to be published in the weekly Customs Bulletin, such additional articles or classes of articles as he shall find should be so designated. Such instruments may be released without entry or the payment of duty, subject to the provisions of this section.
(2) Repair components, accessories, and equipment for any container of foreign production which is an instrument of international traffic may be entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption without the deposit of duty if the person making the entry or withdrawal from warehouse files a declaration that the repair component was imported to be used in the repair of a container of foreign production which is an instrument of international traffic, or that the accessory or equipment is for a container of foreign production which is an instrument of international traffic. The Center director must be satisfied that the importer of the repair component, accessory, or equipment had the declared intention at the time of importation.
(3) As used in this section, “instruments of international traffic” includes the normal accessories and equipment imported with any such instrument which is a “container” as defined in Article 1 of the Customs Convention on Containers.
(b) The reexportation of a container, as defined in Article 1 of the Customs Convention on Containers, which has become badly damaged, shall not be required in the case of a duly authenticated accident if the container (1) is subjected to applicable import duties and import taxes, or (2) is abandoned free of all expense to the Government or destroyed under Customs supervision at the expense of the parties concerned, following the procedure outlined in § 158.43(c) of this chapter. Any salvaged parts and materials shall be subjected to applicable import duties and import taxes. Replaced parts which are not reexported shall be subjected to import duties and import taxes except where abandoned free of
expense to the Government or destroyed under Customs supervision at the expense of the parties concerned.
(c) The instruments of international traffic designated in paragraph (a) of this section may be released in accordance with the provisions of that paragraph only after the applicant for such release has filed a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.66 of this chapter. The required application may be filed at the port of arrival or at a subsequent port to which an instrument shall have been transported in bond or to which a container shall have been moved under cover of a TIR carnet (see part 114 of this chapter) showing the characteristics and value of the container on the Goods Manifest of the carnet. If the container is listed on the Goods Manifest of the carnet, the application may be filed at the port of arrival or at the subsequent port. If the container is not listed on the Goods Manifest, the application shall be filed at the port of arrival. When the application is filed at a port other than the port at which the bond is on file, the following procedure applies:
(1) When the application is filed before the fact of approval of the applicant's bond has been established, the applicant must submit with the application, or the Customs officer to whom the application is made must obtain, evidence that a current bond is on file at another port. That evidence may consist of a certified copy of the bond, or any other evidence which will satisfy the Customs officer to whom the application is made that a current bond is on file at another port.
(2) If the application is filed after the fact of approval of the applicant's bond has been established, a certified copy of that bond need not be filed at the port of release. Upon determination by the appropriate Customs officer that the fact of approval of the applicant's bond has been established, and the bond has not been subsequently discontinued, the instruments of international traffic will be released as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section.
(3) Upon the request of the applicant, the appropriate Customs officer at the port at which the instruments of international traffic are to be released will determine whether or not the fact of approval of the applicant's bond has been established. If the approval has not been established, the Customs officer with whom the application has been filed will advise the applicant of the nature of the evidence required to establish the fact that a current bond is on file at another port.
(d) If an instrument of foreign origin, or of United States origin which has been increased in value or improved in condition by a process of manufacture or other means while abroad, is released under this section and is subsequently diverted to point-to-point local traffic within the United States, or is otherwise withdrawn in the United States from its use as an instrument of international traffic, it becomes subject to entry and the payment of any applicable duties. An instrument of United States origin which has not been increased in value or improved in condition by a process of manufacture or other means while abroad and which is released under this section shall not be subject to entry or the payment of duty if it is so diverted or otherwise withdrawn.
(e) The person who filed the application for release under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall promptly notify a director of a port of entry in the United States as defined in Section 401(k), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, (1) that the container is to be abandoned or destroyed, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, or (2) that the instrument is the subject of a diversion or withdrawal as described in paragraph (d) of this section, in which event he shall file with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically a consumption entry for the instrument and pay all import duties and import taxes due on the container or instrument at the rate or rates in effect and in its condition on the date of such diversion or withdrawal.
(f)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, an instrument of international traffic (other than a container as defined in Article 1 of the Customs Convention on Containers that is governed by paragraphs (g) (1)-(3) of this section) may be used as follows in point-to-point traffic, provided
such traffic is incidental to the efficient and economical utilization of the instrument in the course of its use in international traffic:
(i) Picking up and delivering loads at intervening points in the United States while en route between the port of arrival and the point of destination of its imported cargo; or
(ii) Picking up and delivering loads at intervening points in the United States while en route from the point of destination of imported cargo to a point where export cargo is to be loaded or to an exterior port of departure by a reasonably direct route to, or nearer to, the place of such loading or departure.
(2) Neither use as enumerated in paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section constitutes a diversion to unpermitted point-to-point local traffic within the United States or a withdrawal of an instrument in the United States from its use as an instrument of international traffic under this section.
(g)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, a container (as defined in Article 1 of the Customs Convention on Containers) that is designated as an instrument of international traffic is deemed to remain in international traffic provided that the container exits the United States within 365 days of the date on which it was admitted under this section. A container that is designated as an instrument of international traffic and admitted from Canada or Mexico is deemed to remain in international traffic beyond this 365-day time limit when CBP grants an extension, at the request of the person who filed the application for release under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provided that the container exits the United States prior to the date of expiration of the extension granted. An exit from the United States in this context means a movement across the border of the United States into a foreign country where either:
(i) All merchandise is unladen from the container; or
(ii) Merchandise is laden aboard the container (if the container is empty).
(2) The person who filed the application for release under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is responsible for keeping and maintaining such records, otherwise generated and retained in the ordinary course of business, as may be necessary to establish the international movements of the containers. Such records shall be made available for inspection by Customs officials upon reasonable notice.
(3) If the container does not exit the United States within 365 days of the date on which it is admitted under this section, or, by the date on which an extension granted under paragraph (g)(1) of this section expires, such container shall be considered to have been removed from international traffic, and entry for consumption must be made within 10 business days after the end of the month in which the container is deemed removed from international traffic. When entry is required under this section, any containers considered removed from international traffic in the same month may be listed on one entry. Such entry may be made at any port of entry. Under 19 U.S.C. 1484(a)(1)(B), the importer of record is required, using reasonable care, to complete the entry by filing with CBP the declared value, classification and rate of duty applicable to the merchandise. The importer of record must use the value of the container as determined in accordance with section 402, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a), as amended by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (TAA).
(h) For failure promptly to report the diversion or withdrawal or promptly to make the required entry and pay the duties due, the applicant shall be liable for the payment of liquidated damages equal to the domestic value of the instrument established in accordance with Section 606, Tariff Act of 1930.
(i) When an instrument of international traffic, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, is returned to the United States and released in accordance with the provisions of that paragraph, any repairs which may have been made to the instrument while it was abroad are not subject to entry or the payment of duty whether the instrument is of foreign or domestic manufacture, whether it left the United States empty or loaded, and whether or not the repairs made abroad
were in contemplation when the instrument left the United States.
(j) Containers and other articles designated as instruments of international traffic in accordance with this section are nevertheless subject to the application of the coastwise laws of the United States, with particular reference to Section 883, Title 46, United States Code (see § 4.93 of this chapter).

§ 10.41b
Clearance of serially numbered substantial holders or outer containers.
(a) The holders and containers described in this section may be released without entry or the payment of duty, subject to the provisions of this section.
(b) Subject to the approval of a port director pursuant to the procedures described in this paragraph, certain foreign- or U.S.-made shipping devices arriving from Canada or Mexico, including racks, holders, pallets, totes, boxes and cans, need not be serially numbered or marked if they are always transported on or within either intermodal and similar containers or containers which are themselves vehicles or vehicle appurtenances and accessories such as twenty and forty foot containers of general use and “igloo” air freight containers. The following or similar notation shall appear on the vehicle or vessel manifest in relation to such shipping devices which are exempt from serial numbering or marking requirements pursuant to this paragraph: “The shipping devices transported herein, which are not serially numbered or marked, have been exempted from such requirement pursuant to an application approved under 19 CFR 10.41b(b).” Also, pallets and other solid wood shipping devices must be accompanied by an importer document, to the extent that this is required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, attesting to the admissibility of such devices as regards plant pest risk, as provided for in 7 CFR 319.40-3.
(1) An importer or his agent, regardless of whether the importer is the owner of the foreign- or U.S.-manufactured shipping devices, may apply to a port director of Customs at one of the importer's chiefly utilized Customs ports or the port within which the importer's or agent's recordkeeping center is located for permission to have such shipping devices arriving from Canada or Mexico released without entry and payment of duty at the time of arrival and without the devices being serially numbered or marked. Application may be filed in only one port. Although no particular format is specified for the application, it must contain the information enumerated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Any duty which may be due on these shipping devices shall be tendered and paid cumulatively at the time specified in an approved application, which may be either before or after the arrival of the shipping devices in the U.S. (such as, at the time a contract, purchase order or lease agreement is issued).
(2) The application shall:
(i) Describe the types of shipping devices covered, their classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the U.S. (HTSUS), their countries of origin, and whether and to whom required duty was paid for them or when it will be paid for them, including duties for repair and modifications to such shipping devices while outside the U.S.;
(ii) Identify the intended ports where it is anticipated the shipping devices will be arriving and departing the U.S., as well as the particular movements and conveyances in which they are intended to be utilized;
(iii) Describe the applicant's proposed program for accounting for and reporting these shipping devices;
(iv) Identify the reporting period (which shall in no event be less frequent than annual), as well as the payment period within which applicable duty and fees must be tendered (which shall in no event exceed 90 days following the close of the related reporting period);
(v) Describe the type of inventory control and recordkeeping, including
the specific records, to be maintained to support the reports of the shipping devices; and
(vi) Provide the location in the United States, including the name and address, where the records supporting the reports will be retained by law and will be made available for inspection and audit upon reasonable notice. (The records supporting the reports of the shipping devices must be kept for a period of at least 3 years from the date such reports are filed with the port director.)
(3) The application shall be filed along with a continuous bond containing the conditions set forth in § 113.66(c) of this chapter. If the application is approved by the port director and the conditions set forth in the application or of the bond are violated, the port director may issue a claim for liquidated damages equal to the domestic value of the container. If the domestic value exceeds the amount of the bond, the claim for liquidated damages will be equal to the amount of the bond.
(4) The port director receiving the application shall evaluate the program proposed to account for, report and maintain records of the shipping devices. The port director may suggest amendments to the applicant's proposal. The port director shall notify the applicant in writing of his decision on the application within 90 days of its receipt, unless this period is extended for good cause and the applicant is so informed in writing. Approval of the application by the port director with whom it is filed shall be binding on all Customs ports nationwide.
(5) If the decision is to deny the application, in whole or in part, the port director shall specify the reason for the denial in a written reply, and inform the applicant that such denial may be appealed to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, Customs Headquarters, within 21 days of its date. The Assistant Commissioner's decision shall be issued, in writing, within 30 days of the receipt of the appeal, and shall constitute the final Customs determination concerning the application.
(6) If the application is approved, an importer may later apply to amend his application to add or delete particular types of shipping devices listed in the application in which the procedures set forth in the application may be utilized. If a requested amendment to an approved application should be denied, or if an approved application should be revoked, in whole or in part, by the port director, the procedures described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section shall apply.
(7) Application for and approval of a reporting program shall not limit or restrict the use of other alternative means for obtaining the release of holders, containers and shipping devices.
(c) In the case of serially numbered holders or containers of United States manufacture for which free clearance under subheading 9801.00.10, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, is claimed, the owner shall place thereon the following markings:
(1) 9801.00.10, unless the holder or container has permanently attached thereto the manufacturer's metal tag or plate showing, among other things, the name and address of the manufacturer who is located in the United States.
(2) The name of the owner, either positioned as indicated in the example below, or elsewhere conspicuously shown on the holder or container.
(3) The serial number assigned by the owner, which shall be one of consecutive numbers and not to be duplicated. For example: 9801.00.10 * * * Zenda * * * 2468.
(d)(1) In the case of serially numbered holders or containers of foreign manufacture, other than those provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, for which free clearance under the second provision in subheading 9803.00.50, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), is claimed, the owner shall place thereon the following markings:
(i) 9803.00.50.
(ii) The district and port code numbers of the port of entry, the entry number, and the last two digits of the fiscal year of entry covering the importation of the holders and containers on which duty was paid.

(2) In the case of substantial holders or containers of either U.S. or foreign manufacture, specially designed and equipped to facilitate the carriage of goods by one or more modes of transport without intermediate reloading, each having a gross mass rating of at least 18,120 kilograms, for which duty-free entry is requested under either the first or the second proviso in subheading 9803.00.50, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), is claimed, only the following clear, conspicuous and durable markings are required to be on the container:
(i) The identity of the owner or operator of the container.
(ii) The serial number assigned by the owner or operator of the container, which shall be one of consecutive numbers and shall not be duplicated.
(e) The prescribed markings shall be clear and conspicuous, that is, they shall appear on an exposed side of the holder or container in letters and figures of such size as to be readily discernible. The markings will be stricken out or removed when the holders or containers are taken out of service or when ownership is transferred, except that appropriate changes may be made if a new owner wishes to use the holders and containers under this procedure.
(f) The owner shall keep adequate records open to inspection by Customs officers, which shall show the current status of the serially numbered holders and containers in service and the disposition made of such holders and containers taken out of service.
(g) Nothing in this procedure shall be deemed to affect:
(1) The requirements for outward or inward manifesting of such holders or containers. The manifests will show for each holder or container its markings as provided for herein.
(2) The requirements of the Department of Commerce on exportation with respect to the filing of Electronic Export Information (EEI).
(3) The treatment of articles covered herein under the coastwise laws of the United States, with particular reference to section 883, Title 46, United States Code.
(h) If the holder or container and its contents are to move in bond or under cover of a TIR carnet (see part 114 of this chapter) from the port of arrival intact, the holder or container shall appear on the inward foreign manifest so as to be related to the cargo contained therein and will be released under this procedure at a subsequent port. If the holder or container is to move in bond or under cover of a TIR carnet from the port of arrival not intact with its contents, the holder or container may appear on the inward foreign manifest separate from and not related to the cargo contained therein and will be released under this procedure at the port of arrival before it moves forward and will not appear on the in-bond document.
(i) A continuous bond containing the conditions set forth in § 113.66 of this chapter shall be filed with the port director. If the conditions are violated the port director shall issue a claim for liquidated damages equal to the domestic value of the holder or container established in accordance with section 606, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1606). If the domestic value exceeds the amount of the bond the claim for liquidated damages will be equal to the amount of the bond.

(b) Antiques of the age prescribed by subheading 9706.00.00, HTSUS, or admitted under the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, shall be admitted free of duty though repaired or renovated. If, however, an antique has been repaired with a substantial amount of additional material, without changing the original form or shape, the original and added portions shall be appraised and reported as separate entities and the basis for such report shall be plainly indicated on the invoice by the appraiser. In such cases duty shall be assessed on the portion added. If the repairs consist of an addition to an article of a feature which changes it substantially from the article originally produced, or if the antique portion has otherwise been so changed as to lose its identity as the article which was in existence prior to the time prescribed in subheading 9706.00.00, HTSUS, the entire article shall be excluded from free entry under subheading 9706.00.00, HTSUS.
(c) Except for furniture admitted under the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, furniture claimed to be free of duty under subheading 9706.00.00, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) may be entered for consumption at any port of entry within the customs territory of the United States. Furniture as used in this section of the regulations is defined as ‘movable articles of convenience or decoration for use in furnishing a house, apartment, place of
business or accommodation’. This definition embraces most articles claimed to be free of duty as antiques.
(d) A claim for the free entry of an article under subheading 9706.00.00, HTSUS on the basis of antiquity may be made on the entry, or filed after entry at any time prior to liquidation of the entry, provided the article has not been released from Customs custody or it has been found upon examination before such release to be described in subheading 9706.00.00, HTSUS.
(e) Antique articles otherwise prohibited entry by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1521,
et seq.
) may be entered if:
(1) The article is composed in whole or in part of any endangered or threatened species listed in 50 CFR 17.11 or 17.12,
(2) The article is not less than 100 years of age,
(3) The article has not been repaired or modified with any part of any such endangered or threatened species, on or after December 28, 1973,
(4) The article is entered at a port designated in § 12.26 of this chapter,
(5) A Declaration for Importation or Exportation of Fish or Wildlife (USFWS Form 3-177, or its electronic equivalent) is filed at the time of entry with the port director who will forward the form to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and
(6) The importer meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(f) The additional duty imposed by additional U.S. Note 2, Chapter 97, HTSUS, shall apply to any article which is imported for sale and claimed, either at the time of entry or at a later date, to be free of duty under subheading 9706.00.00, HTSUS, if such article is later found to be unauthentic in respect of the antiquity claimed as a basis for such free entry, unless the claim under subheading 9706.00.00, HTSUS, is withdrawn in writing before the examination of the article for the purpose of appraisement or classification has begun.
(g) The additional duty provided for in additional U.S. Note 2, Chapter 97, HTSUS shall not be assessed if the importer established by evidence satisfactory to the Center director that the article was not imported for sale. In the case of any article imported in a passenger's baggage or entered under an informal entry, the Customs officer concerned may accept the statement of the owner that the article was not imported for sale if he is satisfied of the truth of such statement.

Proprietary mixtures approved by the Commissioner of Customs will not be published but appropriate notice of their approval will be given to all Customs officers.
(d) The Headquarters, U.S. Customs Service, will from time to time prescribe additional formulas, and will consider any formula for special denaturing that may be submitted.
(e) The Center director may, if he deems it advisable, require an importer requesting permission to use any authorized denaturant to submit to the appraiser an adequate sample of such denaturant, in order that the appraiser may report to the Center director whether or not such denaturant is suitable for rendering the oil unfit for use as food or for any but mechanical or manufacturing purposes.
(f) No such oil shall be released free of duty until the appraiser shall have made a special report that it has been properly denatured.

# Withdrawal of Supplies and Equipment for Vessels
§ 10.59
Exemption from customs duties and internal-revenue tax.
(a) A vessel shall not be considered to be actually engaged in the foreign trade, or in trade between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United States, or between the United States and its possessions, or between Hawaii and any other part of the United States or between Alaska and any other part of the United States, as the case may be, for the purpose of withdrawing supplies free of duty and internal-revenue tax pursuant to section 309(a), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, unless it is—
(1) Operating on a regular schedule in a class of trade which entitles it to the privilege;
(2) Actually transporting passengers or merchandise to or from a foreign port, a port on the opposite coast of the United States, or between a port in a possession of the United States and a port in the United States or in another of its possessions, or between Hawaii and any other part of the United States or between Alaska and any other part of the United States;
(3) Departing in ballast (without cargo or passengers) from one port for another, domestic or foreign, for the purpose of lading passengers or cargo at the port of destination for carriage in a class of trade specified in section 309(a), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, for which class of trade the vessel is suitable and substantially ready for service with necessary fittings, outfit, and equipment already installed on its departure in ballast, and from which it is not diverted prior to carriage of passengers or cargo in such trade. A written declaration of the owner or agent of the vessel may be required in connection with the withdrawal, certifying to the vessel's suitableness and substantial readiness with necessary fittings, outfit, and equipment already installed on its departure in ballast for service in a class of trade specified in section 309 and agreeing to notify the port director if it is laid up or diverted from such class of trade prior to the carriage of cargo or passengers in such trade.
(b) A withdrawal of articles may not be made under section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, for use on a trial or test trip of a vessel preparatory to its actually engaging in trades.
(c) The classes of articles which may be withdrawn as provided for by section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, include the containers in which the articles are withdrawn and laden even though for tariff purposes the containers are classifiable separately from their contents, except unusual containers within the purview of General Rule of Interpretation 5, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).
(d) For the purpose of allowing the privileges of section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, to aircraft as provided for therein, an aircraft shall be deemed to be a vessel within the meaning of each provision of this section and of §§ 10.60 through 10.64 which may be applied to aircraft.
(e) A documented vessel with a fisheries license endorsement and foreign fishing vessels of 5 net tons or over may be allowed to withdraw distilled spirits (including alcohol), wines, and beer conditionally free under section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309), if the port director is satisfied from the quantity requested, in the light of (1) whether the vessel is employed in substantially continuous fishing activities, and (2) the vessel's complement, that none of the withdrawn articles is intended to be removed from the vessel in, or otherwise returned to, the United States without the payment of duty or tax. Such withdrawal shall be permitted only after the approval by the port director of a special written application, in triplicate, on Customs Form 5125, of the withdrawer, supported by a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter executed by the withdrawer. Such application shall be filed with Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, or 7512, as the case may be. The original and the triplicate copy of the application, after approval, shall be stamped with the withdrawal number and date thereof and shall be returned to the withdrawer for use as prescribed below. Approval of each such application shall be subject to the condition that the original and the triplicate copy shall be presented thereafter by the withdrawer or the vessel's master to the port director within 24 hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday, and holidays) after each subsequent arrival of the vessel at a Customs port or station and that an accounting shall be made at the time of such presentation of the disposition of the articles until the port director is satisfied that all of them have been consumed on board, or landed under Custom's supervision, and takes up the original application. (The withdrawer shall retain the triplicate copy as evidence of consumption on board or landing under Customs supervision.) The approval shall be subject
to the further conditions that any such withdrawn article remaining on board while the vessel is in port shall be safeguarded in the manner and to such extent as the district director for the port or place of arrival shall deem necessary and that failure to comply with the conditions upon which a conditionally free withdrawal is approved shall subject the total quantity of withdrawn articles to the assessment and collection of an amount equal to the duties and taxes that would have been assessed on the entire quantity of supplies withdrawn had such supplies been regularly entered, or withdrawn, for consumption.
Exemption from internal-revenue tax on distilled spirits, alcohol, wines, and beer removed from any internal-revenue bonded warehouse, industrial alcohol premises, bonded wine cellar, or brewery; and drawback on taxpaid distilled spirits or wines removed from an export storage room, or on taxpaid beer removed from a brewery (or place of storage elsewhere), for use as supplies on vessels under section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, are governed by regulations of the Internal Revenue Service.
(f) Pursuant to section 309(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, the Department of Commerce has found and advised the Secretary of the Treasury of the foreign countries which allow privileges to aircraft registered in the United States substantially reciprocal to those described in sections 309 and 317 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. Advices also have been received of changes and limitations of privileges allowed. In accordance with these advices, Treasury decisions are issued extending to the aircraft of foreign countries free withdrawal privileges reciprocal to those found by the Secretary of Commerce to be extended by those countries to aircraft registered in the United States or making changes in such privileges on the basis of new findings.

§ 10.60
Forms of withdrawals; bond.
(a) Withdrawals from warehouse shall be made on CBP Form 7501. Each withdrawal must contain the statement prescribed for withdrawals in § 144.32 of this chapter and all of the statistical information as provided in § 141.61(e) of this chapter. Withdrawals from continuous CBP custody elsewhere than in a bonded warehouse must be made by filing an in-bond application pursuant to part 18 of this chapter, except as provided for by paragraph (h) of this section. When a withdrawal of supplies or other articles is made which may be used on a vessel while it is proceeding in ballast to another port as provided for by § 10.59(a)(3), a notation of this fact shall be made on the withdrawal and the name of the other port given if known.
(b) If the withdrawal is made by other than the principal on the warehouse or rewarehouse entry, as the case may be, the assent of such principal shall be endorsed on the withdrawal, unless the principal has otherwise authorized such withdrawal in writing.
(c) A bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter shall be taken when the withdrawal from warehouse is made by a person other than the principal on the warehouse or rewarehouse entry, as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d) Except as otherwise provided in § 10.62b, relating to withdrawals from warehouse of aircraft turbine fuel to be used within 30 days of such withdrawal as supplies on aircraft under section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, when the supplies are to be laden at a port other than the port of withdrawal from warehouse, they shall be withdrawn for transportation in bond to the port of lading by filing an in-bond application pursuant to part 18 of this chapter. The procedure shall be the same as that prescribed in 144.37 of this chapter.
(e) No bond shall be required in the case of war vessels.
(f) Unless transfer is permitted under the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section, when articles are withdrawn from continuous Customs custody elsewhere than in a bonded warehouse for lading at the port of withdrawal, the procedure provided for in § 18.25 of this chapter shall be followed. Unless transfer is permitted under the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section, when articles are withdrawn from continuous Customs custody elsewhere than in a bonded warehouse for lading at another port, the procedure set forth in § 18.26 of this chapter shall be followed. There shall be such examination of the articles as may be necessary to satisfy the port director that they are subject to the privileges of section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and that the value and quantity declared for them are correct.
(g) A withdrawal under § 10.59(e) shall be supported by a bond on Customs
Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter.
(h) If a request is made for permission to transfer supplies or stores from one vessel to another which would be entitled to withdraw them free of duty and tax under section 309 or 317, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, the port director in his discretion may permit the articles to be so transferred under Customs supervision under a permit on Customs Form 3171 in lieu of a formal withdrawal under the pertinent statute. In such a case, the pertinent statute shall be indicated by an endorsement made on the permit by the port director.

§ 10.62
Bunker fuel oil.
(a)
Withdrawal under section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309).
Except as otherwise provided in § 10.62b, relating to withdrawals from warehouse of aircraft turbine fuel to be used within 30 days of such withdrawal as supplies on aircraft under section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309), when all the bunker fuel oil in a Customs bonded tank is intended only for lading duty free as supplies on vessels under section 309 at the port where the tank is located, delivery of the oil, by Customs bonded carrier, cartman, or lighterman (including bonded pipelines), under withdrawals on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, either single or blanket, may be made without the presence of a Customs officer. When a blanket withdrawal is filed and a partial release takes place, the partial release procedure set forth in § 19.6(d) of this chapter shall be followed for each partial release. However, each abstract copy of Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, shall include the following additional information:
(1) Type of oil withdrawn.
(2) Number or other identification of sales order therefor.
(3) Name of bonded carrier, date it received oil.
(4) Receipt signed by master or other person in charge of delivering conveyance identified by number, or name, and if Customs bonded lighterman or cartman, by the carrier's license number.
(5) Name and location of vessel obtaining oil.
(6) Quantity and identification of each type of oil received with date, and signature and title of receiving officer. If all the oil is laden on the receiving vessel at the port of withdrawal via pipeline from the bonded storage tank, paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) of this section shall be deemed to be inapplicable.
(b) If a blanket free withdrawal of bunker fuel oil is filed, to comply with Bureau of the Census requirements the withdrawal on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, shall be endorsed “Estimated Withdrawals” and limited to the aggregate quantity and value of fuel oil which it is estimated will be physically removed from Customs bond during the calendar month in which the withdrawal is filed for lading on vessels entitled to duty-free vessel supplies under section 309 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.
(c)(1) As an incident of the delivery of fuel oils classifiable at different rates of duty to a vessel or vessels under section 309 of the tariff act, the port director may, when necessary to enable a supplier to meet fuel specifications, permit the blending of the oils in the delivering conveyance or in other suitable facilities after withdrawal from the bonded tanks, upon the condition that, to the extent of the amount of oil withdrawn classifiable at the higher rate, duty at the higher rate will be paid on any portion of the blended fuel oil not delivered within a reasonable time to a qualified vessel. The withdrawer shall be required to file a withdrawal for consumption for the excess quantity withdrawn. For example, if the quantity withdrawn consists of
1,500 barrels of bunker C fuel oil classifiable at the rate of one-eighth cent per gallon and 500 barrels of diesel oil classifiable at the rate of one-fourth cent per gallon but only 1,400 barrels of the blended oil are actually laden as fuel supplies on qualified vessels, withdrawals for consumption are required for 500 barrels of diesel oil at the higher rate and for 100 barrels of bunker C fuel oil at the lower rate.
(2)
Delivering transferer receipt.
The receipt of the delivering carrier on a copy of Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, for fuel oil which has been blended under paragraph (c)(1) of this section with components classifiable at different rates of duty shall show, for each warehouse entry number and withdrawal number involved, the types and quantity of oil received.
(d) Fuel oil withdrawn as vessel supplies at one port may be laden at another port on a vessel or vessels entitled to the free withdrawal privileges of section 309 of the tariff act, under procedures prescribed in this section, provided the movement to the receiving vessel or vessels is under the bond of a qualified carrier as described in § 18.1(a) of this chapter. In such cases, the provisions of § 10.60(d) of this chapter shall be deemed inapplicable.
(e) If a vessel not entitled to duty-free withdrawal of supplies from Customs bonded warehouses under section 309 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, should be supplied with fuel oil from a Customs bonded tank described in paragraph (a) of this section because of an emergency, a duty paid withdrawal therefor shall be filed on the first day that the customhouse is open for the general transaction of business after the day on which the oil is laden on the using vessel. If there should be willful or repeated instances of late filing of a duty-paid withdrawal in such cases, the port director shall require a duty-paid withdrawal to be filed prior to the removal of fuel oil from the bonded tank.
(f) When the procedures prescribed in this section are followed, representatives of the port director will from time to time verify various withdrawals against all pertinent records, including financial records, of the withdrawers, deliverers, and receivers of the oil. The withdrawer shall maintain all pertinent records relating to the withdrawal, delivery, or receipt of the fuel oil for 5 years from the date of liquidation of the related fuel oil entry.

§ 10.62a
Blanket withdrawals for certain merchandise.
(a)
Generally.
Under this section, a blanket withdrawal on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, may be filed for all or part of any merchandise withdrawn from warehouse except fuel oil covered under § 10.62, for use on qualified vessels. Such a withdrawal shall be made only for lading on board vessels at the port where the warehouse is located. The procedure for the blanket withdrawal and partial releases after the initial release are the same as those provided in § 19.6(d) of this chapter, except as noted in paragraph (b).
(b)
Partial release.
A partial release on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, in duplicate, or in triplicate if an extra copy is required by the port director, shall be presented to the warehouse proprietor and placed in the proprietor's permit file folder under the partial release procedure set forth in § 19.6(d) of this chapter, as merchandise is needed for delivery to a using vessel. The original of the partial release document shall accompany the merchandise for delivery to the Customs officer who will supervise lading, or if a Customs officer does not physically supervise lading, to the master of the vessel. The original shall be returned to the proprietor for record purposes after the Customs officer or master of the vessel, as appropriate, has certified lading of the goods described in the document.

Unless otherwise provided, aircraft turbine fuel withdrawn from a Customs bonded warehouse for use under section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309), may be commingled with domestic or other aircraft turbine fuel after such withdrawal only if such commingling is approved by the appropriate Customs official for the port where the commingling occurs. The appropriate Customs official may approve such commingling if the fueling system in which the commingling will occur contains adequate physical safeguards to prevent the possible unauthorized entry into the Customs territory of the bonded fuel. Such commingled fuel must be accounted for in the same 24-hour period in which it was commingled and must be—
(1) Exported within that 24-hour period;
(2) Used under section 309 within that 24-hour period; or
(3) Entered or withdrawn for consumption, with duty deposited, as required under the applicable regulations (see part 144 of this chapter).

Withdrawal of aircraft turbine fuel under this paragraph shall be in accordance with the procedures in §§ 10.59 through 10.64, unless otherwise provided in this section. Withdrawals under this paragraph shall be annotated with the term “Withdrawal under 19 CFR 10.62b(b)”.
(c)
Establishment of use of fuel by qualifying aircraft.
(1) The person withdrawing aircraft turbine fuel under paragraph (b) of this section must establish that an aircraft qualifying for the privileges provided for in section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, used fuel in an amount equal to or exceeding the quantity of the fuel withdrawn that is not entered and upon which duties are not paid by submitting to Customs, at the port where the bonded warehouse entry was filed, within the time provided in paragraph (d) of this section, either—
(i) Records prepared in the normal course of business effecting the transfer to identified (
e.g.,

(C) All of the aircraft into which fuel is loaded hereunder were used in a trade provided for in section 309; and
(D) The person making the certification possesses evidence (documentary or electronic) available for Customs inspection at a named place which supports each of the above statements.
(2) Upon request by Customs, the person who submits the certification provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall promptly provide the evidence required to support the claim for treatment under this section (including the records described in § 10.62b(c)(1)(i)) and §§ 10.62 and 19.6(d) and each of the statements in the certification.
(d)
Time for establishment of use of fuel by qualifying aircraft.
The person withdrawing aircraft turbine fuel under
paragraph (b) of this section shall submit the records or certification provided for in paragraph (c) of this section by the 40th day after the date of withdrawal of the fuel unless the fuel was withdrawn under a blanket withdrawal under paragraph (g) of this section. If the fuel was withdrawn under a blanket withdrawal, the person withdrawing aircraft turbine fuel under this section shall submit the records or certification provided for in paragraph (c) of this section by the 40th day after all of the fuel covered by the blanket permit to withdraw has been withdrawn.
(e)
Treatment of turbine fuel withdrawn but not used on qualifying aircraft within 30 days.

(2) When a shipping case containing cigars and cigarettes is made up of a number of units, each in a separate package, such units may be withdrawn separately, provided each unit is marked and numbered for identification and contains not less than 250 cigars or 1,000 cigarettes. In the case of imported cigars and cigarettes so packed, only one unit from each shipping case shall be opened for examination, unless the port director shall deem it necessary for the protection of the revenue to examine a greater quantity. Imported tobacco products on which the duty or internal-revenue tax has been paid may not be withdrawn under section 317, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, with a drawback of such duty or internal-revenue tax.
(3) When all the units in such shipping case are not to be withdrawn at the same time or for use on the same vessel, a blanket withdrawal may be filed for the entire case in lieu of a separate withdrawal for each unit. In such event, the withdrawal shall be retained by the warehouse proprietor until delivery receipts are obtained for the entire quantity covered by the withdrawal, provided the total period of time prior to delivery to the using vessel or aircraft does not exceed 5 years. A bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in
§ 113.62 of this chapter, when required, shall be filed at the time of or prior to the removal of any of the merchandise from the warehouse for delivery to the vessel on which it is to be used.
(4) Merchandise for which blanket withdrawals are filed shall be stored in a separate room or enclosure in a bonded warehouse under separate locks, and the merchandise clearly marked to show that it has been withdrawn.

# Theatrical Effects, Motion-Picture Films, Commercial Travelers' Samples, and Tools of Trade
§ 10.68
Procedure.
(a) Theatrical scenery, properties, and effects, motion-picture films (including motion-picture films taken aboard a vessel for exhibition only during an outward voyage and returned for the same purpose during an inward voyage on the same or another vessel), commercial travelers' samples, and professional books, implements, instruments, and tools of trade, occupation, or employment (see § 148.53 of this chapter), of domestic or foreign origin, taken abroad may be returned without formal entry and without payment of duty if an exportation voucher from a carnet, when applicable, or an application on Customs Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, was filed, and the merchandise was identified as set forth in § 10.8, before exportation of the articles. Articles exported under cover of an A.T.A. carnet (where the carnet serves as the control document) may, in accordance with this paragraph, be returned without entry or the payment of duty. If Customs Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, is utilized, commercial travelers' samples, professional books, implements, instruments,
and tools of trade, occupation, or employment may be returned with either an informal entry or a declaration on Customs Form 3299, or its electronic equivalent; theatrical scenery, properties, and effects and motion-picture films may be returned only with an informal entry. When articles other than those exported by mail or parcel post are examined and registered at one port and exported through another port, the port director may require proof of exportation in those cases where the carnet or Customs Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, does not reflect that these articles were exported under Customs supervision. In the case of commercial travelers' samples taken abroad for temporary use, except where exportation involves certification of a carnet, port directors may waive examination of the samples at the time of exportation. When motion-picture films are to be taken aboard a vessel for exhibition only during an outward voyage and are to be returned for the same purpose during an inward voyage on the same or another vessel, port directors may waive examination and supervision at the time of exportation. When theatrical scenery, properties, and effects are taken abroad in sealed carload lots by rail for temporary use, the cars must be sealed by U.S. Customs officers for entry at any Canadian or Mexican port where U.S. Customs officers are stationed. Application and examination before the time of exportation is waived if a Customs Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, is filed with the U.S. Customs officer in the appropriate Canadian or Mexican port, and that officer examines the articles before they are released from foreign customs custody by the foreign customs officer.
(b) When any such articles are to be returned to the United States from a contiguous foreign country in which a United States Customs officer is stationed, the articles may be presented to such officer with the duplicate copy of the application for examination and comparison with the descriptive list. Upon completion of such examination, the packages containing the articles shall be corded and sealed or forwarded in cars sealed by Customs officers and shall be manifested in the same manner as personal baggage. Articles so treated shall be released upon arrival in the United States and removal of the seals by Customs officers.
(c) When commercial travelers' samples consisting of raw cotton are taken to and returned from Canada, the application on Customs Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, shall be executed in triplicate, two copies thereof to be returned to the traveler for surrender to the Customs officer on the return of the samples from Canada.

Samples to Great Britain and Ireland under reciprocal agreement.
Descriptive lists, or their electronic equivalents, of samples taken to Great Britain and Ireland by commercial travelers of the United States under the joint declarations of December 3 and 8, 1910 (State Department treaty series 552), shall be required in triplicate, verified by the affidavit of the commercial traveler before a Customs officer, and shall show that the samples are for use as models or patterns for the purpose of obtaining orders and not for sale and that the lists contain a full description of the articles. One copy shall be retained and the others shall be delivered to the commercial traveler—one for the identification of the samples on their return to the United States and one for the use of the foreign customs authorities. The latter copy must have been attested by a consular officer of the country concerned in the United States.

For regulations with respect to recognition of breeds and purebred animals, see 9 CFR part 151.
§ 10.70
Purebred animals for breeding purposes; certificate.
(a) In connection with the entry of purebred animals for breeding purposes
under subheading 0101.11.00, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), no claim for free entry shall be allowed in liquidation of the entry until the Center director has received from the Department of Agriculture a certificate, or its electronic equivalent, that the animal is purebred of a recognized breed and duly registered in a book of record recognized by the Secretary of Agriculture for that breed. Importers are required by regulation of the Department of Agriculture to make application for a certificate of pure breeding to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services, on ANH Form 17-338 before the animal will be examined as required by 9 CFR 151.7. Application for the certificate must be executed by the owner agent, or importer and filed at a port of entry designated in the regulations of the Department of Agriculture for the importation of animals (9 CFR 92.3). However, applications for certificates for dogs (other than dogs for handling livestock regulated under 9 CFR 92.18) and cats may be filed either at a designated port of entry or at any other port where Customs entry is made. The regulations of the Department of Agriculture prescribing the requirements for the issuance of certificates of pure breeding provide that all animals imported under such regulations must be accompanied to the port at which examination is to be made by certificates of pedigree and transfer of ownership, or their electronic equivalents, in order that identification may be accomplished, and that, if such animals are moved from such port prior to the presentation of such certificates and transfers, or their electronic equivalents, such action shall constitute a waiver of any further claim to certification under such regulations.
(b) In the cases of cats and dogs arriving at Canadian border ports, Customs officers and employees are hereby authorized and directed to make the examination required by such regulations of the Department of Agriculture. Customs officers and employees are also authorized and directed to make such examinations at the ports of New York and Boston, provided the dog or cat is brought into the United States by a passenger. At all airports, Customs officers shall make the examination of dogs and cats, whether or not accompanied by the owners, if there is no inspector of the Department of Agriculture stationed there or on duty at the time of arrival.

§ 10.71
Purebred animals; bond for production of evidence; deposit of estimated duties; stipulation.
(a) The animal may be released from Customs custody upon the furnishing by the importer of a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter for the production within 6 months of (1) a certificate of pure breeding, or its electronic equivalent, issued by the Department of Agriculture, and (2) the declaration required by § 10.70(a) submitted in letter form if such declaration was not filed at the time of entry. The release of the animal from customs custody requires the presentation of the pedigree certificate and evidence of transfer of ownership in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Agriculture mentioned in § 10.70(b).
(b) Charges against the bond shall be canceled only upon the production of the required evidence or on payment of duties.
(c) In cases where the pedigree certificate and evidence of transfer of ownership have been presented in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Agriculture, the importer, if he so elects, may, in lieu of giving a bond, deposit estimated duties and file a stipulation with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically within 10 days after the date of entry to produce the declaration and certificate of pure breeding within 6 months from the date of entry, whereupon the liquidation of the entry shall be suspended. (See § 113.42 of this chapter.)
(d) If the pedigree certificate and evidence of transfer of ownership were not presented in accordance with such regulations of the Department of Agriculture, a deposit of estimated duties,
in addition to the regular entry bond, shall be required.
(e) When a passenger arriving in the United States with one or more dogs or cats and with the required certificates of pedigree and transfers of ownership in his possession furnishes a properly executed declaration as required by § 10.70(a) along with an application to the Department of Agriculture on ANH Form 17-338 for a certificate of pure breeding, the entry of the animal(s) as duty-free under subheading 0106.00.50, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), may be made on the passenger's baggage declaration if the value of the animals does not exceed $500. In such case the entry shall be supported by a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter for the production within 6 months of a certificate of pure breeding. The bond shall be without surety or cash deposit unless the port director on the basis of information before him finds that a bond with surety or a cash deposit is necessary to protect the revenue.

Wild animals and birds; zoological collections.
When wild animals or birds are claimed to be free of duty under subheading 9810.00.70, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), (19 U.S.C. 1202), the port director may, at his discretion, require appropriate proof that the animals or birds were specially imported pursuant to negotiations conducted prior to importation for the delivery of animals or birds of a named species meeting agreed specifications of reasonable particularity and that they are intended at the time of importation for public exhibition in a collection maintained for scientific or educational purposes and not for sale or for use in connection with any enterprise conducted for profit. The fact that an animal or bird may have been sent on approval shall not preclude free entry under subheading 9810.00.70, HTSUS, when it is actually accepted as a part of the zoological collection and so exhibited.

# Products of American Fisheries
§ 10.78
Entry.
(a) No entry shall be required for fish or other marine products taken on the high seas by vessels of the U.S. or by residents of the U.S. in undocumented vessels owned in the U.S. when such fish or other products are brought into port by the taking vessel or are transferred at sea to another fishing vessel of the same fleet and brought into port.
(b) An American fishery, within the meaning of Subchapter XV of Chapter 98, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, is defined as a fishing enterprise conducted under the American flag by vessels of the United States on the high seas or in foreign waters in which such vessels have the right by treaty or otherwise, to take fish or other marine products and may include a shore station operated in conjunction with such vessels by the owner or master thereof.
(c) The employment of citizens of a foreign country by an American fishery is permissible but the purchase by an American fishery of fish or other marine products taken by citizens of a foreign country on the high seas or in foreign waters will subject such fish or other marine products to treatment as foreign merchandise.
(d) Products of an American fishery shall be entitled to free entry although prepared, preserved, or otherwise changed in condition, provided the work is done at sea by the master or crew of the fishery or by persons employed by and under the supervision of the master or owner of the fishery. Fish (except cod, haddock, hake, pollock, cusk, mackerel, and swordfish) the product of an American fishery landed in a foreign country and there not further advanced than beheaded, eviscerated, packed in ice, frozen and with fins removed, shall be entitled to free entry, whether or not such processing is done by the American fishery. Products of an American fishery prepared or preserved on the treaty coasts of Newfoundland, Magdalen Islands, or Labrador, as such coasts are defined in the Convention of 1818 between the United States and Great Britain, shall be entitled to free entry only if the preparation or preservation is done by an American fishery.

# Salt For Curing Fish
§ 10.80
Remission of duty; withdrawal; bond.
Imported salt in bond may be used in curing fish taken by vessels licensed to engage in the fisheries, and in curing fish in the shores of the navigable waters of the U.S., whether such fish are taken by licensed or unlicensed vessels, and upon proof that the sale has been used for either of such purposes, the duties on the same shall be remitted. (Section 313(e), Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313(e)). Imported salt entered for warehouse may be withdrawn under bond for use in curing fish. Upon proof that the salt has been
so used, the duties thereon shall be remitted. In no case shall the quantity of salt withdrawn exceed the reasonable requirements of the case. Withdrawal shall be made on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent. Each withdrawal shall contain the statement prescribed for withdrawals in § 144.32 of this chapter. When the withdrawal is made by a person other than the importer of record, a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter for the production of proof of proper use shall be filed. Upon acceptance of the bond, a withdrawal permit shall be issued on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent.

§ 10.81
Use in any port.
(a) Salt withdrawn under bond for use in curing fish on the shores of navigable waters may be used for such purpose at any port, but the evidence of use in such cases shall be submitted through the director of the port where the salt was used.
(b) If desired, salt to be used in curing fish on shore at another port than that in which it is warehoused in bond may be withdrawn under a transportation entry and shipped in bond to the other port at which it is to be used, where it may be entered on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, which shall show withdrawal of the salt for use in curing fish. Thereupon, and upon the filing of a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter, such salt may be used without being sent to a bonded warehouse or public store. In such a case the proof of use shall be filed at the latter port.

[Reserved]
§ 10.83
Bond; cancellation; extension.
(a) If it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Center director holding the bond referred to in § 10.80, that the entire quantity of salt covered by the bond has been duly accounted for, either by having been used in curing fish or by the payment of duty, the Center director may cancel the charges against the bond. The Center director may require additional evidence in corroboration of the proof of use produced.
(b) On application of the person making the withdrawal, the period of the bond may be extended 1 year so as to allow the salt to be used during the time of extension in curing fish with the same privileges as if used during the original period.

# Automotive Products
§ 10.84
Automotive vehicles and articles for use as original equipment in the manufacture of automotive vehicles.
(a)(1) Certain motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment are eligible for duty-free entry as proclaimed by the President under the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965. The articles designated for such duty-free treatment are defined in General Note 3(c)(iii), HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202). Specifically, such articles are those designated [as “Free (B)”] in the “Special” subcolumn in Chapter 87, HTSUS, and must qualify as “Canadian articles” as defined in General Note 3(c)(iii)(A)(1), HTSUS. To claim exemption from duty under the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965, an importer must establish, to the satisfaction of the appropriate Customs officer, that the article in question qualifies as a “Canadian article” for purposes of General Note 3(c)(iii)A)(1), HTSUS. The Customs officer may accept as satisfactory evidence a certificate executed by the exporter as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, subject to any verification he may deem necessary. Alternatively, the Customs officer may determine that under the circumstances of the importation a certificate is unnecessary.
(2) Under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement and implementing legislation (Pub. L. 100-449, 102
Stat. 1851) a manufacturer of motor vehicles may elect to average, over its 12-month financial year, its calculation of the value-content requirement for vehicles in establishing its eligibility for tariff preference. Requirements for averaging are set forth in §§ 10.310 and 10.311.
(b)(1) When all materials used at any stage in the production of the imported article are wholly obtained or produced in Canada or the United States, or both, a certificate, or its electronic equivalent, in the following form may be accepted as evidence that the commodity is a “Canadian article”:
All materials contained in the product covered by the __________ (Describe the invoice, bill of lading, or other document or statement identifying the shipment) annexed or appended to this certificate of Canadian origin at the time it was subscribed were wholly obtained or produced in Canada or the United States, or both. No materials other than those which were wholly obtained or produced in Canada or the United States, or both, were incorporated into this product or any of its components at any stage of production or in the production of any intermediate product used at any stage in the chain of production in Canada or the United States, or both.
(2) When any material used at any stage in the production of an imported article or any of its components is not wholly obtained or produced in Canada or the United States, or both, a certificate, or its electronic equivalent, in the following form may be accepted as evidence that the commodity is nevertheless a “Canadian article”:
The product covered by the __________ (Describe the invoice, bill of lading, or other document or statement identifying the shipment) annexed or appended to this certificate of Canadian origin at the time it was subscribed is an originating good so as to be a Canadian article. There were used in its production in Canada __________ (Description sufficient for tariff classification of the materials, and number of units) of third country materials of which the price paid was __________ per unit of quantity, plus __________ which represents all costs incurred in transporting the materials to the location of the producer and the duties, taxes, and brokerage fees on the materials, if such costs were not included in the price paid.
(3) If such Customs officer is satisfied that the revenue will be protected adequately thereby, he may accept in lieu of the certificate specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section a certificate, or its electronic equivalent, in the following form when the merchandise covered thereby has been produced with third country material but is an originating good under a specific rule of origin for the merchandise:
The product covered by the __________ (Describe the invoice, bill of lading, or other document or statement identifying the shipment) annexed or appended to this certificate of Canadian origin at the time it was subscribed is an originating good so as to be a Canadian article. There were or may have been used in its production in Canada or the United States, or both, materials of a third country.
It is impractical to ascertain the exact number of units of third country material, if any, used in its production or the price paid (and other costs required to be included in the price paid) of such materials but to the best of (my) (our) (its) knowledge the materials are described (sufficient for tariff classification purposes) as follows: __________.
(4) The certificates described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, or their electronic equivalents, shall not be accepted if the statements therein make it evident that the importation is not a “Canadian article” within the meaning of General Note 3(c), HTSUS.
(5) If more than one kind of article is covered by a certificate provided for in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section, the information required by the certificate shall be shown with respect to each kind. When more than one kind of material, other than originating material, is used in the production of an article covered by such a certificate, the certificate shall state the number of units, a description sufficient for tariff classification purposes, the price paid, and, if not included in the price paid, the costs incurred in transporting the materials to the location of the producer and duties, taxes and brokerage fees paid in Canada and/or the United States on the material, per unit of each kind of materials.
(6) A certificate conforming to paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section shall be accepted as evidence of the facts alleged therein only if:
(i) There is annexed thereto a copy of the commercial invoice or bill of lading, or the electronic equivalent, covering the articles or other documentary evidence which identifies the article to which the certificate pertains,
(ii) The certificate, or its electronic equivalent, is signed by the manufacturer or producer of the article to which it pertains, or by the person who exported the articles from Canada, and
(iii) It clearly appears that such copy or other documentary evidence was annexed to the certificate when it was signed.
(c) In lieu of the certification in paragraph (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this section, a manufacturer of motor vehicles who claims a preference under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement and elects to average pursuant to § 10.310(a), shall be subject to the requirements of §§ 10.301 to 10.311 of this part.
(d) When an importer makes an entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of articles for use as “original motor-vehicle equipment” as that term is defined in General Note 3(c)(iii), HTSUS, he shall file in connection therewith his declaration that the articles are being imported for use as original equipment in the manufacture in the United States of the kinds of motor vehicles specified in the General Note and furnish the name and address of the motor vehicle manufacturer. A copy of the written order, contract, or letter of intent shall be attached to the importer's declaration except that if the Center director is satisfied that a copy of the written order, contract, or letter of intent will be made available by the importer or ultimate consignee for inspection by customs officials upon request during a period of 3 years from the date of such entry or withdrawal from warehouse, the production of such documents will not be required. Proof of use need not be furnished.
(e) If, after a Canadian article has been accorded the status of original motor-vehicle equipment, it is decided to divert the article from its intended use in the manufacture in the United States of motor vehicles, the importer or other person deciding to divert the article from such intended use shall give notice in writing of the decision to the CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically or where the offices of the importer are located and either make arrangements for its destruction or exportation under Customs supervision or pay duties in accordance with General Note 3(c)(iii)(B)(2), HTSUS. If such article is not destroyed or exported under Customs supervision or the duties paid, the article, or its value, shall be subject to forfeiture.

# Master Records, And Metal Matrices
§ 10.90
Master records and metal matrices.
(a) Consumption entries covering importations under subheading 8524.99.20, HTSUS, shall be filed at a port in the Customs district in which the factory where the articles will be used is located.
(b) The invoice, or its electronic equivalent, filed with the entry shall contain or be supported by a detailed statement of the cost of production, or its electronic equivalent, in the country where made, of each master record or metal matrix covered thereby.
(c) A bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter shall be filed for importations under this section.
(d) Entries already filed and future entries shall be liquidated in due course without the assessment of duty, but liability on bonds given with the entries shall be discontinued with respect to any article covered thereby only upon payment of liquidated damages in an amount equal to the duties which would have accrued had the master records or metal matrices been imported for use otherwise than in the manufacture of sound records for export purposes, or upon satisfactory proof that the master records or metal matrices obtained therefrom have been exported or destroyed under Customs supervision, and that all sound records
made with the use of such articles have been exported.

# Prototypes
§ 10.91
Prototypes used exclusively for product development and testing.
(a)
Duty-free entry; declaration of use; extension of liquidation
—(1)
Entry or withdrawal for consumption.
Articles defined as “prototypes” and meeting the other requirements prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section may be entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, duty-free, under subheading 9817.85.01, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), on CBP Form 7501 or an electronic equivalent. A separate entry or withdrawal must be made for a qualifying prototype article each time the article is imported/reimported to the United States.
(2)
Importer declaration
—(i)
Entry accepted as declaration.
Entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption under HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01 may be accepted by the Center director as an effective declaration that the articles will be used solely for the purposes stated in the subheading.
(ii)
Proof (declaration) of actual use.
If it is believed the circumstances so warrant, the Center director may request the submission of proof of actual use, executed and dated by the importer. The title of the party executing the proof of actual use must be set forth. If proof of actual use is requested, the importer must provide it within three years after the date the article is entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption. Liquidation of the related entry may be extended until the requested proof or declaration of actual use is received or until the three-year period from the date of entry allowed for the receipt of such proof has expired. While requested proof of use must be given to CBP within three years of the date of entry, the prototype may continue to be used thereafter for the purposes enumerated in HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01. If requested proof of use is not timely received, the entry will be liquidated as dutiable under the tariff provision that would otherwise apply to the imported article. While there is no particular form for this declaration, it may either be submitted in writing, or electronically as authorized by CBP, and must include the following:
(A) A description of the use that is being and/or that has been made of the articles set forth in sufficient detail so as to enable the Center director to determine whether the articles have been entitled to entry as claimed;
(B) A statement that the articles have not and are not to be put to any other use after the articles have been entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption and prior to the completion of their use under HTSUS 9817.85.01 (also see paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section concerning the disposition(s) to which the articles may be put following their use under HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01); and
(C) A statement that the articles or any parts of the articles have not been and are not intended to be sold, or incorporated into other products that are sold, after the articles have been entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption and prior to the completion of their use as provided in HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01 (
see
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section).
(b)
Articles classifiable as prototypes
—(1)
Prototypes defined.
In accordance with U.S. Note 6(a) to subchapter XVII of chapter 98, HTSUS, applicable to subheading 9817.85.01, the term “prototypes” means originals or models of articles pertaining to any industry that:
(i) Are either in the preproduction, production or postproduction stage and are to be used exclusively for development, testing, product evaluation, or quality control purposes (not including automobile racing for purse, prize or commercial competition); and
(ii) In the case of originals or models of articles that are either in the production or postproduction stage, are associated with a design change from current production (including a refinement, advancement, improvement, development or quality control in either
the product itself or the means of producing the product).
(2)
Additional requirements.
In accordance with U.S. Note 6(b) and (c) to subchapter XVII of chapter 98, HTSUS, applicable to subheading 9817.85.01, the following additional restrictions apply to articles that may be classified as prototypes:
(i)
Importations limited.
Prototypes may be imported pursuant to this section only in limited noncommercial quantities in accordance with industry practice.
(ii)
Sale prohibited after entry and prior to use.
Prototypes or parts of prototypes may not be sold, or be incorporated into other products that are sold into the commerce of the United States, after the prototypes have been entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption under HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01, except that, after having been used for the purposes for which they were entered or withdrawn from warehouse under HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01, such prototypes or any part(s) of the prototypes may be sold as scrap, waste, or for recycling, as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.
(iii)
Articles subject to laws of another agency.
Articles that are subject to licensing requirements, or that must comply with laws, rules or regulations administered by an agency other than CBP before being imported, may be entered as prototypes pursuant to this section if they meet all applicable provisions of law and otherwise meet the definition of prototypes in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(iv)
Articles excluded from being prototypes.
Articles that are in fact subject at the time of entry to quantitative restrictions, antidumping orders or countervailing duty orders are excluded from being classified as prototypes under this section.
(c)
Sale of prototype following use
—(1)
Sale.
Prototypes or any part(s) of prototypes, after having been used for the purposes for which they were entered or withdrawn under HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01, may only be sold as scrap, waste, or for recycling. This includes a prototype or any part thereof that is incorporated into another product, as scrap, waste, or recycled material. If sold as scrap, waste, or for recycling, applicable duty must be paid on the prototypes or parts as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, at the rate of duty in effect for such scrap, waste, or recycled materials at the time the prototypes were entered or withdrawn for consumption.
(2)
Notice of sale required.
If, after a prototype has been used for the purposes contemplated in HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01, the prototype or any part(s) of the prototype (including a prototype or any part that is incorporated into another product) is sold as scrap, waste, or for recycling, the importer must provide notice of such sale to CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically. A notice, in the manner authorized in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, must be submitted in connection with the sale, whether or not duty is payable. The notice should not be submitted prior to the submission of proof of actual use, should such proof of actual use be requested by the Center director (
see
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section).
(3)
Form and content of notice; tender of duty.
While no particular form is required for the notice of sale, a consumption entry (CBP Form 7501), appropriately modified, or an electronic equivalent as authorized by CBP, may be used for this purpose. The notice may be a blanket notice covering all those sales described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section that occur over a quarterly (3-month) calendar period. Such notice must be filed within 10 business days of the end of the related quarterly period in which the sale(s) occurred. If an article sold is dutiable, the payment of any duty due must be forwarded together with the notice (
see
paragraph (c)(1) of this section). If the notice is filed electronically, payment of any duty owed will be handled through the Automated Clearinghouse (
see
§ 24.25 of this chapter). The notice of sale must be executed by the importer, or other person having knowledge of the facts surrounding the sale, and must include the following:
(i) The identity of the prototype; the consumption entry number under which it was imported; a copy of the declaration of actual use, if proof of actual use was requested under paragraph
(a)(2)(ii) of this section; and a detailed description of the condition of the prototype following use for the intended permissible purposes, including any damage, degradation or deterioration to the article resulting from such use and/or otherwise resulting to the article from any other cause prior to its sale for scrap, waste, or recycling;
(ii) The name and address of the party to whom the article was sold, and (if known) the use to which the party intends to put the article;
(iii) The HTSUS subheading number for scrap, waste, or recycled material, as applicable, claimed in connection with the sale of the prototype, together with the corresponding rate of duty in effect at the time the prototype was originally imported for consumption;
(iv) The value of the prototype article (if dutiable and the duty owed is based upon value) (
see
paragraph (e)(2) of this section); and
(v) The title of the party executing the declaration and the date of execution.
(d)
Prototypes not sold following use.
As to those prototypes or parts of prototypes that, after having been used as prescribed under HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01, are disposed of otherwise than by sale (
see
paragraph (c)(1) of this section), there is no requirement that the importer notify CBP of any such alternative disposition. Nor are there any dutiable consequences that ensue from any disposition of the merchandise after the merchandise's use under HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01 other than sale to the extent authorized under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(e)
Recordkeeping; retention and production
—(1)
Recordkeeping.
The importer must be prepared to submit to the CBP officer, if requested, any information, including any supporting documents, reports and records, as was necessary for the preparation of the declaration of use, if the declaration of use was requested under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, and the notice of sale, if applicable under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The notices, together with any related supporting evidence, may be subject to such verification as the Center director reasonably deems necessary. Supporting documentary evidence must be made available to the CBP officer, upon request, for a period of five years (

(B) Describe the circumstances of the use of the article; the operations, testing, review, manipulation, experimentation, and/or other exercises that are being and/or that have been conducted in connection with the prototype; and the location, such as the plant or production facility, where these activities occurred, sufficient to demonstrate that the purposes enumerated in HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01 are taking and/or have actually taken place.
(ii) Documents supporting the notice of sale must establish that:
(A) The identity of the prototype sold is the same article for which a consumption entry was made under subheading 9817.85.01 HTSUS when it was imported, and that the article was in the condition described in the notice of sale;
(B) The article was sold to the party identified in the notice of sale;
(C) The HTSUS subheading number for scrap, waste, or recycled material, as applicable, claimed in connection with the sale of the prototype is accurate;
(D) The date that the prototype was originally imported for consumption, and the corresponding rate of duty in effect at the time for the applicable HTSUS subheading; and
(E) The value of the prototype article (if dutiable and the duty owed is based upon value) (
see
paragraph (e)(2) of this section) as claimed in the notice of sale is accurate.

Relevant value for used prototype or parts sold.
For purposes of this section, with respect to any duty owed on prototypes or parts of prototypes that are
sold as scrap, or waste, or for recycling, where the duty owed is based upon value, the relevant value is the market value of the prototypes or parts, based upon their character and condition following use for the purposes prescribed in HTSUS subheading 9817.85.01. The relevant value should take into consideration any damage, degradation or deterioration to the prototypes or parts resulting from their use as a prototype and/or otherwise resulting to the articles from any other cause prior to their sale as scrap, waste, or for recycling. The market value will generally be measured by the selling price. Should a prototype or part of a prototype become a component of another product that is sold as scrap, waste, or recycled material, the relevant market value would be that portion of the selling price attributable to the component (prototype or part) as provided in this paragraph.

Within 3 years from the date of entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, the importer shall submit in duplicate in support of his claim for free entry or for a reduced rate of duty a certificate executed by (1) the superintendent or manager of the manufacturing plant, or (2) the individual end-user or other person having knowledge of the actual use of the imported article. The certificate shall include a description of the processing in sufficient detail to show that the use contemplated by the law has actually taken place. A blanket certificate covering all purchases of a given type of merchandise from a particular importer during a given period, or all such purchases with specified exceptions, may be accepted for this purpose, provided the importer shall furnish a statement showing in detail, in such manner as to be readily identified with each entry, the merchandise which he sold to such manufacturer or end-user during such period.
[T.D. 71-139, 36 FR 10727, June 2, 1971]
§ 10.139
Liquidation.
(a)
In general.
Upon satisfactory proof of timely use of the merchandise for the purpose specified by law, the entry shall be liquidated free of duty or at the lower rate of duty specified by law. When such proof is not filed within 3 years from the date of entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, the entry shall be liquidated dutiable under the appropriate subheading of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.
(b)
Exception for blackstrap molasses.
An entry covering blackstrap molasses, as hereinafter defined, may be accepted and liquidated with duty at the lower rate after the filing of the declaration of intent required by § 10.134 and the deposit of estimated duties required by § 10.135 without compliance with §§ 10.136, 10.137, and 10.138. Blackstrap molasses is “final” molasses practically free from sugar crystals, containing not over 58 percent total sugars and having a ratio of
total sugars × 100/Brix
not in excess of 71. In the event of doubt, an ash determination may be made. An ash content of not less than 7 percent indicates a blackstrap molasses within the meaning of this paragraph.

# Importations Not Over $200 and Bona Fide Gifts
§ 10.151
Importations not over $800.
Subject to the conditions in § 10.153 of this part, the port director shall pass free of duty and tax any shipment of merchandise, as defined in § 101.1 of this chapter, imported by one person on one day having a fair retail value, as evidenced by an oral declaration or the bill of lading (or other document filed as the entry) or manifest listing each bill of lading, in the country of shipment not exceeding $800, unless he has reason to believe that the shipment is one of several lots covered by a single order or contract and that it was sent separately for the express purpose of securing free entry therefor or of avoiding compliance with any pertinent law or regulation. Merchandise subject to this exemption shall be entered under the informal entry procedures (see subpart C, part 143, and §§ 128.24, 145.31, 148.12, and 148.62, of this chapter).
[T.D. 94-51, 59 FR 30293, June 13, 1994, as amended by T.D. 95-31, 60 FR 18990, Apr. 14, 1995; T.D. 95-31, 60 FR 37875, July 24, 1995; T.D. 97-82, 62 FR 51769, Oct. 3, 1997; CBP Dec. No. 16-13, 81 FR 58833, Aug. 26, 2016]
§ 10.152
Bona-fide gifts.
Subject to the conditions in § 10.153 of this part, the port director shall pass free of duty and tax any article sent as a bona-fide gift from a person in a foreign country to a person in the United States, provided that the aggregate fair retail value in the country of shipment of such articles received by one person on one day does not exceed $100
or, in the case of articles sent from a person in the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, $200. Articles subject to this exemption shall be entered under the informal entry procedures (see subpart C, part 143, and §§ 145.32, 148.12, 148.51, and 148.64, of this chapter). An article is “sent” for purposes of this section if it is conveyed in any manner other than on the person or in the accompanied or unaccompanied baggage of the donor or donee.
[T.D. 94-51, 59 FR 30293, June 13, 1994]
§ 10.153
Conditions for exemption.
Customs officers shall be further guided as follows in determining whether an article or parcel shall be exempted from duty and tax under § 10.151 or § 10.152:
(a) A “bona fide gift” for purposes of § 10.152 is an article formerly owned by a donor (may be a commercial firm) who gave it outright in its entirety to a donee without compensation or promise of compensation. It does not include articles acquired by purchase, barter, promissory exchange, or similar transaction, nor does it include articles said to be “given” in conjunction with a purchase, barter, promissory exchange, or similar transaction, such as a so-called bonus article.
(b) A parcel addressed to a person in the United States from an individual in a foreign country which contains a gift should be clearly marked on the outside to indicate that it contains a gift. Such marking is not conclusive evidence of a gift nor is the absence of such marking conclusive evidence that an article is not a gift. Ordinarily an article not exceeding $100 in fair retail value in the country of shipment sent from a person in a foreign country to a person in the United States ($200, in the case of an article sent from a person in the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa) will be recognizable as a gift from the nature of the article and obvious facts surrounding the shipment.
(c) A parcel addressed to a person in the United States from a business firm in a foreign country would ordinarily not contain a gift from a donor in the foreign country. When such a parcel in fact contains an article entitled to free entry under § 10.152, the parcel should be clearly marked to indicate that it contains such a gift and a statement to this effect should be enclosed in the parcel.
(d) Consolidated shipments addressed to one consignee shall be treated for purposes of §§ 10.151 and 10.152 as one importation. The foregoing shall not apply to shipments of bona fide gifts consolidated abroad for shipment to the United States when:
(1) The consolidation for shipment to the United States is in a cargo van or similar containerization which is consigned to a common carrier, freight forwarder, freight handler, or other public service agency for distribution of the gift packages;
(2) The separate gifts not exceeding $100 in fair retail value in the country of shipment ($200, in the case of articles sent from persons in the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa) included in the consolidated shipment are before shipment individually wrapped and addressed to the donee in the United States;
(3) Each gift package is marked on the outside to indicate that it contains a gift not exceeding $100 in fair retail value in the country of shipment ($200, in the case of packages sent from persons in the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa); and
(4) Each gift package is separately listed in the name of the addressee-donee on a packing list, manifest, bill of lading, or other shipping document.
(e) No alcoholic beverage, cigars (including cheroots and cigarillos) and cigarettes containing tobacco, cigarette tubes, cigarette papers, smoking tobacco (including water pipe tobacco, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco), snuff, or chewing tobacco, shall be exempted from the payment of duty and tax under § 10.151 or § 10.152.
(f) The exemptions provided for in § 10.151 or § 10.152 are not to be allowed in respect of any shipment containing one or more gifts having an aggregate fair retail value in the country of shipment in excess of $100 ($200, in the case of articles sent from persons in the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa), except as indicated in paragraph (d) of this section. For example, an article ordinarily subject to an ad valorem rate of duty but sent as a gift,
if the fair retail value exceeds the $100 (or $200) exemption, would be subject to a duty based upon its value under the provisions of section 402 or 402(a), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a or 1402), even though the dutiable value is less than the $100 (or $200) exemption.
(g) The exemption referred to in § 10.151 is not to be allowed in the case of any merchandise of a class or kind provided for in any absolute or tariff-rate quota, whether the quota is open or closed. In the case of merchandise of a class or kind provided for in a tariff-rate quota, the merchandise is subject to the rate of duty in effect on the date of entry.
(h) The exemption provided for in § 10.151 is not to be allowed with respect to any tax imposed under the Internal Revenue Code collected by other agencies on imported goods.

# Generalized System of Preferences
§ 10.171
General.
(a)
Statutory authority.
Title V of the Trade Act of 1974 as amended (19 U.S.C. 2461-2467) authorizes the President to establish a Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to provide duty-free treatment for eligible articles imported directly from designated beneficiary developing countries. Beneficiary developing countries and articles eligible for duty-free treatment are designated by the President by Executive order in accordance with sections 502(a)(1) and 503(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 as amended (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(1), 2463(a)).
(b)
Country defined.
For purposes of §§ 10.171 through 10.178, except as otherwise provided in § 10.176(a), the term “country” means any foreign country, any overseas dependent territory or possession of a foreign country, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. In the case of an association of countries which is a free trade area or customs union or which is contributing to comprehensive regional economic integration among its members through appropriate means, including but not limited to, the reduction of duties, the President may by Executive order provide that all members of such association other than members which are barred from designation under section 502(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)) shall be treated as one country for purposes of §§ 10.171 through 10.178.
[T.D. 76-2, 40 FR 60047, Dec. 31, 1975, as amended by T.D. 80-271, 45 FR 75641, Nov. 17, 1980; T.D. 00-67, 65 FR 59675, Oct. 5, 2000]
§ 10.172
Claim for exemption from duty under the Generalized System of Preferences.
A claim for an exemption from duty on the ground that the Generalized System of Preferences applies shall be allowed by the Center director only if he is satisfied that the requirements set forth in this section and §§ 10.173 through 10.178 have been met. If duty-free treatment is claimed at the time of entry, a written claim shall be filed on the entry document by placing the symbol “A” as a prefix to the subheading of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States for each article for which such treatment is claimed.
[T.D. 76-2, 40 FR 60048, Dec. 31, 1975, as amended by T.D. 77-36, 42 FR 5041, Jan. 27, 1977; T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51252, Dec. 21, 1988; T.D. 94-47, 59 FR 25569, May 17, 1994; T.D. 99-27, 64 FR 13675, Mar. 22, 1999]
§ 10.173
Evidence of country of origin.
(a)
Shipments covered by a formal entry
—(1)
Merchandise not wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary developing country
—(i)
Declaration.
In a case involving merchandise covered by a formal entry which is not wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a single beneficiary developing country, the exporter of the merchandise or other appropriate party having knowledge of the relevant facts shall be prepared to submit directly to the Center director, upon request, a declaration setting forth all pertinent detailed information concerning the production or manufacture of the merchandise. When requested by the Center director, the declaration shall be prepared in substantially the following form:

(ii)
Retention of records and submission of declaration.
The information necessary for preparation of the declaration shall be retained in the files of the party responsible for its preparation and submission for a period of 5 years. In the event that the Center director requests submission of the declaration during the 5-year period, it shall be submitted by the appropriate party directly to the Center director within 60 days of the date of the request or such additional period as the Center director may allow for good cause shown. Failure to submit the declaration in a timely fashion will result in a denial of duty-free treatment.
(2)

In a case involving merchandise covered by a formal entry which is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a single beneficiary developing country, a statement to that effect shall be included on the commercial invoice provided to Customs.
(b)
Shipments covered by an informal entry.
Although the filing of the declaration provided for in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section will not be required for a shipment covered by an informal entry, the Center director may require such other evidence of country of origin as deemed necessary.
(c)
Verification of documentation.
Any evidence of country of origin submitted under this section shall be subject to such verification as the Center director deems necessary. In the event that the Center director is prevented from obtaining the necessary verification, the Center director may treat the entry as dutiable.
[T.D. 94-47, 59 FR 25569, May 17, 1994]
§ 10.174
Evidence of direct shipment.
(a)
Documents constituting evidence of direct shipment.
The Center director may require that appropriate shipping papers, invoices, or other documents be submitted within 60 days of the date of entry as evidence that the articles were “imported directly”, as that term is defined in § 10.175. Any evidence of direct shipment required by the Center director shall be subject to such verification as he deems necessary.
(b)
Waiver of evidence of direct shipment.
The Center director may waive the submission of evidence of direct shipment when he is otherwise satisfied, taking into consideration the kind and value of the merchandise, that the merchandise clearly qualifies for treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences.
[T.D. 76-2, 40 FR 60048, Dec. 31, 1975, as amended by T.D. 77-27, 42 FR 3162, Jan. 17, 1977]
§ 10.175
Imported directly defined.
Eligible articles shall be imported directly from a beneficiary developing country to qualify for treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences. For purposes of §§ 10.171 through 10.178 the words “imported directly” mean:
(a) Direct shipment from the beneficiary country to the United States without passing through the territory of any other country; or
(b) If the shipment is from a beneficiary developing country to the U.S. through the territory of any other country, the merchandise in the shipment does not enter into the commerce of any other country while en route to the U.S., and the invoice, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the U.S. as the final destination; or
(c) If shipped from the beneficiary developing country to the United States through a free trade zone in a beneficiary developing country, the merchandise shall not enter into the commerce of the country maintaining the free trade zone, and
(1) The eligible articles must not undergo any operation other than:
(i) Sorting, grading, or testing,
(ii) Packing, unpacking, changes of packing, decanting or repacking into other containers,
(iii) Affixing marks, labels, or other like distinguishing signs on articles or their packing, if incidental to operations allowed under this section, or
(iv) Operations necessary to ensure the preservation of merchandise in its condition as introduced into the free trade zone.
(2) Merchandise may be purchased and resold, other than at retail, for export within the free trade zone.
(3) For the purposes of this section, a free trade zone is a predetermined area or region declared and secured by or under governmental authority, where certain operations may be performed with respect to articles, without such articles having entered into the commerce of the country maintaining the free trade zone; or
(d) If the shipment is from any beneficiary developing country to the U.S through the territory of any other country and the invoices and other documents do not show the U.S as the final destination, the articles in the shipment upon arrival in the U.S. are imported directly only if they:
(1) Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country;
(2) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the Center director is satisfied that the importation results from the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the latter's sales agent; and
(3) Were not subjected to operations other than loading and unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the articles in good condition; or
(e)(1) Shipment to the U.S. from a beneficiary developing country which is a member of an association of countries treated as one country under section 507(2), Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2467(2)), through the territory of a former beneficiary developing country whose designation as a member of the same association for GSP purposes was terminated by the President pursuant to section 502(d), Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)), provided the articles in the shipment did not enter into the commerce of the former beneficiary developing country except for purposes of performing one or more of the operations specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and except for purposes of purchase or resale, other than at retail, for export.
(2) The designation of the following countries as members of an association of countries for GSP purposes has been terminated by the President pursuant to section 502(d) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)):
The Bahamas

§ 10.176
Country of origin criteria.
(a)
Merchandise produced in a beneficiary developing country or any two or more countries which are members of the same association of countries
—(1)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, any article which either is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of, or is a new or different article of commerce that has been grown, produced, or manufactured in, a beneficiary developing country may qualify for duty-free entry under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). No article will be considered to have been grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary developing country by virtue of having merely undergone simple (as opposed to complex or meaningful) combining or packaging operations or mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article. Duty-free entry under the GSP may be accorded to an article only if the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in the beneficiary developing country or any two or more countries that are members of the same association of countries and are treated as one country under section 507(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2467(2)), plus the direct costs of processing operations performed in the beneficiary developing country or member countries, is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered.
(2)
Combining, packaging, and diluting operations.
No article which has undergone only a simple combining or packaging operation or a mere dilution in a beneficiary developing country within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be entitled to duty-free treatment even though the processing operation causes the article to meet the value requirement set forth in that paragraph. For purposes of this section:
(i) Simple combining or packaging operations and mere dilution include, but are not limited to, the following:
(A) The addition of batteries to devices;
(B) Fitting together a small number of components by bolting, glueing, soldering, etc.;
(C) Blending foreign and beneficiary developing country tobacco;
(D) The addition of substances such as anticaking agents, preservatives, wetting agents, etc.;
(E) Repacking or packaging components together;
(F) Reconstituting orange juice by adding water to orange juice concentrate; and
(G) Diluting chemicals with inert ingredients to bring them to standard degrees of strength;
(ii) Simple combining or packaging operations and mere dilution will not be taken to include processes such as the following:
(A) The assembly of a large number of discrete components onto a printed circuit board;
(B) The mixing together of two bulk medicinal substances followed by the packaging of the mixed product into individual doses for retail sale;
(C) The addition of water or another substance to a chemical compound under pressure which results in a reaction creating a new chemical compound; and
(D) A simple combining or packaging operation or mere dilution coupled with any other type of processing such as testing or fabrication (for example, a simple assembly of a small number of components, one of which was fabricated in the beneficiary developing country where the assembly took place); and
(iii) The fact that an article has undergone more than a simple combining or packaging operation or mere dilution is not necessarily dispositive of the question of whether that processing constitutes a substantial transformation for purposes of determining the country of origin of the article.
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Merchandise grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary developing country.
Merchandise which is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary developing country, or an association of countries treated as one country under section 507(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2467(2)) and § 10.171(b), and manufactured products consisting of materials produced only
in such country or countries, shall normally be presumed to meet the requirements set forth in this section.

§ 10.177
Cost or value of materials produced in the beneficiary developing country.
(a)
“Produced in the beneficiary developing country” defined.
For purposes of §§ 10.171 through 10.178, the words “produced in the beneficiary developing country” refer to the constituent materials of which the eligible article is composed which are either:
(1) Wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the beneficiary developing country; or
(2) Substantially transformed in the beneficiary developing country into a new and different article of commerce.
(b)
Questionable origin.
When the origin of an article either is not ascertainable or not satisfactorily demonstrated to the Center director, the article shall not be considered to have been produced in the beneficiary developing country.
(c)
Determination of cost or value of materials produced in the beneficiary developing country.
(1) The cost or value of materials produced in the beneficiary developing country includes:
(i) The manufacturer's actual cost for the materials;
(ii) When not included in the manufacturer's actual cost for the materials, the freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the manufacturer's plant;
(iii) The actual cost of waste or spoilage (material list), less the value of recoverable scrap; and
(iv) Taxes and/or duties imposed on the materials by the beneficiary developing country, or an association of countries treated as one country, provided they are not remitted upon exportation.
(2) Where the material is provided to the manufacturer without charge, or at less than fair market value, its cost or value shall be determined by computing the sum of:
(i) All expenses incurred in the growth, production, manufacture or assembly of the material, including general expenses;
(ii) An amount for profit; and
(iii) Freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the manufacturer's plant.
If the pertinent information needed to compute the cost or value of the materials is not available, the appraising officer may ascertain or estimate the value thereof using all reasonable ways and means at his disposal.

§ 10.178
Direct costs of processing operations performed in the beneficiary developing country.
(a)
Items included in the direct costs of processing operations.
As used in § 10.176, the words “direct costs of processing operations” means those costs either directly incurred in, or which can be reasonably allocated to, the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the specific merchandise under consideration. Such costs include, but are not limited to:
(1) All actual labor costs involved in the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the specific merchandise, including fringe benefits, on-the-job training, and the cost of engineering, supervisory, quality control, and similar personnel;
(2) Dies, molds, tooling, and depreciation on machinery and equipment which are allocable to the specific merchandise;
(3) Research, development, design, engineering, and blueprint costs insofar as they are allocable to the specific merchandise; and
(4) Costs of inspecting and testing the specific merchandise.
(b)
Items not included in the direct costs of processing operations.
Those items which are not included within the meaning of the words “direct costs of processing operations” are those which are not directly attributable to the merchandise under consideration or are not “costs” of manufacturing the product. These include, but are not limited to:
(1) Profit; and
(2) General expenses of doing business which are either not allocable to the specific merchandise or are not related to the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the merchandise, such as administrative salaries, casualty and liability insurance, advertising, and salesmen's salaries, commissions, or expenses.

§ 10.178a
Special duty-free treatment for sub-Saharan African countries.
(a)
General.
Section 506A of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2466a) authorizes the President to provide duty-free treatment for certain articles otherwise excluded from duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) pursuant to section 503(b)(1)(B) through (G) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2463(b)(1)(B) through (G)) and authorizes the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3706) as an eligible beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of that duty-free treatment.
(b)
Eligible articles.
The duty-free treatment referred to in paragraph (a) of this section will apply to any article within any of the following classes of articles, provided that the article in question has been designated by the President for that purpose and is the growth, product, or manufacture of an eligible beneficiary sub-Saharan African country and meets the requirements specified or referred to in paragraph (d) of this section:
(1) Watches, except those watches entered after June 30, 1989, that the President specifically determines, after public notice and comment, will not cause material injury to watch or watch band, strap, or bracelet manufacturing and assembly operations in the United States or the United States insular possessions;
(2) Certain electronic articles;
(3) Certain steel articles;
(4) Footwear, handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather wearing apparel which were not eligible articles for purposes of the GSP on January 1, 1995, as the GSP was in effect on that date;
(5) Certain semimanufactured and manufactured glass products; and
(6) Any other articles which the President determines to be import-sensitive in the context of the GSP.
(c)
Claim for duty-free treatment.
A claim for the duty-free treatment referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must be made by placing on the entry document the symbol “D” as a prefix to the subheading of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States for each article for which duty-free treatment is claimed;
(d)
Origin and related rules.
The provisions of §§ 10.171, 10.173, and 10.175 through 10.178 will apply for purposes of duty-free treatment under this section. However, application of those provisions in the context of this section will be subject to the following rules:
(1) The term “beneficiary developing country,” wherever it appears, means “beneficiary sub-Saharan African country;'
(2) In the GSP declaration set forth in § 10.173(a)(1)(i), the column heading “Materials produced in a beneficiary developing country or members of the same association” should read “Material produced in a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, a former beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, or the U.S.;”
(3) The provisions of § 10.175(c) will not apply; and
(4) For purposes of determining compliance with the 35 percent value content requirement set forth in § 10.176(a):
(i) An amount not to exceed 15 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered may be attributed to the cost or value of materials produced in the customs territory of the United States, and the provisions of § 10.177 will apply for purposes of identifying materials produced in the customs territory of the United States and the cost or value of those materials; and
(ii) The cost or value of materials included in the article that are produced in more than one beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or former beneficiary sub-Saharan African country may be applied without regard to whether those countries are members of the same association of countries.
(5) As used in this paragraph, the term “former beneficiary sub-Saharan African country” means a country that, after being designated by the President as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country under section 506A of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2466a), ceased to be designated as such a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country by reason of its entering into a free trade agreement with the United States.
(e)
Importer requirements.
In order to make a claim for duty-free treatment under this section, the importer:
(1) Must have records that explain how the importer came to the conclusion that the article qualifies for duty-free treatment;
(2) Must have records that demonstrate that the importer is claiming that the article qualifies for duty-free treatment because it is the growth of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or because it is the product of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or because it is the manufacture of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. If the importer is claiming that the article is the growth of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, the importer must have records that indicate that the product was grown in that country, such as a record of receipt from a farmer whose crops are grown in that country. If the importer is claiming that the article is the product of, or the manufacture of, a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, the importer must have records that indicate that the manufacturing or processing operations reflected in or applied to the article meet the country of origin rules set forth in § 10.176(a) and paragraph (d) of this section. A properly completed GSP declaration in the form set forth in § 10.173(a)(1) is one example of a record that would serve this purpose;
(3) Must establish and implement internal controls which provide for the periodic review of the accuracy of the declarations or other records referred to in paragraph (e)(2) of this section;
(4) Must have shipping papers that show how the article moved from the beneficiary sub-Saharan African country to the United States. If the imported article was shipped through a country other than a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country and the invoices and other documents from the beneficiary sub-Saharan African country do not show the United States as the final destination, the importer also must have documentation that demonstrates that the conditions set forth in § 10.175(d)(1) through (3) were met;
(5) Must have records that demonstrate the cost or value of the materials produced in the United States and the cost or value of the materials produced in a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or countries and the direct costs of processing operations incurred in the beneficiary sub-Saharan African country that were relied upon by the importer to determine that the article met the 35 percent value content requirement set forth in § 10.176(a) and paragraph (c) of this section. A properly completed GSP declaration in the form set forth in § 10.173(a)(1) is one example of a record that would serve this purpose; and
(6) Must be prepared to produce the records referred to in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(4), and (e)(5) of this section within 30 days of a request from Customs and must be prepared to explain how those records and the internal controls referred to in paragraph (e)(3) of this section justify the importer's claim for duty-free treatment.

# Civil Aircraft
§ 10.183
Duty-free entry of civil aircraft, aircraft engines, ground flight simulators, parts, components, and subassemblies.
(a)
Applicability.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this section applies to aircraft, aircraft engines, and ground flight simulators, including their parts, components, and subassemblies, that qualify as civil aircraft under General Note 6(b) ofthe Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) by meeting the following requirements:
(1) The aircraft, aircraft engines, ground flight simulators, or their parts, components, and subassemblies, are used as original or replacement equipment in the design, development, testing, evaluation, manufacture, repair, maintenance, rebuilding, modification, or conversion of aircraft; and
(2) They are either:
(i) Manufactured or operated pursuant to a certificate issued by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under 49 U.S.C. 44704 or pursuant to the approval of the airworthiness authority in the country of exportation, if that approval is recognized by the FAA as an acceptable substitute for the FAA certificate;
(ii) Covered by an application for such certificate, submitted to and accepted by the FAA, filed by an existing type and production certificate holder pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 44702 and implementing regulations (Federal Aviation Administration Regulations, title 14, Code of Federal Regulations); or
(iii) Covered by an application for such approval or certificate which will be submitted in the future by an existing type and production certificate holder, pending the completion of design or other technical requirements stipulated by the FAA (applicable only to the quantities of parts, components, and subassemblies as are required to meet the stipulation).
(b)
Department of Defense or U.S. Coast Guard use.
If purchased for use by the Department of Defense or the United States Coast Guard, aircraft, aircraft engines, and ground flight simulators, including their parts, components, and subassemblies, are subject to this section only if they are used as original or replacement equipment in the design, development, testing, evaluation, manufacture, repair, maintenance, rebuilding, modification, or conversion of aircraft and meet the requirements of either paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
(c)
Claim for admission free of duty.
Merchandise qualifying under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section is entitled to duty-free admission in accordance with General Note 6, HTSUS, upon meeting the requirements of this section. An importer will make a claim for duty-free admission under this section and General Note 6, HTSUS, by properly entering qualifying merchandise under a provision for which the rate of duty “Free (C)” appears in the “Special” subcolumn of the HTSUS and by placing the special indicator “C” on the entry summary. The fact that qualifying merchandise has previously been exported with benefit of drawback does not preclude free entry under this section.
(d)
Importer certification.
In making a claim for duty-free admission as provided for under paragraph (c) of this section, the importer is deemed to certify, in accordance with General Note 6(a)(ii), HTSUS, that the imported merchandise is, as described in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section, a civil aircraft or has been imported for use in a civil aircraft and will be so used.
(e)
Documentation.
Each entry summary claiming duty-free admission for imported merchandise in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section must be supported by documentation to verify the claim for duty-free admission, including the written order or contract and other evidence that the merchandise entered qualifies under General Note 6, HTSUS, as a civil aircraft, aircraft engine, or ground flight simulator, or their parts, components, and subassemblies. Evidence that the merchandise qualifies under the general note includes evidence of compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section concerning use of the merchandise and evidence of compliance with the airworthiness certification requirement of paragraph (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), or (a)(2)(iii) of this section, including, as appropriate in the circumstances, an FAA certification; approval of airworthiness by an airworthiness authority in the country of export and evidence that the FAA recognizes that approval as an acceptable substitute for an FAA certification; an application for a certification submitted to and accepted by the FAA; a type and production certificate issued by the FAA; and/or evidence that a type and production certificate holder will submit an application for certification or approval in the future pending completion of design or other technical requirements stipulated by the FAA and of estimates
of quantities of parts, components, and subassemblies as are required to meet design and technical requirements stipulated by the FAA. This documentation need not be filed with the entry summary but must be maintained in accordance with the general note and with the recordkeeping provisions of part 163 of this chapter. Customs may request production of documentation at any time to verify the claim for duty-free admission. Failure to produce documentation sufficient to satisfy the Center director that the merchandise qualifies for duty-free admission will result in a denial of duty-free treatment and may result in such other measures permitted under the regulations as the Center director finds necessary to more closely monitor the importer's importations of merchandise claimed to be duty-free under this section. Proof of end use of the entered merchandise need not be maintained.
(f)
Post-entry claim.
An importer may file a claim for duty-free treatment under General Note 6, HTSUS, after filing an entry that made no such duty-free claim, by filing a written statement with Customs any time prior to liquidation of the entry or prior to the liquidation becoming final. When filed, the written statement constitutes the importer's claim for duty-free treatment under the general note and its certification that the entered merchandise is a civil aircraft or has been imported for use in a civil aircraft and will be so used. In accordance with General Note 6, HTSUS, any refund resulting from a claim made under this paragraph will be without interest, notwithstanding the provision of 19 U.S.C. 1505(c).
(g)
Verification.
The Center director will monitor and periodically audit selected entries made under this section.

—(1)
Beneficiary country.
For purposes of §§ 10.191 through 10.199 and except as otherwise provided in § 10.195(b), the term “beneficiary country” means any country or territory or successor political entity with respect to which there is in effect a proclamation by the President designating such country, territory or successor political entity as a beneficiary country in accordance with section 212(a)(1)(A) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2702(a)(1)(A)).
See
General Note 7(a), Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). For purposes of this paragraph, when the word “former” is used in conjunction with the term “beneficiary country”, it means a country that ceases to be designated as a beneficiary country under the CBERA because the country has become a party to a free trade agreement with the United States.
See
General Note 7(b)(i)(C), HTSUS.
(2)
Eligible articles.
Except as provided herein, for purposes of § 10.191(a), the term “eligible articles” means any merchandise which is imported directly from a beneficiary country as provided in § 10.193 and which meets the country of origin criteria set forth in § 10.195 or in § 10.198b. The following merchandise shall not be considered eligible articles entitled to duty-free treatment under the CBI.
(i) Textile and apparel articles which were not eligible articles for purposes of the CBI on January 1, 1994, as the CBI was in effect on that date.

(vi) Articles to which reduced rates of duty apply under § 10.198a.
(vii) Sugars, sirups, and molasses, provided for in subheadings 1701.11.00 and 1701.12.00, HTSUS, to the extent that importation and duty-free treatment of such articles are limited by Additional U.S. Note 4, Chapter 17, HTSUS.
(viii) Articles subject to the provisions of the subheadings of Subchapter III, from the beginning through 9903.85.21, Chapter 99, HTSUS, to the extent that such provisions have not been modified or terminated by the President pursuant to section 213(e)(5) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703(e)(5)).
(ix) Merchandise for which duty-free treatment under the CBI is suspended or withdrawn by the President pursuant to sections 213 (c)(2), (e)(1), or (f)(3) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703 (c)(2), (e)(1), or (f)(3)).
(3)
Wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country.
For purposes of § 10.191 through § 10.199, the expression “wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country” refers both to any article which has been entirely grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary country or two or more beneficiary countries and to all materials incorporated in an article which have been entirely grown, produced, or manufactured in any beneficiary country or two or more beneficary countries, as distinguished from articles or materials imported into a beneficiary country from a non-beneficiary country whether or not such articles or materials were substantially transformed into new or different articles of commerce after their importation into the beneficiary country.
(4)
Entered.
For purposes of § 10.191 through § 10.199, the term “entered” means entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, in the customs territory of the U.S.

§ 10.192
Claim for exemption from duty under the CBI.
A claim for an exemption from duty on the ground that the CBI applies shall be allowed by the Center director only if he is satisfied that the requirements set forth in this section and §§ 10.193 through 10.198b have been met. Duty-free treatment may be claimed at the time of filing the entry summary by placing the symbol “E” as a prefix to the HTSUS subheading number for each article for which such treatment is claimed on that document.

§ 10.193
Imported directly.
To qualify for treatment under the CBI, an article shall be imported directly from a beneficiary country into the customs territory of the U.S. For purposes of § 10.191 through § 10.198b the words “imported directly” mean:
(a) Direct shipment from any beneficiary country to the U.S. without passing through the territory of any non-beneficiary country; or
(b) If the shipment is from any beneficiary country to the U.S. through the territory of any non-beneficiary country, the articles in the shipment do not enter into the commerce of any non-beneficiary country while en route to the U.S. and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the U.S. as the final destination; or
(c) If the shipment is from any beneficiary country to the U.S. through the territory of any non-beneficiary country, and the invoices and other documents do not show the U.S. as the final destination, the articles in the shipment upon arrival in the U.S. are imported directly only if they:
(1) Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country;
(2) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the Center director is satisfied that the importation results from the original commericial transaction between the importer and the producer or the latter's sales agent; and
(3) Were not subjected to operations other than loading and unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the articles in good condition.
[T.D. 84-237, 49 FR 47993, Dec. 7, 1984, as amended by T.D. 00-68, 65 FR 59658, Oct. 5, 2000]
§ 10.194
Evidence of direct shipment.
(a)
Documents constituting evidence of direct shipment.
The Center director may require that appropriate shipping papers, invoices, or other documents be submitted within 60 days of the date of entry as evidence that the articles were “imported directly”, as that term is defined in § 10.193. Any evidence of direct shipment required shall be subject to such verification as deemed necessary by the Center director.
(b)
Waiver of evidence of direct shipment.
The Center director may waive the submission of evidence of direct shipment when otherwise satisfied, taking into consideration the kind and value of the merchandise, that the merchandise was, in fact, imported directly and that it otherwise clearly qualifies for treatment under the CBI.
§ 10.195
Country of origin criteria.
(a)
Articles produced in a beneficiary country
—(1)
General.
Except as provided herein, any article which is either wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country or a new or different article of commerce which has been grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary country, may qualify for duty-free entry under the CBI. No article or material shall be considered to have been grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary country by virtue of having merely undergone simple (as opposed to complex or meaningful) combining or packaging operations, or mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article. Duty-free entry under the CBI may be accorded to an article only if the sum of the cost or value of the material produced in a beneficiary country or countries, plus the direct costs of processing operations performed in a beneficiary country or countries, is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered.
(2)
Combining, packaging, and diluting operations.
No article which has undergone only a simple combining or packaging operation or a mere dilution in a beneficiary country within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be entitled to duty-free treatment even though the processing operation causes the article to meet the value requirement set forth in that paragraph.
(i) For purposes of this section, simple combining or packaging operations and mere dilution include, but are not limited to, the following processes:
(A) The addition of batteries to devices;
(B) Fitting together a small number of components by bolting, glueing, soldering etc.;
(C) Blending foreign and beneficiary country tobacco;
(D) The addition of substances such as anticaking agents, preservatives, wetting agents, etc.;
(E) Repacking or packaging components together;
(F) Reconstituting orange juice by adding water to orange juice concentrate; and
(G) Diluting chemicals with inert ingredients to bring them to standard degrees of strength.
(ii) For purposes of this section, simple combining or packaging operations and mere dilution shall not be taken to include processes such as the following:
(A) The assembly of a large number of discrete components onto a printed circuit board;
(B) The mixing together of two bulk medicinal substances followed by the packaging of the mixed product into individual doses for retail sale;
(C) The addition of water or another substance to a chemical compound
under pressure which results in a reaction creating a new chemical compound; and
(D) A simple combining or packaging operation or mere dilution coupled with any other type of processing such as testing or fabrication (
e.g.,
a simple assembly of a small number of components, one of which was fabricated in the beneficiary country where the assembly took place).
The fact that an article or material has undergone more than a simple combining or packaging operation or mere dilution is not necessarily dispositive of the question of whether that processing constitutes a substantial transformation for purposes of determining the country of origin of the article or material.
(b)
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and former beneficiary countries
—(1)
General.
For purposes of determining the percentage referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the term “beneficiary country” includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and any former beneficiary countries. Any cost or value of materials or direct costs of processing operations attributable to the U.S. Virgin Islands or any former beneficiary country must be included in the article prior to its final exportation from a beneficiary country to the United States.
(2)
Manufacture in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico after final exportation.
Notwithstanding the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1311, if an article from a beneficiary country is entered under bond for processing or use in manufacturing in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, no duty will be imposed on the withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of the product of that processing or manufacturing provided that:
(i) The article entered in the warehouse in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary country within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section and was imported directly from a beneficiary country within the meaning of § 10.193; and
(ii) At the time of its withdrawal from the warehouse, the product of the processing or manufacturing in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico meets the 35 percent value-content requirement prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Materials produced in the U.S.
For purposes of determining the percentage referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered may be attributed to the cost or value of materials produced in the customs territory of the U.S. (other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico). In the case of materials produced in the customs territory of the U.S., the provisions of § 10.196 shall apply.
(d)
Textile components cut to shape in the U.S.
The percentage referred to in paragraph (c) of this section may be attributed in whole or in part to the cost or value of a textile component that is cut to shape (but not to length, width, or both) in the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) from foreign fabric and exported to a beneficiary country for assembly into an article that is then returned to the U.S. and entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1996. For purposes of this paragraph, the terms “textile component” and “fabric” have reference only to goods covered by the definition of “textile or apparel product” set forth in § 102.21(b)(5) of this chapter.
(e)
Articles wholly grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary country.
Any article which is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country, including articles produced or manufactured in a beneficiary country exclusively from materials which are wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country or countries, shall normally be presumed to meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
(f)
Country of origin marking.
The general country of origin marking requirements that apply to all importations are also applicable to articles imported under the CBI.
[T.D. 84-237, 49 FR 47993, Dec. 7, 1984; 49 FR 49575, Dec. 20, 1984, as amended by T.D. 95-69, 60 FR 46197, Sept. 5, 1995; T.D. 95-69, 60 FR 55995, Nov. 6, 1996; T.D. 00-68, 65 FR 59658, Oct. 5, 2000; CBP Dec. 10-29, 75 FR 52450, Aug. 26, 2010]
§ 10.196
Cost or value of materials produced in a beneficiary country or countries.
(a)
“Materials produced in a beneficiary country or countries” defined.
For purposes of § 10.195, the words “materials produced in a beneficiary country or countries” refer to those materials incorporated in an article which are either:
(1) Wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country or two or more beneficiary countries; or
(2) Subject to the limitations set forth in § 10.195(a), substantially transformed in any beneficiary country or two or more beneficiary countries into a new or different article of commerce which is then used in any beneficiary country in the production or manufacture of a new or different article which is imported directly into the U.S.

# Example 1.
A raw, perishable skin of an animal grown in one beneficiary country is sent to another beneficiary country where it is tanned to create nonperishable “crust leather”. The tanned product is then imported directly into the U.S. Because the material of which the imported article is composed is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of one of more beneficiary countries, the entire cost or value of that material may be counted toward the 35 percent value requirement set forth in § 10.195.

# Example 2.
A raw, perishable skin of an animal grown in a non-beneficiary country is sent to a beneficiary country where it is tanned to create nonperishable “crust leather”. The tanned skin is then imported directly into the U.S. Although the tanned skin represents a new or different article of commerce produced in a beneficiary country within the meaning of § 10.195(a), the cost or value of the raw skin may not be counted toward the 35 percent value requirement because (1) the tanned material of which the imported article is composed is not wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country and (2) the tanning operation creates the imported article itself rather than an intermediate article which is then used in the beneficiary country in the production or manufacture of an article imported into the U.S. The tanned skin would be eligible for duty-free treatment only if the direct costs attributable to the tanning operation represent at least 35 percent of the appraised value of the imported article.

# Example 3.
A raw, perishable skin of an animal grown in a non-beneficiary country is sent to a beneficiary country where it is tanned to create nonperishable “crust leather”. The tanned material is then cut, sewn and assembled with a metal buckle imported from a non-beneficiary country to create a finished belt which is imported directly into the U.S. Because the operations performed in the beneficiary country involved both the substantial transformation of the raw skin into a new or different article and the use of that intermediate article in the production or manufacture of a new or different article imported into the U.S., the cost or value of the tanned material used to make the imported article may be counted toward the 35 percent value requirement. The cost or value of the metal buckle imported into the beneficiary country may not be counted toward the 35 percent value requirement because the buckle was not substantially transformed in the beneficiary country into a new or different article prior to its incorporation in the finished belt.

# Example 4.
A raw, perishable skin of an animal grown in the U.S. Virgin Islands is sent to a beneficiary country where it is tanned to create nonperishable “crust leather”, which is then imported directly into the U.S. The tanned skin represents a new or different article of commerce produced in a beneficiary country within the meaning of § 10.195(a), and under § 10.195(b), the raw skin from which the tanned product was made is considered to have been grown in a beneficiary country for the purpose of applying the 35 percent value requirement. The tanned material of which the imported article is composed is considered to be wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of one or more beneficiary countries with the result that the entire cost or value of that material may be counted toward the 35 percent value requirement.
(b)
Questionable origin.
When the origin of a material either is not ascertainable or is not satisfactorily demonstrated to the Center director, the material shall not be considered to have been grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary country.
(c)
Determination of cost or value of materials produced in a beneficiary country.
(1) The cost or value of materials produced in a beneficiary country or countries includes:
(i) The manufacturer's actual cost for the materials;
(ii) When not included in the manufacturer's actual cost for the materials, the freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the manufacturer's plant;
(iii) The actual cost of waste or spoilage (material list), less the value of recoverable scrap; and
(iv) Taxes and/or duties imposed on the materials by any beneficiary country, provided they are not remitted upon exportation.
(2) Where a material is provided to the manufacturer without charge, or at less than fair market value, its cost or value shall be determined by computing the sum of:
(i) All expenses incurred in the growth, production, or manufacture of the material, including general expenses;
(ii) An amount for profit; and
(iii) Freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the manufacturer's plant.
If the pertinent information needed to compute the cost or value of a material is not available, the appraising officer may ascertain or estimate the value thereof using all reasonable ways and means at his disposal.
§ 10.197
Direct costs of processing operations performed in a beneficiary country or countries.
(a)
Items included in the direct costs of processing operations.
As used in §§ 10.195 and 10.198, the words “direct costs of processing operations” mean those costs either directly incurred in, or which can be reasonably allocated to, the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the specific merchandise under consideration. Such costs include, but are not limited to the following, to the extent that they are includable in the appraised value of the imported merchandise:
(1) All actual labor costs involved in the growth, production, manufacture or assembly of the specific merchandise, including fringe benefits, on-the-job training, and the cost of engineering, supervisory, quality control, and similar personnel;
(2) Dies, molds, tooling, and depreciation on machinery and equipment which are allocable to the specific merchandise;
(3) Research, development, design, engineering, and blueprint costs insofar as they are allocable to the specific merchandise and;
(4) Costs of inspecting and testing the specific merchandise.
(b)
Items not included in the direct costs of processing operations.
Those items which are not included within the meaning of the words “direct costs of processing operations” are those which are not directly attributable to the merchandise under consideration or are not “costs” of manufacturing the product. These include, but are not limited to:
(1) Profit; and
(2) General expenses of doing business which are either not allocable to the specific merchandise or are not related to the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the merchandise, such as administrative salaries, casualty and liability insurance, advertising, and salesmen's salaries, commissions, or expenses.

The production records must establish, for each lot of beverage produced, the quantity of rum the growth, product or manufacture of a CBI beneficiary country or of the U.S. Virgin Islands under 19 U.S.C. 2703(a)(6) that is used in producing the finished beverage; the alcoholic content by volume of the finished beverage; and the alcoholic content by volume of the finished beverage, expressed as a percentage, that is attributable to the qualifying rum. If rum from two or more qualifying sources (
e.g.,
rum the growth, product or manufacture of a CBI beneficiary country or of the U.S. Virgin Islands and other rum the growth, product or manufacture of another CBI country) are used in processing the beverage, the alcoholic content requirement may be met by aggregating the alcoholic content of the finished beverage that is attributable to rum from each of the qualifying sources used in processing the finished beverage, as reflected in the production records.

§ 10.201
Applicability.
Title II of Pub. L. 102-182 (105 Stat. 1233), entitled the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) and codified at 19 U.S.C. 3201 through 3206, authorizes the President to proclaim duty-free treatment for all eligible articles from any beneficiary country and to designate countries as beneficiary countries. The provisions of §§ 10.202 through 10.207 set forth the legal requirements and procedures that apply for purposes of obtaining that duty-free treatment for certain articles from a beneficiary country which are identified for purposes of that treatment in General Note 11, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), and in the “Special” rate of duty column of the HTSUS. Provisions regarding preferential treatment of apparel and other textile articles under the ATPA are contained in §§ 10.241 through 10.248, and provisions regarding preferential treatment of tuna and certain other non-textile articles under the ATPA are contained in §§ 10.251 through 10.257.

(c) If shipment from any beneficiary country to the United States was through the territory of a non-beneficiary country and the invoices and other documents do not show the United States as the final destination, then the articles in the shipment, upon arrival in the United States, are imported directly only if they:
(1) Remained under the control of the customs authority in the intermediate country;
(2) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the articles are imported into the United States as a result of the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the latter's sales agent; and

The principles and examples set forth in
§ 10.195(a)(2) of this part shall apply equally for purposes of this paragraph.
§ 10.206

An article may be eligible for duty-free treatment under the ATPA only if the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in a beneficiary country or countries, plus the direct costs of processing operations performed in a beneficiary country or countries, is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered.
(b)
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and CBI beneficiary countries.
For purposes of determining the percentage referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the term “beneficiary country” includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and any CBI beneficiary country as defined in § 10.191(b)(1) of this part. Any cost or value of materials or direct costs of processing operations attributable to the Virgin Islands or any CBI beneficiary country must be included in the article prior to its final exportation to the United States from a beneficiary country as defined in § 10.202(a).
(c)
Materials produced in the United States.
For purposes of determining the percentage referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered may be attributed to the cost or value of materials produced in the customs territory of the United States (other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico).

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii), no material shall be considered to be substantially transformed into a new or different article of commerce by virtue of having merely undergone simple (as opposed to complex or meaningful) combining or packaging operations, or mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article. The examples set forth in § 10.196(a) of this part, and the principles and examples set forth in § 10.195(a)(2) of this part, shall apply for purposes of the corresponding context under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

(2)
“Cost” and “value” defined.
The “cost” of components and the “value” of findings and trimmings or interlinings referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section means:
(i) The ex-factory price of the components, findings and trimmings or interlinings as set out in the invoice or other commercial documents, or, if the price is other than ex-factory, the price as set out in the invoice or other commercial documents adjusted to arrive at an ex-factory price; or
(ii) If the price cannot be determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section or if that price is unreasonable, all reasonable expenses incurred in the growth, production, manufacture or other processing of the components, findings and trimmings, or interlinings, including the cost or value of materials and general expenses, plus a reasonable amount for profit.
(3)
Treatment of fibers and yarns as findings or trimmings.
If any fibers or yarns not wholly formed in the United States or one or more beneficiary countries are used in an article as a finding or trimming described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the fibers or yarns will be considered to be a finding or trimming for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Imported directly defined.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the words “imported directly” mean:
(1) Direct shipment from any beneficiary country to the United States
without passing through the territory of any non-beneficiary country;
(2) If the shipment is from any beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any non-beneficiary country, the articles in the shipment do not enter into the commerce of any non-beneficiary country while en route to the United States and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the United States as the final destination; or
(3) If the shipment is from any beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any non-beneficiary country, and the invoices and other documents do not show the United States as the final destination, the articles in the shipment upon arrival in the United States are imported directly only if they:
(i) Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country;
(ii) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the Center director is satisfied that the importation results from the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the producer's sales agent; and
(iii) Were not subjected to operations other than loading or unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the articles in good condition.

Preparation of Certificate.
The following rules will apply for purposes of completing the Certificate of Origin set forth in paragraph (b) of this section:
(1) Blocks 1 through 5 pertain only to the final article exported to the United States for which preferential treatment may be claimed;
(2) Block 1 should state the legal name and address (including country) of the exporter;
(3) Block 2 should state the legal name and address (including country) of the producer. If there is more than one producer, attach a list stating the legal name and address (including country) of all additional producers. If this information is confidential, it is acceptable to state “available to CBP upon request” in block 2. If the producer and the exporter are the same, state “same” in block 2;
(4) Block 3 should state the legal name and address (including country) of the importer;
(5) In block 4, insert the number and/or letter that identifies the preference group which applies to the article according to the description contained in the CFR provision cited on the Certificate for that group;
(6) Block 5 should provide a full description of each article. The description should be sufficient to relate it to the invoice description and to the description of the article in the international Harmonized System. Include the invoice number as shown on the commercial invoice or, if the invoice number is not known, include another unique reference number such as the shipping order number;
(7) Blocks 6 through 10 must be completed only when the block in question calls for information that is relevant to the preference group identified in block 4;
(8) Block 6 should state the legal name and address (including country) of the fabric producer;
(9) Block 7 should state the legal name and address (including country) of the yarn producer;
(10) Block 8 should state the legal name and address (including country) of the thread producer;
(11) Block 9 should state the name of the folklore article or should state that the article is handloomed, handmade or an ethnic printed fabric;
(12) Block 10, should be completed only when preference group identifier “8” and/or “H” is inserted in block 4 and should state the name of the fabric or yarn that is in short supply in the USMCA or that has been designated as
not available in commercial quantities in the United States;
(13) Block 11 must contain the signature of the exporter or producer or of the exporter's or producer's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;
(14) Block 15 should reflect the date on which the Certificate was completed and signed;
(15) Block 16 should be completed if the Certificate is intended to cover multiple shipments of identical articles as described in block 5 that are imported into the United States during a specified period of up to one year (
see
§ 10.216(b)(4)(ii)). The “from” date is the date on which the Certificate became applicable to the article covered by the blanket Certificate (this date may be prior to the date reflected in block 15). The “to” date is the date on which the blanket period expires;
(16) The telephone and facsimile numbers included in block 17 should be those at which the person who signed the Certificate may be contacted; and
(17) The Certificate may be printed and reproduced locally. If more space is needed to complete the Certificate, attach a continuation sheet.

§ 10.215
Filing of claim for preferential treatment.
(a)
Declaration.
In connection with a claim for preferential treatment for a textile or apparel article described in § 10.213, the importer must make a written declaration that the article qualifies for that treatment. The inclusion on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, of the subheading within Chapter 98 of the HTSUS under which the article is classified will constitute the written declaration. Except in any of the circumstances described in § 10.216(d)(1), the declaration required under this paragraph must be based on an original Certificate of Origin that has been completed and properly executed in accordance with § 10.214, that covers the article being imported, and that is in the possession of the importer.
(b)
Corrected declaration.
If, after making the declaration required under paragraph (a) of this section, the importer has reason to believe that a Certificate of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct, the importer must within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error make a corrected declaration and pay any duties that may be due. A corrected declaration will be effected by submission of a letter or other written statement to the CBP port where the declaration was originally filed.
§ 10.216
Maintenance of records and submission of Certificate by importer.
(a)
Maintenance of records.
Each importer claiming preferential treatment for an article under § 10.215 must maintain, in accordance with the provisions of part 163 of this chapter, all records relating to the importation of the article. Those records must include the original Certificate of Origin referred to in § 10.215(a) and any other relevant documents or other records as specified in § 163.1(a) of this chapter.
(b)
Submission of Certificate.
An importer who claims preferential treatment on a textile or apparel article under § 10.215(a) must provide, at the request of the Center director, a copy of the Certificate of Origin pertaining to the article. A Certificate of Origin submitted to CBP under this paragraph:
(1) Must be in writing or must be transmitted electronically pursuant to any electronic data interchange system authorized by CBP for that purpose;
(2) Must be signed by the exporter or producer or by the exporter's or producer's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;
(3) Must be completed either in the English language or in the language of the country from which the article is exported. If the Certificate is completed in a language other than English, the importer must provide to CBP upon request a written English translation of the Certificate; and
(4) May be applicable to:
(i) A single importation of an article into the United States, including a single shipment that results in the filing of one or more entries and a series of
shipments that results in the filing of one entry; or
(ii) Multiple importations of identical articles into the United States that occur within a specified blanket period, not to exceed 12 months, set out in the Certificate by the exporter. For purposes of this paragraph and § 10.214(c)(15), “identical articles” means articles that are the same in all material respects, including physical characteristics, quality, and reputation.
(c)
Correction and nonacceptance of Certificate.
If the Center director determines that a Certificate of Origin is illegible or defective or has not been completed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the importer will be given a period of not less than five working days to submit a corrected Certificate. A Certificate will not be accepted in connection with subsequent importations during a period referred to in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section if the Center director determined that a previously imported identical article covered by the Certificate did not qualify for preferential treatment.
(d)
Certificate not required
—(1)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an importer is not required to have a Certificate of Origin in his possession for:
(i) An importation of an article for which the Center director has in writing waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin because the Center director is otherwise satisfied that the article qualifies for preferential treatment;
(ii) A non-commercial importation of an article; or
(iii) A commercial importation of an article whose value does not exceed US $2,500, provided that, unless waived by the Center director, the producer, exporter, importer or authorized agent includes on, or attaches to, the invoice or other document accompanying the shipment the following signed statement:
I hereby certify that the article covered by this shipment qualifies for preferential treatment under the AGOA.
Check One:
( ) Producer
( ) Exporter
( ) Importer
( ) Agent
Name
Title
Address
Signature and Date
(2)
Exception.
If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section forms part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding a Certificate of Origin requirement under §§ 10.214 through 10.216, the Center director will notify the importer in writing that for that importation the importer must have in his possession a valid Certificate of Origin to support the claim for preferential treatment. The importer will have 30 calendar days from the date of the written notice to obtain a valid Certificate of Origin, and a failure to timely obtain the Certificate of Origin will result in denial of the claim for preferential treatment. For purposes of this paragraph, a “series of importations” means two or more entries covering articles arriving on the same day from the same exporter and consigned to the same person.
§ 10.217
Verification and justification of claim for preferential treatment.
(a)
Verification by CBP.
A claim for preferential treatment made under § 10.215, including any statements or other information contained on a Certificate of Origin submitted to CBP under § 10.216, will be subject to whatever verification the Center director deems necessary. In the event that the Center director for any reason is prevented from verifying the claim, the Center director may deny the claim for preferential treatment. A verification of a claim for preferential treatment may involve, but need not be limited to, a review of:
(1) All records required to be made, kept, and made available to CBP by the importer or any other person under part 163 of this chapter;
(2) Documentation and other information regarding the country of origin of an article and its constituent materials, including, but not limited to,
production records, information relating to the place of production, the number and identification of the types of machinery used in production, and the number of workers employed in production; and
(3) Evidence to document the use of U.S. materials in the production of the article in question, such as purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents, and customs import and clearance documents.
(b)
Importer requirements.
In order to make a claim for preferential treatment under § 10.215, the importer:
(1) Must have records that explain how the importer came to the conclusion that the textile or apparel article qualifies for preferential treatment. Those records must include documents that support a claim that the article in question qualifies for preferential treatment because it is specifically described in one of the provisions under § 10.213(a). If the importer is claiming that the article incorporates fabric or yarn that originated or was wholly formed in the United States, the importer must have records that identify the U.S. producer of the fabric or yarn. A properly completed Certificate of Origin in the form set forth in § 10.214(b) is a record that would serve these purposes;
(2) Must establish and implement internal controls which provide for the periodic review of the accuracy of the Certificate of Origin or other records referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;
(3) Must have shipping papers that show how the article moved from the beneficiary country to the United States. If the imported article was shipped through a country other than a beneficiary country and the invoices and other documents from the beneficiary country do not show the United States as the final destination, the importer also must have documentation that demonstrates that the conditions set forth in § 10.213(d)(3)(i) through (iii) were met; and
(4) Must be prepared to explain, upon request from CBP, how the records and internal controls referred to in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section justify the importer's claim for preferential treatment.

Dyeing, printing, finishing and other operations
—(1)
Dyeing, printing and finishing operations.
Dyeing, printing, and finishing operations may be performed on any yarn, fabric, or knit-to-shape or other component used in the production of any article described under paragraph (a) of this section without affecting the eligibility of the article for preferential treatment, provided that the operation is performed
in the United States or in a CBTPA beneficiary country and not in any other country and subject to the following additional conditions:
(i) In the case of an article described in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(12), or (a)(13) of this section that is entered on or after September 1, 2002, and that contains a knitted or crocheted or woven fabric, or a knitted or crocheted or woven fabric component produced from fabric, that was wholly formed in the United States from yarns wholly formed in the United States, any dyeing, printing, or finishing of that knitted or crocheted or woven fabric or component must have been carried out in the United States; and
(ii) In the case of assembled luggage described in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, an operation may be performed in a CBTPA beneficiary country only if that operation is incidental to the assembly process within the meaning of § 10.16.
(2)
Other operations.
An article described under paragraph (a) of this section that is otherwise eligible for preferential treatment will not be disqualified from receiving that treatment by virtue of having undergone one or more operations such as embroidering, stone-washing, enzyme-washing, acid washing, perma-pressing, oven-baking, bleaching, garment-dyeing or screen printing, provided that the operation is performed in the United States or in a CBTPA beneficiary country and not in any other country. However, in the case of assembled luggage described in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, an operation may be performed in a CBTPA beneficiary country without affecting the eligibility of the article for preferential treatment only if it is incidental to the assembly process within the meaning of § 10.16.
(c)
Special rules for certain component materials
—(1)
Foreign findings, trimmings, interlinings, fibers and yarns
—(i)
General.
An article otherwise described under paragraph (a) of this section will not be ineligible for the preferential treatment referred to in § 10.221 because the article contains:
(A) Findings and trimmings of foreign origin, if the value of those findings and trimmings does not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the components of the assembled article. For purposes of this section “findings and trimmings” include, but are not limited to, hooks and eyes, snaps, buttons, “bow buds,” decorative lace trim, elastic strips (but only if they are each less than 1 inch in width and are used in the production of brassieres), zippers (including zipper tapes), labels, and sewing thread except in the case of an article described in paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(12) of this section;
(B) Interlinings of foreign origin, if the value of those interlinings does not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the components of the assembled article. For purposes of this section “interlinings” include only a chest type plate, a “hymo” piece, or “sleeve header,” of woven or weft-inserted warp knit construction and of coarse animal hair or man-made filaments;
(C) Any combination of findings and trimmings of foreign origin and interlinings of foreign origin, if the total value of those findings and trimmings and interlinings does not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the components of the assembled article; or
(D) Fibers or yarns not wholly formed in the United States or in one or more CBTPA beneficiary countries if the total weight of all those fibers and yarns is not more than 7 percent of the total weight of the article, except in the case of any apparel article described in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(5) or (a)(12) of this section containing elastomeric yarns which will be eligible for preferential treatment only if those yarns are wholly formed in the United States.
(ii)
“Cost” and “value” defined.
The “cost” of components and the “value” of findings and trimmings or interlinings referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section means:
(A) The price of the components, findings and trimmings, or interlinings when last purchased, f.o.b. port of exportation, as set out in the invoice or other commercial documents, or, if the price is other than f.o.b. port of exportation:
(
1
) The price as set out in the invoice or other commercial documents adjusted to arrive at an f.o.b. port of exportation price; or
(
2
) If no exportation to a CBTPA beneficiary country is involved, the price as set out in the invoice or other commercial documents, less the freight, insurance, packing, and other costs incurred in transporting the components, findings and trimmings, or interlinings to the place of production if included in that price; or
(B) If the price cannot be determined under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section or if Customs finds that price to be unreasonable, all reasonable expenses incurred in the growth, production, manufacture, or other processing of the components, findings and trimmings, or interlinings, including the cost or value of materials and general expenses, plus a reasonable amount for profit, and the freight, insurance, packing, and other costs, if any, incurred in transporting the components, findings and trimmings, or interlinings to the port of exportation.
(iii)
Treatment of fibers and yarns as findings or trimmings.
If any fibers or yarns not wholly formed in the United States or one or more beneficiary countries are used in an article as a finding or trimming described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the fibers or yarns will be considered to be a finding or trimming for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

(d)
Imported directly defined.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the words “imported directly” mean:
(1) Direct shipment from any CBTPA beneficiary country to the United States without passing through the territory of any country that is not a CBTPA beneficiary country;
(2) If the shipment is from any CBTPA beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any country that is not a CBTPA beneficiary country, the articles in the shipment do not enter into the commerce of any country that is not a CBTPA beneficiary country while en route to the United States and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the United States as the final destination; or
(3) If the shipment is from any CBTPA beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any country that is not a CBTPA beneficiary country, and the invoices and other documents do not show the United States as the final destination, the articles in the shipment upon arrival in the United States are imported directly only if they:
(i) Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country;
(ii) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the Center director is satisfied that the importation results from the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the producer's sales agent; and
(iii) Were not subjected to operations other than loading or unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the articles in good condition.

§ 10.224
Certificate of Origin.
(a)
General.
A Certificate of Origin must be employed to certify that a textile or apparel article being exported from a CBTPA beneficiary country to the United States qualifies for the preferential treatment referred to in § 10.221. The Certificate of Origin must be prepared by the exporter in the CBTPA beneficiary country in the form
specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Where the CBTPA beneficiary country exporter is not the producer of the article, that exporter may complete and sign a Certificate of Origin on the basis of:
(1) Its reasonable reliance on the producer's written representation that the article qualifies for preferential treatment; or
(2) A completed and signed Certificate of Origin for the article voluntarily provided to the exporter by the producer.
(b)
Form of Certificate.
The Certificate of Origin referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must be in the following format:

§ 10.225
Filing of claim for preferential treatment.
(a)
Declaration.
In connection with a claim for preferential treatment for a textile or apparel article described in § 10.223, the importer must make a written declaration that the article qualifies for that treatment. The inclusion on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, of the subheading within Chapter 98 of the HTSUS under which the article is classified will constitute the written declaration. Except in any of the circumstances described in § 10.226(d)(1), the declaration required under this paragraph must be based on a Certificate of Origin that has been completed and properly executed in accordance with § 10.224 and that covers the article being imported.
(b)
Corrected declaration.
If, after making the declaration required under paragraph (a) of this section, the importer has reason to believe that a Certificate of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct, the importer must within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error make a corrected declaration and pay any duties
that may be due. A corrected declaration will be effected by submission of a letter or other written statement to the Customs port where the declaration was originally filed.

§ 10.226
Maintenance of records and submission of Certificate by importer.
(a)
Maintenance of records.
Each importer claiming preferential treatment for an article under § 10.225 must maintain in the United States, in accordance with the provisions of part 163 of this chapter, all records relating to the importation of the article. Those records must include the original Certificate of Origin referred to in § 10.225(a) and any other relevant documents or other records as specified in § 163.1(a) of this chapter.
(b)
Submission of Certificate.
An importer who claims preferential treatment on a textile or apparel article under § 10.225(a) must provide, at the request of the Center director, a copy of the Certificate of Origin pertaining to the article. A Certificate of Origin submitted to Customs under this paragraph:
(1) Must be in writing or must be transmitted electronically pursuant to any electronic data interchange system authorized by Customs for that purpose;
(2) Must be signed by the exporter or by the exporter's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;
(3) Must be completed either in the English language or in the language of the country from which the article is exported. If the Certificate is completed in a language other than English, the importer must provide to Customs upon request a written English translation of the Certificate; and
(4) May be applicable to:
(i) A single importation of an article into the United States, including a single shipment that results in the filing of one or more entries and a series of shipments that results in the filing of one entry; or
(ii) Multiple importations of identical articles into the United States that occur within a specified blanket period, not to exceed 12 months, set out in the Certificate by the exporter. For purposes of this paragraph and § 10.224(c)(15), “identical articles” means articles that are the same in all material respects, including physical characteristics, quality, and reputation.
(c)
Correction and nonacceptance of Certificate.
If the Center director determines that a Certificate of Origin is illegible or defective or has not been completed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the importer will be given a period of not less than five working days to submit a corrected Certificate. A Certificate will not be accepted in connection with subsequent importations during a period referred to in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section if the Center director determined that a previously imported identical article covered by the Certificate did not qualify for preferential treatment.
(d)
Certificate not required
—(1)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an importer is not required to have a Certificate of Origin in his possession for:
(i) An importation of an article for which the Center director has in writing waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin because the Center director is otherwise satisfied that the article qualifies for preferential treatment;
(ii) A non-commercial importation of an article; or
(iii) A commercial importation of an article whose value does not exceed US $2,500, provided that, unless waived by the Center director, the producer, exporter, importer or authorized agent includes on, or attaches to, the invoice or other document accompanying the shipment the following signed statement:
I hereby certify that the article covered by this shipment qualifies for preferential treatment under the CBTPA.
Check One:
( ) Producer
( ) Exporter
( ) Importer
( ) Agent

Signature and Date
(2)
Exception.
If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section forms part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding a Certificate of Origin requirement under §§ 10.224 through 10.226, the Center director will notify the importer in writing that for that importation the importer must have in his possession a valid Certificate of Origin to support the claim for preferential treatment. The importer will have 30 calendar days from the date of the written notice to obtain a valid Certificate of Origin, and a failure to timely obtain the Certificate of Origin will result in denial of the claim for preferential treatment. For purposes of this paragraph, a “series of importations” means two or more entries covering articles arriving on the same day from the same exporter and consigned to the same person.
[T.D. 00-68, 65 FR 59658, Oct. 5, 2000, as amended by T.D. 03-12, 68 FR 13835, Mar. 21, 2003]
§ 10.227
Verification and justification of claim for preferential treatment.
(a)
Verification by Customs.
A claim for preferential treatment made under § 10.225, including any statements or other information contained on a Certificate of Origin submitted to Customs under § 10.226, will be subject to whatever verification the Center director deems necessary. In the event that the Center director for any reason is prevented from verifying the claim, the Center director may deny the claim for preferential treatment. A verification of a claim for preferential treatment may involve, but need not be limited to, a review of:
(1) All records required to be made, kept, and made available to Customs by the importer or any other person under part 163 of this chapter;
(2) Documentation and other information regarding the country of origin of an article and its constituent materials, including, but not limited to, production records, information relating to the place of production, the number and identification of the types of machinery used in production, and the number of workers employed in production; and
(3) Evidence to document the use of U.S. materials in the production of the article in question, such as purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents, and customs import and clearance documents.
(b)
Importer requirements.
In order to make a claim for preferential treatment under § 10.225, the importer:
(1) Must have records that explain how the importer came to the conclusion that the textile or apparel article qualifies for preferential treatment. Those records must include documents that support a claim that the article in question qualifies for preferential treatment because it is specifically described in one of the provisions under § 10.223(a). If the importer is claiming that the article incorporates fabric or yarn that was wholly formed in the United States, the importer must have records that identify the U.S. producer of the fabric or yarn. A properly completed Certificate of Origin in the form set forth in § 10.224(b) is a record that would serve these purposes;
(2) Must establish and implement internal controls which provide for the periodic review of the accuracy of the Certificates of Origin or other records referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;
(3) Must have shipping papers that show how the article moved from the CBTPA beneficiary country to the United States. If the imported article was shipped through a country other than a CBTPA beneficiary country and the invoices and other documents from the CBTPA beneficiary country do not show the United States as the final destination, the importer also must have documentation that demonstrates that the conditions set forth in § 10.223(d)(3)(i) through (iii) were met; and
(4) Must be prepared to explain, upon request from Customs, how the records and internal controls referred to in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this
section justify the importer's claim for preferential treatment.

Limitations on preferential treatment
—(1)
General.
During the year that begins on October 1, 2002, and during any subsequent year, articles of a producer or an entity controlling production that conform to the production standards set forth in § 10.223(a)(6) will be eligible for preferential treatment only if:
(i) The aggregate cost of fabrics (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) formed in the United States that were used in the production of all of those articles of that producer or that entity controlling production that are entered as articles described in § 10.223(a)(6) during the immediately preceding year was at least 75 percent of the aggregate declared customs value of the fabric (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) contained in all of those articles of that producer or that entity controlling production that are entered as articles described in § 10.223(a)(6) during that year; or
(ii) In a case in which the 75 percent requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section was not met during a year and therefore those articles of that producer or that entity controlling production were not eligible for preferential treatment during the following year, the aggregate cost of fabrics (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) formed in the United States that were used in the production of all of those articles of that producer or that entity controlling production that conform to the production standards set forth in § 10.223(a)(6) and that were entered during the immediately preceding year was at least 85
percent of the aggregate declared customs value of the fabric (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) contained in all of those articles of that producer or that entity controlling production that conform to the production standards set forth in § 10.223(a)(6) and that were entered during that year; and

—(i)
General.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section and for purposes of preparing and filing the documentation prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, the following rules will apply:
(A) The articles in question must have been produced in the manner specified in § 10.223(a)(6) and the articles in question must be entered within the same year;
(B) Articles that are exported to countries other than the United States and are never entered are not to be considered in determining compliance with the 75 or 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section;
(C) Articles that are entered under an HTSUS subheading other than the HTSUS subheading which pertains to articles described in § 10.223(a)(6) are not to be considered in determining compliance with the 75 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section;
(D) For purposes of determining compliance with the 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, all articles that conform to the production standards set forth in § 10.223(a)(6) must be considered, regardless of the HTSUS subheading under which they were entered;
(E) Fabric components and fabrics that constitute findings or trimmings are not to be considered in determining compliance with the 75 or 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section;
(F) Beginning October 1, 2002, in order for articles to be eligible for preferential treatment in a given year, a producer of, or entity controlling production of, those articles must have met the 75 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section during the immediately preceding year. If articles of a producer or entity controlling production fail to meet the 75 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section during a year, articles of that producer or entity controlling production:
(
1
) Will not be eligible for preferential treatment during the following year;
(
2
) Will remain ineligible for preferential treatment until the year that follows a year in which articles of that producer or entity controlling production met the 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section; and
(
3
) After the 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section has been met, will again be subject to the 75 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section during the following year for purposes of determining eligibility for preferential treatment in the next year.
(G) A new producer or new entity controlling production, that is, a producer or entity controlling production which did not produce or control production of articles that were entered as articles described in § 10.223(a)(6) during the immediately preceding year, must first establish compliance with the 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section as a prerequisite to preparation of the declaration of compliance referred to in paragraph (c) of this section;
(H) A declaration of compliance prepared by a producer or by an entity controlling production must cover all production of that producer or all production that the entity controls for the year in question;
(I) A producer is not required to prepare a declaration of compliance if all of its production is covered by a declaration of compliance prepared by an entity controlling production;
(J) In the case of a producer, the 75 or 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and the declaration of compliance procedure under paragraph (c) of this section apply to all articles of that producer for the year in question, even if some but not all of that production is also covered by a declaration of compliance prepared by an entity controlling production;
(K) The U.S. importer does not have to be the producer or the entity controlling production who prepared the declaration of compliance; and
(L) The exclusion references regarding findings and trimmings in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section apply to all findings and trimmings, whether or not they are of foreign origin.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples will illustrate application of the principles set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

# Example 1.
A CBTPA beneficiary country producer of articles that meet the production standards specified in § 10.223(a)(6) in the first year sends 50 percent of that production to CBTPA region markets and the other 50 percent to the U.S. market; the cost of the fabrics formed in the United States equals 100 percent of the value of all of the fabric in the articles sent to the CBTPA region and 60 percent of the value of all of the fabric in the articles sent to the United States. Although the cost of fabrics formed in the United States is more than 75 percent of the value of all of the fabric used in all of the articles produced, this producer could not prepare a valid declaration of compliance because the articles sent to the United States did not meet the minimum 75 percent standard.

# Example 2.
A producer sends to the United States in the first year three shipments of articles that meet the description in § 10.223(a)(6); one of those shipments is entered under the HTSUS subheading that covers articles described in § 10.223(a)(6), the second shipment is entered under the HTSUS subheading that covers articles described in § 10.223(a)(12), and the third shipment is entered under subheading 9802.00.80, HTSUS. In determining whether the minimum 75 percent standard has been met in the first year for purposes of entry of articles under the HTSUS subheading that covers articles described in § 10.223(a)(6) during the following (that is, second) year, consideration must be restricted to the articles in the first shipment and therefore must not include the articles in the second and third shipments.

# Example 3.
A producer in the second year begins production of articles that conform to the production standards specified in § 10.223(a)(6); some of those articles are entered in that year under HTSUS subheading 6212.10 and others under HTSUS subheading 9802.00.80 but none are entered in that year under the HTSUS subheading which pertains to articles described in § 10.223(a)(6) because the 75 percent standard had not been met in the preceding (that is, first) year. In this case the 85 percent standard applies, and all of the articles that were entered under the various HTSUS provisions in the second year must be taken into account in determining whether that 85 percent standard has been met. If the 85 percent was met in the aggregate for all of the articles entered in the second year, in the next (that is, third) year articles of that producer may receive preferential treatment under the HTSUS subheading which pertains to articles described in § 10.223(a)(6).

# Example 4.
An entity controlling production of articles that meet the description in § 10.223(a)(6) buys for the U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets; the articles in each case are first sent to the United States where they are entered for consumption and then placed in a commercial warehouse from which they are shipped to various stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Notwithstanding the fact that some of the articles ultimately ended up in Canada or Mexico, a declaration of compliance prepared by the entity controlling production must cover all of the articles rather than only those that remained in the United States because all of those articles had been entered for consumption.

# Example 5.
Fabric is cut and sewn in the United States with other U.S. materials to form cups which are joined together to form brassiere front subassemblies in the United States, and those front subassemblies are then placed in a warehouse in the United States where they are held until the following year; during that following year all of the front subassemblies are shipped to a CBTPA beneficiary country where they are assembled with elastic strips and labels produced in an Asian country and other fabrics, components or materials produced in the CBTPA beneficiary country to form articles that meet the production standards specified in § 10.223(a)(6) and that are then shipped to the United States and entered during that same year. In determining whether the entered articles meet the minimum 75 or 85 percent standard, the fabric in the elastic strips and labels is to be disregarded entirely because the strips and labels constitute findings or trimmings for purposes of this section, and all of the fabric in the front subassemblies is countable because it was all formed in the United States and used in the
production of articles that were entered in the same year.

# Example 6.
A CBTPA beneficiary country producer's entire production of articles that meet the description in § 10.223(a)(6) is sent to a U.S. importer in two separate shipments, one in February and the other in June of the same calendar year; the articles shipped in February do not meet the minimum 75 percent standard, the articles shipped in June exceed the 85 percent standard, and the articles in the two shipments, taken together, do meet the 75 percent standard; the articles covered by the February shipment are entered for consumption on March 1 of that calendar year, and the articles covered by the June shipment are placed in a CBP bonded warehouse upon arrival and are subsequently withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on November 1 of that calendar year. The CBTPA beneficiary country producer may not prepare a valid declaration of compliance covering the articles in the first shipment because those articles did not meet the minimum 75 percent standard and because those articles cannot be included with the articles of the second shipment on the same declaration of compliance since they were entered in a different year. However, the CBTPA beneficiary country producer may prepare a valid declaration of compliance covering the articles in the second shipment because those articles did meet the requisite 85 percent standard which would apply for purposes of entry of articles in the following year.

# Example 7.
A producer in the second year begins production of articles exclusively for the U.S. market that meet the production standards specified in § 10.223(a)(6), but the entered articles do not meet the requisite 85 percent standard until the third year; the entered articles fail to meet the 75 percent standard in the fourth year; and the entered articles do not attain the 85 percent standard until the sixth year. The producer's articles may not receive preferential treatment during the second year because there was no production (and thus there were no entered articles) in the immediately preceding (that is, first) year on which to assess compliance with the 75 percent standard. The producer's articles also may not receive preferential treatment during the third year because the 85 percent standard was not met in the immediately preceding (that is, second) year. However, the producer's articles are eligible for preferential treatment during the fourth year based on compliance with the 85 percent standard in the immediately preceding (that is, third) year. The producer's articles may not receive preferential treatment during the fifth year because the 75 percent standard was not met in the immediately preceding (that is, fourth) year. The producer's articles may not receive preferential treatment during the sixth year because the 85 percent standard has become applicable and was not met in the immediately preceding (that is, fifth) year. The producer's articles are eligible for preferential treatment during the seventh year because the 85 percent standard was met in the immediately preceding (that is, sixth) year, and during that seventh year the 75 percent standard is applicable for purposes of determining whether the producer's articles are eligible for preferential treatment in the following (that is, eighth) year.

# Example 8.
An entity controlling production (Entity A) uses five CBTPA beneficiary country producers (Producers 1-5), all of which produce only articles that meet the description in § 10.223(a)(6); Producers 1-4 send all of their production to the United States and Producer 5 sends 10 percent of its production to the United States and the rest to Europe; Producers 1-3 and Producer 5 produce only pursuant to contracts with Entity A, but Producer 4 also operates independently of Entity A by producing for several U.S. importers, one of which is an entity controlling production (Entity B) that also controls all of the production of articles of one other producer (Producer 6) which sends all of its production to the United States. A declaration of compliance prepared by Entity A must cover all of the articles of Producers 1-3 and the 10 percent of articles of Producer 5 that are sent to the United States and that portion of the articles of Producer 4 that are produced pursuant to the contract with Entity A, because Entity A controls the production of those articles. There is no need for Producers 1-3 and Producer 5 to prepare a declaration of compliance because they have no production that is not covered by a declaration of compliance prepared by an entity controlling production. A declaration of compliance prepared by Producer 4 would cover all of its production, that is, articles produced for Entity A, articles produced for Entity B, and articles produced independently for other U.S. importers; a declaration of compliance prepared by Entity B must cover that portion of the production of Producer 4 that it controls as well as all of the production of Producer 6 because Entity B also controls all of the production of Producer 6. Producer 6 would not prepare a declaration of compliance because all of its production is covered by the declaration of compliance prepared by Entity B.
(c)
Documentation
—(1)
Initial declaration of compliance.
In order for an importer to comply with the requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the producer or the entity controlling production must have filed with CBP, in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a declaration of compliance with the applicable
75 or 85 percent requirement prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section. After filing of the declaration of compliance has been completed, CBP will advise the producer or the entity controlling production of the distinct and unique identifier assigned to that declaration. The producer or the entity controlling production will then be responsible for advising each appropriate U.S. importer of that distinct and unique identifier for purposes of recording that identifier on the entry summary or warehouse withdrawal. In order to provide sufficient time for advising the U.S. importer of that distinct and unique identifier prior to the arrival of the articles in the United States, the producer or the entity controlling production should file the declaration of compliance with CBP at least 10 calendar days prior to the date of the first shipment of the articles to the United States.
(2)
Amended declaration of compliance.
If the information on the declaration of compliance referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is based on an estimate because final year-end information was not available at that time and the final data differs from the estimate, or if the producer or the entity controlling production has reason to believe for any other reason that the declaration of compliance that was filed contained erroneous information, within 30 calendar days after the final year-end information becomes available or within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error:
(i) The producer or the entity controlling production must file with the CBP office identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section an amended declaration of compliance containing that final year-end information or other corrected information; or
(ii) If that final year-end information or other corrected information demonstrates noncompliance with the applicable 75 or 85 percent requirement, the producer or the entity controlling production must in writing advise both the CBP office identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section and each appropriate U.S. importer of that fact.

Verification of declaration of compliance
—(1)
Verification procedure.
A declaration of compliance filed under this section will be subject to whatever verification CBP deems necessary. In the event that CBP for any reason is prevented from verifying the statements made on a declaration of compliance, CBP may deny any claim for preferential treatment made under § 10.225 that is based on that declaration. A verification of a declaration of compliance may involve, but need not be limited to, a review of:
(i) All records required to be made, kept, and made available to CBP by the importer, the producer, the entity controlling production, or any other person under part 163 of this chapter;
(ii) Documentation and other information regarding all articles that meet the production standards specified in § 10.223(a)(6) that were exported to the United States and that were entered during the year in question, whether or not a claim for preferential treatment was made under § 10.225. Those records and other information include, but are not limited to, work orders and other production records, purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents;
(iii) Evidence to document the cost of fabrics formed in the United States that were used in the production of the articles in question, such as purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents, and customs import and clearance documents, work orders and other production records, and inventory control records;
(iv) Evidence to document the cost or value of all fabric other than fabrics formed in the United States that were used in the production of the articles in question, such as purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents, and customs import and clearance documents, work orders and other production records, and inventory control records; and
(v) Accounting books and documents to verify the records and information referred to in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section. The verification of purchase orders, invoices and bills of lading will be accomplished through the review of a distinct audit trail. The audit trail documents must consist of a cash disbursement or purchase journal or equivalent records to establish the purchase of the fabric. The headings in each of these journals or other records must contain the date, vendor name, and amount paid for the fabric. The verification of production records and work orders will be accomplished through analysis of the inventory records of the producer or entity controlling production. The inventory records must reflect the production of the finished article which must be referenced to the original purchase order or lot number covering the
fabric used in production. In the inventory production records, the inventory should show the opening balance of the inventory plus the purchases made during the accounting period and the inventory closing balance.
(2)
Notice of determination.
If, based on a verification of a declaration of compliance filed under this section, CBP determines that the applicable 75 or 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section was not met, CBP will publish a notice of that determination in the
Federal Register.

CBTPA beneficiary country to the United States qualifies for the preferential tariff treatment referred to in § 10.231. The Certificate of Origin must be prepared by the exporter in the CBTPA beneficiary country. Where the CBTPA beneficiary country exporter is not the producer of the article, that exporter may complete and sign a Certificate of Origin on the basis of:
(a) Its reasonable reliance on the producer's written representation that the article qualifies for preferential tariff treatment; or
(b) A completed and signed Certificate of Origin for the article voluntarily provided to the exporter by the producer.
§ 10.235
Filing of claim for preferential tariff treatment.
(a)
Declaration.
In connection with a claim for preferential tariff treatment for an article described in § 10.233(a)(1) through (5), the importer must make a written declaration that the article qualifies for that treatment.

A corrected declaration will be effected by submission of a letter or other written statement to CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically.
§ 10.236
Maintenance of records and submission of Certificate by importer.
(a)
Maintenance of records.
Each importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for an article under § 10.235 must maintain in the United States, in accordance with the provisions of part 163 of this chapter, all records relating to the importation of the article. Those records must include the original Certificate of Origin referred to in § 10.235(a) and any other relevant documents or other records as specified in § 163.1(a) of this chapter.
(b)
Submission of Certificate.
An importer who claims preferential tariff treatment on an article under § 10.235(a) must provide, at the request of the Center director, a copy of the Certificate of Origin pertaining to the article. A Certificate of Origin submitted to CBP under this paragraph:
(1) Must be on CBP Form 450, including privately-printed copies of that Form, or, as an alternative to CBP Form 450, in an approved computerized format or other medium or format as is approved by the Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. An alternative format must contain the same information and certification set forth on CBP Form 450;
(2) Must be signed by the exporter or by the exporter's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;
(3) Must be completed either in the English language or in the language of the country from which the article is exported. If the Certificate is completed in a language other than English, the importer must provide to Customs upon request a written English translation of the Certificate; and
(4) May be applicable to:
(i) A single importation of an article into the United States, including a single shipment that results in the filing of one or more entries and a series of shipments that results in the filing of one entry; or
(ii) Multiple importations of identical articles into the United States that occur within a specified period, not to exceed 12 months, set out in the Certificate by the exporter.
(c)
Correction and nonacceptance of Certificate.
If the Center director determines that a Certificate of Origin is illegible or defective or has not been completed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the importer will be given a period of not less than five working days to submit a corrected Certificate. A Certificate will not be accepted in connection with subsequent importations during a period referred to in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section if the Center director determined that a previously imported identical article covered by the Certificate did not qualify for preferential treatment.
(d)
Certificate not required
—(1)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an importer is not required to have a Certificate of Origin in his possession for:
(i) An importation of an article for which the Center director has in writing waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin because the Center director is otherwise satisfied that the article qualifies for preferential tariff treatment;
(ii) A non-commercial importation of an article; or
(iii) A commercial importation of an article whose value does not exceed US$2,500, provided that, unless waived by the Center director, the producer, exporter, importer or authorized agent includes on, or attaches to, the invoice or other document accompanying the shipment the following signed statement:
I hereby certify that the article covered by this shipment qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under the CBTPA.

(2)
Exception.
If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section forms part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding a Certificate of Origin requirement under §§ 10.234 through 10.236, the Center director will notify the importer in writing that for that importation the importer must have in his possession a valid Certificate of Origin to support the claim for preferential tariff treatment. The importer will have 30 calendar days from the date of the written notice to obtain a valid Certificate of Origin, and a failure to timely obtain the Certificate of Origin will result in denial of the claim for preferential tariff treatment. For purposes of this paragraph, a “series of importations” means two or more entries covering articles arriving on the same day from the same exporter and consigned to the same person.
§ 10.237
Verification and justification of claim for preferential tariff treatment.
(a)
Verification by Customs.
A claim for preferential tariff treatment made under § 10.235, including any statements or other information contained on a Certificate of Origin submitted to Customs under § 10.236, will be subject to whatever verification the Center director deems necessary. In the event that the Center director for any reason is prevented from verifying the claim, the Center director may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment. A verification of a claim for preferential tariff treatment may involve, but need not be limited to, a review of:
(1) All records required to be made, kept, and made available to Customs by the importer or any other person under part 163 of this chapter;
(2) Documentation and other information in a CBTPA beneficiary country regarding the country of origin of an article and its constituent materials, including, but not limited to, production records, information relating to the place of production, the number and identification of the types of machinery used in production, and the number of workers employed in production; and
(3) Evidence in a CBTPA beneficiary country to document the use of U.S.
materials in the production of the article in question, such as purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents, and customs import and clearance documents.
(b)
Importer requirements.
In order to make a claim for preferential tariff treatment under § 10.235, the importer:
(1) Must have records that explain how the importer came to the conclusion that the article qualifies for preferential tariff treatment. Those records must include documents that support a claim that the article in question qualifies for preferential tariff treatment because it meets the applicable rule of origin set forth in General Note 11, HTSUS, and in part 182, appendix A of this chapter. A properly completed Certificate of Origin in the form prescribed in § 10.236(b) is a record that would serve this purpose;

§ 10.241
Applicability.
Title XXXI of Public Law 107-210 (116 Stat. 933), entitled the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), amended sections 202, 203, 204, and 208 of the Andean Trade Preference Act (the ATPA, 19 U.S.C. 3201-3206) to authorize the President to extend additional trade benefits to countries that are designated as beneficiary countries under the ATPA. Section 204(b)(3) of the ATPA (19 U.S.C. 3203(b)(3)) provides for the preferential treatment of certain apparel and other textile articles from those ATPA beneficiary countries which the President designates as ATPDEA beneficiary countries.

Federal Register,
that the beneficiary country has satisfied the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 3203(b)(5)(A)(ii).
Chief value.
“Chief value” when used with reference to llama, alpaca, and vicuña means that the value of those materials exceeds the value of any other single textile material in the fabric or component under consideration, with the value in each case determined by application of the principles set forth in § 10.243(c)(1)(ii).

were cut from fabric in one or more ATPDEA beneficiary countries, or were cut from fabric in the United States and used in a partial assembly operation in the United States prior to cutting of fabric and assembly of the article in one or more ATPDEA beneficiary countries, or both.
Foreign origin.
“Foreign origin” means, in the case of a finding or trimming of non-textile materials, that the finding or trimming is a product of a country other than the United States or a ATPDEA beneficiary country and, in the case of a finding, trimming, or interlining of textile materials, that the finding, trimming, or interlining does not meet all of the U.S. and ATPDEA beneficiary country production requirements for yarns, fabrics, and/or components specified under § 10.243(a) for the article in which it is incorporated.

(b)
Dyeing, printing, finishing and other operations
—(1)
Dyeing, printing and finishing operations.
Dyeing, printing, and finishing operations may be performed on any yarn, fabric, or knit-to-shape or other component used in the production of any article described under paragraph (a) of this section without affecting the eligibility of the article for preferential treatment, provided that the operation is performed in the United States or in an ATPDEA beneficiary country and not in any other country and subject to the following additional conditions:
(i) In the case of an article described in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(7) of this section that contains a knitted or crocheted or woven fabric, or a knitted or crocheted or woven fabric component produced from fabric, that was wholly formed in the United States from yarns wholly formed in the United States or in one or more ATPDEA beneficiary countries, as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, any dyeing, printing, or finishing of that knitted or crocheted or woven fabric or component must have been carried out in the United States; and
(ii) In the case of assembled luggage described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, an operation may be performed in an ATPDEA beneficiary country only if that operation is incidental to the assembly process within the meaning of § 10.16.
(2)
Other operations.
An article described under paragraph (a) of this section that is otherwise eligible for preferential treatment will not be disqualified from receiving that treatment by virtue of having undergone one or more operations such as embroidering, stone-washing, enzyme-washing, acid washing, perma-pressing, oven-baking, bleaching, garment-dyeing or screen printing, provided that the operation is performed in the United States or in an ATPDEA beneficiary country and not in any other country. However, in the case of assembled luggage described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, an operation may be performed in an ATPDEA beneficiary country without affecting the eligibility of the article for preferential treatment only if it is incidental to the assembly process within the meaning of § 10.16.
(c)
Special rules for certain component materials
—(1)
Foreign findings, trimmings, interlinings, and yarns
—(i)
General.
An article otherwise described under paragraph (a) of this section will not be ineligible for the preferential treatment referred to in § 10.241 because the article contains:
(A) Findings and trimmings of foreign origin, if the value of those findings and trimmings does not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the components of the assembled article. For purposes of this section “findings and trimmings” include, but are not limited to, sewing thread, hooks and eyes, snaps, buttons, “bow buds,” decorative lace trim, elastic strips, zippers (including zipper tapes), and labels;
(B) Interlinings of foreign origin, if the value of those interlinings does not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the components of the assembled article. For purposes of this section “interlinings” include only a chest type plate, a “hymo” piece, or “sleeve header,” of woven or weft-inserted warp knit construction and of coarse animal hair or man-made filaments;
(C) Any combination of findings and trimmings of foreign origin and interlinings of foreign origin, if the total value of those findings and trimmings and interlinings does not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the components of the assembled article; or
(D) Yarns not wholly formed in the United States or in one or more ATPDEA beneficiary countries if the total weight of all those yarns is not more than 7 percent of the total weight of the article.
(ii)
“Cost” and “value” defined.
The “cost” of components and the “value”
of findings and trimmings or interlinings referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section means:
(A) The ex-factory price of the components, findings and trimmings, or interlinings as set out in the invoice or other commercial documents, or, if the price is other than ex-factory, the price as set out in the invoice or other commercial documents adjusted to arrive at an ex-factory price; or
(B) If the price cannot be determined under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section or if CBP finds that price to be unreasonable, all reasonable expenses incurred in the growth, production, manufacture, or other processing of the components, findings and trimmings, or interlinings, including the cost or value of materials and general expenses, plus a reasonable amount for profit.
(iii)
Treatment of yarns as findings or trimmings.
If any yarns not wholly formed in the United States or one or more ATPDEA beneficiary countries are used in an article as a finding or trimming described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, the yarns will be considered to be a finding or trimming for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(2)
Special rule for nylon filament yarn.
An article otherwise described under paragraph (a)(1)(i) through (iii), (a)(2), or (a)(7) of this section will not be ineligible for the preferential treatment referred to in § 10.241 because the article contains nylon filament yarn (other than elastomeric yarn) that is classifiable in subheading 5402.10.30, 5402.10.60, 5402.31.30, 5402.31.60, 5402.32.30, 5402.32.60, 5402.41.10, 5402.41.90, 5402.51.00, or 5402.61.00 of the HTSUS and that is entered free of duty from Canada, Mexico, or Israel.
(d)
Imported directly defined.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the words “imported directly” mean:
(1) Direct shipment from any ATPDEA beneficiary country to the United States without passing through the territory of any country that is not an ATPDEA beneficiary country;
(2) If the shipment is from any ATPDEA beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any country that is not an ATPDEA beneficiary country, the articles in the shipment do not enter into the commerce of any country that is not an ATPDEA beneficiary country while en route to the United States and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the United States as the final destination; or
(3) If the shipment is from any ATPDEA beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any country that is not an ATPDEA beneficiary country, and the invoices and other documents do not show the United States as the final destination, the articles in the shipment upon arrival in the United States are imported directly only if they:
(i) Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country;
(ii) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the Center director is satisfied that the importation results from the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the producer's sales agent; and
(iii) Were not subjected to operations other than loading or unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the articles in good condition.

Block 9 also should be completed if preference group E or I applies to the article described in block 4 and the article incorporates a fabric or yarn described in preference group C or D;
(12) Block 10 must contain the signature of the producer or exporter or the producer's or exporter's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;
(13) Block 14 should reflect the date on which the Certificate was completed and signed;
(14) Block 15 should be completed if the Certificate is intended to cover multiple shipments of identical articles as described in block 4 that are imported into the United States during a specified period of up to one year (see § 10.246(b)(4)(ii)). The “from” date is the date on which the Certificate became applicable to the article covered by the blanket Certificate (this date may be prior to the date reflected in block 14). The “to” date is the date on which the blanket period expires; and
(15) The Certificate may be printed and reproduced locally. If more space is needed to complete the Certificate, attach a continuation sheet.
§ 10.245
Filing of claim for preferential treatment.
(a)
Declaration.
In connection with a claim for preferential treatment for an apparel or other textile article described in § 10.243, the importer must make a written declaration that the article qualifies for that treatment. The inclusion on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, of the subheading within Chapter 98 of the HTSUS under which the article is classified will constitute the written declaration. Except in any of the circumstances described in § 10.246(d)(1), the declaration required under this paragraph must be based on a Certificate of Origin that has been completed and properly executed in accordance with § 10.244, that covers the article being imported, and that is in the possession of the importer.
(b)
Corrected declaration.
If, after making the declaration required under paragraph (a) of this section, the importer has reason to believe that a Certificate of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct, the importer must within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error make a corrected declaration and pay any duties that may be due. A corrected declaration will be effected by submission of a letter or other written statement to CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically.
§ 10.246
Maintenance of records and submission of Certificate by importer.
(a)
Maintenance of records.
Each importer claiming preferential treatment for an article under § 10.245 must maintain in the United States, in accordance with the provisions of part 163 of this chapter, all records relating to the importation of the article. Those records must include a copy of the Certificate of Origin referred to in § 10.245(a) and any other relevant documents or other records as specified in § 163.1(a) of this chapter.
(b)
Submission of Certificate.
An importer who claims preferential treatment on an apparel or other textile article under § 10.245(a) must provide, at the request of the Center director, a copy of the Certificate of Origin pertaining to the article. A Certificate of Origin submitted to CBP under this paragraph:
(1) Must be in writing or must be transmitted electronically through any electronic data interchange system authorized by CBP for that purpose;
(2) If in writing, must be signed by the producer or exporter or the producer's or exporter's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;
(3) Must be completed either in the English language or in the language of the country from which the article is exported. If the Certificate is completed in a language other than English, the importer must provide to CBP upon request a written English translation of the Certificate; and
(4) May be applicable to:
(i) A single importation of an article into the United States, including a single shipment that results in the filing of one or more entries and a series of shipments that results in the filing of one entry; or
(ii) Multiple importations of identical articles into the United States that occur within a specified blanket period, not to exceed 12 months, set out in the Certificate by the exporter. For purposes of this paragraph and § 10.244(c)(14), “identical articles” means articles that are the same in all material respects, including physical characteristics, quality, and reputation.
(c)
Correction and nonacceptance of Certificate.
If the Center director determines that a Certificate of Origin is illegible or defective or has not been completed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the importer will be given a period of not less than five working days to submit a corrected Certificate. A Certificate will not be accepted in connection with subsequent importations during a period referred to in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section if the Center director determined that a previously imported identical article covered by the Certificate did not qualify for preferential treatment.
(d)
Certificate not required
—(1)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an importer is not required to have a Certificate of Origin in his possession for:
(i) An importation of an article for which the Center director has in writing waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin because the Center director is otherwise satisfied that the article qualifies for preferential treatment;
(ii) A non-commercial importation of an article; or
(iii) A commercial importation of an article whose value does not exceed US$2,500, provided that, unless waived by the Center director, the producer, exporter, importer or authorized agent includes on, or attaches to, the invoice or other document accompanying the shipment the following signed statement:
I hereby certify that the article covered by this shipment qualifies for preferential treatment under the ATPDEA.

Exception.
If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section forms part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding a Certificate of Origin requirement under §§ 10.244 through 10.246, the Center director will notify the importer in writing that for that importation the importer must have in his possession a valid Certificate of Origin to support the claim for preferential treatment. The importer will have 30 calendar days from the date of the written notice to obtain a valid Certificate of Origin, and a failure to timely obtain the Certificate of Origin will result in denial of the claim for preferential treatment. For purposes of this paragraph, a “series of importations” means two or more entries covering articles arriving on the same day from the same exporter and consigned to the same person.
§ 10.247
Verification and justification of claim for preferential treatment.
(a)
Verification by CBP.
A claim for preferential treatment made under § 10.245, including any statements or other information contained on a Certificate of Origin submitted to CBP under § 10.246, will be subject to whatever verification the Center director deems necessary. In the event that the Center director for any reason is prevented from verifying the claim, the Center director may deny the claim for preferential treatment. A verification of a claim for preferential treatment may involve, but need not be limited to, a review of:
(1) All records required to be made, kept, and made available to CBP by the importer or any other person under part 163 of this chapter;
(2) Documentation and other information regarding the country of origin of an article and its constituent materials, including, but not limited to, production records, information relating to the place of production, the number and identification of the types of machinery used in production, and the number of workers employed in production; and
(3) Evidence to document the use of U.S. or ATPDEA beneficiary country materials in the production of the article in question, such as purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents, and customs import and clearance documents.
(b)
Importer requirements.
In order to make a claim for preferential treatment under § 10.245, the importer:
(1) Must have records that explain how the importer came to the conclusion that the apparel or other textile article qualifies for preferential treatment. Those records must include documents that support a claim that the article in question qualifies for preferential treatment because it is specifically described in one of the provisions under § 10.243(a). If the importer is claiming that the article incorporates fabric or yarn that was wholly formed in the United States or in an ATPDEA beneficiary country, the importer must have records that identify the producer
of the fabric or yarn. A properly completed Certificate of Origin in the form set forth in § 10.244(b) is a record that would serve these purposes;
(2) Must establish and implement internal controls which provide for the periodic review of the accuracy of the Certificates of Origin or other records referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;
(3) Must have shipping papers that show how the article moved from the ATPDEA beneficiary country to the United States. If the imported article was shipped through a country other than an ATPDEA beneficiary country and the invoices and other documents from the ATPDEA beneficiary country do not show the United States as the final destination, the importer also must have documentation that demonstrates that the conditions set forth in § 10.243(d)(3)(i) through (iii) were met; and
(4) Must be prepared to explain, upon request from CBP, how the records and internal controls referred to in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section justify the importer's claim for preferential treatment.

Limitations on preferential treatment
—(1)
General.
During the year that begins on October 1, 2003, and during any subsequent year, articles of a producer or an entity controlling production that conform to the production standards set forth in § 10.243(a)(4) will be eligible for preferential treatment only if:
(i) The aggregate cost of fabrics (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) formed in the United States that were used in the production of all of those articles of that producer or that entity controlling production that are entered as articles described in § 10.243(a)(4) during the immediately preceding year was at least 75 percent of the aggregate
declared customs value of the fabric (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) contained in all of those articles of that producer or that entity controlling production that are entered as articles described in § 10.243(a)(4) during that year; or
(ii) In a case in which the 75 percent requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section was not met during a year and therefore those articles of that producer or that entity controlling production were not eligible for preferential treatment during the following year, the aggregate cost of fabrics (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) formed in the United States that were used in the production of all of those articles of that producer or that entity controlling production that conform to the production standards set forth in § 10.243(a)(4) and that were entered during the immediately preceding year was at least 85 percent of the aggregate declared customs value of the fabric (exclusive of all findings and trimmings) contained in all of those articles of that producer or that entity controlling production that conform to the production standards set forth in § 10.243(a)(4) and that were entered during that year; and
(iii) In conjunction with the filing of the claim for preferential treatment under § 10.245, the importer records on the entry summary or warehouse withdrawal for consumption (CBP Form 7501, column 34), or its electronic equivalent, the distinct and unique identifier assigned by CBP to the applicable documentation prescribed under paragraph (c) of this section.

Rules of application
—(i)
General.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section and for purposes of preparing and filing the documentation prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, the following rules will apply:
(A) The articles in question must have been produced in the manner specified in § 10.243(a)(4) and the articles in question must be entered within the same year;
(B) Articles that are exported to countries other than the United States and are never entered are not to be considered in determining compliance with the 75 or 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section;
(C) Articles that are entered under an HTSUS subheading other than the HTSUS subheading which pertains to articles described in § 10.243(a)(4) are not to be considered in determining compliance with the 75 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section;
(D) For purposes of determining compliance with the 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, all articles that conform to the production standards set forth in § 10.243(a)(4) must be considered, regardless of the HTSUS subheading under which they were entered;
(E) Fabric components and fabrics that constitute findings or trimmings are not to be considered in determining compliance with the 75 or 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section;
(F) Beginning October 1, 2003, in order for articles to be eligible for preferential treatment in a given year, a producer of, or entity controlling production of, those articles must have met the 75 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section during the immediately preceding year. If articles of a producer or entity controlling production fail to meet the 75 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section during a year, articles of that producer or entity controlling production:
(
1
) Will not be eligible for preferential treatment during the following year;
(
2
) Will remain ineligible for preferential treatment until the year that follows a year in which articles of that producer or entity controlling production met the 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section; and
(
3
) After the 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section has been met, will again be subject to the 75 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section during the following year for purposes of determining eligibility for preferential treatment in the next year.
(G) A new producer or new entity controlling production, that is, a producer or entity controlling production who did not produce or control production of articles that were entered as articles described in § 10.243(a)(4) during the immediately preceding year, must first establish compliance with the 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section as a prerequisite to preparation of the declaration of compliance referred to in paragraph (c) of this section;
(H) A declaration of compliance prepared by a producer or by an entity controlling production must cover all production of that producer or all production that the entity controls for the year in question;
(I) A producer would not prepare a declaration of compliance if all of its production is covered by a declaration of compliance prepared by an entity controlling production;
(J) In the case of a producer, the 75 or 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and the declaration of compliance procedure under paragraph (c) of this section apply to all articles of that producer for the year in question, even if some but not all of that production is also covered by a declaration of compliance prepared by an entity controlling production;
(K) The U.S. importer does not have to be the producer or the entity controlling production who prepared the declaration of compliance; and
(L) The exclusion references regarding findings and trimmings in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section apply to all findings and trimmings, whether or not they are of foreign origin.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples will illustrate application of the principles set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

# Example 1.
An ATPDEA beneficiary country producer of articles that meet the production standards specified in § 10.243(a)(4) in the first year sends 50 percent of that production to ATPDEA region markets and the other 50 percent to the U.S. market; the cost of the fabrics formed in the United States equals 100 percent of the value of all of the fabric in the articles sent to the ATPDEA region and 60 percent of the value of all of the fabric in the articles sent to the United States. Although the cost of fabrics formed in the United States is more than 75 percent of the value of all of the fabric used in all of the articles produced, this producer could not prepare a valid declaration of compliance because the articles sent to the United States did not meet the minimum 75 percent standard.

# Example 2.
A producer sends to the United States in the first year three shipments of articles that meet the description in § 10.243(a)(4); one of those shipments is entered under the HTSUS subheading that covers articles described in § 10.243(a)(4), the second shipment is entered under the HTSUS subheading that covers articles described in § 10.243(a)(7), and the third shipment is entered under subheading 9802.00.80, HTSUS. In determining whether the minimum 75 percent standard has been met in the first year for purposes of entry of articles under the HTSUS subheading that covers articles described in § 10.243(a)(4) during the following (that is, second) year, consideration must be restricted to the articles in the first shipment and therefore must not include the articles in the second and third shipments.

# Example 3.
A producer in the second year begins production of articles that conform to the production standards specified in § 10.243(a)(4); some of those articles are entered in that year under HTSUS subheading 6212.10 and others under HTSUS subheading 9802.00.80 but none are entered in that year under the HTSUS subheading which pertains to articles described in § 10.243(a)(4) because the 75 percent standard had not been met in the preceding (that is, first) year. In this case the 85 percent standard applies, and all of the articles that were entered under the various HTSUS provisions in the second year must be taken into account in determining whether that 85 percent standard has been met. If the 85 percent was met in the aggregate for all of the articles entered in the second year, in the next (that is, third) year articles of that producer may receive preferential treatment under the HTSUS subheading which pertains to articles described in § 10.243(a)(4).

# Example 4.
An entity controlling production of articles that meet the description in § 10.243(a)(4) buys for the U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets; the articles in each case are first sent to the United States where they are entered for consumption and then placed in a commercial warehouse from which they are shipped to various stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Notwithstanding the fact that some of the articles ultimately ended up in Canada or Mexico, a declaration of compliance prepared by the entity controlling production must cover all of the articles rather than only those that remained in the United States because all of those articles had been entered for consumption.

# Example 5.
Fabric is cut and sewn in the United States with other U.S. materials to form cups which are joined together to form brassiere front subassemblies in the United States, and those front subassemblies are then placed in a warehouse in the United States where they are held until the following year; during that following year all of the front subassemblies are shipped to an ATPDEA beneficiary country where they are assembled with elastic strips for use as brassiere straps and labels produced in an Asian country and other fabrics, components or materials produced in the ATPDEA beneficiary country to form articles that meet the production standards specified in § 10.243(a)(4) and that are then shipped to the United States and entered during that same year. In determining whether the entered articles meet the minimum 75 or 85 percent standard, the fabric in the labels is to be disregarded entirely because the labels constitute findings or trimmings for purposes of this section, and all of the fabric in the front subassemblies is countable because it was all formed in the United States and used in the production of articles that were entered in the same year.

# Example 6.
An ATPDEA beneficiary country producer's entire production of articles that meet the description in § 10.243(a)(4) is sent to a U.S. importer in two separate shipments, one in February and the other in June of the same calendar year; the articles shipped in February do not meet the minimum 75 percent standard, the articles shipped in June exceed the 85 percent standard, and the articles in the two shipments, taken together, do meet the 75 percent standard; the articles covered by the February shipment are entered for consumption on March 1 of that calendar year, and the articles covered by the June shipment are placed in a CBP bonded warehouse upon arrival and are subsequently withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on November 1 of that calendar year. The ATPDEA beneficiary country producer may not prepare a valid declaration of compliance covering the articles in the first shipment because those articles did not meet the minimum 75 percent standard and because those articles cannot be included with the articles of the second shipment on the same declaration of compliance since they were entered in a different year. However, the ATPDEA beneficiary country producer may prepare a valid declaration of compliance covering the articles in the second shipment because those articles did meet the requisite 85 percent standard which would apply for purposes of entry of articles in the following year.

# Example 7.
A producer in the second year begins production of articles exclusively for the U.S. market that meet the production standards specified in § 10.243(a)(4), but the entered articles do not meet the requisite 85 percent standard until the third year. The producer's articles may not receive preferential treatment during the second year because there was no production (and thus there were no entered articles) in the immediately preceding (that is, first) year on which to assess compliance with the 75 percent standard. The producer's articles also may not receive preferential treatment during the third year because the 85 percent standard was not met in the immediately preceding (that is, second) year. However, the producer's articles are eligible for preferential treatment during the fourth year based on compliance with the 85 percent standard in the immediately preceding (that is, third) year.

# Example 8.
An entity controlling production (Entity A) uses five ATPDEA beneficiary country producers (Producers 1-5), all of which produce only articles that meet the description in § 10.243(a)(4); Producers 1-4 send all of their production to the United States and Producer 5 sends 10 percent of its production to the United States and the rest to Europe; Producers 1-3 and Producer 5 produce only pursuant to contracts with Entity A, but Producer 4 also operates independently of Entity A by producing for several U.S. importers, one of which is an entity controlling production (Entity B) that also controls all of the production of articles of one other producer (Producer 6) which sends all of its production to the United States. A declaration of compliance prepared by Entity A must cover all of the articles of Producers 1-3 and the 10 percent of articles of Producer 5 that are sent to the United States and that portion of the articles of Producer 4 that are produced pursuant to the contract with Entity A, because Entity A controls the production of those articles. There is no need for Producers 1-3 and Producer 5 to prepare a declaration of compliance because they have no production that is not covered by a declaration of compliance prepared by an entity controlling production. A declaration of compliance prepared by Producer 4 would cover all of its production, that is, articles produced for Entity A, articles produced for Entity B, and articles produced independently for other U.S. importers; a declaration of compliance prepared by Entity B must cover that portion of the production of Producer 4 that it controls as well as all of the production of Producer 6 because Entity B also controls all of the production of Producer 6. Producer 6 would not prepare a declaration of compliance because all of its production is covered by the declaration of compliance prepared by Entity B.
(c)
Documentation
—(1)
Initial declaration of compliance.
In order for an importer to comply with the requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this
section, the producer or the entity controlling production must have filed with CBP, in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a declaration of compliance with the applicable 75 or 85 percent requirement prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section. After filing of the declaration of compliance has been completed, CBP will advise the producer or the entity controlling production of the distinct and unique identifier assigned to that declaration. The producer or the entity controlling production will then be responsible for advising each appropriate U.S. importer of that distinct and unique identifier for purposes of recording that identifier on the entry summary or warehouse withdrawal. In order to provide sufficient time for advising the U.S. importer of that distinct and unique identifier prior to the arrival of the articles in the United States, the producer or the entity controlling production should file the declaration of compliance with CBP at least 10 calendar days prior to the date of the first shipment of the articles to the United States.
(2)
Amended declaration of compliance.
If the information on the declaration of compliance referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is based on an estimate because final year-end information was not available at that time and the final data differs from the estimate, or if the producer or the entity controlling production has reason to believe for any other reason that the declaration of compliance that was filed contained erroneous information, within 30 calendar days after the final year-end information becomes available or within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error:
(i) The producer or the entity controlling production must file with the CBP office identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section an amended declaration of compliance containing that final year-end information or other corrected information; or
(ii) If that final year-end information or other corrected information demonstrates noncompliance with the applicable 75 or 85 percent requirement, the producer or the entity controlling production must in writing advise both the CBP office identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section and each appropriate U.S. importer of that fact.
(3)

Verification of declaration of compliance
—(1)
Verification procedure.
A declaration of compliance filed under this section will be subject to whatever verification CBP deems necessary. In the event that CBP for any reason is prevented from verifying the statements made on a declaration of compliance, CBP may deny any claim for preferential treatment made under § 10.245 that is based on that declaration. A verification of a declaration of compliance may involve, but need not be limited to, a review of:
(i) All records required to be made, kept, and made available to CBP by the importer, the producer, the entity controlling production, or any other person under part 163 of this chapter;
(ii) Documentation and other information regarding all articles that meet the production standards specified in § 10.243(a)(4) that were exported to the United States and that were entered during the year in question, whether or not a claim for preferential treatment was made under § 10.245. Those records and other information include, but are not limited to, work orders and other production records, purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents;
(iii) Evidence to document the cost of fabrics formed in the United States that were used in the production of the articles in question, such as purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents, and customs import and clearance documents, work orders and other production records, and inventory control records;
(iv) Evidence to document the cost or value of all fabric other than fabrics formed in the United States that were used in the production of the articles in question, such as purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents, and customs import and clearance documents, work orders and other production records, and inventory control records; and
(v) Accounting books and documents to verify the records and information referred to in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section. The verification of purchase orders, invoices and bills of lading will be accomplished through the review of a distinct audit trail. The audit trail documents must consist of a cash disbursement or purchase journal or equivalent records to establish the purchase of the fabric. The headings in each of these journals or other records must contain the date, vendor name, and amount paid for the fabric. The verification of production records and work orders will be accomplished through analysis of the inventory records of the producer or entity controlling production. The inventory records must reflect the production of the finished article which must be referenced to the original purchase order or lot number covering the fabric used in production. In the inventory production records, the inventory should show the opening balance of the inventory plus the purchases made during the accounting period and the inventory closing balance.
(2)
Notice of determination.
If, based on a verification of a declaration of compliance filed under this section, CBP determines that the applicable 75 or 85 percent standard specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section was not met, CBP will publish a notice of that determination in the
Federal Register.

(2) If the shipment is from any ATPDEA beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any country that is not an ATPDEA beneficiary country, the articles in the shipment do not enter into the commerce of any country that is not an ATPDEA beneficiary country while en route to the United States and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the United States as the final destination; or
(3) If the shipment is from any ATPDEA beneficiary country to the United States through the territory of any country that is not an ATPDEA beneficiary country, and the invoices and other documents do not show the United States as the final destination, the articles in the shipment upon arrival in the United States are imported directly only if they:
(i) Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country;
(ii) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the Center director is satisfied that the importation results from the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the producer's sales agent; and
(iii) Were not subjected to operations other than loading or unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the articles in good condition.
(c)
Country of origin criteria
—(1)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an article described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be eligible for preferential treatment if the article is either:
(i) Wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of an ATPDEA beneficiary country; or
(ii) A new or different article of commerce which has been grown, produced, or manufactured in an ATPDEA beneficiary country.
(2)
Exceptions.
No article will be eligible for preferential treatment by virtue of having merely undergone simple (as opposed to complex or meaningful) combining or packaging operations, or mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article. The principles and examples set forth in § 10.195(a)(2) will apply equally for purposes of this paragraph.
(d)
Value content requirement
—(1)
General.
An article may be eligible for preferential treatment only if the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in an ATPDEA beneficiary country or countries, plus the direct costs of processing operations performed in an ATPDEA beneficiary country or countries, is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered.
(2)
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and CBI beneficiary countries.
For the specific purpose of determining the percentage referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the term “ATPDEA beneficiary country” includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and any CBI beneficiary country as defined in § 10.191(b)(1). Any cost or value of materials or direct costs of processing operations attributable to the Virgin Islands or any CBI beneficiary country must be included in the article prior to its final exportation to the United States from an ATPDEA beneficiary country as defined in § 10.252.
(3)
Materials produced in the United States.
For purposes of determining the percentage referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered may be attributed to the cost or value of materials produced in the customs territory of the United States (other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico). The principles set forth in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section will apply in determining whether a material is “produced in the customs territory of the United States” for purposes of this paragraph.
(4)
Cost or value of materials
—(i)
“Materials produced in an ATPDEA beneficiary country or countries” defined.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the words “materials produced in an ATPDEA beneficiary country or countries” refer to those materials incorporated in an article which are either:
(A) Wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of an ATPDEA beneficiary country or two or more ATPDEA beneficiary countries; or
(B) Substantially transformed in any ATPDEA beneficiary country or two or more ATPDEA beneficiary countries into a new or different article of commerce which is then used in any ATPDEA beneficiary country as defined in § 10.252 in the production or manufacture of a new or different article which is imported directly into the United States. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B), no material will
be considered to be substantially transformed into a new or different article of commerce by virtue of having merely undergone simple (as opposed to complex or meaningful) combining or packaging operations, or mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article. The examples set forth in § 10.196(a), and the principles and examples set forth in § 10.195(a)(2), will apply for purposes of the corresponding context under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.
(ii)
Failure to establish origin.
If the importer fails to maintain adequate records to establish the origin of a material, that material may not be considered to have been grown, produced, or manufactured in an ATPDEA beneficiary country or in the customs territory of the United States for purposes of determining the percentage referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Determination of cost or value of materials.
(A) The cost or value of materials produced in an ATPDEA beneficiary country or countries or in the customs territory of the United States includes:
(
1
) The manufacturer's actual cost for the materials;
(
2
) When not included in the manufacturer's actual cost for the materials, the freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the manufacturer's plant;
(
3
) The actual cost of waste or spoilage, less the value of recoverable scrap; and
(
4
) Taxes and/or duties imposed on the materials by any ATPDEA beneficiary country or by the United States, provided they are not remitted upon exportation.
(B) Where a material is provided to the manufacturer without charge, or at less than fair market value, its cost or value will be determined by computing the sum of:
(
1
) All expenses incurred in the growth, production, or manufacture of the material, including general expenses;
(
2
) An amount for profit; and
(
3
) Freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the manufacturer's plant.
(5)
Direct costs of processing operations
—(i)
Items included.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the words “direct costs of processing operations” mean those costs either directly incurred in, or which can be reasonably allocated to, the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the specific merchandise under consideration. Those costs include, but are not limited to the following, to the extent that they are includable in the appraised value of the imported merchandise:
(A) All actual labor costs involved in the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the specific merchandise, including fringe benefits, on-the-job training, and the cost of engineering, supervisory, quality control, and similar personnel;
(B) Dies, molds, tooling, and depreciation on machinery and equipment which are allocable to the specific merchandise;
(C) Research, development, design, engineering, and blueprint costs insofar as they are allocable to the specific merchandise; and
(D) Costs of inspecting and testing the specific merchandise.
(ii)
Items not included.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the words “direct costs of processing operations” do not include items which are not directly attributable to the merchandise under consideration or are not costs of manufacturing the product. These include, but are not limited to:
(A) Profit; and
(B) General expenses of doing business which either are not allocable to the specific merchandise or are not related to the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the merchandise, such as administrative salaries, casualty and liability insurance, advertising, and salesmen's salaries, commissions, or expenses.
(6)
Articles wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of an ATPDEA beneficiary country.
Any article which is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of an ATPDEA beneficiary country as defined in § 10.252, and any article produced or manufactured in an
ATPDEA beneficiary country as defined in § 10.252 exclusively from materials which are wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of an ATPDEA beneficiary country or countries, will normally be presumed to meet the requirement set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
§ 10.254
Certificate of Origin.
A Certificate of Origin as specified in § 10.256 must be employed to certify that an article described in § 10.253(a) being exported from an ATPDEA beneficiary country to the United States qualifies for the preferential treatment referred to in § 10.251. The Certificate of Origin must be prepared in the ATPDEA beneficiary country by the producer or exporter or by the producer's or exporter's authorized agent. If the person preparing the Certificate of Origin is not the producer of the article, the person may complete and sign a Certificate on the basis of:
(a) The person's reasonable reliance on the producer's written representation that the article qualifies for preferential treatment; or
(b) A completed and signed Certificate of Origin for the article voluntarily provided to the person by the producer.
[CBP Dec. 06-21, 71 FR 44583, Aug. 7, 2006]
§ 10.255
Filing of claim for preferential treatment.
(a)
Declaration.
In connection with a claim for preferential treatment for an article described in § 10.253(a), the importer must make a written declaration that the article qualifies for that treatment. The written declaration should be made by including on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, the symbol “J + ” as a prefix to the subheading of the HTSUS in which the article in question is classified. Except in any of the circumstances described in § 10.256(d)(1), the declaration required under this paragraph must be based on a complete and properly executed original Certificate of Origin that covers the article being imported and that is in the possession of the importer.
(b)
Corrected declaration.
If, after making the declaration required under paragraph (a) of this section, the importer has reason to believe that a Certificate of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct, the importer must within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error make a corrected declaration and pay any duties that may be due. A corrected declaration will be effected by submission of a letter or other written statement to the Customs port where the declaration was originally filed.
§ 10.256
Maintenance of records and submission of Certificate by importer.
(a)
Maintenance of records.
Each importer claiming preferential treatment for an article under § 10.255 must maintain in the United States, in accordance with the provisions of part 163 of this chapter, all records relating to the importation of the article. Those records must include the original Certificate of Origin referred to in § 10.255(a) and any other relevant documents or other records as specified in § 163.1(a) of this chapter.
(b)
Submission of Certificate.
An importer who claims preferential treatment on an article under § 10.255(a) must provide, at the request of the Center director, a copy of the Certificate of Origin pertaining to the article. A Certificate of Origin submitted to Customs under this paragraph:
(1) Must be on CBP Form 449, including privately-printed copies of that Form, or, as an alternative to CBP Form 449, in an approved computerized format or other medium or format as is approved by the Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. An alternative format must contain the same information and certification set forth on CBP Form 449;
(2) Must be signed by the producer or exporter or by the producer's or exporter's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;
(3) Must be completed either in the English language or in the language of the country from which the article is exported. If the Certificate is completed in a language other than English, the importer must provide to Customs upon request a written
English translation of the Certificate; and
(4) May be applicable to:
(i) A single importation of an article into the United States, including a single shipment that results in the filing of one or more entries and a series of shipments that results in the filing of one entry; or
(ii) Multiple importations of identical articles into the United States that occur within a specified blanket period, not to exceed 12 months, set out in the Certificate by the exporter. For purposes of this paragraph, “identical articles” means articles that are the same in all material respects, including physical characteristics, quality, and reputation.
(c)
Correction and nonacceptance of Certificate.
If the Center director determines that a Certificate of Origin is illegible or defective or has not been completed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the importer will be given a period of not less than five working days to submit a corrected Certificate. A Certificate will not be accepted in connection with subsequent importations during a period referred to in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section if the Center director determined that a previously imported identical article covered by the Certificate did not qualify for preferential treatment.
(d)
Certificate not required
—(1)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an importer is not required to have a Certificate of Origin in his possession for:
(i) An importation of an article for which the Center director has in writing waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin because the Center director is otherwise satisfied that the article qualifies for preferential treatment;
(ii) A non-commercial importation of an article; or
(iii) A commercial importation of an article whose value does not exceed US$2,500, provided that, unless waived by the Center director, the producer, exporter, importer or authorized agent includes on, or attaches to, the invoice or other document accompanying the shipment the following signed statement:
I hereby certify that the article covered by this shipment qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under the ATPDEA.

Exception.
If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section forms part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding a Certificate of Origin requirement under §§ 10.254 through 10.256, the Center director will notify the importer in writing that for that importation the importer must have in his possession a valid Certificate of Origin to support the claim for preferential treatment. The importer will have 30 calendar days from the date of the written notice to obtain a valid Certificate of Origin, and a failure to timely obtain the Certificate of Origin will result in denial of the claim for preferential treatment. For purposes of this paragraph, a “series of importations” means two or more entries covering articles arriving on the same day from the same exporter and consigned to the same person.
[T.D. 03-16, 68 FR 14497, Mar. 25, 2003; 68 FR 67349, Dec. 1, 2003, as amended by CBP Dec. 06-21, 71 FR 44583, Aug. 7, 2006]
§ 10.257
Verification and justification of claim for preferential treatment.
(a)
Verification by Customs.
A claim for preferential treatment made under § 10.255, including any statements or other information contained on a Certificate of Origin submitted to Customs under § 10.256, will be subject to whatever verification the Center director deems necessary. In the event that the Center director for any reason is prevented from verifying the claim, the Center director may deny the claim for
preferential treatment. A verification of a claim for preferential treatment may involve, but need not be limited to, a review of:
(1) All records required to be made, kept, and made available to Customs by the importer or any other person under part 163 of this chapter;
(2) Documentation and other information regarding the country of origin of an article and its constituent materials, including, but not limited to, production records, information relating to the place of production, the number and identification of the types of machinery used in production, and the number of workers employed in production; and
(3) Evidence to document the use of U.S. or ATPDEA beneficiary country materials in the production of the article in question, such as purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading and other shipping documents, and customs import and clearance documents.
(b)
Importer requirements.
In order to make a claim for preferential treatment under § 10.255, the importer:
(1) Must have records that explain how the importer came to the conclusion that the article qualifies for preferential treatment. Those records must include documents that support a claim that the article in question qualifies for preferential treatment because it meets the country of origin and value content requirements set forth in § 10.253(c) and (d). A properly completed Certificate of Origin in the form prescribed in § 10.254(b) is a record that would serve this purpose;
(2) Must establish and implement internal controls which provide for the periodic review of the accuracy of the Certificate of Origin or other records referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;
(3) Must have shipping papers that show how the article moved from the ATPDEA beneficiary country to the United States. If the imported article was shipped through a country other than an ATPDEA beneficiary country and the invoices and other documents from the ATPDEA beneficiary country do not show the United States as the final destination, the importer also must have documentation that demonstrates that the conditions set forth in § 10.253(b)(3)(i) through (iii) were met; and
(4) Must be prepared to explain, upon request from Customs, how the records and internal controls referred to in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section justify the importer's claim for preferential treatment.

Sections 10.301 through 10.311 issued by T.D. 89-3, 53 FR 51766, Dec. 23, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 10.301
Scope and applicability.
The provisions of §§ 10.302 through 10.311 of this part relate to the procedures for obtaining duty preferences on imported goods under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (the Agreement) entered into on January 2, 1988, and the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 (102 Stat. 1851). The United States and Canada agreed to suspend operation of the Agreement with effect from January 1, 1994, to coincide with the entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement (
see
part 181 of this chapter) and to continue suspending operation of the Agreement with the entry into force of the Agreement Between the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA) (
see
part 182 of this chapter) and, accordingly, the provisions of §§ 10.302 through 10.311 of this part apply only to goods imported from Canada that were entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, during the period January 1, 1989, through December 31, 1993. In situations involving goods subject to bilateral restrictions or prohibitions, or country of origin marking, other criteria for determining origin may be applicable pursuant to Article 407 of the Agreement.

§ 10.302
Eligibility criteria in general.
Subject to the more specific explanations of the criteria in §§ 10.303 and 10.305 of this part, goods classifiable
under an HTSUS heading or subheading for which the symbol “CA” appears in the “special” column are eligible for a preference if:
(a)
Originating goods.
The goods originate in Canada or the United States, or both, and
(b)
Direct shipment required.
Except as provided in § 10.306(b), are directly shipped to the United States from Canada.
§ 10.303
Originating goods.
(a)
General.
For purposes of eligibility for a preference under the Agreement, goods may be regarded as originating goods if:
(1)
Wholly of Canadian or United States origin.
The goods are wholly obtained or produced in the Territory of Canada or the United States, or both, as set forth in General Note 3(c), HTSUS;
(2)
Transformed with a change in classification.
The goods have been transformed by a processing which results in a change in classification and, if required, a sufficient value-content, as set forth in General Note 3(c), HTSUS; or
(3)
Transformed without a change in classification.
An assembly of goods, other than goods of chapters 61 to 63 of the HTSUS, which does not result in a change in classification because the goods were imported in an unassembled or disassembled form and classified as the goods, unassembled or disassembled, pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation 2(a), HTSUS, or because the tariff subheading for the goods provides for both the goods themselves and their parts, shall nonetheless be treated as originating goods if:
(i) The value of originating materials and the direct cost of assembling in Canada or the United States, or both, as defined in § 10.305 constitute not less than 50 percent of the value of the goods when exported to the United States;
(ii) The assembled goods are not subsequently processed or further assembled in a third country; and
(iii) The goods satisfy the requirement in § 10.306.
(b)
Originating materials.
For purposes of this section and § 10.305, the term “materials” means goods, other than those included as part of the direct cost of processing or assembling, used or consumed in the production of other goods, and the term “orginating” when used with reference to such materials means that the materials satisfy one of the criteria for originating goods set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Change in classification.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the expression “change in classification” means a change of classification within the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System) as published and amended from time to time by the Customs Cooperation Council.
(d)
Articles of feather.
The goods are eligible to be treated as originating in Canada pursuant to General Note 3(c)(vii)(R)(12)(ee), HTSUS.
[T.D. 92-8, 57 FR 2453, Jan. 22, 1992]
§ 10.304
Exclusions.
(a)
Changes based on simple processing.
No goods shall be considered originating for purposes of eligibility under the Agreement if they have merely undergone simple packaging or simple combining operations, or have undergone mere dilution with water or with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the goods.
(b)
Other excluded processing.
No goods shall be considered to be originating merely by virtue of having undergone any process or work in which the facts clearly justify the presumption that the sole object was to circumvent the provisions of Chapter 3 of the Agreement.
§ 10.305
Value content requirement.
(a)
Direct cost of processing or assembling
—(1)
Definition.
For purposes of applying a specific rule of origin under the Agreement which requires a value content determination, the terms “direct cost of processing” and “direct cost of assembling” mean the costs directly incurred in, or that can be reasonably allocated to, the production of goods, including:
(i) The cost of all labor, including benefits and on-the-job training, labor provided in connection with supervision, quality control, shipping, receiving, storage, packaging, management at the location of the process or
assembly, and other like labor, whether provided by employees or independent contractors;
(ii) The cost of inspecting and testing the goods;
(iii) The cost of energy, fuel, dies, molds, tooling, and the depreciation and maintenance of machinery and equipment, without regard to whether they originate within the territory of the United States or Canada;
(iv) Development, design, and engineering costs;
(v) Rent, mortgage interest, depreciation on buildings, property insurance premiums, maintenance, taxes and the cost of utilities for real property used in the production of the goods; and
(vi) Royalty, licensing, or other like payments for the right to the goods.
(2)
Exclusions from direct costs of processing or assembling.
Excluded from the direct costs of processing or assembling are:
(i) Costs relating to the general expense of doing business, such as the cost of providing executive, financial, sales, advertising, marketing, accounting and legal services, and insurance;
(ii) Brokerage charges relating to the importation and exportation of goods;
(iii) Costs for telephone, mail, and other means of communication;
(iv) Packing costs for exporting the goods;
(v) Royalty payments related to a licensing agreement to distribute or sell the goods;
(vi) Rent, mortgage interest, depreciation on buildings, property insurance premiums, maintenance, taxes, and the cost of utilities for real property used by personnel charged with administrative functions; and
(vii) Profit on the goods.
(3)
Interpretation
—(i)
Indirect materials.
Under the definition of “materials” set forth in § 10.303(b), certain types of materials are treated as direct costs of processing or assembling under paragraph (a) of this section. This applies principally to materials used or consumed indirectly in the production of exported goods, where no portion of those materials is physically incorporated in the exported goods. In addition to the items specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, such materials include items such as gloves and safety glasses worn by production workers, tape used in painting processes, and tools, materials and spare parts used in the repair and maintenance of machinery and equipment used in the production of the exported goods. Such materials are to be distinguished from waste and spoilage specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, which relate to materials that are physically incorporated in the exported goods.
(ii)
Directly incurred.
In order for costs incurred by a production facility to be treated as direct costs of processing or assembling, those costs must be directly incurred in the production of the exported goods and not merely associated with the production facility as peripheral costs necessary to operate the facility. In addition to the exclusions set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, such peripheral costs include labor costs for nurses tending to employees, for accounting personnel involved in physical inventory taking, for personnel responsible for purchasing or requisitioning materials to be used or consumed in the production process, and for second level supervisors and above who are not directly involved in the production process.
(iii)
Labor costs.
Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, labor costs includable as direct costs of processing or assembling are limited to labor provided by the producer's employees or by independent contractors. Thus, for example, where processing operations are performed on components in the United States and those components are sold to a manufacturer in Canada where they are incorporated in goods exported to the United States, the cost of those processing operations in the United States cannot be separately counted as a direct cost of processing attributable to the finished goods exported to the United States.
(iv)
Interest expense. Bona fide
interest payments on debt of any form, secured or unsecured, undertaken on arm's length terms in the ordinary course of business to finance the acquisition of fixed assets such as real property, a plant, and/or equipment used in the production of goods in the territory of Canada or the U.S. are includable in the direct cost of processing or direct
cost of assembling. Interest will be treated as a direct cost of processing or assembling, but only that portion of the interest which is related to a fixed asset directly used in the production of the goods exported; thus, where an entire production facility is covered by a mortgage and incorporates both production and administrative or other general expense space, an appropriate allocation must be made in order to ensure that only that portion of the interest allocated to the production area is counted toward the value-content requirement. Interest expenses attributable to general and administrative costs or expenses, including interest on funds borrowed to meet the payroll of personnel directly involved in the production of goods, are not considered direct costs of processing or assembly.
(b)
Value of originating materials
—(1)
Definition.
The term “value of materials originating in the United States or Canada or both” means the aggregate of:
(i) The price paid by the producer of exported goods for materials originating in either the United States or Canada, or both, or for materials imported from a third country used or consumed in the production of such originating materials; and
(ii) When not included in that price, the following costs related thereto:
(A) Freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting any of the materials referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section to the location of the producer;
(B) Duties, taxes and brokerage fees on such materials paid in the United States, or Canada, or both;
(C) The cost of waste or spoilage resulting from the use or consumption of such materials, less the value of renewable scrap or by-product; and
(D) The value of goods and services relating to such materials determined in accordance with subparagraph 1(b) of Article 8 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
(2)
Directly attributable.
Whenever a value-content determination is required by the rules of the Agreement and whenever originating materials and materials obtained or produced in a third country are used or consumed together in the production of goods in the United States or Canada, the value of originating materials may be treated as such only to the extent that the value is directly attributable to the goods under consideration.
(3)
Interpretation
—(i)
Price paid.
As provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the “price paid” for materials by the producer of exported goods forms the basis for determining the value of such materials when incorporated in the exported goods. The actual price paid for such materials will determine the value of those materials for purposes of the value-content requirement, even though a relationship between the producer and the seller of the materials may have influenced the price, except where the price did not include items specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section that relate to the materials. The following examples will illustrate these principles. Notwithstanding these examples, the totality of the facts must be examined in each case to determine whether § 10.304(b) is applicable.

# Example 1.
Non-originating materials are sold by Company X (a foreign corporation located outside the United States or Canada) to Company Y (a Canadian corporation) for $100; Company X also sold identical materials to Company Z (a U.S. corporation) for $200 which was the price Company Z had paid to Company X for similar materials prior to implementation of the Agreement; and those non-originating materials sold by Company X to Company Y are then incorporated by Company Y into goods exported to the United States. In this case the $100 price paid by Company Y to Company X constitutes the value of those materials for purposes of the value-content requirement.

# Example 2.
Company X purchased materials for $100, added a four percent mark-up to the price paid to defray purchasing expenses, and then sold the marked-up materials to Company Y (a Canadian corporation) which incorporated the materials in goods exported to the United States. In this case the $104 price paid by Company Y to Company X constitutes the value of the materials for purposes of the value-content requirement.

# Example 3.
Company X (a foreign corporation located outside the United States) sold non-originating materials to Company Y (a U.S. corporation) for $200, and Company Y then sold those materials for $100 to Company Z (a Canadian corporation) which incorporated the materials in goods which were imported into the United States by Company P (the U.S. parent company of
Company Y). In this case, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, $100 would be added to the price paid by Company Z for purposes of the value-content requirement because the materials were sold at a reduced cost within the meaning of subparagraph 1(b) of Article 8 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
(ii)
Originating materials for which no price paid.
In cases involving a vertically integrated producer (that is, an entity which produces goods for export from materials which that producer has also made) a “price paid” for such originating materials normally does not exist. Even in the absence of a “price paid”, such a vertically integrated producer may still claim the materials as originating materials for purposes of qualifying the finished goods exported to the United States as goods originating in Canada. However, under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section the value of those materials for purposes of applying the value-content requirement is limited to the price paid for those materials imported from the third country plus any costs added thereto under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The following examples will illustrate these principles.

# Example 1.
If an automobile producer in the United States or Canada fabricates body panels wholly from third country steel coil, those body panels can qualify as originating materials without having to satisfy a value-content requirement because steel coil is classified in chapter 72 of the Harmonized System and body panels are classified in chapter 87 and the change in classification rules in chapter 87 do not incorporate a value-content requirement in this context. Thus, the producer can claim the body panels fabricated from the third country steel as originating materials for purposes of the value-content requirement applicable to the finished automobile which will be exported to the United States. The value of those originating materials is the price paid for the steel coil imported from the third country and used or consumed in the production of the body panels.

# Example 2.
An automobile exporter in Canada purchases and imports body panels fabricated in a third country in order to join them with vertically (locally) fabricated body panels to form an automobile body. If the body qualifies as an originating material, the exporter has two options. Under the first option, the exporter can claim the body as originating material, in which case the value of originating material is the price paid for the foreign body panels. Under the second option, the exporter may elect not to claim the body as originating material; but, rather, the exporter may claim as originating material any domestic steel coil used in producing the vertically (locally) fabricated body panels, in which case the value of originating material is the price paid for the domestic steel coil.
(c)
Value of goods when exported.
The term “value of the goods when exported to the United States” means the aggregate of:
(1) The price paid by the producer for all materials, whether or not the materials originate in the United States, or Canada, or both, and, when not included in the price paid for the materials, the following costs related thereto:
(i) Freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting all materials to the location of the producer;
(ii) Duties, taxes, and brokerage fees on all materials paid in the United States, or Canada, or both;
(iii) The cost of waste or spoilage resulting from the use or consumption of such materials, less the value of renewable scrap or by-product; and
(iv) The value of goods and services relating to all materials determined in accordance with subparagraph 1(b) of Article 8 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs Trade; and
(2) The direct cost of processing or the direct cost of assembling the goods.

(b)
Shipment through a third country.
The goods were shipped through the territory of a third country but:
(1) The goods did not enter the commerce of any third country;
(2) The goods did not undergo any operation other than unloading, reloading, or any operation necessary to transport them to the United States or to preserve them in good condition; and
(3) All shipping and export documents show the United States as the final destination.

(a)
Claims for a preference.
A preference in accordance with the Agreement may be claimed by including on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, the symbol “CA” as a prefix to the subheading of the HTSUS under which each eligible good is classified.
(b)
Failure to claim a preference.
Failure to make a timely claim for a preference under the Agreement will result in liquidation at the rate which would otherwise be applicable.
(c)
Documentation showing origin.
A claim for a preference under the Agreement shall be based on the Exporter's Certificate of Origin, properly completed and signed by the person who exports or knowingly causes the goods to be exported from Canada. The Exporter's Certificate of Origin must be available at the time the preference is claimed and shall be presented to the Center director upon request.
(d)
Exporter's Certificate of Origin
—(1)
General.
The Exporter's Certificate of Origin shall be prepared on Customs Form 353.

(2)
Blanket certifications.
A blanket Exporter's Certificate of Origin, not to exceed a period of 12 months, issued for goods claimed as originating goods under the Agreement, can only be used if the certifying exporter is able to verify that the goods in each shipment to be covered by the blanket certification actually qualify for treatment under the Agreement. A blanket certification does not allow an exporter to average its costs over the blanket certification period in order to establish that the exported goods meet the criteria for originating goods under the Agreement. Under § 10.308, the exporter must retain supporting records that will permit a review of the eligibility of the goods in each shipment covered by a blanket certification.

(2)
Waiver of evidence of direct shipment.
The Center director may waive the submission of evidence of direct shipment when otherwise satisfied, taking into consideration the kind and value of the goods, that the goods were, in fact, imported directly from Canada,
and that they otherwise qualify for a preference in accordance with the Agreement.

An importer who makes a declaration under § 10.410(a) of this subpart is responsible for the truthfulness of the declaration and of all the information and data contained in the certification or other information submitted to CBP under § 10.411(a) of this subpart, for submitting any supporting documents requested by CBP, and for the truthfulness of the information contained in those documents. CBP will allow for the direct submission by the exporter or producer of business confidential or other sensitive information, including cost and sourcing information.

In order to make a claim for preferential treatment under § 10.410 of this subpart, the importer:
(1) Must have records that explain how the importer came to the conclusion that the good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment. Those records must include documents that support a claim that the article in question qualifies for preferential tariff treatment because it meets the applicable rules of origin set forth in General Note 26, HTSUS, and in this subpart. Those records may include a properly completed certification or other information as set forth in § 10.411 of this subpart; and
(2) May be required to demonstrate that the conditions set forth in § 10.463 of this subpart were met if the imported article was shipped through an intermediate country.

The fact that the importer has issued a certification based on information provided by the exporter or producer will not relieve the importer of the responsibility referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. A U.S. importer who voluntarily makes a corrected declaration will not be subject to penalties for having made an incorrect declaration (
see

Effect of noncompliance.
If the importer fails to comply with any requirement under this subpart, including submission of a certification of origin or other information demonstrating that the good qualifies as originating under § 10.411(a) of this subpart or submission of a corrected certification under § 10.413 of this subpart, the Center director may deny preferential tariff treatment to the imported good.
(b)
Failure to provide documentation regarding transshipment.
Where the requirements for preferential tariff treatment set forth elsewhere in this subpart are met, the Center director nevertheless may deny preferential tariff treatment to an originating good if the good is shipped through or transshipped in a country other than Chile or the United States, and the importer of the good does not provide, at the request of the Center director, copies of documents demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Center director that the requirements set forth in § 10.463 of this subpart were met.

§ 10.425
Transit and transshipment of non-originating cotton or man-made fiber fabric or apparel goods.
(a)
General.
A good will not be considered eligible for preferential tariff treatment under an applicable TPL by reason of having undergone production that occurs entirely in the territory of Chile, the United States, or both, that would enable the good to qualify for preferential tariff treatment if subsequent to that production the good undergoes further production or any other operation outside the territories of Chile and the United States, other than unloading, reloading, or any other process necessary to preserve the good in good condition or to transport the good to the territory of Chile or the United States.
(b)
Documentary evidence.
An importer making a claim for preferential tariff treatment may be required to demonstrate, to CBP's satisfaction, that no further production or subsequent operation, other than permitted under paragraph (a) of this section, occurred outside the territories of Chile or the United States.

(2) The value of such non-originating materials is included in calculating the value of non-originating materials for any applicable regional value-content requirement under this note; and
(3) The good meets all other applicable requirements of General Note 26(n), HTSUS.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to:
(1) A non-originating material provided for in Chapter 4 of the Harmonized System, or a non-originating dairy preparation containing over 10 percent by weight of milk solids provided for in subheadings 1901.90 or 2106.90 of the Harmonized System, that

A good containing elastomeric yarns in the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good shall be considered to be an originating good only if such yarns are wholly formed in the territory of a Party. For purposes of this paragraph, if a good is a fiber, yarn or fabric, the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good is all of the fibers in the yarn, fabric or group of fibers.
§ 10.460
Indirect materials.
An indirect material, as defined in § 10.402(o), will be considered to be an originating material without regard to where it is produced.

# Example.
Chilean Producer C produces good C using non-originating material A. Producer C imports non-originating rubber gloves for use by workers in the production of good C. Good C is subject to a tariff shift requirement. As provided in § 10.451(b)(1) and General Note 26(n), each of the non-originating materials in good C must undergo the specified change in tariff classification in order for good C to be considered originating. Although non-originating material A must undergo the applicable tariff shift in order
for good C to be considered originating, the rubber gloves do not because they are indirect materials and are considered originating without regard to where they are produced.
