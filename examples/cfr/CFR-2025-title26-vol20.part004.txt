Filing instructions.
A request for relief under this section is a request for a letter ruling. Requests for relief should be submitted in accordance with the applicable procedures for requests for a letter ruling and must be accompanied by the applicable user fee.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1. Taxpayer discovers own error.
Taxpayer A prepares A's 1997 income tax return. A is unaware that a particular regulatory election is available to report a transaction in a particular manner. A files the 1997 return without making the election and reporting the transaction in a different manner. In 1999, A hires a qualified tax professional to prepare A's 1999 return. The professional discovers that A did not make the election. A promptly files for relief in accordance with this section. Assume paragraphs (b)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section do not apply. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, A is deemed to have acted reasonably and in good faith because A requested relief before the failure to make the regulatory election was discovered by the IRS.

# Example 2. Reliance on qualified tax professional.
Taxpayer B hires a qualified tax professional to advise B on preparing B's 1997 income tax return. The professional was competent to render advice on the election and B provided the professional with all the relevant facts. The professional fails to advise B that a regulatory election is necessary in order for B to report income on B's 1997 return in a particular manner. Nevertheless, B reports this income in a manner that is consistent with having made the election. In 2000, during the examination of the 1997 return by the IRS, the examining agent discovers that the election has not been filed. B promptly files for relief in accordance with
this section, including attaching an affidavit from B's professional stating that the professional failed to advise B that the election was necessary. Assume paragraphs (b)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section do not apply. Under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, B is deemed to have acted reasonably and in good faith because B reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional and the tax professional failed to advise B to make the election.

# Example 3. Accuracy-related penalty.
Taxpayer C reports income on its 1997 income tax return in a manner that is contrary to a regulatory provision. In 2000, during the examination of the 1997 return, the IRS raises an issue regarding the reporting of this income on C's return and asserts the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662. C requests relief under this section to elect an alternative method of reporting the income. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, C is deemed to have not acted reasonably and in good faith because C seeks to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty could be imposed under section 6662.

# Example 4. Election not requiring adjustment under section 481(a).
Taxpayer D prepares D's 1997 income tax return. D is unaware that a particular accounting method regulatory election is available. D files D's 1997 return without making the election and uses another permissible method of accounting. The applicable regulation provides that the election is made on a cut-off basis (without an adjustment under section 481(a)). In 1998, D requests relief under this section to make the election under the regulation. If D were granted an extension of time to make the election, D would pay no less tax than if the election had been timely made. Assume that paragraphs (c)(2) (i), (iii), and (iv) of this section do not apply. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the interests of the Government are not deemed to be prejudiced because the election does not require an adjustment under section 481(a).

# Example 5. Election requiring adjustment under section 481(a).
The facts are the same as in Example 4 of this paragraph (f) except that the applicable regulation provides that the election requires an adjustment under section 481(a). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the interests of the Government are deemed to be prejudiced except in unusual or compelling circumstances.

# Example 6. Under examination by the IRS.
A regulation permits an automatic change in method of accounting for an item on a cut-off basis. Taxpayer E reports income on E's 1997 income tax return using an impermissible method of accounting for the item. In 2000, during the examination of the 1997 return by the IRS, the examining agent notifies E in writing that its method of accounting for the item is an issue under consideration. Any change from the impermissible method made as part of an examination is made with an adjustment under section 481(a). E requests relief under this section to make the change pursuant to the regulation for 1997. The change on a cut-off basis under the regulation would be more favorable than if the change were made with an adjustment under section 481(a) as part of an examination. Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, the interests of the Government are deemed to be prejudiced except in unusual and compelling circumstances because E seeks to change from an impermissible method of accounting that is an issue under consideration in the examination on a basis that is more favorable than if the change were made as part of an examination.

Special election for computing investment company taxable income.
This paragraph applies to the election by a regulated investment company provided under section 1071(b) of the Act, which added section 852(b)(2)(F) to the Code.

(k)
Election of extension of time for payment of estate tax for interests in certain holding companies.
An election under section 6166(b)(8), as added by section 1021(a) of the Act, or under section 1021(d)(2) of the Act, shall be made by including on the notice of election under section 6166 required by § 20.6166-1(b) a statement that an election is being made under section 6166(b)(8) or section 1021(d)(2) of the Act (whichever is applicable) and the facts which formed the basis for the executor's conclusion that the estate qualified for such election. If a taxpayer makes an election described in this paragraph (k), then the special 4-percent interest rate of section 6601(j) and the 5-year deferral of principal payments of section 6166(a)(3) are not available.

If the executor makes an election described in this paragraph (k) and the notice of election under section 6166 fails to state the amount of tax to be paid in installments or the number of installments, then the election is presumed to be for the maximum amount so payable and for payment thereof in 10 equal annual installments, beginning on the date prescribed in section 6151(a). The elections described under this paragraph (k) are available for estates of decedents dying after July 18, 1984.

Election with respect to the treatment of reasonably estimated losses in an insolvent or bankrupt financial institution
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (d) applies to an election under section 905(a) of the 1986 Act, and to an election under section 1009(d) of the Act, both relating to section 165(l) of the Code. If—
(i) As of the close of the taxable year, it can reasonably be estimated that there is a loss on a deposit (within the meaning of section 165(l)(4)) of a qualified individual (as defined in section 165(l)(2)) in a qualified financial institution (as defined in section 165(l)(3)), and
(ii) Such loss is on account of the bankruptcy or insolvency of such institution, then the qualified individual may elect under either section 165(l)(1) or (5) (but not both), to treat the amount (subject to the applicable limitations if under section 165(l)(5)) so estimated for that taxable year as a loss described in either section 165(c)(3), relating to casualty losses, or section 165(c)(2), relating to transactions entered into for profit, and incurred during the taxable year.
The election will apply to all losses of the qualified individual on deposits in the institution with respect to which an election is made. For additional information and examples of the application of the election rules, see Notice 89-28, 1989-12 I.R.B. 72.
This paragraph (d) includes the procedural and the principal substantive rules first issued in Notice 89-28. For specific rules relating to an election under section 165(1)(5), see paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

Specific rules relating to the section 165(1)(5) election
—(i)
Applicability.
An election under section 165(1)(5) of the Code may be made only if no part of the taxpayer's deposits in the financial institution is federally insured. Generally, this requirement will be met only in cases in which none of the deposits in the financial institution are federally insured.
(ii)
Dollar limitations.
An election under section 165(1)(5) of the Code is limited to $20,000 ($10,000 in the case of a separate return by a married individual) in aggregate losses on deposits in any one financial institution. The applicable dollar limit must be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds that can reasonably be expected to be received under any state law.
(3)
Time and manner of determining loss and making the election
—(i)
Year of election and determination of loss.
A qualified individual may make an election under section 165(1) of the Code either for the first taxable year in which a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made or for a later taxable year that is prior to the taxable year in which the loss is sustained. The amount of the loss is determined by the difference between a taxpayer's basis in the deposits and the amount that is reasonably estimated to be recovered, taking into account all facts and circumstances reasonably available to the taxpayer as of the date the election is made. A reasonable estimate might be based, for example, on the percentage of total deposits likely to be recovered by the depositors according to a determination made by the regulatory authority or trustee having responsibility over the institution. In addition, the taxpayer's basis in the deposits must be reduced to the extent that a loss is claimed.
(ii)
Time and manner of making election.
A qualified individual may make an election under section 165(1) of the Code on—
(A) The income tax return for the taxable year with respect to which the taxpayer made a reasonable estimate of the loss;
(B) An amended income tax return for a taxable year described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, if the period prescribed for filing a claim for refund or credit for that taxable year has not yet expired; or, if applicable,
(C) An amended income tax return for a taxable year (beginning after December 31, 1981) described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, whether or not the claim for refund or credit is barred by another provision of law, but only if the amended return is properly filed on or before November 9, 1989.
(iii)
Information to include with election.
The election should include any information requested in the applicable forms and instructions (e.g., Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts). If the applicable form(s) and instructions do not make reference to or request information concerning this election, the taxpayer should, on an appropriate line or space clearly indicate the name of the financial institution, include the following language: “Insolvent Financial Institution Election,” and include the calculation of the reasonably estimated loss claimed.
(4)
Revocability of the election
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer desires to revoke an election under section 165(l) of the Code, the taxpayer must request, in writing, the consent of the Secretary setting forth the pertinent facts surrounding the election and the reasons for requesting a revocation.
(ii)
Exception.
With respect to an election made under section 165(l)(1) of the Code prior to November 9, 1989, a qualified individual may revoke such election without securing the prior consent of the Secretary but only if the taxpayer makes an election under section 165(l)(5) by November 9, 1989, in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

(e)
Effect of election
—(1)
Consent to revoke required.
Except where otherwise provided by statute or except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, an election to which this section applies made in accordance with this section shall be binding unless consent to revoke the election is obtained from the Commissioner. An application for consent to revoke the election will not be accepted before the promulgation of the permanent regulations relating to the section of the Code or Act under which the election is made. Such regulations will provide a reasonable period of time within which taxpayers will be permitted to apply for consent to revoke the election.
(2)

An election to which this section applies, made in accordance with this section, may be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner not later than 90 days after the permanent regulations relating to the section of the Code or Act under which the election is made are filed with the Office of the Federal Register, provided such regulations grant taxpayers blanket permission to revoke that election within such time
without the consent of the Commissioner. Such blanket permission to revoke an election will be provided by the permanent regulations in the event of a determination by the Secretary or his delegate that such regulations contain provisions that may not reasonably have been anticipated by taxpayers at the time of making such election.

§ 301.9100-14T
Individual's election to terminate taxable year when case commences.
(a)
Scope.
The regulations prescribed in this section provide rules for making the election under section 1398(d)(2) to terminate the taxable year of an individual taxpayer.
(b)
Availability of election.
This election is available to an individual taxpayer in a case commenced after March 24, 1981, under chapter 7 (relating to liquidations) or chapter 11 (relating to reorganizations) of title 11 of the United States Code. If the case is dismissed, the taxpayer cannot make the election, and an election previously made will be void. For purposes of this section, a partnership is not treated as an individual. If the taxpayer making the election is married (within the meaning of section 143), the election is available to the taxpayer's spouse, but only if the spouse is eligible to file, and does file, a joint return with the taxpayer for the taxable year ended as a result of the election.
(c)
Effect of election.
The election terminates the taxable year of the taxpayer (and of a spouse who joins in the election) on the day before the commencement date of the case. A new taxable year begins on the commencement date and (unless terminated earlier) ends on the date on which the taxpayer's taxable year in which the case commenced would have ended if the election had not been made.
(d)
Time and manner.
A taxpayer to whom the election is available makes the election by filing a return for the short taxable year ending the day before commencement of the case (the “first short taxable year”) on or before the 15th day of the fourth full month following the end of that first short taxable year. The spouse of such a taxpayer makes the election by making a joint return with the taxpayer for that first short taxable year within the time prescribed in the preceding sentence. To facilitate processing, the taxpayer should write “Section 1398 Election” at the top of the return. A taxpayer may also make the election by attaching a statement of election to an application for extension of time for filing a return that satisfies the requirements under section 6081 for the first short taxable year. The application for extension must be submitted under section 6081 on or before the due date of the return for the first short taxable year. The statement must state that the taxpayer elects under section 1398(d)(2) to close his or her taxable year as of the day before commencement of the case. If the taxpayer's spouse elects to close his or her taxable year, the spouse must join in the application for extension and in the statement of election. If a joint return is not filed for the first short taxable year, the election of the spouse made with the application is void.
(e)
Irrevocability of election.
The election is irrevocable.
(f)
Subsequent bankruptcy case of debtor's spouse.
If a case under chapter 7 or
chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code commences with respect to the spouse of a debtor to whom an election under this section was available, the spouse can make an election under this section even if the spouse's case commences in the same taxable year in which the debtor's case commences. The spouse can make the election whether or not the spouse previously joined in the debtor's election. If the spouse joined in the debtor's election, or if the debtor did not make the election, the debtor may join in the spouse's election, assuming the debtor is otherwise eligible to file a joint return with the spouse.
(g)
Examples.

# Example.
(1) Assume that husband and wife are calendar-year taxpayers, that a bankruptcy case involving only the husband commences on March 1, 1982, and that a bankruptcy case involving only the wife commences on October 10, 1982.
(2) If the husband does not make an election, his taxable year would not be affected;
i.e.,
it does not terminate on February 28. If the husband does make an election, his first short taxable year would be January 1 through February 28; his second short taxable year would begin March 1. The tax return for his first short taxable year would be due on June 15. The wife could join in the husband's election, but only if they file a joint return for the taxable year January 1 through February 28.
(3) The wife could elect to terminate her taxable year on October 9. If she did, and if the husband had not made an election or if the wife had not joined in the husband's election, she would have two taxable years in 1982—the first from January 1 through October 9, and the second from October 10 through December 31. The tax return for her first short taxable year would be due on February 15, 1983. If the husband had not made an election to terminate his taxable year on February 28, the husband could join in an election by his wife, but only if they file a joint return for the taxable year January 1 through October 9. If the husband had made an election but the wife had not joined in the husband's election, the husband could not join in an election by the wife to terminate her taxable year on October 9, since they could not file a joint return for such year.
(4) If the wife makes the election relating to her own bankruptcy case, and had joined the husband in making an election relating to his case, she would have two additional taxable years with respect to her 1982 income and deductions—the second short taxable year would be March 1 through October 9, and the third short taxable year would be October 10 through December 31. The husband could join in the wife's election if they file a joint return for the second short taxable year. If the husband joins in the wife's election, they could file joint returns for the short taxable year ending December 31, but would not be required to do so.

Election to use retroactive effective date.
(a)
Scope.
The regulations prescribed in this section provide rules for making the election to use a retroactive effective date under section 7(f) of the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980.
(b)
Availability of election.
The election is available to the debtor (or debtors) in a case under title 11 of the United States Code (or a receivership, foreclosure, or similar proceeding in a Federal or State court) that commences after September 30, 1979, and before January 1, 1981. The court must approve the election. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a receivership, foreclosure, or similar proceeding before a Federal or State agency involving a financial institution to which section 585 or 593 applies shall be treated as a proceeding before a court.
(c)
Effect of election
—(1)
In general.
An election under this section changes the effective date of certain amendments to the Code made by the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980. The amendments affected by an election under this section are listed in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section. If the election is made, all of the amendments listed in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section apply to all transactions in the case (or similar proceeding) and to all parties in respect of all transactions in the case (or similar proceeding). Thus, the debtor may not elect to have only certain of the amendments apply to transactions in the case (or similar proceeding) and may not elect to have the amendments apply only to certain transactions in the case (or similar proceeding). An election under this section will not make the amendments listed in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) applicable to transactions occurring prior to commencement of the case (or similar proceeding) or transactions not in the case (or similar proceeding).

Subject to the transitional rule of section 7(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980, an election under this section changes the effective date of the amendments to sections 108 and 1017, relating to the tax treatment of discharge of indebtedness.
(4)
Substitution of effective dates.
The election under this section changes the effective date of the amendments listed in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section by substituting “September 30, 1979” for “December 31 1980” wherever it appears in section 7(a), (c), and (d) of the Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980.
(d)
Time and manner
—(1)
Time and place.
A debtor makes the election under this section by filing the written statement and evidence of court approval required under paragraph (d) (2) and (3) of this section on or before November 2, 1981, with the District Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center with whom an income tax return for the debtor would be filed if it were due on the date the election is filed. The election shall be considered to be made on the date on which the written statement and evidence of court approval is filed. The debtor should attach a copy of the statement and evidence of court approval to the next income tax return filed on or after the date the election is made.

An election under this section may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. A request for revocation can be made only with approval of the court (or agency).
[T.D. 7775, 46 FR 25292, May 6, 1981. Redesignated by T.D. 8435, 57 FR 43896, Sept. 23, 1992]
§ 301.9100-16T
Election to accrue vacation pay.
(a)
In general.
Section 463 provides that taxpayers whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting may elect without the consent of the Commissioner, to deduct certain amounts with respect to vacation pay which, because of contingencies, would not otherwise be deductible. Such election must apply to the liability for all vacation pay accounts maintained by the taxpayer within a single trade or business if the liability is contingent when vacation pay is earned.
(b)
Time for making election.
(1) In the case of a taxpayer who established or maintained a vacation pay account
pursuant to I.T. 3956 and who continued to maintain such account pursuant to section 97 of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, as amended, for its last taxable year ending before January 1, 1973, the election must be made for each trade or business for which such account was maintained on or before the later of (i) July 21, 1975, or (ii) the due date for filing the income tax return (determined with regard to any extensions of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return) for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973. The election pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective with respect to an account described in this paragraph (b)(1) for taxable years ending after December 31, 1972. Failure to file such election shall constitute a change in the method of accounting for vacation pay for the first taxable year ending after December 31, 1972. Such change in accounting method will be considered a change initiated by the taxpayer.
(2) In the case of a trade or business of a taxpayer to which paragraph (b)(1) does not apply, the election provided for in this section may be made for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973, by making the election not later than (i) July 21, 1975, or (ii) the due date for filing the income tax return (determined with regard to any extensions of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return) for the first taxable year for which the election is made.
(3) A taxpayer who elects under section 463 to treat vacation pay as provided in this section and who wishes to revoke such election may only do so with the consent of the Commissioner. Such revocation shall constitute a change in the method of accounting.
(c)
Manner of making election.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the election provided for in this section must be made by means of a statement attached to a timely filed income tax return. The statement shall indicate that the taxpayer is electing to apply the provisions of section 463, and shall contain the following information:
(i) The taxpayer's name and a description of each vacation pay plan to which the election is to apply.
(ii) A schedule with appropriate explanations showing—
(A) In the case of a vacation pay account established or maintained pursuant to I.T. 3956 and section 97 of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, as amended,
(
1
) The balance of each such vacation pay account maintained by the taxpayer, and
(
2
) The amount, determined as if the taxpayer had maintained a vacation pay account for the last taxable year ending before January 1, 1973, representing the taxpayer's liability for vacation pay earned by employees, before the close of the taxable year and payable during such taxable year or within 12 months following the close of such taxable year.
(B) In the case of other vacation pay accounts, the amount of the closing balances the taxpayer would have had for the taxpayer's 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year for which the election was made, had the taxpayer maintained an account representing the taxpayer's liability for vacation pay earned by the employees before the close of the taxable year and payable during the taxable year or within 12 months following the close of the taxable year throughout the 3 immediately preceding taxable years.
(iii) The amounts accrued and deducted for prior years for vacation pay but not paid at the close of the taxable year preceding the year for which the election is made.
(2) Where a taxpayer has filed its return for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973 prior to July 21, 1975, and has not made the election pursuant to this section, the election may be made by filing an amended return (showing adjustments, in any) for such year and attaching the statement required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section on or before July 21, 1975.
(d) The time for making the election may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1).
X, whose taxable year begins on February 1, files, its return based on the accrual method of accounting. X has continuously accrued and deducted for income tax purposes contingent amounts of vacation pay, pursuant to I.T. 3956. Pursuant to section 463 and these regulations, in order for X
to continue accruing and deducting its vacation pay amounts, X must elect to account for vacation pay under section 463 by attaching the election to its timely filed return for its taxable year ending on January 31, 1975, or if X has already filed such return by July 21, 1975, without such election, by filing the election statement with an amended return by July 21, 1975. If X does not make the election under section 463, X will be treated as having initiated a change in its method of accounting for vacation pay in its taxable year ending on January 31, 1973.

# Example (2).
Y, a calendar year taxpayer files its returns based on the accrual method of accounting.

If this election is made section 33(a) does not apply with respect to such property, and any subsequent appreciation in the value of the property is not
taxable as compensation. However, if the property is later forfeited, no deduction is allowed to any person with respect to such forfeiture. This election is not necessary in the case of property which is transferred subject only to a restriction which by its terms will never lapse.

Any statement filed before February 15, 1970, may be amended not later than 30 days after the publication of this Treasury decision in the

Election relating to passive investment income of electing small business corporations.
(a)
In general.
Section 3(a) of the Act of April 14, 1966 (Pub. L. 89-389) amends section 1372(e)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to passive investment income of electing small business corporations). This amendment, which applies to taxable years of electing small business corporations ending after April 14, 1966, provides, in general, that an election of a small business corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall not terminate for a taxable year of the corporation in which it has gross receipts more than 20 percent of which is passive investment income, if—
(1) Such taxable year is the first taxable year in which the corporation commenced the active conduct of any trade or business or the next succeeding taxable year; and
(2) The amount of passive investment income for such taxable year is less than $3,000.
Section 3(b) of the Act of April 14, 1966, provides that the amendment made by section 3(a) thereof shall also apply to taxable years of a corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966, if the corporation elects to have the amendment apply to such years, and all persons (or their personal representatives) who were shareholders of such corporation at any time during any of such years consent to such election and the application of the amendment. This section prescribes the time for, and manner of, making such election and consents, and also extends the time within which

—(1)
In general.
An election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall not be treated as terminated under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code for any taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966, if—

If an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code is not treated as terminated for a taxable year of the corporation as a result of an election and consents under this paragraph, such election under section 1372(a) of the Code shall be treated as being in effect with respect to all subsequent taxable years of the corporation unless it is otherwise terminated or revoked for any such subsequent year pursuant to section 1372(e) of the Code.
(2)

An election by a corporation pursuant to subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph shall be filed with the district director with whom the corporation was required to file its return of income (see section 6037 of the Code and the regulations thereunder) for the earliest of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966, for which an election terminated under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code. Such election shall be filed within 3 years after the date prescribed by law (not including any extension thereof) on which such return was required to be filed, or within 90 days from February 28, 1967, whichever is later. (However, credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to the election may not be allowed or made if claim therefor has not been filed within the time prescribed by law; and, see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph providing that the statutory period for assessment of certain deficiencies against shareholders may not have expired on the date the election and consents under this paragraph are filed.) Such election shall be in the form of a statement, signed by a person authorized to sign the corporation's return of income, which shall expressly provide that the corporation elects the application of section 1372(e)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Pub. L. 89-389, with respect to its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966. The statement shall set forth the name, address, and employer identification number of the corporation; the internal revenue officer with whom the corporation's returns of income have been filed for each of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962; the names and addresses of all persons who have been shareholders of the corporation at any time during each of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962; computations showing the amount of the corporation's overpayment or deficiency of tax for any taxable year which is attributable to the election under this paragraph; and computations showing each shareholder's portion of the undistributed taxable income (determined as provided in section 1373(b) of the Code) or net operating loss (determined as provided in section 1374(c) of the Code) for each taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, unless such computations were made on the corporation's returns of income for each of such years. In order for an election under this paragraph to be effective, it must be accompanied by the consents of certain shareholders as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(3)
Consents by shareholders.
An election by a corporation pursuant to this paragraph must be accompanied by the consent of each person who was a shareholder of the corporation at any time during any taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966. This includes persons who may not be shareholders on the date the election is filed. Where stock of the corporation was owned by a husband and wife as community property (or the income from which was community property), or was owned by tenants in common, joint tenants, or tenants by the entirety, each person who had a community interest in such stock and each tenant in common, joint tenant, and tenant by the entirety must consent to the election. The consent of a minor shall be made by the minor or by his legal guardian, or by his natural guardian if no legal guardian has been appointed. The consent of an estate shall be made by the executor or administrator thereof. If a person who is required to file a consent under this subparagraph is deceased, the executor or administrator of such person's estate, or other person charged with the property of such person, shall file the required consent. The consent of each shareholder shall be in the form of a statement signed by the shareholder in which he states that he consents to the election by the corporation under this paragraph. Each of such statements shall set forth the name and address of the corporation and of the shareholder; the number of shares of stock of the corporation owned by such shareholder at any time during any taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962; the date (or dates) on which such stock was acquired, and, if disposed of, the date (or dates) of disposition; and the internal revenue officer with whom the shareholder's income tax returns have been filed for each of such taxable years in which he owned any such stock. In addition, a consent under this paragraph is not effective unless (i) the statutory period for assessment of any deficiency for each taxable year for which there would be a deficiency attributable to the election and consents under this paragraph has not expired on the date the election and consents under this paragraph are filed, and (ii) there is included in, or attached to, the statement of consent a written consent that the statutory period for assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year (to the extent that such deficiency is attributable to the election and consents under this paragraph) shall not expire before the expiration of 1 year after the date the election and consents under this paragraph are filed. Each of the statements of consent under this subparagraph shall be filed with the corporation's election under this paragraph. The consents of all shareholders may be incorporated in one statement.
(4)
Election and consents are binding.
The election and consents under this paragraph are binding and may not be withdrawn.
(c)
New shareholders.
Section 1372(e)(1) of the Code provides that an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall terminate if certain new shareholders do not consent to such election within the time prescribed by regulations. New shareholders of a corporation which makes an election under paragraph (b) of this section may not have consented to the corporation's election under section 1372(a) of the Code within such prescribed time as a result of a termination of such election under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 89-389. Therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1372(e)(1) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall not be treated as terminated for the failure of any new shareholder to file a timely consent under section 1372(e)(1) of the Code, for any of the taxable years of the corporation between and including the earliest taxable year determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and the taxable year during which the corporation files an election under paragraph (b) of this section, if—
(1) The corporation's election under section 1372(a) of the Code would have terminated for a taxable year under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code in the event it had not made an election under paragraph (b) of this section, and
(2) A proper consent under section 1372(e)(1) of the Code is filed by such new shareholder with the corporation's election under paragraph (b) of this section.
[T.D. 6912, 32 FR 3343, Feb. 28, 1967. Redesignated by T.D. 8435, 57 FR 43896, Sept. 23, 1992]

Section 1375(e) provides that a corporation, with the consent of its shareholders, may elect, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, to treat a distribution of money made after the close of the taxable year as made, and as received by its shareholders, on the last day of such taxable year if the following conditions are satisfied:

(3) Each shareholder on the day such distribution is received—
(i) Owns the same proportion of the stock of the corporation on such day as he owned on the last day of such taxable year, and
(ii) Consents to such election. Section 1375(e) applies only with respect to taxable years of corporations beginning after December 31, 1957.
(b)
Time and manner for making election
—(1)
Taxable years ending after February 26, 1964.
For taxable years ending after February 26, 1964, an election under section 1375(e) with respect to a taxable year shall be made by attaching to the corporation income tax return for such taxable year, filed not later than the time (including extensions thereof) prescribed by law, the following documents:
(i) A statement that the corporation elects the application of section 1375(e) and the date and amount of each distribution to which the election applies;
(ii) A copy of the resolution of the board of directors referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and ending on or before February 26, 1964, an election under section 1375(e) with respect to a taxable year shall be made on or before June 25, 1964, by either attaching the documents described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph to its income tax return for such taxable year, or by filing such documents with the district director with whom the corporation has filed, or intends to file, its income tax return for such taxable year.
(3)
Election is binding.
An election under subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph is binding and may not be withdrawn.
(c)
Shareholders' consent.
The consent of a shareholder to an election under section 1375(e) shall be in the form of a statement signed by the shareholder in which such shareholder consents to the election of the corporation. Such shareholder's consent is binding and may not be withdrawn after a valid election is made by the corporation. Each person who is a shareholder of the electing corporation must consent to the election; thus, where stock of the corporation is owned by a husband and wife as community property (or the income from which is community property), or is owned by tenants in common, joint tenants, or tenants by the entirety, each person having a community interest in such stock and each tenant in common, joint tenant, and tenant by the entirety must consent to the election. The consent of a minor shall be made by the minor or by his
legal guardian, or his natural guardian if no legal guardian has been appointed. The consent of an estate shall be made by the executor or administrator thereof. The statement shall set forth the name, address, and account number of the corporation and of the shareholder, the date the distribution is received, the number and proportion of the shares of stock of the corporation owned by him on the date the distribution is received, and the number and proportion of such shares owned by him on the last day of the taxable year of the corporation with respect to which the election is made. The consents of all shareholders may be incorporated in one statement.

The partnership makes an election under this section by providing a written statement with the words “Election under Section 1101(g)(4)” written at the top that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section to the individual identified in the notice of selection for examination as the IRS contact regarding the examination.

A statement making an election under this section must be in writing and be dated and signed by the tax matters partner, as defined under section 6231(a)(7) (prior to amendment by the BBA), and the applicable regulations, or an individual who has the authority to sign the partnership return for the taxable year under section 6063, the regulations thereunder, and applicable forms and instructions. The fact that an individual dates and signs the statement making the election described in this paragraph (b) shall be prima facie evidence that the individual is authorized to make the election on behalf of the partnership. A statement making an election must include—

chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code as amended by the BBA; and
(F) A representation, signed under penalties of perjury, that the individual signing the statement is duly authorized to make the election described in this paragraph (b) and that, to the best of the individual's knowledge and belief, all of the information contained in the statement is true, correct, and complete.
(iii)
Notice of Administrative Proceeding.
Upon receipt of the election described in this paragraph (b), the IRS will promptly mail a notice of administrative proceeding to the partnership and the partnership representative, as required under section 6231(a)(1) as amended by the BBA. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the IRS will not mail the notice of administrative proceeding before the date that is 30 days after receipt of the election described in paragraph (b) of this section.

Election for the purpose of filing an administrative adjustment request (AAR) under section 6227 as amended by the BBA
—(1)

A partnership that has not been issued a notice of selection for examination as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may make an election with respect to a partnership return for an eligible taxable year for the purpose of filing an AAR under section 6227 as amended by the BBA. Once an election under this paragraph (c) is made, all of the amendments made by section 1101 of the BBA, except section 6221(b) as added by the BBA, apply with respect to the partnership taxable year for which such election is made.

(4)
Effect of filing an AAR before January 1, 2018.
Except in the case of an election made in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, an AAR filed on behalf of a partnership before January 1, 2018, is deemed for purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, to be an AAR filed under section 6227(c) (prior to amendment by the BBA) or an amended return of partnership income, as applicable.
(d)
Eligible taxable year
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term
eligible taxable year
means any partnership taxable year beginning after November 2, 2015 and before January 1, 2018, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Exception if AAR or amended return filed or deemed filed.

§ 302.1
Statutory provisions and Executive order; section 212 of the International Claims Settlement Act, and Executive Order 10644.
Sec. 212.
(a) The vesting in any officer or agency designated by the President under this title of any property or the receipt by such designee of any earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof shall not render inapplicable any Federal, State, Territorial, or local tax for any period before or after such vesting.
(b) The officer or agency designated by the President under this title shall, notwithstanding the filing of any claim or the institution of any suit under this title, pay any tax incident to any such property, or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, at the earliest time appearing to him to be not contrary to the interest of the United States. The former owner shall not be liable for any such tax accruing while such property, earnings, increment, or proceeds are held by such designee, unless they are returned pursuant to this title without payment of such tax by the designee. Every such tax shall be paid by the designee to the same extent, as nearly as may be deemed practicable, as though the property had not been vested, and shall be paid only out of the property, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, to which they are incident or out of other property acquired from the same former owner, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof. No tax liability may be enforced from any property or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof while held by the designee except with his consent. Where any property is transferred otherwise than pursuant to section 207(a) or 207(b) hereof, the designee may transfer the property free and clear of any tax, except to the extent of any lien for a tax existing and perfected at the date of vesting, and the proceeds of such transfer shall, for tax purposes, replace the property in the hands of the designee.
(c) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the manner of computing any Federal taxes, including without limitation by reason of this enumeration, the applicability in such computation of credits, deductions, and exemptions to which the former owner is or would be entitled, and the time and manner of any payment of such taxes and the extent of any compliance by the designee with provisions of Federal law and regulations applicable with respect to Federal taxes, shall be in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury to effectuate this section. Statutes of limitations on assessments, collection, refund, or credit of Federal taxes shall be suspended with respect to any vested property or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, while vested and for six months thereafter; but no interest shall be paid upon any refund with respect to any period during which the statute of limitations is so suspended.
(d) The word “tax” as used in this section shall include, without limitation by reason of this enumeration, any property, income, excess-profits, war-profits, excise, estate, and employment tax, import duty, and special assessment; and also any interest, penalty, additional amount, or addition thereto not arising from any act, omission, neglect, failure, or delay on the part of the designee.

§ 302.1-3
Protection of internal revenue prior to tax determination.
(a)
Suits and claims for return of vested property

In such cases vested property (including property vested pursuant to section 202(a) of the Act which is subject to divestment by reason of its ownership by a natural person) shall not be returned or divested except in accordance with this paragraph.

(ii)
Without security.
Where vested property is the subject of a suit or proceeding pursuant to the Act, it may be returned without security prior to determination of applicable internal revenue taxes and prior to the judgment of the court or to the publication of the order of the Attorney General directing such return to the following described claimants under conditions hereinafter stated:
(
a
)
Residents and domestic enterprises.
In the case of claimants who at the time of return are (
1
) individuals permanently resident in the United States since December 7, 1941, or (
2
) corporations or other business enterprises organized under the laws of the United States, or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, or doing business in the United States, the Attorney General may without notice to the Commissioner return the property at any time.
(
b
)
Non-residents, etc.
In the case of claimants who at the time of return are (
1
) individuals not permanently resident in the United States since December 7, 1941, or (
2
) nondomestic corporations or other nondomestic enterprises not doing business within the United States, the property may be returned not less than 90 days after notice by the Attorney General to the Commissioner in a case within subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, or not less than 60 days after notice in a case within subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph (a), unless within such time the Attorney General is advised otherwise by the Commissioner.
(iii)
When security required.
Except as provided in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, vested property shall not be released prior to determination of tax liability without security satisfactory to the Commissioner, but determination of tax liability will be expedited in order that the release of the property or of the security shall not be unnecessarily delayed.
(4)
Security.
When security is required under subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph (a), it shall be such of the following as the Commissioner considers necessary:
(i)
Bond.
A bond of the claimant conditioned upon payment of the full amount of internal revenue taxes determined to be due, filed with the district director in such amount, and with such sureties, as the Commissioner deems necessary. Only surety companies holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury may be used.
(ii)
Collateral security.
Collateral authorized by law deposited by the claimant in lieu of surety conditioned upon the payment of the full amount of internal revenue taxes determined to be due.
(iii)
Reservation of assets.
Monies, or if the monies are insufficient, so much of the other property involved, to be reserved by the Attorney General, as will be sufficient in the judgment of the Attorney General to cover any internal revenue tax liability determined by the Commissioner.
(b)
Vested property subject to debt claims
—(1)
Notice to Commissioner.
With respect to vested property available for the payment of debt claims pursuant to section 208 of the Act, and with respect to which debt claims have been filed, prior to the allowance of any such claims the Attorney General shall in writing notify the Commissioner of the property involved, the citizenship, residence, business organization and other necessary information concerning the debtor and the aggregate of debt claims filed in respect thereof.
(2)
Action by Commissioner.
Upon receipt of the notice provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (b), the Commissioner shall, as soon as practicable and not later than 120 days after receipt of notice, unless the time is extended by the Commissioner after notice to the Attorney General, (i) determine the taxes payable by the Attorney General in respect of the debtor, or (ii) advise the Attorney General of the provision, if any, to be made by him for payment of taxes with respect of the debtor.
§ 302.1-4
Computation of taxes.
(a)
Detail of employees of the Internal Revenue Service.
The Commissioner will detail for the assistance of the Attorney General such employees of the Internal Revenue Service as may be necessary to make the computations under the regulations in this part promptly and accurately.
(b)
Relationship of Attorney General and former owner.
In the computation of tax liability under the regulations in this part, except as otherwise provided herein, the vesting of property shall not be considered as affecting the ownership thereof; and any act of the Attorney General in respect of such property (including the collection or operation thereof and any investment, sale, or other disposition and any payment or other expenditure) shall be considered as the act of the owner. Nevertheless, except as otherwise provided in the Act or the regulations in this part, insofar as taxes are incident to the vested property during the period of vesting, they shall be payable by the Attorney General, except that to the extent of the value of any of the property returned to the former owner the latter shall be liable for such tax not paid by the Attorney General. While tax incident to nonvested property is collectible out of both vested and nonvested property, the nonvested property will be regarded as the primary source of collection of such tax. In determining the amount of liability to be paid out of property not vested by the Attorney General a computation shall be made covering the taxpayer's full period of liability, but without regard to the vested property, or the income received by, or the operations of, the Attorney General. The amount so computed shall be first asserted against and collected so far as practicable from the taxpayer or out of his property which is not vested. Such part of the total tax liability as is not paid by the taxpayer or collected out of property not vested shall be asserted against the vested property. See § 302.1-5, relating to payment of taxes, and § 302.1-7, relating to claims for credit or refund.
(c)
Laws applicable to computations.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the regulations in this part, the computation under the regulations in this part of any internal revenue tax liability shall be in accordance with the internal revenue laws and regulations applicable thereto, including all amendments of such laws or regulations enacted or promulgated prior to determination of the tax.
(d)
Periods for which computations made.
The amount of income, declared value excess profits, excess profits, capital stock, employment, and excise taxes under the internal revenue laws will be computed for each taxable year or period during all or part of which property is vested prior to the return of the property. In the case of a return of property prior to computation of tax, see § 302.1-3. Where vesting occurs during a taxable year or taxable period, any return filed or computation made covering vested or nonvested property should nevertheless be for the entire year or period. See paragraph (b) of this section. Unless facts are available indicating a liability for taxes for a taxable year or period occurring wholly prior or subsequent to the period of vesting of the property by the Attorney General, the computations under the regulations in this part, both tentative and final, will be made only in respect of years and periods during all or part of which the property is held by the Attorney General.
(e)
Tentative computation.
In order that the return of property or other appropriate action may not be delayed until the amount of taxes payable is finally computed and paid, a tentative computation of such amount will be made in every case, unless there are circumstances appearing to make such action inappropriate. Such circumstances would include (1) return of the property in accordance with § 302.1-3, (2) notice to the Commissioner by the person to whom the property is returnable or by the Attorney General that such person or the Attorney General, as the case may be, prefers that the return of the property be postponed until the amount of such taxes can be finally computed or (3) belief on the part of the Commissioner that a final computation will not unduly delay the return of, or other appropriate action with respect to, the property. In making any such tentative computation of income, profits, or estate tax, the gross income or the gross estate, as the case may be, as shown by the records of the Attorney General (excluding therefrom items exempt from taxation) shall be considered as the taxable or net income or taxable or net estate, respectively, unless a tax return has been filed or facts are available upon which a more accurate computation can be made. In
any case in which a duly authorized officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service has otherwise computed the amount of taxes payable in respect of any period, such computation will be accepted as a tentative computation, unless the facts clearly indicate that a more accurate computation can be made.
(f)
Final computation
—(1)
General.
A final computation of the amount of taxes payable by the person to whom property is returnable, or out of property to be returned, will be made as soon as practicable in every case. In any case in which the amount shown by a tentative computation has been paid, refund or credit of any amount paid in excess of the amount properly due will be made in accordance with the final computation, even though a claim therefor has not been filed, if the period of limitation applicable to the filing of such claim has not expired. However, if it is desired to protect the right to any credit or refund determined to be due, a claim for credit or refund should be filed. The sufficiency of any such claim in respect of any amount paid in accordance with a tentative computation under the regulations in this part will not be questioned solely because facts upon which a more accurate computation could be made are not available or cannot be established at the time such claim is filed. Any such claim in respect of an amount paid in accordance with a final computation must, however, clearly set forth in detail under penalties of perjury all the facts relied upon in support of the claim and must conform to the regulations applicable to an ordinary claim for refund or credit. See § 302.1-7 relating to claims for credit or refunds.
(2)
Information required
—(i)
Income and profit taxes.
The following information submitted under penalties of perjury by or for the taxpayer is necessary in each case for a final computation, for each taxable year for which the computation is to be made:
(
a
) All income (other than income received by the Attorney General) from sources within the United States, or if no such income has been received, then a statement to that effect, except that in the case of a citizen or resident of the United States, income from sources without as well as within the United States must be shown.
(
b
) If a return of such income has been made, then the following data in respect of such return:
(
1
) The taxable year for which the return was made and the tax (whether income, declared value excess profits, or excess profits tax) paid;
(
2
) The name of the taxpayer for whom the return was made;
(
3
) The name of the agent or other person (if any) by whom such return was made;
(
4
) The office of the district director in which such return was filed.
(
c
) Such other facts as may be required, from time to time, by the Commissioner.
(ii)
Other taxes.
Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, in order to make a final computation of the amount of any internal revenue tax payable by return in any case, the usual return should be filed, together with the supporting documents required by the regulations pertaining to the tax.
(g)
Tax returns
—(1)
General.
In many cases allowance of deductions and credits is contingent upon the making of a return in accordance with the applicable internal revenue law. The submission of evidence relative to income or profits tax in accordance with subdivisions (a) and (c) of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section will be considered as the making of the return required by any such law, only (i) for any taxable period, ending on or before December 31, 1946, during all or part of which all or part of the property of the taxpayer was held by the Attorney General, or (ii) for any taxable period ending within one year from the date of the first return to the taxpayer of any part of the property held by the Attorney General, whichever period ends later. In all other cases a return will be required in accordance with the applicable internal revenue law and regulations. In the case of returns where property is vested during a taxable year or period, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Estates and trusts.
In the case of estates and trusts the fiduciaries shall file returns, including information returns as required by section 147 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
(3)
Income tax forms to be used
—(i)
General.
In the case of taxpayers engaged in trade or business in the United States Forms 1040B and 1120, as may be appropriate, shall be used. Where the taxpayer is not engaged in trade or business in the United States, Form M797 may be used in lieu of Forms 1040NB, 1040NB--a, and 1120NB.
(ii)
Definition.
When used in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the term “engaged in trade or business in the United States” includes the managing and renting of real estate in the United States by an agent of the Attorney General or of the former owner duly authorized to execute rental agreements and to pay all taxes and charges incident to the repair and maintenance of such property, but does not include the mere renting or leasing of property under agreement requiring the lessee or occupant to pay taxes and to make repairs or improvements.
§ 302.1-5
Payment of taxes.
(a)
Pursuant to tentative computations.
The amount of taxes shown by a tentative computation, shall be paid by the Attorney General or the taxpayer, as the case may be, to the district director as soon as practicable after the tentative computation has been made. It will not be necessary, however, for the payment by the Attorney General to be made prior to the return of property if an amount sufficient to cover all internal revenue taxes is retained from the property by the Attorney General.
(b)
Pursuant to final computations.
Upon a final computation of internal revenue taxes properly payable, the amount thereof remaining unpaid shall be paid by the Attorney General to the district director as soon as practicable after the final computation has been made, or, in case the property has been returned to the former owner, by such owner. If the final computation shows that the full amount of internal revenue taxes properly payable is less than the amount previously paid, the difference shall be credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of the regulations in this part and other applicable regulations. A final computation will not prohibit a subsequent recomputation if it is determined that the amount shown by the final computation is erroneous.
(c)
Deficiency procedure.
The Attorney General shall pay internal revenue taxes without regard to the provisions of law relating to the sending of a deficiency notice by certified or registered mail or to notice and demand.
§ 302.1-6
Interest and penalties.
(a)
Liability for interest and civil penalties.
Under subsection (d) of section 212 of the Act there is no liability for interest or penalty on account of any act or failure of the Attorney General. Such subsection is not applicable to interest or penalties payable in respect of any act or failure during the period prior to the vesting of the property by the Attorney General, or after the return of the property, or during the period during which the property was vested by the Attorney General on account of an act or ommission of any person other than the Attorney General.
(b)
Adjustment.
In case of any assessment or collection, or credit or refund, of interest or a civil penalty contrary to section 212 (c) or (d) of the Act, proper adjustment shall be made.
§ 302.1-7
Claims for credit or refund.
(a)
Time for filing claims.
Claims for credit or refund must be filed within the period prescribed by section 322 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or by section 6511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as modified by section 212(c) of the Act. Any such claim must contain a detailed statement under penalties of perjury of all the facts relied upon in support of the claim and should be filed with the district director of the district in which the tax was paid. See paragraph (f)(1) of § 302.1-4 relating to final computation.
(b)
Attorney General acting for taxpayer.
Any act of the Attorney General for, or on behalf of, a taxpayer in respect of any claim under the regulations in this part will be considered as the act of such taxpayer, unless such taxpayer notifies the Commissioner in writing, by the filing of a claim for refund or credit or otherwise, that he
does not ratify such act. See paragraph (b) of § 302.1-4 relating to relationship of Attorney General and former owner.
(c)
Refund payable to Attorney General.
All refund of taxes paid by the Attorney General shall be made directly to that official.

§ 303.1
Statutory provisions; section 36, Trading With the Enemy Act.
Sec.
36 (a) The vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian of any property or interest (other than any property or interest acquired by the United States prior to December 18, 1941), or the receipt by him of any earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof shall not render inapplicable any Federal, State, Territorial, or local tax for any period prior or subsequent to the date of such vesting or transfer, nor render applicable the exemptions provided in title II of the Social Security Act with respect to service performed in the employ of the United States Government or of any instrumentality of the United States.
(b) The Alien Property Custodian shall, notwithstanding the filing of any claim or the institution of any suit under this Act, pay any tax incident to any such property or interest, or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, at the earliest time appearing to him to be not contrary to the interest of the United States. The former owner shall not be liable for any such tax accruing while such property, interest, earnings, increment, or proceeds are held by the Alien Property Custodian, unless they are returned pursuant to this Act without payment of such tax by the Alien Property Custodian. Every such tax shall be paid by the Alien Property Custodian to the same extent, as nearly as may be deemed practicable, as though the property or interest had not been vested in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian, and shall be paid only out of the property or interest, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, to which they are incident or out of other property or interests acquired from the same former owner, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof. No tax liability may be enforced from any property or interest or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof while held by the Alien Property Custodian except with his consent. Where any property or interest is transferred, otherwise than pursuant to section 9(a) or 32 hereof, the Alien Property Custodian may transfer the property or interest free and clear of any tax, except to the extent of any lien for a tax existing and perfected at the date of vesting, and the proceeds of such transfer shall, for tax purposes, replace the property or interest in the hands of the Alien Property Custodian.
(c) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, the manner of computing any Federal taxes, including without limitation by reason of this enumeration, the applicability in such computation of credits, deductions, and exemptions to which the former owner is or would be entitled, and the time and manner of any payment of such taxes and the extent of any compliance by the Custodian with provisions of Federal law and regulations applicable with respect to Federal taxes, shall be in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury to effectuate this section. Statutes of limitations on assessment, collection, refund, or credit of Federal taxes shall be suspended with respect to any vested property or interest, or the earnings, increment or proceeds thereof, while vested and for six months thereafter; but no interest shall be paid upon any refund with respect to any period during which the statute of limitations is so suspended.
(d) The word “tax” as used in this section shall include, without limitation by reason of this enumeration, any property, income, excess-profits, war-profits, excise, estate and employment tax, import duty, and special assessment; and also any interest, penalty, additional amount, or addition thereto not arising from any act, omission, neglect, failure, or delay on the part of the Custodian.
(e) Any tax exemption accorded to the Alien Property Custodian by specific provision of existing law shall not be affected by this section.

§ 303.1-3
Protection of internal revenue prior to tax determination.
(a)
Suits and claims for return of vested property
—(1)
General.
The provisions of this paragraph apply in cases where there has been neither a final nor a tentative determination of internal revenue tax liability. See paragraphs (e) and (f) of § 303.1-4. In such cases vested property shall not be returned except in accordance with this paragraph.

(ii)
Return without suit.
At least 90 days prior to any return of vested property pursuant to section 32 of the Act the Attorney General shall in writing notify the Commissioner in the manner prescribed in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(3)
Return of property
—(i)
Without security.
Vested property, the subject of a suit or proceeding pursuant to the Trading With the Enemy Act, may be returned without security prior to determination of applicable internal revenue taxes and prior to the judgment of the court or publication of the order of the Attorney General directing such return, to the following described claimants under the conditions hereinafter stated:
(
a
)
Residents and domestic enterprises.
In the case of claimants who at the time of return are (
1
) individuals permanently resident in the United States since December 7, 1941, or (
2
) corporations or other business enterprises organized under the laws of the United States, or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, or doing business in the United States, the Attorney General may return the property at any time without notice to the Commissioner of such return.
(
b
)
Nonresidents, etc.
In the case of claimants who at the time of return are (
1
) individuals not permanently resident of the United States since December 7, 1941, or (
2
) nondomestic corporations or other nondomestic business enterprises not doing business within the United States, the property may be returned not less than 90 days after notice by the Attorney General to the Commissioner in a case within subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph (a), or not less than 60 days after notice in a case within subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph (a), unless within such time the Attorney General is advised otherwise by the Commissioner.
(ii)
When security required.
Except as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph vested property shall not be released prior to determination of tax liability without security satisfactory
to the Commissioner, but determination of tax liability will be expedited in order that release of the property or of the security shall not be unnecessarily delayed.
(4)
Security.
Security when required shall be such of the following as shall, in the judgment of the Commissioner, be appropriate:
(i)
Bond.
A bond of the claimant conditioned upon payment of the full amount of internal revenue taxes determined to be due, filed with the district director in such amount, and with such sureties, as the Commissioner deems necessary. Only surety companies holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury may be used.
(ii)
Collateral security.
Collateral authorized by law deposited by the claimant in lieu of surety conditioned upon the payment of the full amount of internal revenue taxes determined to be due.
(iii)
Reservation of assets.
Moneys, or if the moneys are insufficient, so much of the other property involved, to be reserved by the Attorney General, as will be sufficient in the judgment of the Attorney General to cover any internal revenue tax liability determined by the Commissioner.
(b)
Vested property subject to debt claims
—(1)
Notice to Commissioner.
With respect to vested property available for the payment of debt claims under section 34 of the Act, and with respect to which debt claims have been filed, prior to the allowance of any such claims the Attorney General shall, in writing, notify the Commissioner of the property involved, the citizenship, residence, business organization, and other necessary information concerning the debtor and the aggregate of debt claims filed in respect thereof.
(2)
Action by Commissioner.
Upon receipt of the notice provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), the Commissioner shall, as soon as practicable and not later than 120 days after receipt of notice, unless the time is extended by the Commissioner after notice to the Attorney General—
(i) Determine the taxes payable by the Attorney General in respect of the debtor, or
(ii) Advise the Attorney General of the provision, if any, to be made by him for payment of taxes in respect of the debtor.
§ 303.1-4
Computation of taxes.
(a)
Detail of employees of the Internal Revenue Service.
The Commissioner will detail for the assistance of the Attorney General such employees of the Internal Revenue Service as may be necessary to make the computations under this part promptly and accurately.
(b)
Relationship of Attorney General and former owner.
In the computation of tax liability under this part, except as otherwise provided in this part, the vesting of property shall not be considered as affecting the ownership thereof; and any act of the Attorney General in respect of such property (including the collection or operation thereof and any investment, sale, or other disposition and any payment or other expenditure) shall be considered as the act of the owner. Nevertheless, except as otherwise provided in the Act or this part, insofar as taxes are incident to vested property during the period of vesting, they shall be payable by the Attorney General, except that to the extent of the value of any of the property returned to the former owner the latter shall be liable for such tax not paid by the Attorney General. While tax incident to nonvested property is collectible out of both vested and nonvested property, the nonvested property will be regarded as the primary source of collection of such tax. In determining the amount of the liability to be paid out of property not vested by the Attorney General a computation shall be made covering the taxpayer's full period of liability, but without regard to the vested property, or the income received by, or the operations of, the Attorney General. The amount so computed shall be first asserted against and collected so far as practicable from the taxpayer or out of his property which is not vested. Such part of the total tax liability as is not paid by the taxpayer or collected out of property not vested shall be asserted against the vested property. See § 303.1-5, relating to payment of taxes, and § 303.1-7, relating to claims for refund or credit.
(c)
Laws applicable to computation.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this part, the computation under this part of any internal revenue tax liability shall be in accordance with the internal revenue laws and regulations applicable thereto, including all amendments of such laws or regulations enacted or promulgated prior to determination of the tax.
(d)
Periods for which computations made.
The amount of income, employment, and excise taxes under the internal revenue laws will be computed for each taxable year or period during all or part of which property is vested prior to the return of the property. In the case of a return of property prior to computation of tax, see § 303.1-3. Where vesting occurs during a taxable year or taxable period, any return filed or computation made covering vested or nonvested property should nevertheless be for the entire year or period. See paragraph (b) of this section. Unless facts are available indicating a liability for taxes for a taxable year or period occurring wholly prior or subsequent to the period of vesting of the property by the Attorney General, the computations under this part, both tentative and final, will be made only in respect of years and periods during all or part of which the property is held by the Attorney General.
(e)
Tentative computation.
In order that the return of property or other appropriate action may not be delayed until the amount of taxes payable is finally computed and paid, a tentative computation of such amount will be made in every case, unless there are circumstances appearing to make such action inappropriate. Such circumstances would include (1) return of the property in accordance with § 303.1-3, (2) notice to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the person to whom the property is returnable or by the Attorney General that such person or the Attorney General, as the case may be, prefers that the return of the property be postponed until the amount of such taxes can be finally computed, or (3) belief on the part of the Commissioner that a final computation will not unduly delay the return of, or other appropriate action with respect to, the property. In making any such tentative computation of income or estate tax, the gross income or the gross estate, as the case may be, as shown by the records of the Attorney General (excluding therefrom items exempt from taxation) shall be considered as the taxable income or taxable estate, respectively, unless a tax return has been filed or facts are available upon which a more accurate computation can be made. In any case in which a duly authorized officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service has otherwise computed the amount of taxes payable in respect of any period, such computation will be accepted as a tentative computation, unless the facts clearly indicate that a more accurate computation can be made.
(f)
Final computation
—(1)
General.
A final computation of the amount of taxes payable by the person to whom property is returnable, or out of property to be returned, will be made as soon as practicable in every case. In any case in which the amount shown by a tentative computation has been paid, refund or credit of any amount paid in excess of the amount properly due will be made in accordance with the final computation, even though a claim therefor has not been filed, if the period of limitation applicable to the filing of such claim has not expired. However, if it is desired to protect the right to any credit or refund determined to be due, a claim for credit or refund should be filed. The sufficiency of any such claim in respect of an amount paid in accordance with a tentative computation under this part will not be questioned solely because facts upon which a more accurate computation could be made are not available or cannot be established at the time such claim is filed. Any such claim in respect of an amount paid in accordance with a final computation must, however, clearly set forth in detail under the penalties of perjury all the facts relied upon in support of the claim and must conform to the regulations applicable to an ordinary claim for refund or credit. See § 301.6402-2 of this chapter and § 303.1-7, relating to claims for refund or credit.
(2)
Information required
—(i)
Income taxes.
The following information submitted under the penalties of perjury
by or for the taxpayer is necessary in each case for a final computation, for each taxable year for which the computation is to be made:
(
a
) All income (other than income received by the Attorney General) from sources within the United States, or if no such income has been received, then a statement to that effect, except that in the case of a citizen or resident of the United States, income from sources without as well as within the United States must be shown.
(
b
) If a return of such income has been made, then the following data in respect of such return:
(
1
) The taxable year for which the return was made and the tax paid;
(
2
) The name of the taxpayer for whom the return was made;
(
3
) The name of the agent or other person (if any) by whom such return was made;
(
4
) The office of the district director in which the return was filed.
(
c
) Such other facts as may be required, from time to time, by the Commissioner.
(ii)
Other taxes.
Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, in order to make a final computation of the amount of any internal revenue tax payable by return in any case, the usual return should be filed, together with the supporting documents required by the regulations pertaining to the tax.
(g)
Tax returns
—(1)
General.
In many cases allowance of deductions and credits is contingent upon the making of a return in accordance with the applicable internal revenue law. The submission of evidence relative to income tax in accordance with subdivisions (
a
) and (
c
) of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section will be considered as the making of the return required by any such law, only (i) for any taxable period, ending on or before December 31, 1946, during all or part of which all or part of the property of the taxpayer was held by the Attorney General, or (ii) for any taxable period ending within one year from the date of the first return to the taxpayer, of any part of the property held by the Attorney General, whichever period ends later. In all other cases a return will be required in accordance with the applicable internal revenue laws and regulations. In the case of returns where property is vested during a taxable year or period, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Estates and trusts.
In the case of estates and trusts the fiduciaries shall file returns, including information returns as required by section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
(3)
Income tax forms to be used.
In the case of taxpayers engaged in trade or business in the United States Forms 1040B and 1120, as may be appropriate, shall be used. Where the taxpayer is not engaged in trade or business in the United States, Form M797 may be used in lieu of Forms 1040NB, 1040NB--a and 1120NB.
§ 303.1-5
Payment of taxes.
(a)
Pursuant to tentative computations.
The amount of taxes shown by a tentative computation shall be paid by the Attorney General or the taxpayer, as the case may be, to the district director as soon as practicable after the tentative computation has been made. It will not be necessary, however, for the payment by the Attorney General to be made prior to the return of property if an amount sufficient to cover all internal revenue taxes is retained from the property by the Attorney General.
(b)
Pursuant to final computations.
Upon a final computation of internal revenue taxes properly payable, the amount thereof remaining unpaid shall be paid by the Attorney General to the district director as soon as practicable after the final computation has been made, or, in case the property has been returned to the former owner, by such owner. If the final computation shows that the full amount of internal revenue taxes properly payable is less than the amount previously paid, the difference shall be credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of these and other applicable regulations. A final computation will not prohibit a subsequent recomputation if it is determined that the amount shown by the final computation is erroneous.
(c)
Deficiency procedure.
The Attorney General shall pay internal revenue taxes without regard to the provisions of law relating to the sending of a deficiency notice by certified or registered mail or to notice and demand.
§ 303.1-6
Interest and penalties.
(a)
Liability for interest and civil penalties.
Under subsection (d) of section 36 of the Trading With the Enemy Act there is no liability for interest or penalty on account of any act or failure of the Attorney General. Such subsection is not applicable to interest or penalties payable in respect of any act or failure during the period prior to the vesting of the property by the Attorney General, or after the return of the property, or during the period during which the property was vested by the Attorney General on account of an act or omission of any person other than the Attorney General.
(b)
Adjustment.
In case of any assessment or collection, or credit or refund, of interest or a civil penalty contrary to the provisions of section 36 (c) or (d), proper adjustment shall be made.
§ 303.1-7
Claims for refund or credit.
(a) Claims for refund or credit must be filed within the period prescribed by section 6511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as modified by section 36(c) of the Trading With the Enemy Act. Any such claim must contain a detailed statement under the penalties of perjury of all the facts relied upon in support of the claim and should be filed with the district director for the district in which the tax was paid. See paragraph (f)(1) of § 303.1-4, relating to final computation.
(b) Any act of the Attorney General for, or on behalf of, a taxpayer in respect of any claim under this part will be considered as the act of such taxpayer, unless such taxpayer notifies the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in writing, by the filing of a claim for refund or credit or otherwise, that he does not ratify such act. See paragraph (b) of § 303.1-4, relating to relationship of Attorney General and former owner.
(c) All refund of taxes paid by the Attorney General shall be made directly to that official.

Definition of Indian tribal government.
(a)
Definition.
A governing body of a tribe, band, pueblo, community, village, or group of native American Indians, or Alaska Natives, qualifies as an Indian tribal government upon determination by the Internal Revenue Service that the governing body exercises governmental functions. Designation of a governing body as an Indian tribal government will be by revenue procedure. If a governing body is not currently designated by the applicable revenue procedure as an Indian tribal government, and such governing body believes that it qualifies for such designation, the governing body may apply for a ruling from Internal Revenue Service. In order to qualify as an Indian tribal government, for purposes of section 7701(a)(40) and this section, such governing body must receive a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. The request for a ruling shall be made in accordance with all applicable procedural rules set forth in the Statement of Procedural Rules (26 CFR part 601) and any applicable revenue procedures relating to the submission of ruling requests. The request shall be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service, Associate Chief Counsel (Technical), Attention: CC:IND:S, room 6545, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20224.

(3) Section 511(a)(2)(B) (relating to the taxation of colleges and universities which are agencies or instrumentalities of governments or their political subdivisions);
(4) Section 37(e)(9)(A) (relating to certain public retirement systems);

(9) Subchapter A of chapter 42 of the Code (relating to private foundations).
(b)
Special rule for excise tax provisions.
An Indian tribal government shall be treated as a State, and a subdivision of an Indian tribal government shall be treated as a political subdivision of a State, for purposes of any exemption from, credit or refund of, or payment with respect to, an excise tax imposed on a transaction under—
(1) Chapter 31 of the Code (relating to tax on special fuels);
(2) Chapter 32 of the Code (relating to manufacturers excise taxes);
(3) Subchapter B of chapter 33 of the Code (relating to communications excise tax); and
(4) Subchapter D of chapter 36 of the Code (relating to tax on use of certain highway vehicles), if, in addition to satisfying all requirements applicable to a similar transaction involving a State (or political subdivision thereof) under the Code, the transaction involves the exercise of an essential governmental function of the Indian tribal government, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)
Special rule for tax-exempt bonds.
An Indian tribal government shall be treated as a State and a subdivision of an Indian tribal government shall be treated as a political subdivision of a State for purposes of any obligation issued by such government or subdivision under section 103 (relating to interest on certain governmental obligations) if such obligation is part of an issue substantially all of the proceeds of which are to be used in the exercise of an essential governmental function, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes of section 7871 and this section, the “substantially all” test is the same as that provided in § 1.103-8(a)(1)(i). An Indian tribal government shall not be treated as a State and a subdivision of an Indian tribal government shall not be treated as a political subdivision of a State, however, for issues of the following private activity bonds—
(1) An industrial development bond (as defined in section 103(b)(2));
(2) An obligation described in section 103(l)(1)(A) (relating to scholarship bonds); or
(3) A mortgage subsidy bond (as defined in section 103A(b)(1), without regard to section 103A(b)(2)).
(d)
Essential governmental function.
For purposes of section 7871 and this section, an essential governmental function of an Indian tribal government (or portion thereof) is a function of a type which is—
(1) Eligible for funding under 25 U.S.C. 13 and the regulations thereunder;
(2) Eligible for grants or contracts under 25 U.S.C. 450 (f), (g), and (h) and the regulations thereunder; or
(3) An essential governmental function under section 115 and the regulations thereunder when conducted by a State or political subdivision thereof.
(e)
Treatment of subdivisions of Indian tribal governments as political subdivisions.
A subdivision of an Indian tribal government shall be treated as a political subdivision of a State for purposes of section 7871 and this section if the Internal Revenue Service determines that the subdivision has been delegated the right to exercise one or more of the substantial governmental functions of the Indian tribal government. Designation of a subdivision of an Indian tribal government as a political subdivision of a State will be by revenue procedure. If a subdivision of an Indian tribal government is not currently designated by the applicable revenue procedure as a political subdivision of a State, and such subdivision believes that it qualifies for such designation, the subdivision may apply for a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. In order to qualify as a political subdivision of a State, for purposes of section 7871 and this section, such subdivision must receive a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. The request for a ruling shall be made in accordance with all applicable procedural rules set forth in the Statement of Procedural Rules (26 CFR part 601) and any applicable revenue procedures relating to submission of ruling requests. The request shall be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service, Associate Chief Counsel (Technical), Attention: CC:IND:S, Room 6545, 1111 Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, D.C. 20224.

§ 400.1-1
Refiling of notice of tax lien.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules with respect to the provisions contained in section 6323(g), relating to the refiling of a notice of lien arising under section 6321. In general, section 6323(g) contains new rules requiring the Internal Revenue Service to refile a notice of lien during the 1-year period ending 30 days after the expiration of the normal 6-year statutory period for collection of an assessed tax liability, and each succeeding period of 6 years, in order to maintain the effectiveness of a notice of lien. These provisions in section 6323 were added by section 101(a) of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1125), effective after November 2, 1966.
(b)
Requirement to refile.
In order to continue the effect of a notice of lien, the notice must be refiled in the place described in paragraph (c) of this section during the required refiling period (described in paragraph (d) of this section). In the event that two or more notices of lien are filed with respect to a particular tax assessment, the failure to comply with the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (d) of this section in respect of one of the notices of lien does not affect the effectiveness of the refiling of the other notice or notices of lien. Thus, except for the filing of a notice of lien required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section relating to a change of residence, the validity of any refiling of a notice of lien is not affected by the refiling or non-refiling of any other notice of lien. The effectiveness of a timely refiled notice of lien relates back to the date on which the notice of lien was effective before the refiling. If the district director fails to refile a notice of lien in the manner described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the notice of lien is not effective, after the expiration of the required refiling period, as against any person without regard to when the interest of the person in the property subject to the lien was acquired. However, the failure of the district director to refile a notice of lien during the required refiling period will not affect the effectiveness of the notice with respect to (1) property which is the subject matter of a suit, to which the United States is a party, commenced prior to the expiration of the required refiling period, or (2) property which has been levied upon by the United States prior to the expiration of the required refiling period. Failure to refile a notice of lien does not affect the existence of the lien. If a notice of lien is not refiled, and if the lien is still in existence, the Internal Revenue Service may nevertheless file a new notice of lien either on the form prescribed for the filing of a notice of lien or on the form prescribed for refiling a notice of lien. This new filing must meet the requirements of section 6323(f) and is effective from the date on which such filing is made. Upon written request of any person who has a proper interest, any district director may issue a certificate of release of lien if notice of the lien has not been refiled within the required refiling period and the entire liability for the tax has been satisfied or has become unenforceable as a matter of law. Such request should be sent to the district director for the internal revenue district shown on the notice of lien. For provisions relating to certificates of release of lien, see section 6325.
(c)
Place for refiling notice of lien
—(1)
In general.
A notice of lien refiled during the required refiling period (described in paragraph (d) of this section) shall be effective only—
(i) If the notice of lien is refiled in the office in which the prior notice of lien (including a refiled notice) was filed under the provisions of section 6323; and
(ii) In any case in which 90 days or more prior to the date the refiling of the notice of lien under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is completed, the Internal Revenue Service receives written information (in the manner described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b)) concerning a change in the taxpayer's residence, if a notice of such lien is also filed in accordance with section 6323f)(1)(A)(ii) in the State in which such new residence is located (or, if such new residence is located without the United States, in the District of Columbia). If on or before such 90th day more than one written notice is received concerning a change in the taxpayer's residence, a notice of lien is required by this subdivision to be filed only with respect to the residence shown on the written notice received on the most recent date. This subdivision is applicable regardless of whether the taxpayer resides at the new residence on the date the refiling of notice of lien under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is completed.
(2)
Notice of change of taxpayer's residence
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, for purposes of this section, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence will be effective only if it is received, in writing, by the Internal Revenue Service from the taxpayer or his representative, relates to an unpaid tax liability of the taxpayer, and states the taxpayer's name and address of his new residence. Although it is not necessary
that a written notice contain the taxpayer's identifying number authorized by section 6109, it is preferable that it include such number. For purposes of this subdivision, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence shown on a return or an amended return (including a return of the same tax) will not be effective to notify the Internal Revenue Service.
(ii)
By return or amended return.
For purposes of this section, in the case of a notice of lien which relates to an assessment of tax made after December 31, 1966, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence will also be effective if it is contained in a return or amended return of the same type of tax filed with the Internal Revenue Service by the taxpayer which on its face indicates that there is a change in the taxpayer's address and correctly states the taxpayer's name, address of his new residence, and his identifying number required by section 6109.
(iii)
Other rules applicable.
Other than the means specified in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, no communication (either written or oral) to the Internal Revenue Service will be considered effective as notice of a change of a taxpayer's residence under this section, whether or not the Service has actual notice of the taxpayer's residence. For the purpose of determining the date on which a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence is received under this section, the notice shall be treated as received on the date it is actually received by the Internal Revenue Service without reference to the provisions of section 7502.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of M State and owns real property in N State. Notices of lien are properly filed in M and N States. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in M State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of lien with the appropriate office in M State but is not required to refile the notice of lien with the appropriate office in N State. Similarly, in order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in N State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of lien with the appropriate office in N State but is not required to refile the notice of lien with the appropriate office in M State.

# Example 2.
B, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of M State. Notice of lien is properly filed in that State. One year before the required refiling period, B establishes his residence in N State, and B immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in M State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, notices of lien with (i) the appropriate office in M State, and (ii) the appropriate office in N State because B properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to N State more than 89 days prior to the date refiling of the notice of lien in M State is completed. If B did not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to N State in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service would not be required to file a notice of lien in N State, even if the Internal Revenue Service had actual notice of B's change in residence to N State. In this latter case, in order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in M State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of lien only with the appropriate office in M State.

# Example 3.
C, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of O State. Notice of lien is properly filed in that State. Four years before the required refiling period, C establishes his residence in P State, and C immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Three years before the required refiling period, C establishes his residence in R State, and again C immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in O State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, notices of lien with (i) the appropriate office in O State, and (ii) the appropriate office in R State since the notice received by the Service of C's change in residence to R State was the most recent notice received more than 89 days prior to the date refiling in O State is completed. The notice of lien is not required to be filed in P State, even though C properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P State, because such notice is not the most recent one received.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example 3, except that C does not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to R State in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In
order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in O State, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of lien with (i) the appropriate office in O State, and (ii) the appropriate office in P State because C properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P State, even though C is not a resident of P State on the date refiling of the notice of lien in O State is completed. The Internal Revenue Service is not required to file a notice of lien in R State because C did not properly notify the Service of his change in residence to R State.

# Example 5.
D, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of M State and owns real property in N and O States. The Internal Revenue Service properly files notices of lien in M, N, and O States. Five years and 6 months after the date of the assessment shown on the notice of lien, D establishes his residence in P State, and at that time the Internal Revenue Service received from D a notification of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. On a date which is 5 years and 7 months after the date of the assessment shown on the notice of lien, the Internal Revenue Service properly refiles notices of lien in M, N, and O States which refilings continue the effect of each of the notices of lien. The Internal Revenue Service is not required to file a notice of lien in P State because D did not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change of residence to P State more than 89 days prior to the date each of the refilings in M, N, and O States was completed.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in example 5 except that the refiling of the notice of lien in O State occurs 100 days after D notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P State in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in O State, in addition to refiling the notice of lien in O State, the Internal Revenue Service must also file, during the required refiling period, a notice of lien in P State because D properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change of residence to P State more than 89 days prior to the date the refiling in O State was completed. However, in order to maintain the effect of the refilings in M and N States, the Internal Revenue Service is not required to file, during the required refiling period, the notice of lien in P State since D did not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P State more than 89 days prior to the date the refilings in M and N States were completed.

# Example 7.
E, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of T State. Because T State has not designated one office in the case of personal property for filing notices of lien in accordance with the provisions of section 6323(f)(1)(A)(ii), the Internal Revenue Service properly files a notice of lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States district court. However, solely as a matter of convenience for those who may have occasion to search for notices of lien, and not as a matter of legal effectiveness, the Internal Revenue Service also files notice of lien with the recorder of deeds of the county in T State where E resides. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service sent a copy of the notice of lien to the X Life Insurance Company to give the Company actual notice of the notice of lien. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of lien with the clerk of the appropriate U.S. district court. It is not necessary in order to continue the effect of the notice of the lien to refile the notice of lien with the recorder of deeds of the county where E resides because the refiling of the notice of lien with the recorder of deeds does not constitute a proper filing for the purposes of section 6323(f). In addition, it is not necessary to continue the effect of the notice of lien under this section to send a copy of the notice of lien to the X Life Insurance Company because the sending of a notice of lien to an insurance company does not constitute a filing for the purposes of section 6323 and, thus, a refiling with an insurance company is not required under this section.
(d)
Required refiling period
—(1)
In general.
For the purpose of this section, except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (d), the term “required refiling period” means—
(i) The 1-year period ending 30 days after the expiration of 6 years after the date of the assessment of the tax, and
(ii) The 1-year period ending with the expiration of 6 years after the close of the preceding required refiling period for such notice of lien.
(2)
Tax assessments made before January 1, 1962.
If the assessment of the tax is made before January 1, 1962, the first required refiling period shall be the calendar year 1967. Thus, to maintain the effectiveness of any notice of lien on file which relates to a lien which arose before January 1, 1962, the Internal Revenue Service will refile the notice of lien during the calendar year 1967. The second required refiling period for any such notice of lien is the calendar year 1973.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On March 1, 1963, an assessment of tax is made against B, a delinquent taxpayer, and a lien for the amount of the assessment arises on that date. On July 1, 1963, a notice of lien is properly filed. The notice of lien filed on July 1, 1963, is effective up to and including March 31, 1969. The first required refiling period for the notice of lien begins on April 1, 1968, and ends on March 31, 1969. A refiling of the notice of lien during that period will extend the effectiveness of the notice of lien filed on July 1, 1963, up to and including March 31, 1975. The second required refiling period for the notice of lien begins on April 1, 1974, and ends on March 31, 1975.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that the Internal Revenue Service fails to refile a notice of lien during the first required refiling period (Apr. 1, 1968, through Mar. 31, 1969). However, a notice of lien which meets the requirements of section 6323(f) is filed on June 2, 1971. Because of this filing, the notice of lien filed on June 2, 1971, is effective as of June 2, 1971. That notice must itself be refiled during the 1-year period ending on March 31, 1975, if it is to continue in effect after March 31, 1975. As in example 1, the second required refiling period for the notice of lien begins on April 1, 1974, and ends on March 31, 1975.

# Example 3.
On April 1, 1960, an assessment of tax is made against B, a delinquent taxpayer, and a tax lien for the amount of the assessment arises on that date. On June 1, 1962, a notice of lien is properly filed. Because the assessment of tax was made before January 1, 1962, the notice of lien filed on June 1, 1962, is effective up to and including December 31, 1967. The first required refiling period for the notice of lien is the calendar year 1967. A refiling of the notice of lien during 1967 will extend the effectiveness of the notice of lien filed on June 1, 1962, up to and including December 31, 1973. The second required refiling period for the notice of lien is the calendar year 1973.
[T.D. 6932, 32 FR 14835, Oct. 18, 1967]
§ 400.2-1
Discharge of property by substitution of proceeds of sale; subordination of lien.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules under the provisions in section 6325(b)(3) which relate to the discharge of property from a tax lien by substitution therefor of a lien on the proceeds of the sale of the property, and in section 6325(d) which relate to the subordination of a tax lien. Section 6325 was amended by section 103(a) of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1133), effective after November 2, 1966.
(b)
Discharge of property by substitution of proceeds of sale.
Pursuant to section 6325(b)(3), a district director may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to any lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Code if part of the property is sold and, pursuant to a written agreement with the district director, the proceeds of the sale are held, as a fund subject to the lien of the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as the liens and claims had with respect to the discharged property. In order for the provisions of this paragraph to apply, the sale must divest the taxpayer of all right, title, and interest in the property sought to be discharged. Any person desiring a certificate of discharge under this paragraph shall submit an application in writing to the district director responsible for the collection of the tax. The application shall contain such information as the district director may require. Any reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the property and the administration of the sale proceeds shall be paid by the applicant or from the proceeds of the sale before satisfaction of any claims and liens.
(c)
Subordination of lien
—(1)
By payment of the amount of subordination.
Pursuant to section 6325(d)(1), a district director may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of subordination of any lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Code upon any part of the property subject to the lien if there is paid over to the district director an amount equal to the amount of the lien or interest to which the certificate subordinates the lien of the United States. Under this provision, the tax lien may be subordinated to another lien or interest on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For example, if a notice of a Federal tax lien is filed and a delinquent taxpayer secures a mortgage on a part of the property subject to the tax lien and pays over the amount of the principal of the debt secured by the mortgage to a district director after an application for a certificate of subordination is approved, the district director will issue a certificate of subordination. This certificate will have the effect of subordinating the tax lien to the mortgage.
(2)
To facilitate tax collection
—(i)
In general.
Pursuant to section 6325(d)(2), a district director may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of subordination of any lien imposed under chapter 64 of the Code upon any part of the property subject to the lien if the district director believes that the subordination of the lien will ultimately result in an increase in the amount realizable by the United States from the property subject to the lien and will facilitate the ultimate collection of the tax liability.
(ii)
Example.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A, a farmer, needs money in order to harvest his crop. However, a Federal tax lien, notice of which has been filed, is outstanding with respect to A's property. B, a lending institution is willing to make the necessary loan if the loan is secured by a first mortgage on the farm which is prior to the Federal tax lien. Upon examination, the district director believes that ultimately the amount realizable from A's property will be increased and the collection of the tax liability will be facilitated by the availability of cash when the crop is harvested and sold. In this case, the district director may, in his discretion, subordinate the tax lien on the farm to the mortgage securing the crop harvesting loan.
(3)
Application for certificate of subordination.
Any person desiring a certificate of subordination under this paragraph shall submit an application in writing to the district director responsible for the collection of the tax. The application shall contain such information as the district director may require.
[T.D. 6944, 33 FR 732, Jan. 20, 1968]
§ 400.4-1
Notice required with respect to a nonjudicial sale.
(a)
Scope and application of this section
—(1)
In general.
Section 109 of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1141) amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 by adding a new section 7425, relating to the discharge of liens. A tax lien of the United States, or a title derived from the enforcement of a tax lien of the United States, may be discharged or divested under local law only in the manner prescribed in section 2410 of title 28 of the United States Code or section 7425 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 7425(a) contains provisions relating to the discharge of a lien or a title derived from the enforcement of a lien in the judicial proceedings described in subsection (a) of section 2410 of title 28 of the United States Code. These judicial proceedings are plenary in nature and proceed on formal pleadings. Section 7425(b) contains provisions relating to the discharge of a lien or a title derived from the enforcement of a lien in the event of a nonjudicial sale with respect to the property involved. Section 7425(c) contains special rules relating to the notice of sale requirements contained in section 7425(b). Paragraph (b) of this section of the regulations contains rules with respect to the nonjudicial sales described in section 7425(b). Paragraph (c) of this section of the regulations contains rules with respect to the notice of sale provisions of section 7425(c)(1). Paragraph (d) of this section of the regulations contains rules relating to the consent to sale provisions of section 7425(c)(2). Paragraph (e) of this section of the regulations contains rules relating to the sale of perishable goods provisions of section 7425(c)(3). Paragraph (f) of this section of the regulations contains the requirements with respect to the contents of a notice of sale.
(2)
Effective date of this section.
The provisions of section 7425, as added by the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, are effective with respect to sales occurring after November 2, 1966. The notice of sale provisions of section 7425(c) (1) or (3) do not apply to sales occurring after November 2, 1966, if the seller of the property performed an act before November 3, 1966, which act at the time of performance was required and effective under local law with respect to the sale. An example of such an act is publication of a notice of the sale in a local newspaper before November 3, 1966, if local law requires such publication before a sale and the publication is effective under local law. Accordingly, in such a case, it is not necessary to notify the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the provisions of section 7425(c) (1) or (3). With respect to a notice of sale required under section 7425(c) (1) or (3)—
(i) Any notice of sale given to an office of the Internal Revenue Service or the Treasury Department during the period November 3, 1966, through December 21, 1966, shall be considered as adequate;
(ii) Any notice of sale given during the period December 22, 1966, through January 31, 1968, which complies with provisions of either
(
a
) Revenue Procedure 67-25, 1967-20 I.R.B. 42 (based on Technical Information Release 873, dated December 22, 1966), or
(
b
) This section
shall be considered as adequate; and
(iii) Any notice of sale given after January 31, 1968, which complies with the provisions of this section shall be considered as adequate.
(b)
Nonjudicial sale
—(1)
In general.
Section 7425(b) contains provisions with respect to the effect on the interest of the United States in property in which the United States has or claims a lien, or a title derived from the enforcement of a lien, when a sale is made pursuant to—
(i) An instrument creating a lien on the property sold,
(ii) A confession of judgment on the obligation secured by an instrument creating a lien on the property sold, or
(iii) A statutory lien on the property sold.
For purposes of this section, such a sale is referred to as a “nonjudicial sale.” The term “nonjudicial sale” includes, but is not limited to, the divestment of the taxpayer's title to property which occurs by operation of law, as well as those which result from a public or private sale. Under section 7425(b)(1), if a notice of lien is filed in accordance with section 6323(f) or (g), or the title derived from the enforcement of a lien is recorded as provided by local law, more than 30 days before the date of sale, and the appropriate district director is not given notice of the sale (in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section), the sale shall be made subject to and without disturbing the lien or title of the United States. Under section 7425(b)(2)(C), in any case in which notice of the sale is given to the district director not less than 25 days prior to the date of sale (in the manner prescribed in section 7425(c)(1)), the sale shall have the same effect with respect to the discharge or divestment of the lien or title as may be provided by local law with respect to other junior liens. A nonjudicial sale pursuant to a lien which is junior to a tax lien does not divest the tax lien, even though notice of the nonjudicial sale is given to the appropriate district director. However, under the provisions of section 6325(b), § 301.6325-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration), and § 400.2-1, a district director may discharge the property from a tax lien, including a tax lien which is senior to another lien upon the property. In the case of a nonjudicial sale subject to the provisions of section 7425(b), in order to compute any period of time determined with reference to the date of sale, the date of sale shall be determined in accordance with the following rules:
(iv) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting directly from a public sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date the public sale is held, regardless of the date under local law on which junior liens on the property are divested or the title to the property is transferred,
(v) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting directly from a private sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date title to the property is transferred, regardless of the date junior liens on the property are divested under local law, and
(vi) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property not resulting directly from a public or private sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date on which junior liens on the property are divested under local law.
For provisions relating to the right of redemption of the United States, see section 7425(d) and § 400.5-1.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (b), may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Under the law of M State upon entry of judgment, the judgment creditor obtains a statutory lien upon the real property of the judgment debtor, and certain procedures are provided by which the judgment creditor may execute by public sale upon
such real property. These procedures provide, among other things, for notification by personal service or registered or certified mail to other lien creditors, if any, and publication of a notice of the sale in a local newspaper. After the expiration of a prescribed period of time after such notification and publication, the sheriff of the county where the real property is located may sell the property at public sale. After payment of the amount bid at the public sale, the sheriff issues to the purchaser a deed to the real property, and the interests of junior lienors in the property are divested. For purposes of this section, such an execution sale is a nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) since the sale is made pursuant to a statutory lien on the property sold. The date of sale, for purposes of computing a period of time determined with reference to the date of sale, is the date on which the public sale is held, since junior liens on the real property are divested directly as a result of the public sale. This result obtains even though the junior liens are legally divested on a later date when the sheriff issues the deed.

# Example 2.
Under the law of N State, mortgages on real property may contain a power of sale which authorizes the mortgagee, upon breach by the mortgagor of one of the conditions of the mortgage, to have the mortgaged property sold at public sale. This public sale must be preceded by notice by advertisement in a local newspaper, and the time, place, description of the property, and other terms of the sale must be specified. The purchaser at such a public sale obtains a title to the real property which is not subject to a right of redemption by the mortgagor and which divests the interests of the junior lienors in the property. For purposes of this section, a sale pursuant to such a power of sale is a nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) since the sale is made pursuant to the mortgage instrument which created a lien on the property sold. The date of the sale, for purposes of computing a period of time determined with reference to the date of sale, is the date of the public sale since junior liens on the property are divested directly as a result of the public sale.

# Example 3.
Under the law of O State, upon breach by a mortgagor of real property of one of the conditions of the mortgage, the mortgagee may foreclose the mortgage by securing possession of the property by one of several procedures provided by statute. These procedures are generally referred to as “strict foreclosure.” In order for a foreclosure to be effective under these procedures, a certificate attesting the fact of entry must be recorded with the proper registrar of deeds within 30 days after the mortgagee enters the property. During the 1-year period following the date on which the certificate of entry is recorded, the mortgagor or a junior lienor may redeem the property by paying the mortgagee the amount of the mortgage obligation. If, during such 1-year period the property is not redeemed and the mortgagee's possession is continued, the interests of the mortgagor and the junior lienors in the property are divested. For purposes of this section, such a foreclosure procedure is a nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) since it results in the divestment of the mortgagor's interest in the property by operation of law pursuant to the mortgage which created a lien on the property. In addition, since there is no public or private sale which directly results in the divestment of junior liens on the property, the date of sale, for purposes of computing a period of time determined with reference to the date of sale, is the date on which the 1-year period following the recording of the certificate of entry expires.

# Example 4.
The law of P State contains a procedure which permits a county to collect a delinquent tax assessment with respect to real property by the means of a tax sale of the property. First, a notice of a public auction with respect to the tax assessment on the real property is published in a local newspaper. At the public auction, the purchaser, upon payment of the delinquent taxes and interest, obtains from the county tax collector a tax certificate with respect to the real property. Since the obtaining of this tax certificate does not directly result in the divestment of either the owner's title or junior liens with respect to the property, the public auction is not a nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b). At any time before a tax deed with respect to the property is issued by the clerk of the county court, the owner or any holder of a lien or other interest with respect to the property may obtain the tax certificate by paying the holder of the tax certificate the amount of the taxes, interest, and costs. After a date which is two years after the date on which the tax assessment became delinquent, the holder of the tax certificate may request the clerk of the county court to have the property advertised for sale. After advertisement of the sale, the clerk of the county court conducts a public sale of the real property and the purchaser obtains a tax deed. The interests of all junior lienors in the property are divested and the property is not subject to a right of redemption under the law of P State. For purposes of this section, this public sale is considered to be a nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) since the sale is made pursuant to a statutory lien on the property sold. The date of the sale, for purposes of computing a period of time determined with reference to the date of sale, is the date on which the public sale is held at which the purchaser obtains a tax deed as this sale directly results in the divestment of junior liens on the property.
(c)
Notice of sale requirements
—(1)
In general.
Except in the case of the sale of perishable goods described in paragraph (e) of this section, a notice (as described in paragraph (f) of this section) of a nonjudicial sale shall be given, in writing by registered or certified mail or by personal service, not less than 25 days prior to the date of sale (determined under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) (iv), (v), and (vi) of this section), to the district director (marked for the attention of the chief, special procedures section) for the internal revenue district in which the sale is to be conducted. Thus, under this section, a notice of sale is not effective if it is given to a district director other than the district director for the internal revenue district in which the sale is to be conducted. The provisions of sections 7502 (relating to timely mailing treated as timely filing) and 7503 (relating to time for performance of acts where last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday) apply in the case of notices required to be made under this section.
(2)
Postponement of scheduled sale—
(i)
Where notice of sale is given.
In the event that notice of a sale is given in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (c), with respect to a scheduled sale which is postponed to a later time or date, the seller of the property is required to give notice of the postponement to the district director in the same manner as is required under local law with respect to other secured creditors. For example, assume that in M State local law requires that in the event of a postponement of a scheduled foreclosure sale of real property, an oral announcement of the postponement at the place and time of the scheduled sale constitutes sufficient notice to secured creditors of the postponement. Accordingly, if at the place and time of a scheduled sale in M State an oral announcement of the postponement is made, the Internal Revenue Service is considered to have notice of the postponement for the purpose of this subparagraph.
(ii)
Where notice of sale is not given.
In the event that—
(
a
) Notice of a nonjudicial sale would not be required under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (c), if the sale were held on the originally scheduled date,
(
b
) Because of a postponement of the scheduled sale, more than 30 days elapse between the originally scheduled date of the sale and the date of the sale, and
(
c
) A notice of lien with respect to the property to be sold is filed more than 30 days before the date of the sale,
notice of the sale is required to be given to the district director in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (c). In any case in which notice of sale is required to be given with respect to a scheduled sale, and notice of the sale is not given, any postponement of the scheduled sale does not affect the rights of the United States under section 7425(b).
(iii)
Examples.
The provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A nonjudicial sale of Blackacre, belonging to A, a delinquent taxpayer, is scheduled for December 2, 1968. As no notice of lien is filed applicable to Blackacre more than 30 days before December 2, 1968, no notice of sale is given to the district director. On December 2, 1968, the sale of Blackacre is postponed until January 15, 1969. A notice of lien with respect to Blackacre is properly filed on January 2, 1969. The sale of Blackacre is held on January 15, 1969. Even though more than 30 days elapsed between the originally scheduled date of the sale (Dec. 2, 1968) and the date of the sale (Jan. 15, 1969), no notice of sale is required to be given to the district director since the notice of lien was not filed more than 30 days before the date of the sale.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the notice of lien is properly filed on November 29, 1968. Since more than 30 days elapsed between the originally scheduled date of the sale and the date of the sale, and the notice of lien is filed (on Nov. 29, 1968) more than 30 days before the date of the sale (Jan. 15, 1969), notice of the sale, in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, is required to be given to the district director.

# Example 3.
A nonjudicial sale of Whiteacre, belonging to B, a delinquent taxpayer, is scheduled for December 2, 1968. A notice of lien applicable to Whiteacre is filed on November 12, 1968. As the notice of lien was not filed more than 30 days before December 2, 1968, no notice of sale is given to the district director. On December 2, 1968, the sale of Whiteacre is postponed until December 20,
1968. The sale of Whiteacre is held on December 20, 1968. Even though more than 30 days elapsed between the date notice of lien was filed (Nov. 12, 1968) and the date of the sale (Dec. 20, 1968), no notice of sale is required to be given to the district director since not more than 30 days elapsed between the date of the originally scheduled sale (Dec. 2, 1968) and the date the sale was actually held (Dec. 20, 1968).
(d)
Consent to sale
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding the notice of sale provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, a nonjudicial sale of property shall discharge or divest the property of the lien or title of the United States if the district director for the internal revenue district in which the sale occurs consents to the sale of the property free of the lien or title. Pursuant to section 7425(c)(2), where adequate protection is afforded the lien or title of the United States, a district director may, in his discretion, consent with respect to the sale of property in appropriate cases. Such consent shall be effective only if given in writing and shall be subject to such limitations and conditions as the district director may require. However, a district director may not consent to a sale of property under this section after the date of sale, as determined under paragraph (b)(1) (iv), (v), and (vi) of this section. For provisions relating to the authority of the district director to discharge property subject to a tax lien in the case where the proceeds of the sale are held as a fund subject to the liens and claims of the United States, see section 6325(b)(3) and § 400.2-1.
(2)
Application for consent.
Any person desiring a district director's consent to sell property free of a tax lien or a title derived from the enforcement of a tax lien of the United States in the property shall submit to the district director for the internal revenue district in which the sale is to occur a written application in triplicate, declaring it is made under penalties of perjury, requesting that such consent be given. The application shall contain the information required in the case of a notice of sale, as set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and, in addition, shall contain a statement of the reasons why the consent is desired.
(e)
Sale of perishable goods
—(1)
In general.
A notice (as described in paragraph (f) of this section) of a nonjudicial sale of perishable goods (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (e)) shall be given in writing, by registered or certified mail or delivered by personal service, at any time before the sale to the district director (marked for the attention of the chief, special procedures section) for the internal revenue district in which the sale is to be conducted. If a notice of a nonjudicial sale is timely given in the manner described in this paragraph, the nonjudicial sale shall discharge or divest the tax lien, or a title derived from the enforcement of a tax lien, of the United States in the property. The provisions of sections 7502 (relating to timely mailing treated as timely filing) and 7503 (relating to time for performance of acts where last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday) apply in the case of notices required to be made under this paragraph. For example, where the sale of perishable goods is scheduled for 1 p.m. on November 1, 1968, and the notice is mailed by certified mail to the district director at 10 a.m. on November 1, 1968, the notice shall be considered as timely given for purposes of this paragraph. The seller of the perishable goods shall hold the proceeds (exclusive of costs) of the sale as a fund, for not less than 30 days after the date of the sale, subject to the liens and claims of the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as the liens and claims of the United States had with respect to the property sold. If the seller fails to hold the proceeds of the sale in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the seller shall be personally liable to the United States for an amount equal to the value of the interest of the United States in the fund. However, even if the proceeds of the sale are not so held by the seller, but all the other provisions of this paragraph are satisfied, the buyer of the property at the sale takes the property free of the liens and claims of the United States. In the event of a postponement of the scheduled sale of perishable goods, the seller is not required to notify the district director of the postponement. For provisions relating to the authority of the district director to discharge property subject to a tax
lien in the case where the proceeds of the sale are held as a fund subject to the liens and claims of the United States, see section 6325(b)(3) and § 400.2-1.
(2)
Definition of perishable goods.
For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “perishable goods” means any personal property which, in the reasonable view of the person selling the property, is liable to perish or become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping, or cannot be kept without great expense.
(f)
Content of notice of sale
—(1)
In general.
With respect to a notice of sale described in paragraph (c) or (e) of this section, the notice will be considered adequate if it contains the information described in subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this subparagraph.
(i) The name and address of the person submitting the notice of sale.
(ii) A copy of each Notice of Federal Tax Lien (Form 668) affecting the property to be sold, or the following information as shown on each such Notice of Federal Tax Lien:
(
a
) The internal revenue district named thereon,
(
b
) The name and address of the taxpayer, and
(
c
) The date and place of filing of the notice.
(iii) With respect to the property to be sold, the following information:
(
a
) A detailed description, including location, of the property affected by the notice (in the case of real property, the street address, city, and State and the legal description contained in the title or deed to the property and, if available, a copy of the abstract of title);
(
b
) The date, time, place, and terms of the proposed sale of the property; and
(
c
) In the case of a sale of perishable property described in paragraph (e) of this section, a statement of the reasons why the property is believed to be perishable.
(iv) The approximate amount of the principal obligation, including interest, secured by the lien sought to be enforced and a description of the other expenses (such as legal expenses, selling costs, etc.) which may be charged against the sale proceeds.
(2)
Inadequate notice.
Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, a notice of sale described in paragraph (c) of this section which does not contain the information described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (f), will not be considered adequate by a district director. If a district director determines that the notice is inadequate, he will give written notification of the items of information which are inadequate to the person who submitted the notice. In such event a notice complying with the provisions of this section (including the requirement that the notice be given 25 days prior to the sale in the case of a notice described in paragraph (c) of this section) must be given. However, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, in such a case the district director may, in his discretion, consent to the sale of the property free of the lien or title of the United States even though notice of the sale is not given 25 days prior to the sale. In any case in which the person who submitted a timely notice does not receive, more than 5 days prior to the date of the sale, written notification from the district director that the notice is inadequate, the notice shall be considered adequate for the purposes of this section.
(3)
Acknowledgment of notice.
If a notice of sale described in paragraph (c) or (e) of this section is submitted in duplicate to the district director with a written request that receipt of the notice be acknowledged and returned to the person giving the notice, this request will be honored by the district director. The acknowledgment by the district director will indicate the date and time of the receipt of the notice.
(4)
Disclosure of adequacy of notice.
The district director for the internal revenue district in which the sale was held is authorized to disclose, to any person who has a proper interest, whether an adequate notice of sale was given under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (f). Any person desiring this information should submit to the district director a written request which clearly describes the property sold, identifies the applicable notice of lien,
gives the reasons for requesting the information, and states the name and address of the person making the request.

§ 400.5-1
Redemption by United States.
(a)
Scope.
The purpose of this section is to prescribe rules with respect to the provisions contained in section 7425(d), relating to redemption of real property by the United States. Section 109 of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1141) amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 by adding a new section 7425, relating to the discharge of tax liens, effective after November 2, 1966.
(b)
Right to redeem
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a nonjudicial sale of real property to satisfy a lien prior to the tax lien, the district director may redeem the property within the redemption period (as described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b)). The right of redemption of the United States exists under section 7425(d) even though the district director has consented to the sale under section 7425(c)(2) and paragraph (d) of § 400.4-1. For purposes of this section, the term “nonjudicial sale” shall have the same meaning as when used in paragraph (b)(1) of § 400.4-1.
(2)
Redemption period.
For purposes of this section, the redemption period shall be—
(i) The period beginning with the date of the sale (as determined under paragraph (b)(1)(iv), (v), and (vi) of § 400.4-1) and ending with the 120th day after such date, or
(ii) The period for redemption of real property allowable, with resepct to other secured creditors, under local law of the place where the real property is located,whichever is longer.
(3)
Limitations.
In the event a sale does not ultimately discharge the property from the tax lien (whether by reason of local law or the provisions of section 7425(b)), the provisions of this section do not apply since the tax lien will continue to attach to the property after the sale. In a case in which the Internal Revenue Service is not entitled to a notice of sale under section 7425(b) and § 400.4-1, the United States does not have a right of redemption under section 7425(d). However, in such a case, if a tax lien has attached to the property at the time of sale, the United States has the same right of redemption, if any, which is afforded to any secured creditor under the local law of the place in which the property is situated.
(c)
Amount to be paid
—(1)
In general.
In any case in which a district director exercises the right to redeem real property, the amount to be paid is the sum of the following amounts—
(i) The actual amount paid for the property being redeemed (which, in the case of a purchaser who is the holder of the lien being foreclosed, shall include the amount of the obligation secured by such lien to the extent legally satisfied by reason of the sale);
(ii) Interest on the amount paid (described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) at the sale by the purchaser of the real property computed at the rate of 6 percent per annum for the period from the date of the sale (as determined under paragraphs (b)(1)(iv), (v), and (vi) of § 400.4-1) to the date of redemption; and
(iii) The amount, if any, equal to the excess of (
a
) the expenses necessarily incurred in connection with such property by the purchaser, over (
b
) the income from such property realized by the purchaser plus a reasonable rental value of such property (to the extent the property is used by or with the consent of the purchaser, or is rented at less than its reasonable rental value).
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph (b), may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a delinquent taxpayer, owns Blackacre located in X State upon which B holds a mortgage. After the mortgage is properly recorded, a notice of tax lien is filed which is applicable to Blackacre. Subsequently, A defaults on the mortgage and B forecloses on the mortgage which has an outstanding obligation in the amount of $100,000. At the foreclosure sale, B bids $50,000 and obtains title to Blackacre as a result of the sale. At the time of the foreclosure sale, Blackacre has a fair market value of $75,000. Under the laws of X State, the mortgage obligation is fully satisfied as a result of the foreclosure sale and the mortgagee cannot obtain a deficiency judgment. Under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, the district director must pay $100,000 in order to redeem Blackacre.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that under the laws of X State, the fair market value of the property foreclosed is the amount of the obligation legally satisfied as a result of the foreclosure sale, and in a case in which the amount of the obligation exceeds the amount of the fair market value of the property, the mortgagee has the right to a judgment for the deficiency computed as the difference between the obligation and the fair market value of the property. In such a case the district director must, under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, pay $75,000 in order to redeem Blackacre, whether or not B seeks a judgment for the deficiency.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that under the laws of X State, the amount bid is the amount of the obligation legally satisfied as a result of the foreclosure sale, and in the case in which the amount of the obligation exceeds the amount bid, the mortgagee has the right to a judgment for the deficiency computed as the difference between the amount of the obligation and the amount bid. In such a case, the district director must under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, pay $50,000 in order to redeem Blackacre, whether or not B seeks a judgment for the deficiency.
(d)
Certificate of redemption
—(1)
In general.
If a district director exercises the right of redemption of the United States described in paragraph (b) of this section, he shall apply to the officer designated by local law, if any, for the documents necessary to evidence the fact of redemption and to record title to the redeemed property in the name of the United States. If no such officer has been designated by local law or if the officer designated by local law fails to issue the necessary documents, the district director is authorized to issue a certificate of redemption for the property redeemed by the United States.
(2)
Filing.
The district director shall, without delay, cause either the documents issued by the local officer or the certificate of redemption executed by the district director, described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (d), to be duly recorded in the proper registry of deeds. If a certificate of redemption is issued by the district director and if the State in which the real property redeemed by the United States is situated has not by law designated an office in which the certificate of redemption may be recorded, the district director shall file the certificate of redemption in the office of the clerk of the U.S. district court for the judicial district in which the redeemed property is situated.
(3)
Effect of certificate of redemption.
A certificate of redemption executed pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (d), shall constitute prima facie evidence of the regularity of the redemption. When a certificate of redemption is recorded, it shall transfer to the United States all the rights, title, and interest in and to the redeemed property acquired by the person from whom the district director redeemed the property by virtue of the sale of the property.
(4)
Application for release of right of redemption.
Upon application of a party with a proper interest in the real property sold in a nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) and paragraph (b) of § 400.4-1, which real property is subject to the right of redemption of the United States described in this section, the district director may, in his discretion, release the right of redemption with respect to the property. The application for the release shall be submitted in writing to a district director and shall contain such information as the district director may require. If the district director determines that the right of redemption of the United States is without value, no amount shall be required to be paid with respect to the release of the right of redemption.

§ 403.30
Special disposition of perishable goods.
The proceedings to enforce forfeiture of perishable goods shall, as is the case with proceedings to enforce forfeiture of nonperishable goods, be in the nature of proceedings in rem in the United States District Court for the district wherein such seizure is made. When any seized property is liable to perish or become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping, or when it cannot be kept without great expense, the Commissioner or his delegate shall advise the owner, when known, of the seizure thereof. The owner of the seized property may apply to the District Director of the internal revenue district in which the property was seized to examine the property at any time prior to referral of the property to the U.S. Marshal for disposition. If, in the opinion of the Commissioner or his delegate it is necessary that such property be sold to prevent waste or expense, the Commissioner or his delegate shall cause the property to be appraised in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 403.26(a)(2). The owner shall have such property returned to him upon giving a corporate surety bond pursuant to § 403.28 in an amount equal to the appraised value of the property, to abide the final order, decree, or judgment of the court having cognizance of the case. The bond shall be conditioned to pay the amount of the appraised value to the Commissioner or his delegate, the U.S. Marshal, or otherwise, as may be ordered and directed by the court. The bond shall be filed by the Commissioner or his delegate with the U.S. Attorney for the district in which the proceedings may be commenced. If the owner of such property neglects or refuses to give such bond within a reasonable time considering the condition of the property, the Commissioner or his delegate shall request the U.S. Marshal to proceed to sell the property at public sale as soon as practicable and to pay the proceeds of sale, less reasonable costs of the seizure and sale, to the court to abide its final order, decree, or judgment.

(Sec. 613, 46 Stat. 756, as amended, sec. 618, 46 Stat. 757, as amended, sec. 7327, 68A Stat. 871; (19 U.S.C. 1613, 1618, 26 U.S.C. 7327))
§ 403.36
Interest claimed.
Any person claiming an interest in property seized by an officer of the Internal Revenue Service as subject to administrative forfeiture under this part may file a petition addressed to the District Director of the internal revenue district in which the property was seized for remission or mitigation of the forfeiture of such property.
§ 403.37
Form of the petition.
There is no standardized form provided or required by the Department of the Treasury for use in filing a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture. However, the petition should be typewritten on legal size paper; and must be executed under oath, prepared in triplicate, and addressed to the District Director of the internal revenue district in which the property was seized. All copies of original documents submitted as exhibits in support of allegations of the petition should be certified as true and accurate copies of originals. Each copy of the petition must contain a complete set of exhibits.
§ 403.38
Contents of the petition.
(a)
Description of the property.
The petition should contain such a description of the property and such facts of the seizure as will enable the Commissioner or his delegate to identify the property.

Statement regarding knowledge of seizure.
In the event the petition is filed for the restoration of the proceeds derived from sale of the property pursuant to an administrative forfeiture, it should contain, or be supported by, satisfactory proof that the petitioner did not know and could not have known of the seizure prior to the declaration of forfeiture. (See also § 403.39)
(c)
Interest of petitioner.
The petition should clearly and concisely indicate the nature and amount of his interest in the property on the date the petition is filed, and the facts relied upon to show that the petitioner was not willfully negligent and did not intend that the property be involved or used in violation of the internal revenue laws. Such petition may allege such other circumstances which in the opinion of the petitioner would justify the remission or mitigation of the forfeiture.
(d)
Petitioner innocent party.
If the petitioner did not commit the act which caused the seizure of his property, the petition should state how the property came into the possession of the person whose act did cause the seizure, and it should also state that the petitioner had no knowledge or reason to believe that the property would be involved or used in violation of the internal revenue laws. If the petitioner knows, at the time he files the petition, that the person in whose possession the seized property was at the time of the seizure had a record or reputation for committing commercial crimes, the petitioner should state in the petition whether the petitioner knew of such record or reputation before the petitioner acquired his interest in the property or before such other person came into possession of the property, whichever occured later. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “commercial crimes” includes, but is not limited to any of the following federal or state crimes:
(1) Offenses against the revenue laws; burglary; counterfeiting, forgery; kidnapping; larceny; robbery; illegal sale or possession of deadly weapons; prostitution (including soliciting, procuring, pandering, white slaving, keeping house of ill fame, and like offenses); extortion; swindling and confidence games; and attempting to commit, conspiring to commit, or compounding any of the foregoing crimes.

Such costs include but are not limited to all expenses incurred in seizing and storing the property; the costs borne or to be borne by the United States; the taxes, if any, payable by the petitioner or imposed in respect of the property to which the petition relates; the penalty, if any, asserted by the Internal Revenue Service; and, if the property has been sold, or is in the course of being sold, the expenses incurred relating to such sale.
§ 403.39
Time of filing petition.
A complete petition for remission or mitigation must be filed before the expiration of three months after the sale or other disposition of the property with respect to which the petition is filed. For purposes of this part, the term “sale or other disposition” includes acquisition of the property for official use.
(Sec. 613, 46 Stat. 756, sec. 306, 49 Stat. 880; (19 U.S.C. 1613, 40 U.S.C. 304(k)))

§ 403.43
Final action.
(a)
Petitions for remission or mitigation of forfeiture.
(1) The Commissioner or his delegate shall either allow or deny any petition filed pursuant to these regulations. Such allowance or denial will constitute final action. If he allows the petition, the Commissioner or his delegate shall state the conditions, if any, of the allowance.

(b)
Offers in compromise of liability to forfeiture.
The Commissioner or his delegate shall accept or reject any offer in compromise of the liability to forfeiture of personal property seized pursuant to § 403.25 and such acceptance or rejection shall be a final action with respect to the offer.
§ 403.44
Acquisition for official use and sale for account of petitioner in the case of an allowed petition.
(a)
Acquisition for official use.
The seized property may be purchased by the United States pursuant to agreement and retained for official use. Where the petitioner is the owner, the purchase price is the appraised value of the property less all costs. Where the petitioner is a creditor, the purchase price is the smaller of:
(1) The petitioner's equity, or (2) the appraised value of the property less the amount of all costs.
(b)
Sale for account of petitioner.
If the petitioner elects not to comply with the conditions, if any, set for the return of the property, the Commissioner or his delegate is authorized to sell the property. If the petitioner is the owner of the property, there is deducted from the proceeds of the sale all costs incident to the seizure, forfeiture, and sale. The Commissioner or his delegate shall pay to the petitioner, out of the proper appropriation, an amount equal to the balance, if any. Where the petitioner is
a creditor, there is deducted from the proceeds of the sale all costs incident to the seizure, forfeiture, and sale, and the Commissioner or his delegate shall pay to the petitioner, out of the proper appropriation, an amount equal to the smaller of: (1) The balance, if any, or (2) the equity of the petitioner.
§ 403.45
Re-appraisal of property involved in an allowed petition.
In determining the nature and extent of the relief to be afforded a petitioner pursuant to § 403.44 the value of the property with respect to which the petition has been allowed is the value of such property as determined by the appraisal thereof made pursuant to § 403.26(a)(2) but if the petitioner desires re-appraisal of the property, after notification as to the conditions of allowances of the petition, and makes written request therefor, undertaking in such request to pay, or to be liable for, the total costs of such re-appraisal, the property shall be re-appraised in the manner in which the original appraisal was made, and the conditions of allowance of the petition shall be modified to the extent required by such re-appraisal.

Because this regulation is nonsubstantive, liberalizing and essentially procedural, it is found unnecessary to issue it with notice and public procedure under subsection (b) of section 553 of title 5 of the United States Code or subject to the effective date limitation of subsection (d) of that section.
[T.D. 7695, 45 FR 27932, Apr. 25, 1980]

# Subpart F—Administrative Sale of Personal Property
§ 403.55
Alternative methods of sale.

At the discretion of the Commissioner or his delegate the forfeited personal property may be sold at public auction to the highest bidder on open, competitive bids, or sold to the highest bidder on sealed, competitive bids.
(Sec. 7325, 68A Stat. 870, as amended; (26 U.S.C. 7325))
§ 403.56

All competitive bids shall be on a unit basis. Thus, for example, if a number of forfeited automobiles are advertised for sale at the same date, hour and place, whether or not in the same notice of sale, a separate individual bid is required as to each automobile. The Commissioner or his delegate will not accept one blanket bid to cover the entire group of automobiles offered for sale.

(d)
One bid.
When only one bid is received for a single unit of property
such bid shall be the highest bid received for such property.
(Sec. 7325, 68A Stat. 870, as amended (26 U.S.C. 7325 (1), (4)); sec. 7326, 72 Stat. 1429, as amended (26 U.S.C. 7326(a)))

§ 403.62
Sale on sealed, competitive bids.
If the property is to be sold to the highest bidder on sealed, competitive bids, the notice of sale shall so specify, and shall state the date, hour, and place of sale, and the date, hour, and place prior to the sale when and where prospective bidders may view the property and obtain necessary information. All sealed bids must be filed with the district director of the internal revenue district in which the property was seized before the sale. No bids will be accepted after the sale starts. At the appointed date, hour, and place of sale, all sealed bids timely filed shall be open in the presence of all bidders attending the sale, who shall have the privilege of inspecting the bids if they so desire.

§ 404.6048-1
[Reserved]
§ 404.6334(d)-1
Minimum exemption from levy for wages, salary, or other income.
(a)
In general.
Under section 6331(a), if an individual liable for any tax neglects or refuses to pay such tax within 10 days after notice and demand, the tax may be collected by levy upon property or rights to property belonging to such individual, including amounts payable to or received by him as wages, salary, or other income. Under section 6331(d)(3), a levy upon wages or salary is continuous from the date the levy is first made until the liability giving rise to the levy is satisfied or becomes unforceable by reason of lapse of time. Under section 6334(a)(9), however, certain amounts payable to or received by an individual as wages or salary for personal services, or as income from other sources, are exempt from levy. Under section 6334(d), amounts so exempt are determined by taking into account (1) the individual's payroll period,
i.e.
, the basis (whether weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly or otherwise) on which the individual is paid or receives wages, salary, or other income, and (2) the number of certain other persons dependent upon the individual for their
support during each such payroll period. Paragraph (b) of this section prescribes rules for determining an individual's payroll period. Paragraph (c) of this section contains rules relating to the minimum amount of wages, salary, or other income which is exempt from levy for each such payroll period, and the additional amount which is exempt for each person who is claimed as a dependent of the individual pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Determination of payroll period.
For purposes of determining the amount of wages, salary, or other income exempt from levy pursuant to section 6334(a)(9) and this section—
(1)
Regularly used calendar periods.
In the case of a levy on wages, etc. paid on the basis of an established calendar period regularly used by the employer for payroll purposes (e.g., weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly), that period shall be used as the individual's payroll period.
(2)
Remuneration paid on an irregular basis.
In the case of a levy on wages, etc. not paid on the basis of an established calendar period regularly used by an employer for payroll purposes, the first day of the individual's payroll period shall be that day following the day upon which the wages, salary, or other income become payable to or are received by the individual, and the last day of the payroll period shall be that day upon which such wages, salary, or other income next become payable to or are received by him.
(c)
Determination of exempt amount.
For each payroll period determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, amounts exempt from levy pursuant to section 6334(a)(9) and this section are as follows:
(1) If such payroll period is weekly: $50, plus $15 for each person who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) If such payroll period is biweekly: $100, plus $30 for each person who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
(3) If such payroll period is semimonthly: $108.33, plus $32.50 for each person who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
(4) If such payroll period is monthly: $216.67, plus $65 for each person who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
(5) If such payroll period is not weekly, biweekly, semimonthly or monthly: a proportionate amount based upon the sum of an annual exemption of $2,600 plus $780 for each person who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Dependent exemption
—(1)
Dependent defined.
For purposes of this section, a person is a dependent of an individual for any payroll period of such individual, if—
(i) Over half of such person's support for such payroll period was received from the individual, and
(ii) Such person is the spouse of the individual, or bears a relationship to the individual specified in section 152(a) (1) through (9) (relating to definition of dependent), and
(iii) Such person is not a minor child of the individual with respect to whom amounts are exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(8) (relating to exemption from levy for judgments for support of minor children) at any time during such payroll period.
For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, “payroll period” shall be substituted for “taxable year” each place it appears in section 152(a)(9).
