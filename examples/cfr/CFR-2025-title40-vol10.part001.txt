# Method 107A—Determination of Vinyl Chloride Content of Solvents, Resin-Solvent Solution, Polyvinyl Chloride Resin, Resin Slurry, Wet Resin, and Latex Samples
Introduction
Performance of this method should not be attempted by persons unfamiliar with the operation of a gas chromatograph (GC) or by those who are unfamiliar with source sampling because knowledge beyond the scope of this presentation is required. Care must be exercised to prevent exposure of sampling personnel to vinyl chloride, a carcinogen.
1.
Applicability and Principle
1.1 Applicability. This is an alternative method and applies to the measurement of the vinyl chloride content of solvents, resin solvent solutions, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin, wet cake slurries, latex, and fabricated resin samples. This method is not acceptable where methods from Section 304(h) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251
et seq.,
(the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977) are required.
1.2 Principle. The basis for this method lies in the direct injection of a liquid sample into a chromatograph and the subsequent evaporation of all volatile material into the carrier gas stream of the chromatograph, thus permitting analysis of all volatile material including vinyl chloride.
2.
Range and Sensitivity
The lower limit of detection of vinyl chloride in dry PVC resin is 0.2 ppm. For resin solutions, latexes, and wet resin, this limit rises inversely as the nonvolatile (resin) content decreases.
With proper calibration, the upper limit may be extended as needed.
3.
Interferences
The chromatograph columns and the corresponding operating parameters herein described normally provide an adequate resolution of vinyl chloride. In cases where resolution interferences are encountered, the chromatograph operator shall select the column and operating parameters best suited to his
particular analysis problem, subject to the approval of the Administrator. Approval is automatic, provided that the tester produces confirming data through an adequate supplemental analytical technique, such as analysis with a different column or GC/mass spectroscopy, and has the data available for review by the Administrator.
4.
Precision and Reproducibility
A standard sample of latex containing 181.8 ppm vinyl chloride analyzed 10 times by the alternative method showed a standard deviation of 7.5 percent and a mean error of 0.21 percent.
A sample of vinyl chloride copolymer resin solution was analyzed 10 times by the alternative method and showed a standard deviation of 6.6 percent at a level of 35 ppm.
5.
Safety
Do not release vinyl chloride to the laboratory atmosphere during preparation of standards. Venting or purging with vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) air mixtures must be held to minimum. When purging is required, the vapor must be routed to outside air. Vinyl chloride, even at low-ppm levels, must never be vented inside the laboratory.

8.
Procedure
8.1 Sampling. Allow the liquid or dried resin to flow from a tap on the tank, silo, or pipeline until the tap has been purged. Fill a wide-mouth pint bottle, and immediately tightly cap the bottle. Place an identifying label on each bottle and record the date, time, sample location, and material.
8.2 Sample Treatment. Sample must be run within 24 hours.
8.2.1 Resin Samples. Weigh 9.00 ±0.01 g of THF or DMAC in a tared 20-ml vial. Add 1.00 ±0.01 g of resin to the tared vial containing the THF or DMAC. Close the vial tightly with the screw cap, and shake or otherwise agitate the vial until complete solution of the resin is obtained. Shaking may require several minutes to several hours, depending on the nature of the resin.
8.2.2 Suspension Resin Slurry and Wet Resin Sample. Slurry must be filtered using a small Buchner funnel with vacuum to yield a wet resin sample. The filtering process must be continued only as long as a steady stream of water is exiting from the funnel. Excessive filtration time could result in some loss of VCM. The wet resin sample is weighed into a tared 20-ml vial with THF or DMAC as described earlier for resin samples (8.2.1) and treated the same as the resin sample. A sample of the wet resin is used to determine total solids as required for calculating the residual VCM (Section 8.3.4).
8.2.3 Latex and Resin Solvent Solutions. Samples must be thoroughly mixed. Weigh 1.00 ±0.01 g of the latex or resin-solvent solution into a 20-ml vial containing 9.00 ±0.01 g of THF or DMAC as for the resin samples (8.2.1). Cap and shake until complete solution is obtained. Determine the total solids of the latex or resin solution sample (Section 8.3.4).
8.2.4 Solvents and Non-viscous Liquid Samples. No preparation of these samples is required. The neat samples are injected directly into the GC.
8.3 Analysis.
8.3.1 Preparation of GC. Install the chromatographic column, and condition overnight at 70 °C. Do not connect the exit end of the column to the detector while conditioning.
8.3.1.1 Flow Rate Adjustments. Adjust the flow rate as follows:
a. Nitrogen Carrier Gas. Set regulator on cylinder to read 60 psig. Set column flow controller on the chromatograph using the soap film flowmeter to yield a flow rate of 40 cc/min.
b. Burner Air Supply. Set regulator on the cylinder at 40 psig. Set regulator on the chromatograph to supply air to the burner to yield a flow rate of 250 to 300 cc/min using the flowmeter.
c. Hydrogen. Set regulator on cylinder to read 60 psig. Set regulator on the chromatograph to supply 30 to 40 cc/min using the flowmeter. Optimize hydrogen flow to yield the most sensitive detector response without extinguishing the flame. Check flow with flowmeter and record this flow.
d. Nitrogen Back Flush Gas. Set regulator on the chromatograph using the soap film flowmeter to yield a flow rate of 40 cc/min.
8.3.1.2 Temperature Adjustments. Set temperature as follows:
a. Oven (chromatographic column) at 70 °C.
b. Injection Port at 100 °C.
c. Detector at 300 °C.
8.3.1.3 Ignition of Flame Ionization Detector. Ignite the detector according to the manufacturer's instructions. Allow system to stabilize approximately 1 hour.
8.3.1.4 Recorder. Set pen at zero and start chart drive.
8.3.1.5 Attenuation. Set attenuation to yield desired peak height depending on sample VCM content.
8.3.2 Chromatographic Analyses.
a. Sample Injection. Remove needle from 50-microliter syringe. Open sample vial and draw 50-microliters of THF or DMAC sample recovery solution into the syringe. Recap sample vial. Attach needle to the syringe and while holding the syringe vertically (needle uppermost), eject 40 microliters into an absorbent tissue. Wipe needle with tissue. Now inject 10 microliters into chromatograph system. Repeat the injection until two consecutive values for the height of the vinyl chloride peak do not vary more than 5 percent. Use the average value for these two peak heights to compute the sample concentration.
b. Back Flush. After 4 minutes has elapsed after sample injection, actuate the back flush valve to purge the first 4 feet of the chromatographic column of solvent and other high boilers.
c. Sample Data. Record on the chromatograph strip chart the data from the sample label.
d. Elution Time. Vinyl chloride elutes at 2.8 minutes. Acetaldehyde elutes at 3.7 minutes. Analysis is considered complete when chart pen becomes stable. After 5 minutes, reset back flush valve and inject next sample.
8.3.3 Chromatograph Servicing.
a. Septum. Replace after five sample injections.
b. Sample Port Liner. Replace the sample port liner with a clean spare after five sample injections.
c. Chromatograph Shutdown. If the chromatograph has been shut down overnight, rerun one or more samples from the preceding day to test stability and precision prior to starting on the current day's work.
8.3.4 Determination of Total Solids (TS). For wet resin, resin solution, and PVC latex samples, determine the TS for each sample by accurately weighing approximately 3 to 5 grams of sample into a tared aluminum pan. The initial procedure is as follows:
a. Where water is the major volatile component: Tare the weighing dish, and add 3 to 5 grams of sample to the dish. Weigh to the nearest milligram.
b. Where volatile solvent is the major volatile component: Transfer a portion of the sample to a 20-ml screw cap vial and cap immediately. Weigh the vial to the nearest milligram. Uncap the vial and transfer a 3- to 5-gram portion of the sample to a tared aluminum weighing dish. Recap the vial and reweigh to the nearest milligram. The vial weight loss is the sample weight.
To continue, place the weighing pan in a 130 °C oven for 1 hour. Remove the dish and allow to cool to room temperature in a desiccator. Weigh the pan to the nearest 0.1 mg. Total solids is the weight of material in the aluminum pan after heating divided by the net weight of sample added to the pan originally times 100.
9.
Calibration of the Chromatograph
9.1 Preparation of Standards. Prepare a 1 percent by weight (approximate) solution of vinyl chloride in THF or DMAC by bubbling vinyl chloride gas from a cylinder into a tared 125-ml glass-stoppered flask containing THF or DMAC. The weight of vinyl chloride to be added should be calculated prior to this operation, i.e., 1 percent of the weight of THF or DMAC contained in the tared flask. This must be carried out in a laboratory hood. Adjust the vinyl chloride flow from the cylinder so that the vinyl chloride dissolves essentially completely in the THF or DMAC and is not blown to the atmosphere. Take particular care not to volatize any of the solution. Stopper the flask and swirl the solution to effect complete mixing. Weigh the stoppered flask to nearest 0.1 mg to determine the exact amount of vinyl chloride added.
Pipet 10 ml of the approximately 1 percent solution into a 100-ml glass-stoppered volumetric flask, and add THF or DMAC to fill to the mark. Cap the flask and invert 10 to 20 times. This solution contains approximately 1,000 ppm by weight of vinyl chloride (note the exact concentration).
Pipet 50-, 10-, 5-, 1-, 0.5-, and 0.1-ml aliquots of the approximately 1,000 ppm solution into 10 ml glass stoppered volumetric flasks. Dilute to the mark with THF or DMAC, cap the flasks and invert each 10 to 20 times. These solutions contain approximately 500, 100, 50, 10, 5, and 1 ppm vinyl chloride. Note the exact concentration of each one. These standards are to be kept under refrigeration in stoppered bottles, and must be renewed every 3 months.
9.2 Preparation of Chromatograph Calibration Curve.
Obtain the GC for each of the six final solutions prepared in Section 9.1 by using the procedure in Section 8.3.2. Prepare a chart plotting peak height obtained from the chromatogram of each solution versus the known concentration. Draw a straight line through
the points derived by the least squares method.

8.7 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5, Section 8.7, except that 0.1 N NaOH is used as the cleanup solvent instead of acetone and that the impinger water is treated as follows:
8.7.1 Container Number 4 (Impinger Water). Clean each of the first three impingers and connecting glassware in the following manner:
8.7.1.1 Wipe the impinger ball joints free of silicone grease, and cap the joints.
8.7.1.2 Rotate and agitate each of the first two impingers, using the impinger contents as a rinse solution.
8.7.1.3 Transfer the liquid from the first three impingers to Container Number 4. Remove the outlet ball-joint cap, and drain the contents through this opening. Do not separate the impinger parts (inner and outer tubes) while transferring their contents to the container.
8.7.1.4 Weigh the contents of Container No. 4 to within 0.5 g. Record in the log the weight of liquid along with a notation of any color or film observed in the impinger catch. The weight of liquid is needed along with the silica gel data to calculate the stack gas moisture content.

# Note:
Measure and record the total amount of 0.1 N NaOH used for rinsing under Sections 8.7.1.5 and 8.7.1.6.
8.7.1.5 Pour approximately 30 ml of 0.1 NaOH into each of the first two impingers, and agitate the impingers. Drain the 0.1 N NaOH through the outlet arm of each impinger into Container Number 4. Repeat this operation a second time; inspect the impingers for any abnormal conditions.
8.7.1.6 Wipe the ball joints of the glassware connecting the impingers and the back half of the filter holder free of silicone grease, and rinse each piece of glassware twice with 0.1 N NaOH; transfer this rinse into Container Number 4. (DO NOT RINSE or brush the glass-fritted filter support.) Mark the height of the fluid level to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label the container to identify clearly its contents.
8.8 Blanks.
8.8.1 Sodium Hydroxide. Save a portion of the 0.1 N NaOH used for cleanup as a blank. Take 200 ml of this solution directly from the wash bottle being used and place it in a plastic sample container labeled “NaOH blank.”

3
. Dilute to the mark with water.
10.2.2 For the low level vapor generator procedure, pipet 1, 2, 3, and 5 ml of 1.0 µg As/ml standard solution into separate reaction tubes. Dilute to the mark with water.
10.2.3 For the low level graphite furnace procedure, pipet 1, 5, 10 and 15 ml of 1.0 µg As/ml standard solution into separate flasks along with 2 ml of the 5 percent nickel nitrate solution and 10 ml of the 3 percent H
2
O
2
solution. Dilute to the mark with water.
10.3 Calibration Curve. Analyze a 0.8 N HNO
3
blank and each standard solution according to the procedures outlined in section 11.4.1. Repeat this procedure on each standard solution until two consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value. Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank—which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale—from the averaged peak height of each standard solution. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is As contamination of a reagent or carry-over of As from a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the corresponding final total As weight in the solution.
10.4 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through the origin or through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations (
e.g.,
1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 mg As for the high-level procedure) must be less than 7 percent for all standards.

# Note:
For instruments equipped with direct concentration readout devices, preparation of a standard curve will not be necessary. In all cases, follow calibration and operational procedures in the manufacturers' instruction manual.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 Sample Loss Check. Prior to analysis, check the liquid level in Containers Number 2 and Number 4. Note on the analytical data sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage occurred, either void the sample or take steps, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to adjust the final results.
11.2 Sample Preparation.
11.2.1 Container Number 1 (Filter). Place the filter and loose particulate matter in a 150 ml beaker. Also, add the filtered solid material from Container Number 2 (see Section 11.2.2). Add 50 ml of 0.1 N NaOH. Then stir and warm on a hot plate at low heat (do not boil) for about 15 minutes. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO
3
, bring to a boil, then simmer for about 15 minutes. Filter the solution through a glass fiber filter. Wash with hot water, and catch the filtrate in a clean 150 ml beaker. Boil the filtrate, and evaporate to dryness. Cool, add 5 ml of 50 percent HNO
3
, and then warm and stir. Allow to cool. Transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix well.
11.2.2 Container Number 2 (Probe Wash).
11.2.2.1 Filter (using a glass fiber filter) the contents of Container Number 2 into a 200 ml volumetric flask. Combine the filtered (solid) material with the contents of Container Number 1 (Filter).
11.2.2.2 Dilute the filtrate to exactly 200 ml with water. Then pipet 50 ml into a 150 ml beaker. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO
3
, bring to a boil, and evaporate to dryness. Allow to cool, add 5 ml of 50 percent HNO
3
, and then warm and stir. Allow the solution to cool, transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix well.
11.2.3 Container Number 4 (Impinger Solution). Transfer the contents of Container Number 4 to a 500 ml volumetric flask, and
dilute to exactly 500-ml with water. Pipet 50 ml of the solution into a 150-ml beaker. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO
3
, bring to a boil, and evaporate to dryness. Allow to cool, add 5 ml of 50 percent HNO
3
, and then warm and stir. Allow the solution to cool, transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix well.
11.2.4 Filter Blank. Cut each filter into strips, and treat each filter individually as directed in Section 11.2.1, beginning with the sentence, “Add 50 ml of 0.1 N NaOH.”
11.2.5 Sodium Hydroxide and Water Blanks. Treat separately 50 ml of 0.1 N NaOH and 50 ml water, as directed under Section 11.2.3, beginning with the sentence, “Pipet 50 ml of the solution into a 150-ml beaker.”
11.3 Spectrophotometer Preparation. Turn on the power; set the wavelength, slit width, and lamp current. Adjust the background corrector as instructed by the manufacturer's manual for the particular atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame characteristics as necessary.
11.4 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.2 through 10.4.
11.4.1 Arsenic Samples. Analyze an appropriately sized aliquot of each diluted sample (from Sections 11.2.1 through 11.2.3) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. If applicable, follow the procedures outlined in Section 11.4.1.1. If the sample concentration falls outside the range of the calibration curve, make an appropriate dilution with 0.8 N HNO
3
so that the final concentration falls within the range of the curve. Using the calibration curve, determine the arsenic concentration in each sample fraction.

# Note:
Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instrument manufacturer's detailed operating instructions should be followed.
11.4.1.1 Arsenic Determination at Low Concentration. The lower limit of flame AAS is 10 µg As/ml. If the arsenic concentration of any sample is at a lower level, use the graphite furnace or vapor generator which is available as an accessory component. Flame, graphite furnace, or vapor generators may be used for samples whose concentrations are between 10 and 30 µg/ml. Follow the manufacturer's instructions in the use of such equipment.
11.4.1.1.1 Vapor Generator Procedure. Place a sample containing between 0 and 5 µg of arsenic in the reaction tube, and dilute to 15 ml with water. Since there is some trial and error involved in this procedure, it may be necessary to screen the samples by conventional atomic absorption until an approximate concentration is determined. After determining the approximate concentration, adjust the volume of the sample accordingly. Pipet 15 ml of concentrated HCl into each tube. Add 1 ml of 30 percent KI solution. Place the reaction tube into a 50 °C (120 °F) water bath for 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Connect the reaction tube to the vapor generator assembly. When the instrument response has returned to baseline, inject 5.0 ml of 5 percent NaBH
4
, and integrate the resulting spectrophotometer signal over a 30-second time period.
11.4.1.1.2 Graphite Furnace Procedure. Dilute the digested sample so that a 5 ml aliquot contains less than 1.5 µg of arsenic. Pipet 5 ml of this digested solution into a 10-ml volumetric flask. Add 1 ml of the 1 percent nickel nitrate solution, 0.5 ml of 50 percent HNO
3
, and 1 ml of the 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and dilute to 10 ml with water. The sample is now ready for analysis.
11.4.1.2 Run a blank (0.8 N HNO
3
) and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected average peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.
11.4.1.3 Determine the arsenic concentration in the filter blank (i.e., the average of the two blank values from each lot).
11.4.2 Container Number 3 (Silica Gel). This step may be conducted in the field. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g; record this weight.
11.5 Check for matrix effects on the arsenic results. Same as Method 12, Section 11.5.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardizations

# Note:
Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
10.1 Preparation of Standard Solutions. Pipet 1, 5, 10, and 25 ml of the stock As solution into separate 100-ml volumetric flasks. Add 10 ml KCl solution and dilute to the mark with 0.5 N HNO
3
. This will give standard concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 250 µg As/ml. For low-level arsenic samples that require the use of a graphite furnace or vapor generator, follow the procedures in Section 11.3:1. Dilute 10 ml of KCl solution to 100 ml with 0.5 N HNO
3
and use as a reagent blank.
10.2 Calibration Curve. Analyze the reagent blank and each standard solution according to the procedures outlined in Section 11.3. Repeat this procedure on each standard solution until two consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value. Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank—which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale—from the averaged peak heights of each standard solution. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is Hg contamination of a reagent or carry-over of As from a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the
corresponding final total As weight in the solution.
10.3 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through the origin or through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations must be less than 7 percent for all standards.

# Note:
For instruments equipped with direct concentration readout devices, preparation of a standard curve will not be necessary. In all cases, follow calibration and operational procedures in the manufacturer's instruction manual.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 Sample Preparation. Weigh 50 to 500 mg of finely pulverized sample to the nearest 0.1 mg. Transfer the sample into the Teflon cup of the digestion bomb, and add 2 ml each of concentrated HNO
3
and HF. Seal the bomb immediately to prevent the loss of any volatile arsenic compounds that may form. Heat in an oven at 105 °C (221 °F) for 2 hours. Remove the bomb from the oven and allow to cool. Using a Teflon filter, quantitatively filter the digested sample into a 50-ml polypropylene volumetric flask. Rinse the bomb three times with small portions of 0.5 N HNO
3
, and filter the rinses into the flask. Add 5 ml of KCl solution to the flask, and dilute to 50 ml with 0.5 N HNO
3
.
11.2 Spectrophotometer Preparation.
11.2.1 Turn on the power; set the wavelength, slit width, and lamp current. Adjust the background corrector as instructed by the manufacturer's manual for the particular atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame characteristics as necessary.
11.2.2 Develop a spectrophotometer calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.2 and 10.3.
11.3 Arsenic Determination. Analyze an appropriately sized aliquot of each diluted sample (from Section 11.1) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. If applicable, follow the procedures outlined in Section 11.3.1. If the sample concentration falls outside the range of the calibration curve, make an appropriate dilution with 0.5 N HNO
3
so that the final concentration falls within the range of the curve. Using the calibration curve, determine the As concentration in each sample.

# Note:
Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instrument manufacturer's detailed operating instructions should be followed.
11.3.1 Arsenic Determination at Low Concentration. The lower limit of flame AAS is 10 µg As/ml. If the arsenic concentration of any sample is at a lower level, use the vapor generator or graphite furnace which is available as an accessory component. Flame, graphite furnace, or vapor generators may be used for samples whose concentrations are between 10 and 30 µg/ml. Follow the manufacturer's instructions in the use of such equipment.
11.3.1.1 Vapor Generator Procedure. Place a sample containing between 0 and 5 µg of arsenic in the reaction tube, and dilute to 15 ml with water. Since there is some trial and error involved in this procedure, it may be necessary to screen the samples by conventional AAS until an approximate concentration is determined. After determining the approximate concentration, adjust the volume of the sample accordingly. Pipet 15 ml of concentrated HCl into each tube. Add 1 ml of 30 percent KI solution. Place the reaction tube into a 50 °C (120 °F) water bath for 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Connect the reaction tube to the vapor generator assembly. When the instrument response has returned to baseline, inject 5.0 ml of 5 percent NaBH
4
and integrate the resulting spectrophotometer signal over a 30-second time period.
11.3.1.2 Graphite Furnace Procedure. Pipet 5 ml of the digested solution into a 10-ml volumetric flask. Add 1 ml of the 1 percent nickel nitrate solution, 0.5 ml of 50 percent HNO
3
, and 1 ml of the 3 percent H
2
O
2
, and dilute to 10 ml with water. The sample is now ready to inject in the furnace for analysis.
11.4 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected average peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.

16.1.2 Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures, including audit material analysis, are conducted as prescribed in the method. The QA acceptance conditions must be met.
16.1.3 The limit of quantitation for the ICP-AES must be demonstrated and the sample concentrations reported should be no less than two times the limit of quantitation. The limit of quantitation is defined as ten times the standard deviation of the blank value. The standard deviation of the blank value is determined from the analysis of seven blanks. It has been reported that for mercury and those elements that form hydrides, a continuous-flow generator coupled to an ICP-AES offers detection limits comparable to cold vapor atomic absorption.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 Sample Preparation.
11.1.1 Weigh 1.0 g of finely pulverized sample to the nearest 0.1 mg. Transfer the sample to a 300 ml Erlenmeyer flask and add 15 ml of HNO
3
, 4 ml HCl, 2 ml HF, 3 ml HClO
4
, and 15 ml H
2
SO
4
, in the order listed. In a HClO
4
fume hood, heat on a hot plate to decompose the sample. Then heat while swirling over an open flame until dense white fumes evolve. Cool, add 15 ml of water, swirl to hydrate the H
2
SO
4
completely, and add several boiling granules. Cool to room temperature.
11.1.2 Add 1 g of KBr, 1 g hydrazine sulfate, and 50 ml HCl. Immediately attach the distillation head with thermometer and dip the side arm into a 50-ml graduated cylinder containing 25 ml of water and 2 ml of bromine water. Keep the graduated cylinder immersed in a beaker of cold water during distillation. Distill until the temperature of the vapor in the flask reaches 107 °C (225 °F). When distillation is complete, remove the flask from the hot plate, and simultaneously wash down the side arm with water as it is removed from the cylinder.
11.1.3 If the expected arsenic content is in the range of 0.0020 to 0.10 percent, dilute the distillate to the 50-ml mark of the cylinder with water, stopper, and mix. Transfer a 5.0-ml aliquot to a 50-ml volumetric flask. Add 10 ml of water and a boiling granule. Place the flask on a hot plate, and heat gently until the bromine is expelled and the color of methyl orange indicator persists upon the addition of 1 to 2 drops. Cool the flask to room temperature. Neutralize just to the yellow color of the indicator with dropwise additions of NH
4
OH. Bring back to the red color by dropwise addition of dilute HCl, and add 10 ml excess. Proceed with the molybdenum blue color development as described in Section 11.2.
11.1.4 If the expected arsenic content is in the range of 0.0002 to 0.0010 percent As, transfer either the entire initial distillate or the measured remaining distillate from Section 11.1.2 to a 250-ml beaker. Wash the cylinder with two successive portions of concentrated HNO
3
, adding each portion to the distillate in the beaker. Add 4 ml of concentrated HClO
4
, a boiling granule, and cover with a flat watch glass placed slightly to one side. Boil gently on a hot plate until the volume is reduced to approximately 10 ml. Add 3 ml of HNO
3
, and continue the evaporation until HClO
4
is refluxing on the beaker cover. Cool
briefly, rinse the underside of the watch glass and the inside of the beaker with about 3-5 ml of water, cover, and continue the evaporation to expel all but 2 ml of the HClO

# Note:
If the solution appears cloudy due to a small amount of antimony distilling over, add 4 ml of 50 percent HCl and 5 ml of water, cover, and warm gently until clear. If cloudiness persists, add 5 ml of HNO

11.1.5 To the 2 ml of HClO
4
solution or 1 ml of H

SO
4
solution, add 15 ml of water, boil gently for 2 minutes, and then cool. Proceed with the molybdenum blue color development by neutralizing the solution directly in the beaker just to the yellow indicator color by dropwise addition of NH
4
OH. Obtain the red color by dropwise addition of dilute HCl. Transfer the solution to a 50-ml volumetric flask. Rinse the beaker successively with 10 ml of dilute HCl, followed by several small portions of water. At this point the volume of solution in the flask should be no more than 40 ml. Continue with the color development as described in Section 11.2.
11.2 Analysis.
11.2.1 Add 1 ml of KBrO
3
solution to the flask and heat on a low-temperature hot plate to about 50 °C (122 °F) to oxidize the arsenic and methyl orange. Add 5.0 ml of ammonium molybdate solution to the warm solution and mix. Add 2.0 ml of hydrazine sulfate solution, dilute until the solution comes within the neck of the flask, and mix. Place the flask in a 400 ml beaker, 80 percent full of boiling water, for 10 minutes. Enough heat must be supplied to prevent the water bath from cooling much below the boiling point upon inserting the volumetric flask. Remove the flask, cool to room temperature, dilute to the mark, and mix.
11.2.2 Transfer a suitable portion of the reference solution to an absorption cell, and adjust the spectrophotometer to the initial setting using a light band centered at 660 nm. While maintaining this spectrophotometer adjustment, take the readings of the calibration solutions followed by the samples.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
A particulate matter sample, collected according to Method 5, is analyzed for polonium-210 content: the polonium-210 in the sample is put in solution, deposited on a metal disc, and the radioactive disintegration rate measured. Polonium in acid solution spontaneously deposits on surfaces of metals that are more electropositive than polonium. This principle is routinely used in the radiochemical analysis of polonium-210. Data reduction procedures are provided, allowing the calculation of polonium-210 emissions from individual sources and from all
affected sources at a facility, using data obtained from Methods 2 and 5 and from the analytical procedures herein.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure

# Note:
Perform duplicate analyses of all samples, including background counts and Method 5 samples. Duplicate measurements are considered acceptable when the difference between them is less than two standard deviations as described in EPA 600/4-77-001 or subsequent revisions.
11.1 Determination of Procedure Background. Background counts used in all equations are determined by performing the specific analysis required using the analytical reagents only. All procedure background counts and sample counts for the internal proportional counter should utilize a counting time of 100 minutes; for the alpha spectrometry system, 1000 minutes. These background counts should be performed no less frequently than once per 10 sample analyses.
11.2 Determination of Instrument Background. Instrument backgrounds of the internal proportional counter and the alpha spectrometry system should be determined on a weekly basis. Instrument background should not exceed procedure background. If this occurs, it may be due to a malfunction or contamination, and should be corrected before use.
11.4 Sample Preparation. Treat the Method 5 samples [
i.e.,
the glass fiber filter (Container No. 1) and the acetone rinse (Container No. 2)] as follows:
11.4.1 Container No. 1. Transfer the filter and any loose particulate matter from the sample container to a 150-ml Teflon beaker.
11.4.2 Container No. 2. Note the level of liquid in the container, and confirm on the analysis sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results. Transfer the contents to a 400-ml glass beaker. Add polonium-209 tracer solution to the glass beaker in an amount approximately equal to the amount of polonium-210 expected in the total particulate sample. Record the activity of the tracer solution added. Add 16 M nitric acid to the beaker to digest and loosen the residue.
11.4.3 Transfer the contents of the glass beaker to the Teflon beaker containing the glass fiber filter. Rinse the glass beaker with 16 M HNO
3
. If necessary, reduce the volume in the beaker by evaporation until all of the nitric acid HNO
3
from the glass beaker has been transferred to the Teflon beaker.
11.4.4 Add 30 ml of 29 M HF to the Teflon beaker and evaporate to near dryness on a hot plate in a properly operating hood.

# Note:
Do not allow the residue to go to dryness and overheat; this will result in loss of polonium.
11.4.5 Repeat step 11.4.4 until the filter is dissolved.
11.4.6 Add 100 ml of 16 M HNO
3
to the residue in the Teflon beaker and evaporate to near dryness.

# Note:
Do not allow the residue to go to dryness.
11.4.7 Add 50 ml of 16 M HNO
3
and 10 ml of 12 M perchloric acid to the Teflon beaker and heat until dense fumes of perchloric acid are evolved.
11.4.8 Repeat steps 11.4.4 to 11.4.7 as necessary until sample is completely dissolved.
11.4.9 Add 10 ml of 12 M HCl to the Teflon beaker and evaporate to dryness. Repeat additions and evaporations several times.
11.4.10 Transfer the sample to a 250-ml volumetric flask and dilute to volume with 3 M HCl.
11.5 Sample Screening. To avoid contamination of the alpha spectrometry system, check each sample as follows:
11.5.1 Add 20 ml of 1 M HCl, 1 ml of the lanthanum carrier solution (0.1 mg La/ml), a 1 ml aliquot of the sample solution from Section 11.4.10, and 3 ml of 15 M ammonium hydroxide to a 250-ml beaker in the order listed. Allow this solution to stand for a minimum of 30 minutes.
11.5.2 Filter the solution through a filter membrane using the suction filter apparatus. Wash the filter membrane with 10 ml of water and 5 ml of ethanol, and allow the filter membrane to air dry on the filter apparatus.
11.5.3 Carefully remove the filter membrane and mount it, filtration side up, with double-side tape on the inner surface of a planchet. Place the planchet in an internal proportional counter, and count for 100 minutes.
11.5.4 Calculate the activity of the sample using Eq. 111-4 in Section 12.5.
11.5.5 Determine the aliquot volume of the sample solution from Section 11.4.10 to be analyzed for polonium-210, such that the aliquot contains an activity between 1 and 4 picocuries. Use Eq. 111-5 in Section 12.6.
11.6 Preparation of Silver Disc for Spontaneous Electrodeposition.
11.6.1 Clean both sides of the polished silver disc with silver cleaner and with degreaser.
11.6.2 Place disc on absorbent paper and spray one side with epoxy spray enamel. This should be carried out in a well-ventilated area, with the disc lying flat to keep paint on one side only. Allow paint to dry for 24 hours before using disc for deposition.
11.7 Sample Analysis.
11.7.1 Add the aliquot of sample solution from Section 11.4.10 to be analyzed for polonium-210, the volume of which was determined in Section 11.5.5, to a suitable 200-ml container to be placed in a constant temperature bath.

# Note:
Aliquot volume may require a larger container.
11.7.2 If necessary, bring the volume to 100 ml with 1 M HCl. If the aliquot volume exceeds 100 ml, use total aliquot.
11.7.3 Add 200 mg of ascorbic acid and heat solution to 85 °C (185 °F) in a constant temperature bath.
11.7.4 Suspend a silver disc in the heated solution using a glass or plastic rod with a hook inserted through the hole in the disc. The disc should be totally immersed in the solution, and the solution must be stirred constantly, at all times during the plating operation. Maintain the disc in solution for 3 hours.
11.7.5 Remove the silver disc, rinse with deionized distilled water, and allow to air dry at room temperature.
11.7.6 Place the disc, with deposition side (unpainted side) up, on a planchet and secure
with double-side plastic tape. Place the planchet with disc in alpha spectrometry system and count for 1000 minutes.

# Method 114—Test Methods for Measuring Radionuclide Emissions from Stationary Sources
1.
Purpose and Background
This method provides the requirements for: (1) Stack monitoring and sample collection methods appropriate for radionuclides; (2) radiochemical methods which are used in determining the amounts of radionuclides collected by the stack sampling and; (3) quality assurance methods which are conducted in conjunction with these measurements. These methods are appropriate for emissions for stationary sources. A list of references is provided.
Many different types of facilities release radionuclides into air. These radionuclides differ in the chemical and physical forms, half-lives and type of radiation emitted. The appropriate combination of sample extraction, collection and analysis for an individual radionuclide is dependent upon many interrelated factors including the mixture of other radionuclides present. Because of this wide range of conditions, no single method for monitoring or sample collection and analysis of a radionuclide is applicable to all types of facilities. Therefore, a series of methods based on “principles of measurement” are described for monitoring and sample collection and analysis which are applicable to the measurement of radionuclides found in effluent streams at stationary sources. This approach provides the user with the flexibility to choose the most appropriate combination of monitoring and sample collection and analysis methods which are applicable to the effluent stream to be measured.
2.
Stack Monitoring and Sample Collection Methods
Monitoring and sample collection methods are described based on “principles of monitoring and sample collection” which are applicable to the measurement of radionuclides from effluent streams at stationary sources.
Radionuclides of most elements will be in the particulate form in these effluent streams and can be readily collected using a suitable filter media. Radionuclides of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, the noble gases and in some circumstances iodine will be in the gaseous form. Radionuclides of these elements will require either the use of an in-line or off-line monitor to directly measure the radionuclides, or suitable sorbers, condensers or bubblers to collect the radionuclides.
2.1 Radionuclides as Particulates. The extracted effluent stream is passed through a filter media to remove the particulates. The filter must have a high efficiency for removal of sub-micron particles. The guidance in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 (section 6.6.2 Filter media) shall be followed in using filter media to collect particulates (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18 of this part).
2.2 Radionuclides as Gases.
2.2.1 The Radionuclide Tritium (H-3). Tritium in the form of water vapor is collected from the extracted effluent sample by sorption, condensation or dissolution techniques. Appropriate collectors may include silica gel, molecular sieves, and ethylene glycol or water bubblers.
Tritium in the gaseous form may be measured directly in the sample stream using Method B-1, collected as a gas sample or may be oxidized using a metal catalyst to tritiated water and collected as described above.
2.2.2 Radionuclides of Iodine. Iodine is collected from an extracted sample by sorption or dissolution techniques. Appropriate collectors may include charcoal, impregnated charcoal, metal zeolite and caustic solutions.
2.2.3 Radionuclides of Argon, Krypton and Xenon. Radionuclides of these elements are either measured directly by an in-line or off-line monitor, or are collected from the extracted sample by low temperature sorption techniques, Appropriate sorbers may include charcoal or metal zeolite.
2.2.4 Radionuclides of Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen and Radon. Radionuclides of these elements are measured directly using an in-line or off-line monitor. Radionuclides of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide may be collected by dissolution in caustic solutions.
2.3 Definition of Terms
In-line monitor
means a continuous measurement system in which the detector is placed directly in or adjacent to the effluent stream. This may involve either gross radioactivity measurements or specific radionuclide measurements. Gross measurements shall be made in conformance with the conditions specified in Methods A-4, B-2 and G-4.
Off-line monitor
means a measurement system in which the detector is used to continuously measure an extracted sample of the effluent stream. This may involve either gross radioactivity measurements or specific radionuclide measurements. Gross measurements shall be made in conformance with the conditions specified in Methods A-4, B-2 and G-4.
Sample collection
means a procedure in which the radionuclides are removed from an extracted sample of the effluent using a collection media. These collection media include filters, absorbers, bubblers and condensers. The collected sample is analyzed using the methods described in Section 3.
3.
Radionuclide Analysis Methods
A series of methods based on “principles of measurement” are described which are applicable to the analysis of radionuclides collected from airborne effluent streams at stationary sources. These methods are applicable only under the conditions stated and within the limitations described. Some methods specify that only a single radionuclide be present in the sample or the chemically separated sample. This condition should be interpreted to mean that no other radionuclides are present in quantities which would interfere with the measurement.
Also identified (Table 1) are methods for a selected list of radionuclides. The listed radionuclides are those which are most commonly used and which have the greatest potential for causing dose to members of the public. Use of methods based on principles of measurement other than those described in this section must be approved in advance of use by the Administrator. For radionuclides not listed in Table 1, any of the described methods may be used provided the user can demonstrate that the applicability conditions of the method have been met.
The type of method applicable to the analysis of a radionuclide is dependent upon the type of radiation emitted, i.e., alpha, beta or gamma. Therefore, the methods described below are grouped according to principles of measurements for the analysis of alpha, beta and gamma emitting radionuclides.
3.1 Methods for Alpha Emitting Radionuclides
3.1.1 Method A-1, Radiochemistry-Alpha Spectrometry.
Principle:
The element of interest is separated from other elements, and from the sample matrix using radiochemical techniques. The procedure may involve precipitation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers (elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. The element is deposited on a planchet in a very thin film by electrodeposition or by coprecipitation on a very small amount of carrier, such as lanthanum fluoride. The deposited element is then counted with an alpha spectrometer. The activity of the nuclide of interest is measured by the number of alpha counts in the appropriate energy region. A
correction for chemical yield and counting efficiency is made using a standardized radioactive nuclide (tracer) of the same element. If a radioactive tracer is not available for the element of interest, a predetermined chemical yield factor may be used.
Applicability:
This method is applicable for determining the activity of any alpha-emitting radionuclide, regardless of what other radionuclides are present in the sample provided the chemical separation step produces a very thin sample and removes all other radionuclides which could interfere in the spectral region of interest. APHA-605(2), ASTM-D-3972(13).
3.1.2 Method A-2, Radiochemistry-Alpha Counting.
Principle:
The element of interest is separated from other elements, and from the sample matrix using radiochemistry. The procedure may involve precipitation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers (elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. The element is deposited on a planchet in a thin film and counted with an alpha counter. A correction for chemical yield (if necessary) is made. The alpha count rate measures the total activity of all emitting radionuclides of the separated element.
Applicability:
This method is applicable for the measurement of any alpha-emitting radionuclide, provided no other alpha emitting radionuclide is present in the separated sample. It may also be applicable for determining compliance, when other radionuclides of the separated element are present, provided that the calculated emission rate is assigned to the radionuclide which could be present in the sample that has the highest dose conversion factor. IDO-12096(18).
3.1.3 Method A-3, Direct Alpha Spectrometry.
Principle:
The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counted directly on an alpha spectrometer. The sample must be thin enough and collected on the surface of the filter so that any absorption of alpha particle energy in the sample or the filter, which would degrade the spectrum, is minimal.
Applicability:
This method is applicable to simple mixtures of alpha emitting radionuclides and only when the amount of particulates collected on the filter paper are relatively small and the alpha spectra is adequately resolved. Resolutions should be 50 keV (FWHM) or better, ASTM-D-3084(16).
3.1.4 Method A-4, Direct Alpha Counting (Gross alpha determination).
Principle:
The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counted with an alpha counter. The sample must be thin enough so that self-absorption is not significant and the filter must be of such a nature that the particles are retained on the surface.
Applicability:
Gross alpha determinations may be used to measure emissions of specific radionuclides only (1) when it is known that the sample contains only a single radionuclide, or the identity and isotopic ratio of the radionuclides in the sample are well-known, and (2) measurements using either Method A-1, A-2 or A-5 have shown that this method provides a reasonably accurate measurement of the emission rate. Gross alpha measurements are applicable to unidentified mixtures of radionuclides only for the purposes and under the conditions described in section 3.7. APHA-601(3), ASTM-D-1943(10).
3.1.5 Method A-5, Chemical Determination of Uranium.
Principle:
Uranium may be measured chemically by either colorimetry or fluorometry. In both procedures, the sample is dissolved, the uranium is oxidized to the hexavalent form and extracted into a suitable solvent. Impurities are removed from the solvent layer. For colorimetry, dibenzoylmethane is added, and the uranium is measured by the absorbance in a colorimeter. For fluorometry, a portion of the solution is fused with a sodium fluoride-lithium fluoride flux and the uranium is determined by the ultraviolet activated fluorescence of the fused disk in a fluorometer.
Applicability:
This method is applicable to the measurements of emission rates of uranium when the isotopic ratio of the uranium radionuclides is well known. ASTM-E-318(15), ASTM-D-2907(14).
3.1.6 Method A-6, Radon-222—Continuous Gas Monitor.
Principle:
Radon-222 is measured directly in a continuously extracted sample stream by passing the air stream through a calibrated scintillation cell. Prior to the scintillation cell, the air stream is treated to remove particulates and excess moisture. The alpha particles from radon-222 and its decay products strike a zinc sulfide coating on the inside of the scintillation cell producing light pulses. The light pulses are detected by a photomultiplier tube which generates electrical pulses. These pulses are processed by the system electronics and the read out is in pCi/l of radon-222.
Applicability:
This method is applicable to the measurement of radon-222 in effluent streams which do not contain significant quantities of radon-220. Users of this method should calibrate the monitor in a radon calibration chamber at least twice per year. The background of the monitor should also be checked periodically by operating the instrument in a low radon environment. EPA 520/1-89-009(24).
3.1.7 Method A-7, Radon-222-Alpha Track Detectors
Principle:
Radon-222 is measured directly in the effluent stream using alpha track detectors (ATD). The alpha particles emitted by
radon-222 and its decay products strike a small plastic strip and produce submicron damage tracks. The plastic strip is placed in a caustic solution that accentuates the damage tracks which are counted using a microscope or automatic counting system. The number of tracks per unit area is correlated to the radon concentration in air using a conversion factor derived from data generated in a radon calibration facility.
Applicability:
Prior approval from EPA is required for use of this method. This method is only applicable to effluent streams which do not contain significant quantities of radon-220, unless special detectors are used to discriminate against radon-220. This method may be used only when ATDs have been demonstrated to produce data comparable to data obtained with Method A-6. Such data should be submitted to EPA when requesting approval for the use of this method. EPA 520/1-89-009(24).
3.2 Methods for Gaseous Beta Emitting Radionuclides.
3.2.1 Method B-1, Direct Counting in Flow-Through Ionization Chambers.
Principle:
An ionization chamber containing a specific volume of gas which flows at a given flow rate through the chamber is used. The sample (effluent stream sample) acts as the counting gas for the chamber. The activity of the radionuclide is determined from the current measured in the ionization chamber.
Applicability:
This method is applicable for measuring the activity of a gaseous beta-emitting radionuclide in an effluent stream that is suitable as a counting gas, when no other beta-emitting nuclides are present. DOE/EP-0096(17), NCRP-58(23).
3.2.2 Method B-2, Direct Counting With In-line or Off-line Beta Detectors.
Principle:
The beta detector is placed directly in the effluent stream (in-line) or an extracted sample of the effluent stream is passed through a chamber containing a beta detector (off-line). The activities of the radionuclides present in the effluent stream are determined from the beta count rate, and a knowledge of the radionuclides present and the relationship of the gross beta count rate and the specific radionuclide concentration.
Applicability:
This method is applicable only to radionuclides with maximum beta particle energies greater then 0.2 MeV. This method may be used to measure emissions of specific radionuclides only when it is known that the sample contains only a single radionuclide or the identity and isotopic ratio of the radionuclides in the effluent stream are well known. Specific radionuclide analysis of periodic grab samples may be used to identify the types and quantities of radionuclides present and to establish the relationship between specific radionuclide analyses and gross beta count rates.
This method is applicable to unidentified mixtures of gaseous radionuclides only for the purposes and under the conditions described in section 3.7.
3.3 Methods for Non-Gaseous Beta Emitting Radionuclides.
3.3.1 Method B-3, Radiochemistry-Beta Counting.
Principle:
The element of interest is separated from other elements, and from the sample matrix by radiochemistry. This may involve precipitation, distillation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers (elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. The element is deposited on a planchet, and counted with a beta counter. Corrections for chemical yield, and decay (if necessary) are made. The beta count rate determines the total activity of all radionuclides of the separated element. This method may also involve the radiochemical separation and counting of a daughter element, after a suitable period of ingrowth, in which case it is specific for the parent nuclide.
Applicability:
This method is applicable for measuring the activity of any beta-emitting radionuclide, with a maximum energy greater than 0.2 MeV, provided no other radionuclide is present in the separated sample. APHA-608(5).
3.3.2 Method B-4, Direct Beta Counting (Gross beta determination).
Principle:
The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counted with a beta counter. The sample must be thin enough so that self-absorption corrections can be made.
Applicability:
Gross beta measurements are applicable only to radionuclides with maximum beta particle energies greater than 0.2 MeV. Gross beta measurements may be used to measure emissions of specific radionuclides only (1) when it is known that the sample contains only a single radionuclide, and (2) measurements made using Method B-3 show reasonable agreement with the gross beta measurement. Gross beta measurements are applicable to mixtures of radionuclides only for the purposes and under the conditions described in section 3.7. APHA-602(4), ASTM-D-1890(11).
3.3.3 Method B-5, Liquid Scintillation Spectrometry.
Principle:
An aliquot of a collected sample or the result of some other chemical separation or processing technique is added to a liquid scintillation “cocktail” which is viewed by photomultiplier tubes in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The spectrometer is adjusted to establish a channel or “window” for the pulse energy appropriate to the nuclide of interest. The activity of the nuclide of interest is measured by the counting rate in the appropriate energy channel. Corrections are made for chemical yield where separations are made.
Applicability:
This method is applicable to any beta-emitting nuclide when no other radionuclide is present in the sample or the separated sample provided that it can be incorporated in the scintillation cocktail. This method is also applicable for samples which contain more than one radionuclide but only when the energies of the beta particles are sufficiently separated so that they can be resolved by the spectrometer. This method is most applicable to the measurement of low-energy beta emitters such as tritium and carbon-14. APHA-609(6), EML-LV-539-17(19).
3.4 Gamma Emitting Radionuclides
3.4.1 Method G-1, High Resolution Gamma Spectrometry.
Principle:
The sample is counted with a high resolution gamma detector, usually either a Ge(Li) or a high purity Ge detector, connected to a multichannel analyzer or computer. The gamma emitting radionuclides in the sample are measured from the gamma count rates in the energy regions characteristic of the individual radionuclide. Corrections are made for counts contributed by other radionuclides to the spectral regions of the radionuclides of interest. Radiochemical separations may be made prior to counting but are usually not necessary.
Applicability:
This method is applicable to the measurement of any gamma emitting radionuclide with gamma energies greater than 20 keV. It can be applied to complex mixtures of radionuclides. The samples counted may be in the form of particulate filters, absorbers, liquids or gases. The method may also be applied to the analysis of gaseous gamma emitting radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by passing the stream through a chamber or cell containing the detector. ASTM-3649(9), IDO-12096(18).
3.4.2 Method G-2, Low Resolution Gamma Spectrometry.
Principle:
The sample is counted with a low resolution gamma detector, a thallium activated sodium iodide crystal. The detector is coupled to a photomultiplier tube and connected to a multichannel analyzer. The gamma emitting radionuclides in the sample are measured from the gamma count rates in the energy regions characteristic of the individual radionuclides. Corrections are made for counts contributed by other radionuclides to the spectral regions of the radionuclides of interest. Radiochemical separation may be used prior to counting to obtain less complex gamma spectra if needed.
Applicability:
This method is applicable to the measurement of gamma emitting radionuclides with energies greater than 100 keV. It can be applied only to relatively simple mixtures of gamma emitting radionuclides. The samples counted may be in the form of particulate filters, absorbers, liquids or gas. The method can be applied to the analysis of gaseous radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by passing the gas stream through a chamber or cell containing the detector. ASTM-D-2459(12), EMSL-LV-0539-17(19).
3.4.3 Method G-3, Single Channel Gamma Spectrometry.
Principle:
The sample is counted with a thallium activated sodium iodide crystal. The detector is coupled to a photomultiplier tube connected to a single channel analyzer. The activity of a gamma emitting radionuclide is determined from the gamma counts in the energy range for which the counter is set.
Applicability:
This method is applicable to the measurement of a single gamma emitting radionuclide. It is not applicable to mixtures of radionuclides. The samples counted may be in the form of particulate filters, absorbers, liquids or gas. The method can be applied to the analysis of gaseous radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by passing the gas stream through a chamber or cell containing the detector.
3.4.4 Method G-4, Gross Gamma Counting.
Principle:
The sample is counted with a gamma detector usually a thallium activated sodium iodine crystal. The detector is coupled to a photomultiplier tube and gamma rays above a specific threshold energy level are counted.
Applicability:
Gross gamma measurements may be used to measure emissions of specific radionuclides only when it is known that the sample contains a single radionuclide or the identity and isotopic ratio of the radionuclides in the effluent stream are well known. When gross gamma measurements are used to determine emissions of specific radionuclides periodic measurements using Methods G-1 or G-2 should be made to demonstrate that the gross gamma measurements provide reliable emission data. This method may be applied to analysis of gaseous radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by placing the detector directly in or adjacent to the effluent stream or passing an extracted sample of the effluent stream through a chamber or cell containing the detector.
3.5 Counting Methods. All of the above methods with the exception of Method A-5 involve counting the radiation emitted by the radionuclide. Counting methods applicable to the measurement of alpha, beta and gamma radiations are listed below. The equipment needed and the counting principles involved are described in detail in ASTM-3648(8).
3.5.1 Alpha Counting:
•
Gas Flow Proportional Counters.
The alpha particles cause ionization in the counting gas and the resulting electrical pulses are counted. These counters may be windowless or have very thin windows.
•
Scintillation Counters.
The alpha particles transfer energy to a scintillator resulting in a production of light photons which strike a
photomultiplier tube converting the light photons to electrical pulses which are counted. The counters may involve the use of solid scintillation materials such as zinc sulfide or liquid scintillation solutions.
•
Solid-State Counters.
Semiconductor materials, such as silicon surface-barrier p-n junctions, act as solid ionization chambers. The alpha particles interact which the detector producing electron hole pairs. The charged pair is collected by an applied electrical field and the resulting electrical pulses are counted.
•
Alpha Spectrometers.
Semiconductor detectors used in conjunction with multichannel analyzers for energy discrimination.
3.5.2 Beta Counting:
•
Ionization Chambers.
These chambers contain the beta-emitting nuclide in gaseous form. The ionization current produced is measured.
•
Geiger-Muller (GM) Counters-or Gas Flow Proportional Counters.
The beta particles cause ionization in the counting gas and the resulting electrical pulses are counted. Proportional gas flow counters which are heavily shielded by lead or other metal, and provided with an anti-coincidence shield to reject cosmic rays, are called low background beta counters.
•
Scintillation Counters.
The beta particles transfer energy to a scintillator resulting in a production of light photons, which strike a photomultiplier tube converting the light photon to electrical pulses which are counted. This may involve the use of anthracene crystals, plastic scintillator, or liquid scintillation solutions with organic phosphors.
•
Liquid Scintillation Spectrometers.
Liquid scintillation counters which use two photomultiplier tubes in coincidence to reduce background counts. This counter may also electronically discriminate among pulses of a given range of energy.
3.5.3 Gamma Counting:
•
Low-Resolution Gamma Spectrometers.
The gamma rays interact with thallium activated sodium iodide or cesium iodide crystal resulting in the release of light photons which strike a photomultiplier tube converting the light pulses to electrical pulses proportional to the energy of the gamma ray. Multi-channel analyzers are used to separate and store the pulses according to the energy absorbed in the crystal.
•
High-Resolution gamma Spectrometers.
Gamma rays interact with a lithium-drifted (Ge(Li)) or high-purity germanium (HPGe) semiconductor detectors resulting in a production of electron-hole pairs. The charged pair is collected by an applied electrical field. A very stable low noise preamplifier amplifies the pulses of electrical charge resulting from the gamma photon interactions. Multichannel analyzers or computers are used to separate and store the pulses according to the energy absorbed in the crystal.
•
Single Channel Analyzers.
Thallium activated sodium iodide crystals used with a single window analyzer. Pulses from the photomultiplier tubes are separated in a single predetermined energy range.
3.5.4 Calibration of Counters. Counters are calibrated for specific radionuclide measurements using a standard of the radionuclide under either identical or very similar conditions as the sample to be counted. For gamma spectrometers a series of standards covering the energy range of interest may be used to construct a calibration curve relating gamma energy to counting efficiency.
In those cases where a standard is not available for a radionuclide, counters may be calibrated using a standard with energy characteristics as similar as possible to the radionuclide to be measured. For gross alpha and beta measurements of the unidentified mixtures of radionuclides, alpha counters are calibrated with a natural uranium standard and beta counters with a cesium-137 standard. The standard must contain the same weight and distribution of solids as the samples, and be mounted in an identical manner. If the samples contain variable amounts of solids, calibration curves relating weight of solids present to counting efficiency are prepared. Standards other than those prescribed may be used provided it can be shown that such standards are more applicable to the radionuclide mixture measured.
3.6 Radiochemical Methods for Selected Radionuclides. Methods for a selected list of radionuclides are listed in Table 1. The radionuclides listed are those which are most commonly used and which have the greatest potential for causing doses to members of the public. For radionuclides not listed in Table 1, methods based on any of the applicable “principles of measurement” described in section 3.1 through 3.4 may be used.
3.7 Applicability of Gross Alpha and Beta Measurements to Unidentified Mixtures of Radionuclides. Gross alpha and beta measurements may be used as a screening measurement as a part of an emission measurement program to identify the need to do specific radionuclide analyses or to confirm or verify that unexpected radionuclides are not being released in significant quantities.
Gross alpha (Method A-4) or gross beta (Methods B-2 or B-4) measurements may also be used for the purpose of comparing the measured concentrations in the effluent stream with the limiting “Concentration Levels for Environmental Compliance” in table 2 of appendix E. For unidentified mixtures, the measured concentration value shall be compared with the lowest environmental concentration limit for any radionuclide which is not known to be absent from the effluent stream.

# Method 115—Monitoring for Radon-222 Emissions
This appendix describes the monitoring methods which must be used in determining the radon-222 emissions from underground uranium mines, uranium mill tailings piles, phosphogypsum stacks, and other piles of waste material emitting radon.
1.
Radon-222 Emissions from Underground Uranium Mine Vents

(d) The annual radon-222 emission rate is the sum of the weekly emission rates during a calendar year.
1.1.2 Periodic Measurement. This method is applicable only to mines that continuously operate their ventilation system except for extended shutdowns. Mines which start up and shut down their ventilation system frequently must use the continuous measurement method describe in Section 1.1.1 above. Emission rates determined using periodic measurements shall be measured and calculated as follows:
(a) The radon-222 shall be continuously measured at each mine vent for at least one week every three months.
(b) Each mine vent exhaust flow rate shall be measured at least once during each of the radon-222 measurement periods.
(c) A weekly radon-222 emission rate shall be calculated for each weekly period according to the method described in Section 1.1.1. In this calculation T = 168 hr.
(d) The annual radon-222 emission rate from the mine should be calculated as follows:
EC15NO91.090
Where:
A

n = Number of weekly measurement periods per year
W

= Number of weeks during the year that the mine ventilation system is shut down in excess of 7 consecutive days, i.e. the sum of the number of weeks each shut down exceeds 7 days
1.2 Test Methods and Procedures
Each underground mine required to test its emissions, unless an equivalent or alternative method has been approved by the Administrator, shall use the following test methods:
1.2.1 Test Method 1 of appendix A to part 60 shall be used to determine velocity traverses. The sampling point in the duct shall
be either the centroid of the cross section or the point of average velocity.
1.2.2 Test Method 2 of appendix A to part 60 shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates.
1.2.3 Test Methods A-6 or A-7 of appendix B, Method 114 to part 61 shall be used for the analysis of radon-222. Use of Method A-7 requires prior approval of EPA based on conditions described in appendix B.
1.2.4 A quality assurance program shall be conducted in conformance with the programs described for Continuous Radon Monitors and Alpha Track Detectors in EPA 520/1-89-009. (2)

Radon-222 Emissions from Uranium Mill Tailings Piles
2.1 Measurement and Calculation of Radon Flux from Uranium Mill Tailings Piles.
2.1.1 Frequency of Flux Measurement. A single set of radon flux measurements may be made, or if the owner or operator chooses, more frequent measurements may be made over a one year period. These measurements may involve quarterly, monthly or weekly intervals. All radon measurements shall be made as described in paragraphs 2.1.2 through 2.1.6 except that for measurements made over a one year period, the requirement of paragraph 2.1.4(c) shall not apply. The mean radon flux from the pile shall be the arithmetic mean of the mean radon flux for each measurement period. The weather conditions, moisture content of the tailings and area of the pile covered by water existing at the time of the measurement shall be chosen so as to provide measurements representative of the long term radon flux from the pile and shall be subject to EPA review and approval.
2.1.2 Distribution of Flux Measurements. The distribution and number of radon flux measurements required on a pile will depend on clearly defined areas of the pile (called regions) that can have significantly different radon fluxes due to surface conditions. The mean radon flux shall be determined for each individual region of the pile. Regions that shall be considered for operating mill tailings piles are:
(a) Water covered areas,
(b) Water saturated areas (beaches),
(c) Dry top surface areas, and
(d) Sides, except where earthen material is used in dam construction.
For mill tailings after disposal the pile shall be considered to consist of only one region.
2.1.3 Number of Flux Measurements. Radon flux measurements shall be made within each region on the pile, except for those areas covered with water. Measurements shall be made at regularly spaced locations across the surface of the region, realizing that surface roughness will prohibit measurements in some areas of a region. The minimum number of flux measurements considered necessary to determine a representative mean radon flux value for each type of region on an operating pile is:
(a) Water covered area—no measurements required as radon flux is assumed to be zero,
(b) Water saturated beaches—100 radon flux measurements,
(c) Loose and dry top surface—100 radon flux measurements,
(d) Sides—100 radon flux measurements, except where earthern material is used in dam construction.
For a mill tailings pile after disposal which consists of only one region a minimum of 100 measurements are required.
2.1.4 Restrictions to Radon Flux Measurements. The following restrictions are placed on making radon flux measurements:
(a) Measurements shall not be initiated within 24 hours of a rainfall.
(b) If a rainfall occurs during the 24 hour measurements period, the measurement is invalid if the seal around the lip of the collector has washed away or if the collector is surrounded by water.
(c) Measurements shall not be performed if the ambient temperature is below 35 °F or if the ground is frozen.
2.1.5 Areas of Pile Regions. The approximate area of each region of the pile shall be determined in units of square meters.
2.1.6 Radon Flux Measurement. Measuring radon flux involves the adsorption of radon on activated charcoal in a large-area collector. The radon collector is placed on the surface of the pile area to be measured and allowed to collect radon for a time period of 24 hours. The radon collected on the charcoal is measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy. The detailed measurement procedure provided in appendix A of EPA 520/5-85-0029(1) shall be used to measure the radon flux on uranium mill tailings, except the surface of the tailings shall not be penetrated by the lip of the radon collector as directed in the procedure, rather the collector shall be carefully positioned on a flat surface with soil or tailings used to seal the edge.
2.1.7 Calculations. The mean radon flux for each region of the pile and for the total pile shall be calculated and reported as follows:
(a) The individual radon flux calculations shall be made as provided in appendix A EPA 86 (1). The mean radon flux for each region of the pile shall be calculated by summing all individual flux measurements for the region and dividing by the total number of flux measurements for the region.
(b) The mean radon flux for the total uranium mill tailings pile shall be calculated as follows.

Any condition or unusual event that occurred during the measurements that could significantly affect the results should be reported.
3.0 Radon-222 Emissions from Phosphogypsum Stacks.
3.1 Measurement and Calculation of the Mean Radon Flux. Radon flux measurements shall be made on phosphogypsum stacks as described below:
3.1.1 Frequency of Measurements. A single set of radon flux measurements may be made after the phosphogypsum stack becomes inactive, or if the owner or operator chooses, more frequent measurements may be made over a one year period. These measurements may involve quarterly, monthly or weekly intervals. All radon measurements shall be made as described in paragraphs 3.1.2 through 3.1.6 except that for measurements made over a one year period, the requirement of paragraph 3.1.4(c) shall not apply. For measurements made over a one year period, the radon flux shall be the arithmetic mean of the mean radon flux for each measurement period.
3.1.2 Distribution and Number of Flux Measurements. The distribution and number of radon flux measurements required on a stack will depend on clearly defined areas of the stack (called regions) that can have significantly different radon fluxes due to surface conditions. The mean radon flux shall be determined for each individual region of the stack. Regions that shall be considered are:
(a) Water covered areas,
(b) Water saturated areas (beaches),
(c) Loose and dry top surface areas,
(d) Hard-packed roadways, and
(e) Sides.
3.1.3 Number of Flux Measurements. Radon flux measurements shall be made within each region on the phosphogypsum stack, except for those areas covered with water. Measurements shall be made at regularly spaced locations across the surface of the region, realizing that surface roughness will prohibit measurements in some areas of a region. The minimum number of flux measurements considered necessary to determine a representative mean radon flux value for each type of region is:
(a) Water covered area—no measurements required as radon flux is assumed to be zero,
(b) Water saturated beaches—50 radon flux measurements,
(c) Loose and dry top surface—100 radon flux measurements,
(d) Hard-packed roadways—50 radon flux measurements, and
(e) Sides—100 radon flux measurements.
A minimum of 300 measurements are required. A stack that has no water cover can be considered to consist of two regions, top and sides, and will require a minimum of only 200 measurements.
3.1.4 Restrictions to Radon Flux Measurements. The following restrictions are placed on making radon flux measurements:
(a) Measurements shall not be initiated within 24 hours of a rainfall.
(b) If a rainfall occurs during the 24 hour measurement period, the measurement is invalid if the seal around the lip of the collector has washed away or if the collector is surrounded by water.
(c) Measurements shall not be performed if the ambient temperature is below 35 °F or if the ground is frozen.
3.1.5 Areas of Stack Regions. The approximate area of each region of the stack shall be determined in units of square meters.

4.0 Quality Assurance Procedures for Measuring Rn-222 Flux

# A. Sampling Procedures
Records of field activities and laboratory measurements shall be maintained. The following information shall be recorded for each charcoal canister measurement:
(a) Site
(b) Name of pile
(c) Sample location
(d) Sample ID number
(e) Date and time on
(f) Date and time off
(g) Observations of meteorological conditions and comments
Records shall include all applicable information associated with determining the sample measurement, calculations, observations, and comments.

# B. Sample Custody
Custodial control of all charcoal samples exposed in the field shall be maintained in accordance with EPA chain-of-custody field procedures. A control record shall document all custody changes that occur between the field and laboratory personnel.

# C. Calibration Procedures and Frequency
The radioactivity of two standard charcoal sources, each containing a carefully determined quantity of radium-226 uniformly distributed through 180g of activated charcoal, shall be measured. An efficiency factor is computed by dividing the average measured radioactivity of the two standard charcoal sources, minus the background, in cpm by the known radioactivity of the charcoal sources in dpm. The same two standard charcoal sources shall be counted at the beginning and at the end of each day's counting as a check of the radioactivity counting equipment. A background count using unexposed charcoal should also be made at the beginning and at the end of each counting day to check for inadvertent contamination of the detector or other changes affecting the background. The unexposed charcoal comprising the blank is changed with each new batch of charcoal used.

# D. Internal Quality Control Checks and Frequency
The charcoal from every tenth exposed canister shall be recounted. Five percent of the samples analyzed shall be either blanks (charcoal having no radioactivity added) or samples spiked with known quantities of radium-226.

# E. Data Precision, Accuracy, and Completeness
The precision, accuracy, and completeness of measurements and analyses shall be within the following limits for samples measuring greater than 1.0 pCi/m
2
−s.
(a) Precision: 10%
(b) Accuracy: ±10%
(c) Completeness: at least 85% of the measurements must yield useable results.

# Appendix C to Part 61—Quality Assurance Procedures

# Procedure 1—Determination of Adequate Chromatographic Peak Resolution
In this method of dealing with resolution, the extent to which one chromatographic peak overlaps another is determined.
For convenience, consider the range of the elution curve of each compound as running from −2σ to + 2σ. This range is used in other resolution criteria, and it contains 95.45 percent of the area of a normal curve. If two peaks are separated by a known distance, b, one can determine the fraction of the area of one curve that lies within the range of the other. The extent to which the elution curve of a contaminant compound overlaps the curve of a compound that is under analysis is found by integrating the contaminant curve
over the limits b−2σ
s
to b + 2σ
s
, where σ
s
is the standard deviation of the sample curve.
This calculation can be simplified in several ways. Overlap can be determined for curves of unit area; then actual areas can be introduced. Desired integration can be resolved into two integrals of the normal distribution function for which there are convenient calculation programs and tables. An example would be Program 15 in Texas Instruments Program Manual ST1, 1975, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, Texas 75222.
EC01MY92.034
In judging the suitability of alternate GC columns or the effects of altering chromatographic conditions, one can employ the area overlap as the resolution parameter with a specific maximum permissible value.
The use of Gaussian functions to describe chromatographic elution curves is widespread. However, some elution curves are highly asymmetric. In cases where the sample peak is followed by a contaminant that has a leading edge that rises sharply but the curve then tails off, it may be possible to define an effective width for t
c
as “twice the distance from the leading edge to a perpendicular line through the maxim of the contaminant curve, measured along a perpendicular bisection of that line.”

# Procedure 2—Procedure for Field Auditing GC Analysis
Responsibilities of audit supervisor and analyst at the source sampling site include the following:
A. The audit supervisor verifies that audit cylinders are stored in a safe location both before and after the audit to prevent vandalism.
B. At the beginning and conclusion of the audit, the analyst records each cylinder number and pressure. An audit cylinder is never analyzed when the pressure drops below 200 psi.
C. During the audit, the analyst performs a minimum of two consecutive analyses of each audit cylinder gas. The audit must be conducted to coincide with the analysis of source test samples, normally immediately after GC calibration and prior to sample analyses.
D. At the end of audit analyses, the audit supervisor requests the calculated concentrations from the analyst and compares the results with the actual audit concentrations. If each measured concentration agrees with the respective actual concentration within ±10 percent, he directs the analyst to begin analyzing source samples. Audit supervisor judgment and/or supervisory policy determine action when agreement is not within ±10 percent. When a consistent bias in excess of 10 percent is found, it may be possible to proceed with the sample analysis, with a corrective factor to be applied to the results at a later time. However, every attempt should be made to locate the cause of the discrepancy, as it may be misleading. The audit supervisor records each cylinder number, cylinder pressure (at the end of the audit), and all calculated concentrations. The individual being audited must not under any circumstance be told actual audit concentrations until calculated concentrations have been submitted to the audit supervisor.

# Appendix D to Part 61—Methods for Estimating Radionuclide Emissions

# 1. Purpose and Background
Facility owners or operators may estimate radionuclide emissions to the atmosphere for dose calculations instead of measuring emissions. Particulate emissions from mill tailings piles should be estimated using the procedures listed in reference re #2. All other emissions may be estimated by using the
“Procedures” listed below, or using the method described in reference #1.

# 2. Procedure
To estimate emissions to the atmosphere:
(a) Determine the amount (in curies) used at facilities for the period under consideration. Radioactive materials in sealed packages that remain unopened, and have not leaked during the assessment period should not be included in the calculation.
(b) Multiply the amount used by the following factors which depend on the physical state of the radionuclide. They are:
(i) 1 for gases;
(ii) 10
−3
for liquids or particulate solids; and
(iii) 10
−6
for solids.
If any nuclide is heated to a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or more, boils at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or less, or is intentionally dispersed into the environment, it must be considered to be a gas.
(c) If a control device is installed between the place of use and the point of release, multiply emissions from (b) by an adjustment factor. These are presented in Table 1.

# Appendix E to Part 61—Compliance Procedures Methods for Determining Compliance With Subpart I

# 1. Purpose and Background
This Appendix provides simplified procedures to reduce the burden on Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees, and non-Department of Energy Federal facilities in determining compliance with 40 CFR part 61, subpart I. The procedures consist of a series of increasingly more stringent steps, depending on the facility's potential to exceed the standard.
First, a facility can be found in compliance if the quantity of radioactive material possessed during the year is less than that listed in a table of annual possession quantities. A facility will also be in compliance if the average annual radionuclide emission concentration is less than that listed in a table of air concentration levels. If the facility is
not in compliance by these tables, it can establish compliance by estimating a dose using screening procedure developed by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements with a radiological source term derived using EPA approved emission factors. These procedures are described in a “Guide for Determining Compliance with the Clean Air Act Standards for Radionuclide Emissions From NRC-Licensed and Non-DOE Federal Facilities.”
A user-friendly computer program called COMPLY has been developed to reduce the burden on the regulated community. The Agency has also prepared a “User's Guide for the COMPLY Code” to assist the regulated community in using the code, and in handling more complex situations such as multiple release points. The basis for these compliance procedures are provided in “Background Information Document: Procedures Approved for Demonstrating Compliance with 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart I”. The compliance model is the highest level in the COMPLY computer code and provides for the most realistic assessment of dose by allowing the use of site-specific information.

# 2. Table of Annual Possession Quantity
(a) Table 1 may be used for determining if facilities are in compliance with the standard. The possession table can only be used if the following conditions are met:
(i) No person lives within 10 meters of any release point; and
(ii) No milk, meat, or vegetables are produced within 100 meters of any release point.
(b) Procedures described in Reference (1) shall be used to determine compliance or exemption from reporting by use of Table 2.

* Radionuclides boiling at 100 °C or less, or exposed to a temperature of 100 °C, must be considered a gas. Capsules containing radionuclides in liquid or powder form can be considered to be solids.
** Mo-99 contained in a generator to produce Technetium-99 can be assumed to be a solid.

# 3. Table of Concentration Levels
(a) Table 2 may be used for determining if facilities are in compliance with the standard.
1. The concentration table as applied to emission estimates can only be used if all releases are from point sources and concentrations have been measured at the stack or vent using EPA-approved methods, and the distance between each stack or vent and the nearest resident is greater than 3 times the diameter of the stack or vent. Procedures provided in Ref. (1) shall be used to determine compliance or exemption from reporting by use of Table 2.
2. The concentration table may be used to determine compliance with the standard based on environmental measurements provided these measurements are made in conformance with the requirements of § 61.107(b)(5).

# 4. NCRP Screening Model
The procedures described in Reference (4) may be used to determine doses to members of the general public from emissions of radionuclides to the atmosphere. Both the total dose from all radionuclides emitted, and the dose caused by radioactive iodine must be considered in accordance with the procedures in Ref. (1).

# 5. The COMPLY Computer Code
The COMPLY computer code may be used to determine compliance with subpart I. The compliance model in the COMPLY computer code may be used to determine the dose to members of the general public from emissions of radionuclides to the atmosphere. The EPA may add radionuclides to all or any part of COMPLY to cover radionuclides that may be used by the regulated community.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 62.01
Definitions.
As used in this part, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Clean Air Act and in part 60 of this chapter.
§ 62.02
Introduction.
(a) This part sets forth the Administrator's approval and disapproval of State plans for the control of pollutants and facilities under section 111(d), and section 129 as applicable, of the Act, and the Administrator's promulgation of such plans or portions of plans thereof. Approval of a plan or any portion of a plan is based on a determination by the Administrator that it meets the requirements of section 111(d), and section 129 as applicable, of the Act and provisions of part 60 of this chapter.
(b)(1) If a State does not submit a complete, approvable plan, the Administrator may then promulgate a substitute plan or part of a plan. The promulgated provision, plus the approved parts of the State plan, constitute the applicable plan for purposes of the act.
(2) The part 60 subpart A of this chapter general provisions and appendices to part 60 apply to part 62, except as follows: 40 CFR 60.7(a)(1), 60.7(a)(3), and 60.8(a) and where special provisions set forth under the applicable subpart of this part shall apply instead of any conflicting provisions.
(c) The Administrator will promulgate substitute provisions for the disapproved regulatory provisions only. If a nonregulatory provision is disapproved, however, it will be noted in this part and a detailed explanation will be sent to the State.
(d) Section 62.12 provides information on availability of applicable plans. The Administrator and state and local agencies shall enforce
(1) Regulatory provisions of a plan approved or promulgated by the Administrator, and
(2) All permit conditions or denials issued in carrying out the approved or promulgated regulations for the review of designated facilities.
(e) Each State's plan is dealt with in a separate subpart, with separate headings for different pollutants and facilities. The plans shall include an introductory section identifying the plan by name and the date of its submittal. Additional sections are included as necessary to specifically identify disapproved provisions, to set forth reasons for disapproval, and to set forth provisions of the plan promulgated by the Administrator. Except as otherwise specified, all supplemental information submitted to the Administrator with respect to any plan has been submitted by the Governor of the State.
(f) Revisions to applicable plans will be included in this part when approved or promulgated by the Administrator.
(g) Substitute plans promulgated by the Administrator for States that do not have approved plans are contained in separate subparts that appear after the subparts for States. These Federal plans include sections identifying the applicability of the plan, emission limits, compliance schedules, recordkeeping and reporting, performance testing, and monitoring requirements.

§ 62.03
Extensions.
The Administrator may, whenever he determines necessary, extend the period for submission of any plan or plan revision or portion thereof.
§ 62.04
Approval status.
The approval status of each State's plan or portions thereof, are set forth in each subpart. All plans are approved unless specifically disapproved in the appropriate subpart.
§ 62.05
Legal authority.
(a) The Administrator's determination of the absence or inadequacy of legal authority required to be included in the plan is set forth in each subpart. This includes the legal authority of local agencies and State governmental agencies other than an air pollution control agency if such other agencies are assigned responsibility for carrying out a plan or portion thereof.
(b) No legal authority as such is promulgated by the Administrator. Where required regulatory provisions are not included in the plan by the State because of inadequate authority, substitute provisions are promulgated by the Administrator.
§ 62.06
Negative declarations.
A State may submit to the Administrator a letter certifying that no designated facilities exist in the State if such is the case. The negative declaration will be in lieu of a plan.
§ 62.07
Emission standards, compliance schedules.
(a) In each subpart, emission standards and compliance schedules which have been disapproved by the Administrator are identified, and those promulgated by the Administrator are set forth.
(b) The Administrator's approval or promulgation of any compliance schedule shall not affect the responsibility of the owner or operator to comply
with any applicable emission limitation on or after the date for final compliance specified in the applicable schedule.
§ 62.08
Emission inventories and source surveillance.
(a) Each subpart identifies the plan provisions for source surveillance which are disapproved, and sets forth the Administrator's promulgation of necessary provisions for requiring designated sources to maintain records, make reports, and submit information.
(b) The Administrator will not promulgate provisions for disapproved State or local agency procedures for testing, inspection, investigation, or detection. However, detailed critiques of such portions will be provided to the State.
§ 62.09
Revision of plans by Administrator.
After notice and opportunity for public hearing in each affected State, the Administrator may revise any provision of an applicable plan if:
(a) The provision was promulgated by the Administrator and
(b) The plan, as revised, will be consistent with the Act and with the requirements of part 60, subpart B of this chapter.

After de-rating is accomplished, the municipal waste combustor affected facility is no longer subject to this subpart.
§ 62.14109
Reporting and recordkeeping and compliance and performance testing.
(a) The owner or operator of an affected facility must comply with the reporting and recordkeeping provisions listed in 40 CFR 60.59b of subpart Eb, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.
(1) The siting requirements under 40 CFR 60.59b(a), (b)(5), and (d)(11) of subpart Eb and the notification of construction requirements under 40 CFR 60.59b(b) and (c) of subpart Eb do not apply.
(2) 40 CFR 60.54b, 60.56b, and 60.58b(g)(5)(iii) of subpart Eb do not apply to this subpart (see §§ 62.14105 and 62.14107 of this subpart).
(b) The owner or operator of an affected facility must comply with the compliance and performance testing methods and procedures listed in 40 CFR 60.58b of subpart Eb, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
(c) The initial performance test must be completed within 180 days after the date of final compliance specified in § 62.14108, rather than the date for the initial performance test specified in 40 CFR 60.58b of subpart Eb.
(d) The owner or operator of an affected facility may follow the alternative performance testing schedule for dioxin/furan emissions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(1) If all performance tests for all affected facilities at the MWC plant over a 2-year period indicate that dioxin/furan emissions are less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter total mass, corrected to 7 percent oxygen for all affected facilities located within a municipal waste combustor plant, the owner or operator of the municipal waste combustor plant may elect to conduct annual performance tests for one affected facility (i.e., unit) per year at the municipal waste combustor plant. At a minimum, a performance test for dioxin/furan emissions shall be conducted annually (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test) for one affected facility at the municipal waste combustor plant. Each year a different affected facility at the municipal waste combustor plant shall be tested, and the affected facilities at the plant shall be tested in sequence (e.g., unit 1, unit 2, unit 3, as applicable). If each annual performance test continues to indicate a dioxin/furan emission level less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass), the owner or operator may continue conducting a performance test on only one affected facility per year. If any annual performance test indicates a dioxin/furan emission level greater than 15 nanograms per dry standrd cubic meter (total mass), performance tests thereafter shall be conducted annually on all affected facilities at the plant until and unless all annual performance tests for all affected facilities at the plant over a 2-year period indicate a dioxin/furan emission level less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass).
(2) The owner or operator who is following the alternative performance testing schedule for dioxin/furan emissions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section may choose an alternative testing sequence (e.g., unit 1, 3, 2, 4) for affected facilities at the municipal waste combustor plant. The owner or operator must submit a request to EPA for approval of the alternative testing sequence. After approval, the alternative testing sequence is effective until a different testing sequence is received and approved by EPA.
(e) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF final rule to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must submit notification to
the EPA Regional Office within 10 business days of completing each increment. Each notification must indicate which increment of progress specified in § 62.14108(a)(1) through (a)(5) has been achieved. The notification must be signed by the owner or operator of the affected facility.
(f) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart who fails to meet any increment of progress specified in § 62.14108(a)(1) through (a)(5) according to the applicable schedule in § 62.14108 must submit notification to the EPA Regional Office within 10 business days of the applicable date in § 62.14108 that the owner or operator failed to meet the increment.
(g) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must submit a final control plan by the date specified in § 62.14108(b) with the notification required by § 62.14109(e). The final control plan must, at a minimum, include a description of the air pollution control devices or process changes that will be employed for each unit to comply with the emission limits and other requirements of this subpart.
(h) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must submit a signed copy of the contract or contracts awarded according to the requirements of § 62.14108(a)(2) with the notification required by § 62.14109(e).
(i) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must keep on site a copy of the final control plan required by § 62.14109(g).
(j) The owner or operator of an affected facility that plans to cease operation of the affected facility on or before December 19, 2000 rather than comply with the emission limits of this subpart by the applicable compliance date specified in § 62.14108 must submit a notification by the date specified for the final control plan according to the schedule specified in paragraphs § 62.14108(b)(1) through (b)(4), as applicable. (Affected facilities that cease operation on or before December 19, 2000 rather than comply with the emission limits of this subpart by the compliance date specified in § 62.14108 are not required to submit a final control plan.) The notification must state the date by which the affected facility will cease operation. If the cease operation date is later than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF, the owner or operator must enter into a legally binding closure agreement with EPA by the date the final control plan is due. The agreement must specify the date by which operation will cease.
(k) The owner or operator of an affected facility that plans to de-rate the affected facility on or before December 19, 2000 rather than comply with the emission limits of this subpart by the compliance date specified in § 62.14108 must submit a final control plan as required by paragraph (g) of this section and submit notification of increments of progress as required by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and § 62.14108(e) of this subpart.
(1) The final control plan must, at a minimum, include the information in paragraphs (k)(1)(i) and (k)(1)(ii) of this section rather than the information in paragraph (g) of this section.
(i) A description of the physical changes that will be made to accomplish the de-rating.
(ii) Calculations of the current maximum combustion capacity and the planned maximum combustion capacity after the de-rating. (See the procedures specified in 40 CFR 60.58b(j) of subpart Eb for calculating municipal waste combustor unit capacity.)
(2) The owner or operator must submit a signed copy of the contract or contracts awarded to initiate the de-rating with the notification required by paragraph (e) of this section.
(l) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is ceasing operation more than 1 year following the date of publication of this subpart FFF must
submit performance test results for dioxin/furan emissions conducted during or after 1990 for each affected facility by the date 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF. The performance test shall be conducted according to the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section.
(m) The owner or operator (or the State air pollution control authority) that is submitting alternative dates for increments 2, 3, and 4 according to § 62.14108(b)(4) must submit the alternative dates by the date specified for the final control plan according to the schedule specified in paragraphs § 62.14108 (b)(1) and (b)(2), as applicable. The owner or operator (or the State air pollution control authority) must submit a justification if any of the alternative dates are later than the increment dates in tables 4 or 5 of this subpart. The owner or operator must also submit the alternative dates and justification to the State.

# Subpart GGG—Federal Plan Requirements for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills That Commenced Construction Prior to May 30, 1991 and Have Not Been Modified or Reconstructed Since May 30, 1991

# Source:
64 FR 60703, Nov. 8, 1999, unless otherwise noted.
§ 62.14350
Scope and delegation of authority.
(a) This subpart contains emission requirements and compliance schedules for the control of designated pollutants from certain municipal solid waste landfills in accordance with section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subpart B. This municipal solid waste landfills Federal plan applies to each designated facility as defined in § 62.14352 of this subpart that is not covered by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan.
(b) The following authorities shall be retained by the Administrator and not transferred to the State or Tribe upon delegation of authority to the State or Tribe to implement and enforce the Federal plan pursuant to sections 101(a)(3) and 111 of the Clean Air Act:
(1) Approval of alternative methods to determine site-specific NMOC concentration (C
NMOC
) or site-specific methane generation rate constant (k) used in calculating the annual NMOC emission rate (as provided in 40 CFR 60.754(a)(5) of subpart WWW),
(2) Alternative emission standards,
(3) Major alternatives
1
to test methods,
1
Major changes to test methods or to monitoring are modifications made to a federally enforceable test method or to a federal monitoring requirement. These changes would involve the use of unproven technology or procedures or an entirely new method (which is sometimes necessary when the required test method or monitoring requirement is unsuitable).
(4) Major alternatives to monitoring, or
(5) Waivers of recordkeeping.
§ 62.14351
Definitions.
Terms used but not defined in this subpart have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subparts A, B, and WWW.
Achieve final compliance
means to connect and operate the collection and control system as specified in the final control plan. Within 180 days after the date the landfill is required to achieve final compliance, the initial performance test must be conducted.
Award contract
means the MSW landfill owner or operator enters into legally binding agreements or contractual obligations that cannot be canceled or modified without substantial financial loss to the MSW landfill owner or operator. The MSW landfill owner or operator may award a number of contracts to install the collection and control system. To meet this increment of progress, the MSW landfill owner or operator must award a contract or contracts to initiate on-site construction or installation of the collection and control system.
Complete on-site construction
means that all necessary collection system components and air pollution control devices identified in the final control plan are on site, in place, and ready for operation.
Design capacity
means the maximum amount of solid waste a landfill can accept, as indicated in terms of volume or mass in the most recent permit issued by the State, local, or Tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, plus any in-place waste not accounted for in the most recent permit. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site-specific density, which must be recalculated annually.
EPA approved State plan
means a State plan that EPA has approved based on the requirements in 40 CFR part 60, subpart B to implement and enforce 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc. An approved State plan becomes effective on the date specified in the notice published in the
Federal Register
announcing EPA's approval.
Federal Indian Reservation
means for purposes of the Clean Air Act, all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the
United States government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-way running through the reservation.
Final control plan (Collection and control system design plan)
means a plan that describes the collection and control system that will capture the gas generated within an MSW landfill. The collection and control system design plan must be prepared by a professional engineer and must describe a collection and control system that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 60.752(b)(2)(ii). The final control plan must contain engineering specifications and drawings of the collection and control system. The final control plan must include any alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting provisions of 40 CFR 60.753 through 60.758 proposed by the owner or operator. The final control plan must either conform with the specifications for active collection systems in 40 CFR 60.759 or include a demonstration that shows that based on the size of the landfill and the amount of waste expected to be accepted, the system is sized properly to collect the gas, control emissions of NMOC to the required level and meet the operational standards for a landfill.
Indian Country

§ 62.14352
Designated facilities.
(a) The designated facility to which this subpart applies is each municipal solid waste landfill in all States, protectorates, and Indian Country that meets the conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, except for landfills exempted by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(1) The municipal solid waste landfill commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification before May 30, 1991 (landfills that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after May 30, 1991 are subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW), and
(2) The municipal solid waste landfill has accepted waste at any time since November 8, 1987 or the landfill has additional capacity for future waste deposition.
(b) A municipal solid waste landfill regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan is not subject to the requirements of this subpart. States that have an approved and effective State plan are listed in table 1 of this subpart. Notwithstanding the exclusions in table 1 of this subpart, any MSW landfill located in a State or portion of Indian country that does not have an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan is subject to the requirements of this subpart.
(c) A municipal solid waste landfill located in a State, locality, or portion of Indian country that submitted a negative declaration letter is not subject to the requirements of this subpart other than the requirements in the definition of design capacity to recalculate the site-specific density annually and in § 62.14355 to submit an amended design capacity report in the event that the recalculated design capacity is equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. However, if the existing municipal solid waste landfill already has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, then it is subject to the requirements of the Federal plan. States, localities, or portions of Indian country that submitted negative declaration letters are listed in table 2 of this subpart.
(d) Physical or operational changes made to an existing municipal solid waste landfill solely to comply with an emission guideline are not considered a modification or reconstruction and would not subject an existing municipal solid waste landfill to the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW.
(e) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters is not subject to the requirement to obtain an operating permit for the landfill under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, unless the landfill is otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71. For purposes of submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters on January 7, 2,000 and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or § 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter April 6, 2000, even if the initial design capacity report is submitted earlier. In addition, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters on January 7, 2000, and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, but whose design capacity subsequently increases to equal or exceed 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters by a change that is not a modification or reconstruction becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or § 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter upon the date the amended design capacity report is due.
(f) When a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart is closed, the owner or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to maintain an operating permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter for the landfill if the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements of either
part 70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met:
(1) The landfill was never subject to the requirement for a control system under § 62.14353 of this subpart; or
(2) The owner or operator meets the conditions for control system removal specified in 40 CFR 60.752(b)(2)(v).
§ 62.14353

§ 62.14401
How do I determine if my HMIWI is covered by an approved and effective State or Tribal plan?
This part (40 CFR part 62) contains a list of all states and tribal areas with approved Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d)/129 plans in effect. However, this part is only updated once a year. Thus, if this part does not indicate that your state or tribal area has an approved and effective plan, you should contact your state environmental agency's air director or your EPA Regional Office to determine if approval occurred since publication of the most recent version of this part. A state may also meet its CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations by submitting an acceptable written request for delegation of the federal plan that meets the requirements of this section. This is the only other option for a state to meet its 111(d)/129 obligations.
(a) An acceptable Federal plan delegation request must include the following:
(1) A demonstration of adequate resources and legal authority to administer and enforce the Federal plan.
(2) The items under §§ 60.25(a) and 60.39e(c).
(3) Certification that the hearing on the state delegation request, similar to the hearing for a state plan submittal, was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.
(4) A commitment to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator who sets forth the terms, conditions and effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for the transfer of authority. Additional guidance and information is given in the EPA's Delegation Manual, Item 7-139, Implementation and Enforcement of 111(d)(2) and 111(d)(2)/129(b)(3) Federal plans.
(b) A state with an already approved HMIWI CAA section 111(d)/129 state plan is not precluded from receiving EPA approval of a delegation request for the revised Federal plan, providing the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and at the time of the delegation request, the state also requests withdrawal of the EPA's previous state plan approval.
(c) A state's CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations are separate from its obligations under Title V of the CAA.
[78 FR 28066, May 13, 2013]
§ 62.14402
If my HMIWI is not listed on the Federal plan inventory, am I exempt from this subpart?
Not necessarily. Sources subject to this subpart include, but are not limited to, the inventory of sources listed in Docket ID Number EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0405 for the federal plan. Review the applicability of § 62.14400 to determine if you are subject to this subpart.

# Waste Management Plan
§ 62.14430
Must I prepare a waste management plan?
Yes. All HMIWI owners or operators must have a waste management plan.
§ 62.14431
What must my waste management plan include?
(a) Your waste management plan must identify both the feasibility of, and the approach for, separating certain components of solid waste from the health care waste stream in order to reduce the amount of toxic emissions from incinerated waste. The waste management plan you develop may address, but is not limited to, elements such as segregation and recycling of paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, batteries, food waste and metals (
e.g.,
aluminum cans, metals-containing devices); segregation of non-recyclable wastes (
e.g.,
polychlorinated biphenyl-containing waste, pharmaceutical waste, and mercury-containing waste such as dental waste); and purchasing recycled or recyclable products. Your waste management plan may include different goals or approaches for different areas or departments of the facility and need not include new waste management goals for every waste stream. When you develop your waste management plan, it should identify, where possible, reasonably available additional waste management measures, taking into account the effectiveness of waste management measures already in place, the costs of additional measures, the emissions reductions expected to be achieved, and any other potential environmental or energy impacts they might have. In developing your waste management plan, you must consider the American Hospital Association (AHA) publication titled “Ounce of Prevention: Waste Reduction Strategies for Health Care Facilities.” This publication (AHA Catalog Number 057007) is available for purchase from AHA Services, Inc., Post Office Box 933283, Atlanta, Georgia 31193-3283.
(b) If you own or operate commercial HMIWI, you must conduct training and education programs in waste segregation for each of your waste generator clients and ensure that each client prepares its own waste management plan that includes, but is not limited to, the provisions listed in this section.
(c) If you own or operate commercial HMIWI, you must conduct training and education programs in waste segregation for your HMIWI operators.

and fugitive ash emissions using the test methods and procedures outlined in § 62.14452.
(b) After the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 62.14470, whichever date comes first, you must:
(1) Determine compliance with the opacity limit by conducting an annual performance test (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test) using the applicable procedures and test methods listed in § 62.14452.
(2) Determine compliance with the PM, CO, and HCl emission limits by conducting an annual performance test (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test) using the applicable procedures and test methods listed in § 62.14452. If all three performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), you may forego a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. At a minimum, you must conduct a performance test for PM, CO, and HCl every third year (no more than 36 months following the previous performance test). If a performance test conducted every third year indicates compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), you may forego a performance test for that pollutant for an additional 2 years. If any performance test indicates noncompliance with the respective emission limit, you must conduct a performance test for that pollutant annually until all annual performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance with the emission limit.
(3) If you use a large HMIWI that commenced construction or modification according to § 62.14400(a)(2)(ii), determine compliance with the visible emissions limits for fugitive emissions from flyash/bottom ash storage and handling by conducting a performance test using EPA Reference Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 on an annual basis (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test).
(c) The 2,000 lb/wk limitation for small rural HMIWI does not apply during performance tests.

(2) The HMIWI at your facility must currently be operated in a manner (
e.g.,
with charge rate, secondary chamber temperature, etc.) that would be expected to result in the same or lower emissions than observed during the previous emissions test(s), and the HMIWI may not have been modified such that emissions would be expected to exceed the results from previous emissions test(s).
(3) The previous emissions test(s) must have been conducted in 1996 or later.
[65 FR 49881, Aug. 15, 2000, as amended at 78 FR 28068, May 13, 2013]
§ 62.14452

(o) If you are using a CEMS to demonstrate compliance with any of the emissions limits under §§ 62.14411 or 62.14412, you:
(1) Must determine compliance with the appropriate emissions limit(s) using a 12-hour rolling average, calculated as specified in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. Performance tests using EPA Reference Methods are not required for pollutants monitored with CEMS.
(2) Must operate a CEMS to measure oxygen concentration, adjusting pollutant concentrations to 7 percent oxygen as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
(3) Must operate all CEMS in accordance with the applicable procedures under appendices B and F of 40 CFR part 60. For those CEMS for which performance specifications have not yet been promulgated (HCl, multi-metals), this option takes effect on the date a final performance specification is published in the
Federal Register
or the date of approval of a site-specific monitoring plan.
(4) May substitute use of a CO CEMS for the CO annual performance test and minimum secondary chamber temperature to demonstrate compliance with the CO emissions limit.
(5) May substitute use of an HCl CEMS for the HCl annual performance test, minimum HCl sorbent flow rate and minimum scrubber liquor pH to demonstrate compliance with the HCl emissions limit.

(p) If you are using a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with the dioxin/
furan emissions limits, you must record the output of the system and analyze the sample according to EPA Reference Method 23 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. This option to use a continuous automated sampling system takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to dioxin/furan from monitors is published in the
Federal Register
or the date of approval of a site-specific monitoring plan. If you elect to continuously sample dioxin/furan emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Reference Method 23 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, you must install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous automated sampling system and comply with the requirements specified in 40 CFR 60.58b(p) and (q) of subpart Eb.
(q) If you are using a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with the Hg emissions limits, you must record the output of the system and analyze the sample at set intervals using any suitable determinative technique that can meet appropriate performance criteria. This option to use a continuous automated sampling system takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to Hg from monitors is published in the
Federal Register
or the date of approval of a site-specific monitoring plan. If you elect to continuously sample Hg emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Reference Method 29 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, or an approved alternative method for measuring Hg emissions, you must install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous automated sampling system and comply with the requirements specified in 40 CFR 60.58b(p) and (q) of subpart Eb.
(r) Use of the bypass stack during a performance test will invalidate the performance test.

§ 62.14453
What must I monitor?
(a) If your HMIWI uses combustion control only, or your HMIWI is equipped with a dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter (FF), a wet scrubber, a dry scrubber followed by a FF and wet scrubber, or a selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR) system:
(1) You must establish the appropriate maximum and minimum operating parameters, indicated in Table 3, as site-specific operating parameters during the initial performance test to determine compliance with the emission limits; and
(2) After the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 62.14470, whichever comes first, your HMIWI must not operate above any of the applicable maximum operating parameters or below any of the applicable minimum operating parameters listed in Table 3 and measured as 3-hour rolling averages (calculated each hour as the average of the previous 3 operating hours), at all times except during performance tests.
(b) If you are using an air pollution control device other than a dry scrubber followed by a FF, a wet scrubber, a dry scrubber followed by a FF and a wet scrubber, or a SNCR system to comply with the emissions limits under § 62.14411, you must petition the EPA Administrator for site-specific operating parameters to be established during the initial performance test and you must continuously monitor those parameters thereafter. You may not conduct the initial performance test until the EPA Administrator has approved the petition.
[65 FR 49881, Aug. 15, 2000, as amended at 78 FR 28069, May 13, 2013]
§ 62.14454
How must I monitor the required parameters?
(a) Except as provided in §§ 62.14452(o) through (q), you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate devices (or establish methods) for monitoring the applicable maximum and minimum operating parameters listed in Table 3 of this subpart (unless CEMS are used as a substitute for certain parameters as specified) such that these devices (or methods) measure and record values for the operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in Table 3 of this subpart at all times. For charge rate, the device must measure and record the date, time and weight of each charge fed to the HMIWI. This must be done automatically, meaning that the only intervention from an operator
during the process would be to load the charge onto the weighing device. For batch HMIWI, the maximum charge rate is measured on a daily basis (the amount of waste charged to the unit each day).
(b) For all HMIWI, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate a device or method for measuring the use of the bypass stack, including the date, time and duration of such use.
(c) For all HMIWI, if you are using controls other than a dry scrubber followed by a FF, a wet scrubber, a dry scrubber followed by a FF and a wet scrubber, or a SNCR system to comply with the emissions limits under § 62.14411, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate the equipment necessary to monitor the site-specific operating parameters developed pursuant to § 62.14453(b).
(d) You must obtain monitoring data at all times during HMIWI operation except during periods of monitoring equipment malfunction, calibration, or repair. At a minimum, valid monitoring data must be obtained for 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter that your HMIWI is combusting hospital waste and/or medical/infectious waste.
(e) If you use an air pollution control device that includes a FF and are not demonstrating compliance using PM CEMS, you must determine compliance with the PM emissions limit using a bag leak detection system and meet the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (12) of this section for each bag leak detection system.
(1) Each triboelectric bag leak detection system must be installed, calibrated, operated and maintained according to the “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance,” (EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997). This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D-243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emissions Measurement Center Continuous Emissions Monitoring. Other types of bag leak detection systems must be installed, operated, calibrated and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.
(2) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.
(3) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide an output of relative PM loadings.
(4) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor.
(5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an audible alarm system that will sound automatically when an increase in relative PM emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is easily heard by plant operating personnel.
(6) For positive pressure FF systems, a bag leak detector must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.
(7) For negative pressure or induced air FF, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the FF.
(8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
(9) The baseline output must be established by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time according to section 5.0 of the “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance.”
(10) Following initial adjustment of the system, the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points or alarm delay time may not be adjusted. In no case may the sensitivity be increased by more than 100 percent or decreased more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete FF inspection that demonstrates that the FF is in good operating condition. Each adjustment must be recorded.
(11) Record the results of each inspection, calibration and validation check.
(12) Initiate corrective action within 1 hour of a bag leak detection system alarm; operate and maintain the FF such that the alarm is not engaged for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period. If inspection of the FF demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm is counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time is counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action.

# Permitting Obligation
§ 62.14480
Does this subpart require me to obtain an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act and implementing regulations?
This subpart requires you to obtain an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act and implementing regulations (“title V permit”) unless you are only subject to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements listed at § 62.14400(b)(1) or (b)(2), and § 62.14400(c), of this subpart. Also, if you own or operate a unit described in § 62.14400(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5) or (b)(6), you are not subject to any requirements of this subpart; therefore, this subpart does not require you to obtain a title V permit.
§ 62.14481
When must I submit a title V permit application for my HMIWI?
You must submit a title V permit application in time for it to be determined or deemed complete by no later than September 15, 2000 or by the effective date of a title V permits program in the jurisdiction in which the unit is located, whichever is later. (An earlier deadline may apply if your HMIWI is
also subject to title V permitting requirements because of some other triggering requirement.) A “complete” title V permit application is one that has been approved by the appropriate permitting authority as complete under Section 503 of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR parts 70 and 71. It is not enough to have submitted a title V permit application by September 15, 2000 because the application must be determined or deemed complete by the permitting authority by that date for your HMIWI to operate after that date in compliance with Federal law.

# Applicability
§ 62.14510
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a CISWI unit as defined in § 62.14840 and the CISWI unit meets the criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.
(1) Construction of your CISWI unit commenced on or before November 30, 1999.
(2) Your CISWI unit is not exempt under § 62.14525.
(3) Your CISWI unit is not regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan, or your CISWI unit is located in any State whose approved State or Tribal plan is subsequently vacated in whole or in part.
(b) If you made changes after June 1, 2001 that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction after promulgation of the final 40 CFR part 60 subpart CCCC (New Source Performance Standards for Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units), your CISWI unit is subject to subpart CCCC of 40 CFR part 60 and this subpart no longer applies to that unit.
(c) If you make physical or operational changes to your existing CISWI unit primarily to comply with this subpart, then such changes do not qualify as modifications or reconstructions under subpart CCCC of 40 CFR part 60.
(d) On and after January 10, 2025, CISWI will no longer be subject to the requirements of this subpart and instead will be subject to the requirements of subpart IIIa of this part.
[68 FR 57539, Oct. 3, 2003, as amended at 89 FR 100105, Dec. 11, 2024]
§ 62.14515
Can my CISWI unit be covered by both a State plan and this subpart?
(a) If your CISWI unit is located in a State that does not have an EPA-approved State plan or your State's plan has not become effective, this subpart applies to your CISWI unit until the EPA approves a State plan that covers your CISWI unit and that State plan becomes effective. However, a State may enforce the requirements of a
State regulation while your CISWI unit is still subject to this subpart.
(b) After the EPA approves a State plan covering your CISWI unit, and after that State plan becomes effective, you will no longer be subject to this subpart and will only be subject to the approved and effective State plan.
§ 62.14520
How do I determine if my CISWI unit is covered by an approved and effective State or Tribal plan?
This part (40 CFR part 62) contains a list of State and Tribal areas with approved Clean Air Act section 111(d) and section 129 plans along with the effective dates for such plans. The list is published annually. If this part does not indicate that your State or Tribal area has an approved and effective plan, you should contact your State environmental agency's air director or your EPA Regional Office to determine if the EPA has approved a State plan covering your unit since publication of the most recent version of this subpart.
§ 62.14521
If my CISWI unit is not listed in the Federal plan inventory, am I exempt from this subpart?
If a CISWI unit is not listed in the Federal plan inventory, it is not necessarily exempt from this subpart. Sources subject to this subpart are not limited to the inventory of sources listed in Docket A-2000-52 for the Federal plan. If your CISWI units meets the applicability criteria in § 62.14510, this subpart applies to you whether or not your unit is listed in the Federal plan inventory in the docket.

If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, or limit emissions in some other manner, to comply with the emission limitations under § 62.14630, you must petition the Administrator for specific operating limits to be established during the initial performance test and continuously monitored thereafter. You must not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has been approved by the Administrator. Your petition must include the five items listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
(a) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as additional operating limits.
(b) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated pollutants.
(c) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower values for these parameters which will establish the operating limits on these parameters.
(d) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments.
(e) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these parameters.
§ 62.14645
What happens during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction?

§ 62.14655
How are the performance test data used?
You use results of performance tests to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations in Table 1 of this subpart.

# Initial Compliance Requirements
§ 62.14660
How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations and establish the operating limits?
You must conduct an initial performance test, as required under 40 CFR 60.8, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in Table 1 of this subpart and to establish operating limits using the procedure in § 62.14635 or § 62.14640. The initial performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 1 of this subpart and the procedures in § 62.14650.
§ 62.14665
By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?
The initial performance test must be conducted no later than 90 days after your final compliance date.

# Continuous Compliance Requirements
§ 62.14670
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations and the operating limits?
(a) You must conduct an annual performance test for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, and opacity for each CISWI unit as required under 40 CFR 60.8 to determine compliance with the emission limitations. The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 1 of this subpart and the procedures in § 62.14650.
(b) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified in § 62.14635 or established under § 62.14640. Operation above the established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. Three-hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance (except for baghouse leak detection system alarms) unless a different averaging period is established under § 62.14640. Operating limits do not apply during performance tests.
(c) You must only burn the same types of waste used to establish operating limits during the performance test.
§ 62.14675
By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?
You must conduct annual performance tests for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, and opacity within 12 months following the initial performance test. Conduct subsequent annual performance tests within 12 months following the previous one.
§ 62.14680
May I conduct performance testing less often?
(a) You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test data for at least 3 years, and all performance tests for the pollutant (particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity) over 3 consecutive years show that you comply with the emission limitation. In this case, you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the third year
and no later than 36 months following the previous performance test.
(b) If your CISWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you may choose to conduct performance tests for these pollutants every third year, but each test must be within 36 months of the previous performance test.
(c) If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission limitation for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all performance tests over a 3-year period show compliance.
§ 62.14685
May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish new operating limits?
(a) Yes. You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.
(b) You must repeat the performance test if your feed stream is different than the feed streams used during any performance test used to demonstrate compliance.

# Air Curtain Incinerators That Burn 100 Percent Wood Wastes, Clean Lumber and/or Yard Waste
§ 62.14765
What is an air curtain incinerator?
An air curtain incinerator operates by forcefully projecting a curtain of air across an open chamber or open pit in which combustion occurs. Incinerators of this type can be constructed above or below ground and with or without refractory walls and floor. (Air curtain incinerators are different from conventional combustion devices which typically have enclosed fireboxes and controlled air technology such as mass burn, modular, and fluidized bed combustors.)
§ 62.14770
When must I achieve final compliance?
If you plan to continue operating, then you must achieve final compliance by October October 4, 2004. It is unlawful for your air curtain incinerator to operate after October 4, 2004 if you have not achieved final compliance. An air curtain incinerator that continues to operate after October 4, 2004 without being in compliance is subject to penalties.
§ 62.14795
How do I achieve final compliance?
For the final compliance, you must complete all equipment changes and retrofit installation control devices so that, when the affected air curtain incinerator is placed into service, all necessary equipment and air pollution control devices operate as designed and meet the opacity limits of § 62.14815.
§ 62.14805
What must I do if I close my air curtain incinerator and then restart it?
(a) If you close your incinerator but will reopen it prior to the final compliance date in this subpart, you must achieve final compliance by October 4, 2004.
(b) If you close your incinerator but will restart it after October 4, 2004, you must have completed any needed emission control retrofits and meet the opacity limits of § 62.14815 on the date your incinerator restarts operation.
(c) You are subject to the operating permit requirements of title V of the CAA and 40 CFR part 70 or 71 until you close your air curtain incinerator and at the time you restart it.
§ 62.14810
What must I do if I plan to permanently close my air curtain incinerator and not restart it?
If you plan to permanently close your incinerator rather than comply with this subpart, you must submit a closure notification, including the date of closure, to the Administrator by March 31, 2004. In addition, while still in operation, your air curtain incinerator is subject to the same requirement to apply for and obtain a title V operating permit that applies to an air curtain incinerator that will not be permanently closing.
§ 62.14815
What are the emission limitations for air curtain incinerators that burn 100 percent wood wastes, clean lumber and/or yard waste?
(a) After the date the initial test for opacity is required or completed (whichever is earlier), you must meet the limitations in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) The opacity limitation is 10 percent (6-minute average), except as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) The opacity limitation is 35 percent (6-minute average) during the startup period that is within the first 30 minutes of operation.
(b) Except during malfunctions, the requirements of this subpart apply at all times, and each malfunction must not exceed 3 hours.
§ 62.14820
How must I monitor opacity for air curtain incinerators that burn 100 percent wood wastes, clean lumber, and/or yard waste?
(a) Use Method 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to determine compliance with the opacity limitation.
(b) Conduct an initial test for opacity as specified in § 60.8 no later than January 2, 2005.
(c) After the initial test for opacity, conduct annual tests no more than 12 calendar months following the date of your previous test.
§ 62.14825
What are the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air curtain incinerators that burn 100 percent wood wastes, clean lumber, and/or yard waste?
(a) Keep records of results of all initial and annual opacity tests onsite in either paper copy or electronic format, unless the Administrator approves another format, for at least 5 years.
(b) Make all records available for submittal to the Administrator or for an inspector's onsite review.
(c) Submit an initial report no later than 60 days following the initial opacity test that includes the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) The types of materials you plan to combust in your air curtain incinerator.
(2) The results (each 6-minute average) of the initial opacity tests.
(d) Submit annual opacity test results within 12 months following the previous report.
(e) Submit initial and annual opacity test reports as electronic or paper copy on or before the applicable submittal date and keep a copy onsite for a period of five years.

# Title V Requirements
§ 62.14830
Does this subpart require me to obtain an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act?
If you are subject to this subpart, you are required to apply for and obtain a title V operating permit unless you meet the relevant requirements specified in 40 CFR 62.14525(a) through (h) and (j) through (o) and all of the requirements specified in 40 CFR 62.14531.
§ 62.14835
When must I submit a title V permit application for my existing CISWI unit?

# Introduction
§ 62.14500a
What is the purpose of this subpart?
(a) This subpart establishes emission requirements and compliance schedules for the control of emissions from commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units (CISWI) that are not covered, or are only partially covered, by an EPA approved and currently effective state or tribal plan. The pollutants addressed by the emission requirements in this subpart are listed in tables 4 through 7 to this subpart. The emission requirements in this subpart were developed in accordance with sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subpart B.
(b) In this subpart, “you” means the owner or operator of a CISWI.
§ 62.14505a

This subpart contains the ten major components listed in paragraphs (a) through (j) of this section.
(a) Waste management plan.
(b) Operator training and qualification.
(c) Emission limitations and operating limits.
(d) Performance testing.
(e) Initial compliance requirements.
(f) Continuous compliance requirements.
(g) Monitoring.
(h) Recordkeeping and reporting.
(i) Definitions.
(j) Tables.

# Applicability
§ 62.14510a
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a CISWI as defined in § 62.14780a or an air curtain incinerator as defined in § 62.14780a and the CISWI or air curtain incinerator meets the criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) Construction of your CISWI or air curtain incinerator commenced on or before June 4, 2010, and have not been modified or reconstructed since August 7, 2013.
(2) Your CISWI is not exempt under § 62.14530a.
(3) Your CISWI is not regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective state or tribal plan, or your CISWI is located in any state whose approved state or tribal plan is only approved in part. In the case of a state or tribal program that is approved in part, the Federal plan applies to affected CISWI in lieu of the disapproved portions of the state or tribal program until the state or tribe plan addresses the deficiencies and the revised plan is approved by the EPA.
(b) If changes to the CISWI are made after August 7, 2013, that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction in this subpart, your CISWI is subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart CCCC, and this subpart no longer applies to that unit.
(c) If you make physical or operational changes to your existing CISWI primarily to comply with this subpart, then such changes do not qualify as modifications or reconstructions under 40 CFR part 60, subpart CCCC.
§ 62.14515a
Can my CISWI be covered by both a state plan and this subpart?
(a) If your CISWI is located in a state that does not have an EPA-approved state plan or your state's plan has not become effective, this subpart applies to your CISWI until the EPA approves a state plan that covers your CISWI and that state plan becomes effective. However, a state may enforce the requirements of a state regulation while your CISWI is still subject to this subpart.
(b) After the EPA fully approves a state plan covering your CISWI, and after that state plan becomes effective, you will no longer be subject to this subpart and will only be subject to the approved and effective state plan. If the state or tribal plan are only approved in part, you will remain subject to the Federal plan to the extent necessary to address the deficiencies in the disapproved portions of the state or tribal plan.
§ 62.14520a
How do I determine if my CISWI is covered by an approved and effective state or tribal plan?
This part contains a list of state and tribal areas with approved Clean Air Act section 111(d) and section 129 plans along with the effective dates for such plans. The list is published annually. If this part does not indicate that your state or tribal area has an approved and effective plan, you should contact your state environmental agency's air director or your EPA Regional Office to determine if the EPA has approved a state plan covering your CISWI since publication of the most recent version of this subpart.
§ 62.14525a
If my CISWI is not listed in the Federal plan inventory, am I exempt from this subpart?
Any CISWI that meets the applicability criteria in § 62.14510a is required to comply with the applicable emissions guidelines even if the source is not listed in the Federal plan or otherwise applicable state or tribal plan inventory. CISWI subject to this subpart
are not limited to the inventory of sources listed in Docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0664 for the Federal plan. If your CISWI meets the applicability criteria in § 62.14510a, this subpart applies to you whether or not your CISWI is listed in the Federal plan inventory in the docket.

Records must include documentation of training, the dates of the initial refresher training, and the dates of their qualification and all subsequent renewals of such qualifications.
(3) For each qualified operator, the phone and/or pager number at which they can be reached during operating hours.
§ 62.14595a
What if all the qualified operators are temporarily not accessible?
If all qualified operators are temporarily not accessible (
i.e.,
not at the facility and not able to be at the facility within 1 hour), you must meet one of the two criteria specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, depending on the length of time that a qualified operator is not accessible.
(a) When all qualified operators are not accessible for more than 8 hours, but less than 2 weeks, the CISWI may be operated by other plant personnel familiar with the operation of the CISWI who have completed a review of the information specified in § 62.14590a(a) within the past 12 months. However, you must record the period when all qualified operators were not accessible and include this deviation in the annual report as specified under § 62.14705a.
(b) When all qualified operators are not accessible for 2 weeks or more, you must take the two actions that are described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) Notify the Administrator of this deviation in writing within 10 days. In the notice, state what caused this deviation, what you are doing to ensure
that a qualified operator is accessible, and when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible.
(2) Submit a status report to the Administrator every 4 weeks outlining what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, stating when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible and requesting approval from the Administrator to continue operation of the CISWI. You must submit the first status report 4 weeks after you notify the Administrator of the deviation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If the Administrator notifies you that your request to continue operation of the CISWI is disapproved, the CISWI may continue operation for 90 days, then must cease operation. Operation of the unit may resume if you meet the two requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) A qualified operator is accessible as required under § 62.14565a(a).
(ii) You notify the Administrator that a qualified operator is accessible and that you are resuming operation.

# Emission Limitations and Operating Limits
§ 62.14600a
What emission limitations must I meet and by when?
(a) You must meet the emission limitations for each CISWI, including bypass stack or vent, specified in tables 4 through 7 to this subpart by January 10, 2025. The emission limitations apply at all times the unit is operating including and not limited to startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
(b) Units that do not use wet scrubbers must maintain opacity to less than or equal to the percent opacity (three 1-hour blocks consisting of ten 6-minute average opacity values) specified in table 4 to this subpart, as applicable.
§ 62.14605a
What operating limits must I meet and by when?
(a) If you use a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a, you must establish operating limits for up to four operating parameters (as specified in table 1 to this subpart) as described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the initial performance test.
(1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different procedures in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.
(i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
(ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
(2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet particulate matter scrubber, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average pressure drop across the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum amperage to the wet scrubber, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average amperage to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations.
(3) Minimum scrubber liquor flow rate, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average liquor flow rate at the inlet to the wet acid gas or particulate matter scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
(4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet acid gas scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride (HCl) emission limitation.
(b) You must meet the operating limits established on the date that the performance test report is submitted to the EPA's Central Data Exchange or postmarked, per the requirements of § 62.14730a(b).
(c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations in
§ 62.14600a and you do not use a particulate matter (PM) continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) for monitoring PM compliance, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during any 6-month period. In calculating this operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.
(d) If you use an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a and you do not use a PM CPMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must measure the (secondary) voltage and amperage of the electrostatic precipitator collection plates during the particulate matter performance test. Calculate the average electric power value (secondary voltage × secondary current = secondary electric power) for each test run. The operating limit for the electrostatic precipitator is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average secondary electric power measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations.
(e) If you use activated carbon sorbent injection to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a, you must measure the sorbent flow rate during the performance testing. The operating limit for the carbon sorbent injection is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average sorbent flow rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the mercury emission limitations. For energy recovery units (ERU), when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (
e.g.,
for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).
(f) If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a, you must measure the charge rate, the secondary chamber temperature (if applicable to your CISWI), and the reagent flow rate during the nitrogen oxides (NO
X
) performance testing. The operating limits for the selective noncatalytic reduction are calculated as the highest 1-hour average charge rate, lowest secondary chamber temperature, and lowest reagent flow rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limitations.
(g) If you use a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a, you must measure the injection rate of each sorbent during the performance testing. The operating limit for the injection rate of each sorbent is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average injection rate of each sorbent measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride emission limitations. For energy recovery units, when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (
e.g.,
for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).
(h) If you do not use a wet scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, or fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations in § 62.14600a, and if you do not determine compliance with your particulate matter emission limitation with either a particulate matter continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) or a particulate matter CPMS, you must maintain opacity to less than or equal to ten percent opacity (1-hour block average).
(i) If you use a PM CPMS to demonstrate compliance with this subpart, you must establish your PM CPMS operating limit and determine compliance with it according to paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) of this section:
(1) During the initial performance test or any subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record all hourly average output values (milliamps, or the digital signal equivalent) from the
PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the test runs (
e.g.,
three 1-hour average PM CPMS output values for three 1-hour test runs):
(i) Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp output, or the digital signal equivalent, and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps or digital bits;
(ii) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to at least two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit; and
(iii) During the initial performance test or any subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp output values, or their digital equivalent, from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (
e.g.,
average all your PM CPMS output values for three corresponding 2-hour PM test runs under Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3, or Method 29 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8).
(2) If the average of your three PM performance test runs are below 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS output values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the performance tests under Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3, or Method 29 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, with the procedures in (i)(1) through (5) of this section:
(i) Determine your instrument zero output with one of the following procedures:
(A) Zero point data for
in-situ
instruments should be obtained by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench;
(B) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air;
(C) The zero point can also be established by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (
e.g.,
when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept; and
(D) If none of the steps in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.
(ii) Determine your PM CPMS instrument average in milliamps, or the digital equivalent, and the average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs, using equation 1 to this paragraph (i)(2)(ii):

# Equation 1 to Paragraph (i)(2)(ii)
ER11DE24.024
Where:
X
1
= The PM CPMS output data points for the three runs constituting the performance test;
Y
1
= The PM concentration value for the three runs constituting the performance test; and
n = The number of data points.
(iii) With your instrument zero expressed in milliamps, or the digital equivalent, your three run average PM CPMS milliamp value, or its digital equivalent, and your three run average PM concentration from your three compliance tests, determine a relationship of mg/dscm per milliamp or digital
signal equivalent, with equation 2 to this paragraph (i)(2)(iii):

# Equation 2 to Paragraph (i)(2)(iii)
ER11DE24.025
Where:
R = The relative mg/dscm per milliamp, or the digital equivalent, for your PM CPMS;
Y
1
= The three run average mg/dscm PM concentration;
X
1
= The three run average milliamp output, or the digital equivalent, from you PM CPMS; and
Z = The milliamp or digital signal equivalent of your instrument zero determined from paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section.
(iv) Determine your source specific 30-day rolling average operating limit using the mg/dscm per milliamp value, or per digital signal equivalent from equation 2 to paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section, in equation 3 to this paragraph (i)(2)(iv). This sets your operating limit at the PM CPMS output value corresponding to 75 percent of your emission limit:

# Equation 3 to Paragraph (i)(2)(iv)
ER11DE24.026
Where:
O
1
= The operating limit for your PM CPMS on a 30-day rolling average, in milliamps or their digital signal equivalent;
L = Your source emission limit expressed in mg/dscm;
z = Your instrument zero in milliamps or digital equivalent, determined from paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section; and
R = The relative mg/dscm per milliamp, or per digital signal output equivalent, for your PM CPMS, from equation 2 to paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section.
(3) If the average of your three PM compliance test runs is at or above 75 percent of your PM emission limit you must determine your operating limit by averaging the PM CPMS milliamp or digital signal output corresponding to your three PM performance test runs that demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using equation 4 to this paragraph (i)(3) and you must submit all compliance test and PM CPMS data according to the reporting requirements in paragraph (i)(5) of this section:

# Equation 4 to Paragraph (i)(3)
ER11DE24.027
Where:
X
1
= The PM CPMS data points for all runs i;
n = The number of data points; and
O
h
= Your site specific operating limit, in milliamps or digital signal equivalent.
(4) To determine continuous compliance, you must record the PM CPMS output data for all periods when the process is operating and the PM CPMS is not out-of-control. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average operating parameter in units of the operating limit (
e.g.,
milliamps or digital signal bits, PM concentration, raw data signal) on a 30-day rolling average basis.
(5) For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (
e.g.,
beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp or digital signal value equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp or digital signals corresponding to each PM compliance test run.
§ 62.14610a
What if I do not use a wet scrubber, fabric filter, activated carbon injection, selective noncatalytic reduction, an electrostatic precipitator, or a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations?
If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, activated carbon injection, selective noncatalytic reduction, fabric filter, an electrostatic precipitator, or a dry scrubber or limit emissions in some other manner, including mass balances, to comply with the emission limitations under § 62.14600a, you must petition the EPA Administrator for specific operating limits to be established during the initial performance test and continuously monitored thereafter. You must submit the petition at least sixty days before the performance test is scheduled to begin. Your petition must include the five items listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
(a) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as additional operating limits.
(b) A discussion of the relationship between the parameters required by paragrpah (a) of this seciton and emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of regulated pollutants change with changes in the parameters, and how limits on the parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated pollutants.
(c) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower values for the parameters required by paragraph (a) of this section that will establish the operating limits on the parameters.
(d) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and the instruments you will use to monitor the parameters required by paragraph (a) of this section, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments.
(e) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring the parameters required by paragraph (a) of this section.

2
) (Eq. 1)
Where:
C
adj

(20.9−7) = 20.9 percent oxygen−7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis);
20.9 = Oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
%O
2
= Oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.
(g) You must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency by following the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan (tetra- through octa-) isomer emitted using EPA Method 23 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
(2) Quantify isomers meeting identification criteria in section 11.4.3.4 of Method 23 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, regardless of whether the isomers meet identification criteria in section 11.4.3.4.1 of Method 23. You must quantify the isomers per section 11.4.3.5 of Method 23. Note that you may reanalyze the sample aliquot or split to reduce the number of isomers not meeting identification criteria in section 11.4.3.4 of Method 23.
(3) For each dioxin/furan (tetra- through octa-chlorinated) isomer measured in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) and (2) of this section, multiply the isomer concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in table 2 to this subpart; and

# Initial Compliance Requirements
§ 62.14625a
How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations and establish the operating limits?
(a) You must conduct an initial performance test to determine compliance with the emission limitations in tables 4 through 7 to this subpart, to establish compliance with any opacity operating limits in § 62.14605a(h), to establish the kiln-specific emission limit in § 62.14640a(y), as applicable, and to establish operating limits using the procedure in § 62.14605a or § 62.14610a. The initial performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in tables 4 through 7 to this subpart and the procedures in § 62.14615a. The use of the bypass stack during a performance test shall invalidate the performance test.
(b) As an alternative to conducting a performance test, as required under §§ 62.14615a and 62.14600a, you may use a 30-day rolling average of the 1-hour arithmetic average CEMS data, including CEMS data during startup and shutdown as defined in this subpart, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in tables 4 through 7 to this subpart. You must conduct a performance evaluation of each continuous monitoring system within 180
days of installation of the monitoring system. The initial performance evaluation must be conducted prior to collecting CEMS data that will be used for the initial compliance demonstration.
§ 62.14630a
By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?
(a) The initial performance test must be conducted no later than 180 days after your final compliance date. Your final compliance date is January 10, 2025, or the date you restart your CISWI if later than January 10, 2025.
(b) If you commence or recommence combusting a solid waste at an existing combustion unit at any commercial or industrial facility and you conducted a test consistent with the provisions of this subpart while combusting the given solid waste within the 6 months preceding the reintroduction of that solid waste in the combustion chamber, you do not need to retest until 6 months from the date you reintroduce that solid waste.
(c) If you commence or recommence combusting a solid waste at an existing combustion unit at any commercial or industrial facility and you have not conducted a performance test consistent with the provisions of this subpart while combusting the given solid waste within the 6 months preceding the reintroduction of that solid waste in the combustion chamber, you must conduct a performance test within 60 days from the date you reintroduce solid waste.
§ 62.14635a

(a) The initial air pollution control device inspection must be conducted within 60 days after installation of the control device and the associated CISWI reaches the charge rate at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after January 10, 2025.
(b) Within 10 operating days following an air pollution control device inspection, all necessary repairs must be completed unless the owner or operator obtains written approval from the state agency establishing a date whereby all necessary repairs of the designated facility must be completed.

# Continuous Compliance Requirements
§ 62.14640a
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations and the operating limits?
(a)(1) The emission standards and operating requirements set forth in this subpart apply at all times.
(2) If you cease combusting solid waste you may opt to remain subject to the provisions of this subpart. Consistent with the definition of CISWI in this subpart, you are subject to the requirements of this subpart at least 6 months following the last date of solid waste combustion. Solid waste combustion is ceased when solid waste is not in the combustion chamber (
i.e.,
the solid waste feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the solid waste residence time).
(3) If you cease combusting solid waste you must be in compliance with any newly applicable standards on the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. The effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch is a date selected by you, that must be at least 6 months from the date that you ceased combusting solid waste, consistent with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Your source must remain in compliance with this subpart until the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch.
(4) If you own or operate an existing commercial or industrial combustion unit that combusted a fuel or non-waste material, and you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste, you are subject to the provisions of this subpart as of the first day you introduce or reintroduce solid waste to the combustion chamber, and this date constitutes the effective date of the fuel-to-waste switch. You must complete all initial compliance demonstrations for any standards under section 112 of the Clean Air Act that are applicable to your facility before you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste. You must provide 30 days prior notice of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. The notification must identify:
(i) The name of the owner or operator of the CISWI, the location of the source, the emissions unit(s) that will
cease burning solid waste, and the date of the notice;
(ii) The currently applicable subcategory under this subpart, and any subpart and subcategory under 40 CFR part 63 that will be applicable after you cease combusting solid waste;
(iii) The fuel(s), non-waste material(s) and solid waste(s) the CISWI is currently combusting and has combusted over the past 6 months, and the fuel(s) or non-waste materials the unit will commence combusting;
(iv) The date on which you became subject to the currently applicable emission limits; and
(v) The date upon which you will cease combusting solid waste, and the date (if different) that you intend for any new requirements to become applicable (
i.e.,
the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch), consistent with paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section.
(5) All air pollution control equipment necessary for compliance with any newly applicable emissions limits which apply as a result of the cessation or commencement or recommencement of combusting solid waste must be installed and operational as of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel, or fuel-to-waste switch.
(6) All monitoring systems necessary for compliance with any newly applicable monitoring requirements which apply as a result of the cessation or commencement or recommencement of combusting solid waste must be installed and operational as of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel, or fuel-to-waste switch. All calibration and drift checks must be performed as of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel, or fuel-to-waste switch. Relative accuracy tests must be performed as of the performance test deadline for PM CEMS (if PM CEMS are elected to demonstrate continuous compliance with the particulate matter emission limits). Relative accuracy testing for other CEMS need not be repeated if that testing was previously performed consistent with monitoring requirements under section 112 of the Clean Air Act or monitoring requirements under this subpart.
(b) You must conduct an annual performance test for the pollutants listed in tables 4 through 7 to this subpart and opacity for each CISWI as required under § 62.14615a. The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in tables 4 through 7 to this subpart and the procedures in § 62.14615a. Opacity must be measured using EPA Reference Method 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4. Annual performance tests are not required if you use CEMS or continuous opacity monitoring systems to determine compliance.
(c) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified in § 62.14605a or established under § 62.14610a. Operation above the established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. Three-hour block average values are used to determine compliance (except for baghouse leak detection system alarms) unless a different averaging period is established under § 62.14610a or, for energy recovery units, where the averaging time for each operating parameter is a 30-day rolling average, calculated each hour as the average of the previous 720 operating hours. Operation above the established maximum, below the established minimum, or outside the allowable range of the operating limits specified in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes a deviation from your operating limits established under this subpart, except during performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission and operating limits or to establish new operating limits. Operating limits are confirmed or reestablished during performance tests.
(d) You must burn only the same types of waste and fuels used to establish subcategory applicability (for ERUs) and operating limits during the performance test.
(e) For energy recovery units, incinerators, and small remote units, you must perform annual visual emissions tests for ash handling.
(f) For energy recovery units, you must conduct an annual performance test for opacity using EPA Reference Method 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4 (except where particulate matter continuous monitoring system or CPMS are used), and the pollutants listed in table 5 to this subpart.
(g) For facilities using a CEMS to demonstrate compliance with the carbon monoxide emission limit, compliance with the carbon monoxide emission limit may be demonstrated by using the CEMS, as described in § 62.14665a(o).
(h) Coal and liquid/gas energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates greater than 250 MMBtu/hr may elect to demonstrate continuous compliance with the particulate matter emissions limit using a particulate matter CEMS according to the procedures in § 62.14665a(n) instead of the CPMS specified in paragraph (i) of this section. Coal and liquid/gas energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates less than 250 MMBtu/hr, incinerators, and small, remote incinerators may also elect to demonstrate compliance using a particulate matter CEMS according to the procedures in § 62.14665a(n) instead of particulate matter testing with EPA Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3, and, if applicable, the continuous opacity monitoring requirements in paragraph (i) of this section.
(i) For energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates greater than or equal to 10 MMBtu/hr but less than 250 MMBtu/hr that do not use a wet scrubber, fabric filter with bag leak detection system, an electrostatic precipitator, particulate matter CEMS, or particulate matter CPMS, you must install, operate, certify, and maintain a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) according to the procedures in § 62.14665a(m).
(j) For waste-burning kilns, you must conduct an annual performance test for the pollutants (except mercury and hydrogen chloride if no acid gas wet scrubber or dry scrubber is used) listed in table 6 to this subpart, unless you choose to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance using CEMS, as allowed in paragraph (u) of this section. If you do not use an acid gas wet scrubber or dry scrubber, you must determine compliance with the hydrogen chloride emissions limit using a HCl CEMS according to the requirements in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. You must determine compliance with the mercury emissions limit using a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system according to paragraph (j)(2) of this section. You must determine compliance with particulate matter using a PM CPMS according to paragraph (x) of this section.
(1) If you monitor compliance with the HCl emissions limit by operating an HCl CEMS, you must do so in accordance with Performance Specification 15 (PS 15) of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, or, PS 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. You must operate, maintain, and quality assure a HCl CEMS installed and certified under PS 15 according to the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, except that the Relative Accuracy Test Audit requirements of Procedure 1 must be replaced with the validation requirements and criteria of sections 11.1.1 and 12.0 of PS 15. You must operate, maintain and quality assure a HCl CEMS installed and certified under PS 18 according to the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 6 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix F. For any performance specification that you use, you must use Method 321 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, as the reference test method for conducting relative accuracy testing. The span value and calibration requirements in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to all HCl CEMS used under this subpart:
(i) You must use a measurement span value for any HCl CEMS of 0-10 ppmvw unless the monitor is installed on a kiln without an inline raw mill. Kilns without an inline raw mill may use a higher span value sufficient to quantify all expected emissions concentrations. The HCl CEMS data recorder output range must include the full range of expected HCl concentration values which would include those expected during “mill off” conditions. The corresponding data recorder range shall be documented in the site-specific monitoring plan and associated records;
(ii) In order to quality assure data measured above the span value, you must use one of the three options in paragraphs (j)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section:
(A) Include a second span that encompasses the HCl emission concentrations expected to be encountered during “mill off” conditions. This second span may be rounded to a multiple of 5 ppm of total HCl. The requirements of the appropriate HCl monitor performance specification shall be followed for this second span with the exception that a relative accuracy test audit (RATA) with the mill off is not required;
(B) Quality assure any data above the span value by proving instrument linearity beyond the span value established in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section using the following procedure. Conduct a weekly “above span linearity” calibration challenge of the monitoring system using a reference gas with a certified value greater than your highest expected hourly concentration or greater than 75 percent of the highest measured hourly concentration. The “above span” reference gas must meet the requirements of the applicable performance specification and must be introduced to the measurement system at the probe. Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The “above span linearity” challenge is successful if the value measured by the HCl CEMS falls within 10 percent of the certified value of the reference gas. If the value measured by the HCl CEMS during the above span linearity challenge exceeds 10 percent of the certified value of the reference gas, the monitoring system must be evaluated and repaired and a new “above span linearity” challenge met before returning the HCl CEMS to service, or data above span from the HCl CEMS must be subject to the quality assurance procedures established in (j)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. In this manner values measured by the HCl CEMS during the above span linearity challenge exceeding ±20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas must be normalized using equation 1 to paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(D)(
1
) of this section;
(C) Quality assure any data above the span value established in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section using the following procedure. Any time two consecutive one-hour average measured concentration of HCl exceeds the span value you must, within 24 hours before or after, introduce a higher, “above span” HCl reference gas standard to the HCl CEMS. The “above span” reference gas must meet the requirements of the applicable performance specification and target a concentration level between 50 and 150 percent of the highest expected hourly concentration measured during the period of measurements above span, and must be introduced at the probe. While this target represents a desired concentration range that is not always achievable in practice, it is expected that the intent to meet this range is demonstrated by the value of the reference gas. Expected values may include above span calibrations done before or after the above-span measurement period. Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The “above span” calibration is successful if the value measured by the HCl CEMS is within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas. If the value measured by the HCl CEMS is not within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas, then you must normalize the stack gas values measured above span as described in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. If the “above span” calibration is conducted during the period when measured emissions are above span and there is a failure to collect the one data point in an hour due to the calibration duration, then you must determine the emissions average for that missed hour as the average of hourly averages for the hour preceding the missed hour and the hour following the missed hour. In an hour where an “above span” calibration is being conducted and one or more data points are collected, the emissions average is represented by the average of all valid data points collected in that hour; and
(D)(
1
) In the event that the “above span” calibration is not successful (
i.e.,
the HCl CEMS measured value is not within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas), then you must normalize the one-hour average stack gas values measured above the span during the 24-hour period preceding or following the “above span” calibration for reporting based on the HCl CEMS response to the reference gas as shown
in equation 1 to this paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(D)(
1
):

# Equation 1 to paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(D)(

# )
ER11DE24.028
(

) Only one “above span” calibration is needed per 24-hour period.
(2) Compliance with the mercury emissions limit must be determined using a mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system according to the following requirements:
(i) You must operate a mercury CEMS in accordance with performance specification 12A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system in accordance with Performance Specification 12B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B; these monitoring systems must be quality assured according to Procedure 5 of appendix F to 40 CFR part 60. For the purposes of emissions calculations when using an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system, the mercury concentration determined for each sampling period must be assigned to each hour during the sampling period. If you choose to comply with the production-rate based mercury limit for your waste-burning kiln, you must also monitor hourly clinker production and determine the hourly mercury emissions rate in pounds per million ton of clinker produced. You must demonstrate compliance with the mercury emissions limit using a 30-day rolling average of these 1-hour mercury concentrations or mass emissions rates, including CEMS data during startup and shutdown as defined in this subpart, calculated using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, are not corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and are measured at stack oxygen content;
(ii) Owners or operators using a mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system to determine mass emission rate must install, operate, calibrate and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the mercury mass emissions rate to the atmosphere according to the requirements of Performance Specification 6 (PS 6) of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and conducting an annual relative accuracy test of the continuous emission rate monitoring system according to section 8.2 of PS 6; and
(iii) The owner or operator of a waste-burning kiln must demonstrate initial compliance by operating a mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system while the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill is operating under normal conditions and including at least one period when the raw mill is off.

(s) For facilities using a CEMS to demonstrate initial and continous compliance with the sulfur dioxide (SO
2
) emission limit, compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limit may be demonstrated by using the CEMS specified in § 62.14665a(l) to measure sulfur dioxide. The sulfur dioxide CEMS must follow the procedures and methods specified in this paragraph (s). For sources that have actual inlet emissions less than 100 parts per million dry volume, the relative accuracy criterion for inlet sulfur dioxide CEMS should be no greater than 20 percent of the mean value of the reference method test data in terms of the units of the emission standard, or 5 parts per million dry volume absolute value of the mean difference between the reference method and the CEMS, whichever is greater:
(1) During each relative accuracy test run of the CEMS required by Performance Specification 2 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, collect sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data concurrently (or within a 30- to 60-minute period) with both the CEMS and the test methods specified in paragraphs (s)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:

(4) The owner or operator of an affected facility may request that compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limit be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen. If carbon dioxide is selected for use in diluent corrections, the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels must be established during the initial performance test according to the procedures and methods specified in paragraphs (t)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section. This relationship may be reestablished during performance compliance tests:
(i) The fuel factor equation in Method 3B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, must be used to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide at a sampling location. Method 3A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses [Part 10, Instruments and Apparatus], as applicable, must be used to determine the oxygen concentration at the same location as the carbon dioxide monitor (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (z) of this section);
(ii) Samples must be taken for at least 30 minutes in each hour;
(iii) Each sample must represent a 1-hour average; and
(iv) A minimum of 3 runs must be performed.
(u) For facilities using a CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system for mercury to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with any of the emission limits of this subpart, you must complete the following:
(1) Demonstrate compliance with the appropriate emission limit(s) using a 30-day rolling average of 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, including CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, calculated using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. The 1-hour arithmetic averages for CEMS must be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(e)(2) of this chapter. Except for CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system data during startup and shutdown, the 1-hour arithmetic averages used to calculate the 30-day rolling average emission concentrations must be corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis). Integrated sorbent trap monitoring system or CEMS data
during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, are not corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and are measured at stack oxygen content; and
(2) Operate all CEMS and integrated sorbent trap monitoring systems in accordance with the applicable procedures under of 40 CFR part 60, appendices B and F.
(v) Use of the bypass stack at any time is an emissions standards deviation for PM, HCl, lead, cadmium, mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and dioxin/furans.
(w) For energy recovery units with a design heat input capacity of 100 MMBtu/hr or greater that do not use a carbon monoxide CEMS, you must install, operate, and maintain an oxygen analyzer system as defined in § 62.14785a according to the procedures in paragraphs (w)(1) through (4) of this section:
(1) The oxygen analyzer system must be installed by the initial performance test date specified in § 62.14605a;
(2) You must operate the oxygen trim system within compliance with paragraph (w)(3) of this section at all times;
(3) You must maintain the oxygen level such that the 30-day rolling average that is established as the operating limit for oxygen is not below the lowest hourly average oxygen concentration measured during the most recent carbon monoxide (CO) performance test; and
(4) You must calculate and record a 30-day rolling average oxygen concentration using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
(x) For energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates greater than or equal to 250 MMBtu/hr and waste-burning kilns, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a PM CPMS and record the output of the system as specified in paragraphs (x)(1) through (8) of this section. For other energy recovery units, you may elect to use PM CPMS operated in accordance with this section. PM CPMS are suitable in lieu of using other CMS for monitoring PM compliance (
e.g.,
bag leak detectors, electrostatic precipitator secondary power, PM scrubber pressure):
(1) Install, calibrate, operate, and maintain your PM CPMS according to the procedures in your approved site-specific monitoring plan developed in accordance with paragraphs (l) and (x)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:
(i) The operating principle of the PM CPMS must be based on in-stack or extractive light scatter, light scintillation, beta attenuation, or mass accumulation of the exhaust gas or representative sample. The reportable measurement output from the PM CPMS must be expressed as milliamps or the digital signal equivalent;
(ii) The PM CPMS must have a cycle time (
i.e.,
period required to complete sampling, measurement, and reporting for each measurement) no longer than 60 minutes; and
(iii) The PM CPMS must be capable of detecting and responding to particulate matter concentrations increments no greater than 0.5 mg/actual cubic meter.
(2) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, you must adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test according to the procedures specified in § 62.14605a.
(3) Collect PM CPMS hourly average output data for all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours. Express the PM CPMS output as milliamps or the digital signal equivalent.
(4) Calculate the arithmetic 30-day rolling average of all of the hourly average PM CPMS output collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours data (milliamps or their digital equivalent).
(5) You must collect data using the PM CPMS at all times the energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln is operating and at the intervals specified in paragraph (x)(1)(ii) of this section, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration
checks and required zero and span adjustments), and any scheduled maintenance as defined in your site-specific monitoring plan.
(6) You must use all the data collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours in assessing the compliance with your operating limit except:
(i) Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during monitoring system malfunctions are not used in calculations (report any such periods in your annual deviation report);
(ii) Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in your site-specific monitoring plan, repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during out-of-control periods are not used in calculations (report emissions or operating levels and report any such periods in your annual deviation report); and
(iii) Any PM CPMS data recorded during periods of CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart.
(7) You must record and make available upon request results of PM CPMS system performance audits, as well as the dates and duration of periods from when the PM CPMS is out of control until completion of the corrective actions necessary to return the PM CPMS to operation consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan.
(8) For any deviation of the 30-day rolling average PM CPMS average value from the established operating parameter limit, you must:
(i) Within 48 hours of the deviation, visually inspect the air pollution control device;
(ii) If inspection of the air pollution control device identifies the cause of the deviation, take corrective action as soon as possible and return the PM CPMS measurement to within the established value;
(iii) Within 30 days of the deviation or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct a PM emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the PM emissions limit. Within 45 days of the deviation, you must re-establish the CPMS operating limit. You are not required to conduct additional testing for any deviations that occur between the time of the original deviation and the PM emissions compliance test required under this paragraph (x); and
(iv) PM CPMS deviations leading to more than four required performance tests in a 12-month process operating period (rolling monthly) constitute a violation of this subpart.
(y) When kiln emissions are emittted through multiple stacks (
e.g.,
there is an alkali bypass and/or an in-line coal mill that exhaust emissions through a separate stack(s)), the combined emissions are subject to the emission limits applicable to waste-burning kilns. To determine the kiln-specific emission limit for demonstrating compliance, you must:
(1) Calculate a kiln-specific emission limit using equation 2 to this paragraph (y)(1):

(2) Particulate matter concentration must be measured downstream of the in-line coal mill. All other pollutant concentrations must be measured either upstream or downstream of the in-line coal mill.
(3) For purposes of determining the combined emissions from kilns equipped with an alkali bypass or that exhaust kiln gases to a coal mill that exhausts through a separate stack, instead of installing a CEMS or PM CPMS on the alkali bypass stack or in-line coal mill stack, the results of the initial and subsequent performance test can be used to demonstrate compliance with the relevant emissions limit. A performance test must be conducted on an annual basis (between 11 and 13 calendar months following the previous performance test).

§ 62.14645a
By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?
You must conduct annual performance tests between 11 and 13 calendar months of the previous performance test.
§ 62.14650a
By what date must I conduct the annual air pollution control device inspection?
On an annual basis (no more than 12 months following the previous annual air pollution control device inspection), you must complete the air pollution control device inspection as described in § 62.14635a.
§ 62.14655a
May I conduct performance testing less often?
You must conduct annual performance tests according to the schedule specified in § 62.14645a, with the following exceptions:
(a) You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits, as specified in § 62.14660a. New operating limits become effective on the date that the performance test report is submitted to the EPA's Central Data Exchange or postmarked, per the requirements of § 62.14730a(b). The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time;
(b) You must repeat the performance test within 60 days of a process change, as defined in § 62.14780a; and
(c) You can conduct performance tests less often if you meet the following conditions: your performance tests for the pollutant for at least 2 consecutive performance tests demonstrates that the emission level for the pollutant is no greater than the emission level specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable; there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions; and you are not required to conduct a performance test for the pollutant in response to a request by the Administrator in paragraph (a) of this section or a process change in paragraph (b) of this section.
In this case, you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test for the pollutant no more than 37 months following the previous performance test for the pollutant. If the emission level for your CISWI continues to meet the emission level specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (2), as applicable, you may choose to conduct performance tests for the pollutant every third year, as long as there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions. Each such performance test must be conducted no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.
(1) For particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, mercury, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead, and dioxins/furans, the emission level equal to 75 percent of the applicable emission limit in tables 4 through 7 to this subpart, as applicable; and

# Monitoring
§ 62.14665a
What monitoring equipment must I install and what parameters must I monitor?
(a) If you are using a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitation under § 62.14600a, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate devices (or establish methods) for monitoring the value of the operating parameters used to determine compliance with the operating limits listed in table 1 to this subpart. These devices (or methods) must measure and record the values for these operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in table 1 to this subpart at all times except as specified in § 62.14670a(a).
(b) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the requirements of this subpart and you do not use a PM CPMS or PM CEMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate a bag leak detection system as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section.
(1) You must install and operate a bag leak detection system for each exhaust stack of the fabric filter.
(2) Each bag leak detection system must be installed, operated, calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.
(3) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter or less.
(4) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative or absolute particulate matter loadings.
(5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor.
(6) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will alert automatically an operator when an increase in relative particulate matter emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is observed easily by plant operating personnel.
(7) For positive pressure fabric filter systems, a bag leak detection system must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell. For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter.
(8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
(c) If you are using something other than a wet scrubber, activated carbon, selective non-catalytic reduction, an electrostatic precipitator, or a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations under § 62.14600a, you must install, calibrate (to the manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate the equipment necessary to monitor compliance with the site-specific operating limits established using the procedures in § 62.14610a.
(d) If you use activated carbon injection to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart, you must measure the minimum sorbent flow rate once per hour.
(e) If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart, you must complete the following:
(1) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 62.14615a, whichever date comes first, ensure that the affected facility does not operate above the maximum charge rate, or below the minimum secondary chamber temperature (if applicable to your CISWI) or the minimum reagent flow rate measured as 3-hour block averages at all times; and
(2) Operation of the affected facility above the maximum charge rate, below the minimum secondary chamber temperature and below the minimum reagent flow rate simultaneously constitute a violation of the nitrogen oxides emissions limit.
(f) If you use an electrostatic precipitator to comply with the emission limits of this subpart and you do not use a PM CPMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must monitor the secondary power to the electrostatic precipitator collection plates and maintain the 3-hour block averages at or above the operating limits established during the mercury or particulate matter performance test.
(g) For waste-burning kilns not equipped with a wet scrubber or dry scrubber, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for monitoring hydrogen chloride emissions discharged to the atmosphere, as specified in § 62.14640a(j), and record the output of the system. You may substitute use of a HCl CEMS for conducting the HCl initial and annual testing with EPA Method 321 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A. for units other than waste-burning kilns not equipped with a wet scrubber or dry scrubber, a facility may substitute use of a HCl CEMS for conducting the HCl initial and annual performance test. For units equipped with a HCl CEMS, you are not required to monitor the minimum hydrogen chloride sorbent flow rate, monitoring the minimum scrubber liquor pH, and monitoring minimum injection rate.
(h) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the particulate matter emissions limit in this subpart, a facility may substitute use of either a particulate matter CEMS or a particulate matter CPMS for conducting the particulate matter annual performance test. For units equipped with a particulate matter CEMS, you are not required to use other CMS monitoring for PM compliance (
e.g.,
bag leak detectors, electrostatic precipitator secondary power, PM scrubber pressure). A facility may also substitute use of a particulate matter CEMS for conducting the PM initial performance test.
(i) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the dioxin/furan emissions limit in this subpart, a facility may substitute use of a continuous automated sampling system for the dioxin/furan initial and annual performance test. You must record the output of the system and analyze the sample according to EPA Method 23 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. This option to use a continuous automated sampling system takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to dioxin/furan from continuous monitors is published in the
Federal Register.
The owner or operator who elects to continuously sample
dioxin/furan emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Method 23 must install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous automated sampling system and must comply with the requirements specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q) of this chapter. A facility may substitute continuous dioxin/furan monitoring for the minimum sorbent flow rate, if activated carbon sorbent injection is used solely for compliance with the dioxin/furan emission limit.
(j)(1) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the mercury emissions limit in this subpart, a facility may substitute use of a mercury CEMS or and integrated sorbent trap monitoring system for the mercury initial and annual performance test. The owner or operator who elects to continuously sample mercury emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Method 29 or 30B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, ASTM D6784-24, Standard Test Method for Elemental, Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total Mercury in Flue Gas Generated from Coal-Fired Stationary Sources (Ontario Hydro Method), approved March 1, 2024 (ASTM D6784-24), or an approved alternative method for measuring mercury emissions, must install, calibrate, maintain and operate the mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system and must comply with Performance Specification 12A or 12B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, respectively, and quality assurance requirements of Procedure 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix F. For the purposes of emissions calculations when using an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system, the mercury concentration determined for each sampling period must be assigned to each hour during the sampling period. For units equipped with a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system, you are not required to monitor the minimum sorbent flow rate, if activated carbon sorbent injection is used solely for compliance with the mercury emission limit. Waste-burning kilns must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system as specified in § 62.14640a(j).

(6) At a minimum, valid continuous monitoring system hourly averages must be obtained as specified § 62.14670a;
(7) The 1-hour arithmetic averages required under paragraph (n)(5) of this section must be expressed in milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (mg/dscm) corrected to 7 percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide)(dry basis) and must be used to calculate the 30-day rolling average emission concentrations. CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, are not corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and are measured at stack oxygen content. The 1-hour arithmetic averages must be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(e)(2) of this chapter;

(6) You must use all the data collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours in assessing the compliance with your operating limit except:
(i) Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during monitoring system malfunctions are not used in calculations (report any such periods in your annual deviation report);
(ii) Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in your site-specific monitoring plan, repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during out-of-control periods are not used in calculations (report emissions or operating levels and report any such periods in your annual deviation report); and
(iii) Any PM CPMS data recorded during periods of CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart.
(7) You must record and make available upon request results of PM CPMS system performance audits, as well as the dates and duration of periods from

(i) Within 48 hours of the deviation, visually inspect the air pollution control device;
(ii) If inspection of the air pollution control device identifies the cause of the deviation, take corrective action as soon as possible and return the PM CPMS measurement to within the established value;
(iii) Within 30 days of the deviation or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct a PM emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the PM emissions limit in this subpart and to verify the operation of the emissions control device(s). Within 45 days of the deviation, you must re-establish the CPMS operating limit. You are not required to conduct additional testing for any deviations that occur between the time of the original deviation and the PM emissions compliance test required under this paragraph (r)(8)(iii); and
(iv) PM CPMS deviations leading to more than four required performance tests in a 12-month process operating period (rolling monthly) constitute a violation of this subpart.

(t) If you are required to monitor clinker production because you comply with the production-rate based mercury limit in this subpart for your waste-burning kiln, you must:
(1) Determine hourly clinker production by one of two methods:
(i) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates in tons-mass per hour of the amount of clinker produced. The system of measuring hourly clinker production must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy; or
(ii) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates in tons-mass per hour of the amount of feed to the kiln. The system of measuring feed must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy. Calculate your hourly clinker production rate using a kiln-specific feed to clinker ratio based on reconciled clinker production determined for accounting purposes and recorded feed rates. Update this ratio monthly. Note that if this ratio changes at clinker reconciliation, you must use the new ratio going forward, but you do not have to retroactively change clinker production rates previously estimated.
(2) Determine the accuracy of the system of measuring hourly clinker production (or feed mass flow if applicable) before the final compliance date under this subpart and during each quarter of source operation.
(3) Conduct accuracy checks in accordance with the procedures outlined in your site-specific monitoring plan under § 62.14640a(l).
§ 62.14670a
Is there a minimum amount of monitoring data I must obtain?
For each continuous monitoring system required or optionally allowed under § 62.14665a, you must monitor and collect data according to this section:
(a) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times compliance is required except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods (as specified in § 62.14705a(o)), and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part
by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to effect monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.
(b) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. You must use all the data collected during all other periods, including data normalized for above scale readings, in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.
(c) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments, failure to collect required data is a deviation of the monitoring requirements.

(i) For performance evaluations of continuous monitoring systems measuring RATA pollutants that are supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT website at the time of the evaluation, you must submit the results of the performance evaluation to the EPA via the CEDRI. CEDRI can be accessed through the EPA's CDX. Performance evaluation data must be submitted in a file format generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate file format consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT website. If you claim that some of the performance evaluation information being submitted is CBI, you must submit a complete file generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT website, including information claimed to be CBI, on a compact disc, flash drive, or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic storage media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAQPS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT or alternate file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (b)(2)(i); and
(ii) For any performance evaluations of continuous monitoring systems measuring RATA pollutants that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT website at the time of the evaluation, you must submit the results of the performance evaluation to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 60.4 of this chapter.
(c) If you are required to electronically submit a report through the CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, and due to a planned or actual outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the submission is due, you will be or are precluded from accessing CEDRI or CDX and submitting a required report within the time prescribed, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the reporting
requirement. You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying the date, time, and length of the outage; a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved. The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(d) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX and a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date the submission is due, the owner or operator may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage). If you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs. The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
§ 62.14735a
Can reporting dates be changed?
If the Administrator agrees, you may change the semiannual or annual reporting dates. See § 60.19(c) of this chapter for procedures to seek approval to change your reporting date.

# Air Curtain Incinerators (ACIs)
§ 62.14740a
What is an air curtain incinerator?
(a) An ACI operates by forcefully projecting a curtain of air across an open chamber or open pit in which combustion occurs. Incinerators of this type can be constructed above or below ground and with or without refractory walls and floor. Air curtain incinerators are not to be confused with conventional combustion devices with enclosed fireboxes and controlled air technology such as mass burn, modular, and fluidized bed combustors.
(b) Air curtain incinerators that burn only the materials listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section are only required to meet the requirements under § 62.14770a, this section, and §§ 62.14745a through 62.14765a:
(1) One hundred (100) percent wood waste;
