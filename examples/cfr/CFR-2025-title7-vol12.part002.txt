(D) Upon completion of construction and prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion concerning whether the construction costs, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, present fairly the costs of construction in conformity with eligible construction costs as prescribed in Agency regulations.
(E) In some cases, cost certification will be obtained by the Agency through direct contract with the CPA or LPA. The borrower and his/her CPA or LPA will cooperate fully with the contract CPA or LPA by providing all documentation necessary to conduct the certification. The Agency reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form RD 1924-13 and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to the Agency. If not satisfactory to the Agency, the borrower will be responsible for providing additional information.
(F) There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower except for the performance of the examination of the cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation. Any CPA or LPA who acts as the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping services or maintains the official accounting records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project.
(G) Forms RD 1944-30, “Identity of Interest (IOI) Disclosure Certificate” and RD 1944-31, “Identity of Interest (IOI) Qualification Form,” provide written notification to the borrower that willful and intentional falsification of cost certification documents will result in debarment of all violators in accordance with the provisions of RD Instruction 1940-M (available in any Agency office). These forms require the disclosure of all identities of interest associated with project construction, certify the entity's ability to provide the contracted service, and cite the penalties for failure to disclose or falsify such certification. Each applicant/borrower will be required to complete and sign the forms (available in any Agency office).
(H) (
Subcontracting development work.
(
1
) Contractors will not be allowed to obtain a profit and overhead unless they are performing actual construction. “Actual construction” means “work” as defined in American Institute of Architects (AIA) documents: “* * * labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations.” Under this definition, contractors who choose to subcontract out construction of the project to another contractor will not obtain a builder's fee (general overhead and profit) when:
(
i
) More than 50 percent of the contract sum in the construction contract is subcontracted to one subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor, and/or
(
ii
) Seventy-five percent or more with three or fewer subcontractors, material suppliers and/or equipment lessors.
(
2
)
Note:
If two or more subcontractors have common ownership, they are considered as one subcontractor.
(
3
) How to apply rule:
(
i
) The 50 percent rule will apply when division of the amount of the largest subcontract by the contract sum of the construction contract results in more than 50 percent.
(
ii
) The 75 percent rule will apply when division of the sum of the amounts of the three largest subcontracts by the contract sum of the construction contract results in 75 percent or more.
(I) (
Qualified contracting entities.
Contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and any other individual or organization sharing an identity of interest and providing materials or services for the project must certify that it is a viable, ongoing trade or business qualified and properly licensed to undertake the work for which it intends to contract. Form RD 1944-31 will be prepared and executed by the contracting entities. The form provides notification to the entities of the penalty, under law, for erroneously certifying to the statements contained therein. Debarment actions will be instituted against entities who fail to disclose an identity of interest in accordance with the provisions of RD Instruction 1940-M (available in any Agency office).
(vi)
Method of payments.
Partial payments may be requested in accordance with the terms of the construction contract on Form RD 1924-18, “Partial Payment Estimate,” or other professionally recognized form that contains the architect's certification, approval of the owner, and conditional acceptance of the Agency as shown in Form RD 1924-18.
(A) If interim financing is available at reasonable rates and terms for the construction period, such financing shall be obtained. exhibit B of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter shall be used to inform the interim lender that the Agency will not close its loan until the project is substantially complete, ready for occupancy, evidence is furnished indicating that all bills have been paid or will be paid at loan closing for work completed on the project, all inspections have been completed and all required approvals have been obtained from municipal and governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project.
Upon presentation of proper partial payment estimates approved by the applicant and accepted by the Agency, the interim lender may advance construction funds in accordance with the payment terms of the contract. It is suggested that partial payments not exceed 90 percent of the value of work in place and materials suitably stored on site.
(B) When interim financing is not available, payments will be made in accordance with § 1924.6(a)(12) of this subpart.
(vii)
Exception to competitive bidding
—(A)
For all applicants.
An applicant may negotiate a construction contract provided the State Director grants an exception and documentation shows that:
(
1
) The contract price is competitive with other projects similar in construction and design being built in the area.
(
2
) The proposed contractor is experienced in construction of projects of similar size, scope, and complexity, and is recognized as a reliable builder.
(
3
) The proposed development work meets all requirements of this subpart.
(
4
) If appropriate for nonprofit organizations and public bodies, the applicant provides a copy of a duly authorized resolution by its governing body requesting the Agency to permit awarding the construction contract without formal bidding.
(
5
) The applicant is permitted by state law, local law and/or organizational by-laws to negotiate a construction contract.
(
6
) The requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this section are met.
(B) In considering an exception to competitive bidding, the following additional steps will be taken in all cases.
(
1
) If, after a full review of the case documents by the appropriate members of the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the requirements have been met and the costs are reasonable, an exception to competitive bidding may be granted. Written documentation of the State Office review results will be placed in the application file.
(
2
) If after the full review by the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the negotiated contract price is not competitive with
other similar projects in construction and design being built in the area, the applicant will be requested to competitively bid the construction of the project in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
(
3
) If there is no agreement by the Agency and the applicant as to the construction cost, the State Director will cease any further action on the preapplication and inform the applicant of the right to appeal in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.
(C) Any requests for exceptions to competitive bidding that are not covered in this section may be submitted to the National Office for consideration.
(viii)
Exception to contract method—public body.
With the approval of the National Office, the State Director may grant to a public body an exception to the requirement for using contract method construction under the following circumstances:
(A) The loan or grant is for repair or rehabilitation of existing facilities and it is not practicable to perform all work by the contract method.
(B) The applicant has the managerial ability and qualified employees necessary to complete the work successfully.
(C) That applicant submits a written request to the District Director indicating:
(
1
) The scope of work and construction timetable;
(
2
) What phases of work can be contracted and what cannot;
(
3
) Why is it not practicable to contract all phases;
(
4
) Management ability and employee qualifications for performing the work;
(
5
) Proposed method of fund control and frequency of payments;
(

(
7
) Proposed method of certifying progress and requesting payments.
(D) The request, recommendations of the District Director, appropriate members of the State Office staff and the State Director and the application file will be sent to the National Office.
(2)
Owner-builder method.
This method of development is used only when requested by profit or limited profit RRH applicants when the applicant or any of its controlling principals (such as stockholders, members, partners other than limited partners, directors, or officers), are general contractors by profession, and will serve as the builder of the project without a written construction contract. The State Director may make an exception to the contract method of construction and authorize proceeding by the owner-builder method of construction in accordance with the provisions of this section if the amount of the loan(s) does not exceed the State Director's approval authority. For projects over the State Director's authority, prior written consent of the National Office is required. In such cases, the drawings, specifications, cost estimates, copy of the State Architect/Engineer's review and detailed information on the applicant's qualifications will be submitted to the National Office along with the State Director's recommendations.
(i) The applicant's request to construct a project by the owner-builder method of construction shall be in the form of a letter giving specific and detailed information concerning the owner-builder's proposal, and the qualifications and past experience of the owner-builder. The following information must be included with the request:
(A) A resume indicating the owner-builder's history, ability, and experience.
(B) Dated and signed financial statements on the owner-builder's operation (including balance sheets and statements of income and expense) from current and prior years indicating the payment status of the owner-builder's accounts and any contingent liabilities that may exist. Agency personnel will be responsible for analyzing the financial statement as to the sufficiency of the owner-builder's financial capability to carry out construction. The financial strength must demonstrate the ability of the owner-builder to pay all bills prior to receiving periodic draws of funds from the lender.
(C) A written, dated, and signed statement agreement to provide any funds necessary in excess of the applicant's contribution and the loan amount to complete the project.
(D) A credit report (obtained at no expense to the Agency) attesting to the owner-builder's credit standing.
(E) A listing of trade references that could be contacted to substantiate the owner-builder's experience and good standing.
(F) Statements from other persons for whom the owner-builder has done similar work, indicating the scope of the work and that person's evaluation of the owner-builder's performance.
(G) A current, dated, and signed trade-item cost breakdown of the estimated total development cost of the project which has been prepared by the applicant/owner-builder. Form RD 1924-13 will be used for this purpose. If cost certification services are required by the Agency, the cost of such services may be included in the total development cost of the project. Any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder as defined in § 1924.4(i) of this subpart must also provide a trade-item cost breakdown of the proposed amount.
(H) Prior to the start of construction, the owner-builder and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting system that the owner-builder, subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in maintaining a running record of the actual cost. In order to be acceptable, the owner-builder must provide a written assertion that it has an accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a trade-item basis comparison of the actual cost as compared to the estimated cost submitted on Form RD 1924-13. Costs pertaining to a specific line item will be set up in the accounting system for that particular account. For instance, only costs of materials, supplies, equipment, and labor associated with concrete will be shown in the concrete account. The accounting system must also restrict costs to those pertaining to a specific project so that costs from multiple projects will not be co-mingled. The independent CPA or LPA shall report on the owner-builder's assertion in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements of the AICPA. The owner-builder's and the CPA or LPA's reports on the accounting system shall be provided to the Agency by the owner-builder.
(I) A written, dated, and signed statement agreeing to permit U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, to have access to any books, documents, papers, and records which are directly pertinent to the specific Federal program for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts and transcriptions.
(ii) In order to grant an exception to the contract method of construction and proceed with the owner-builder method of construction, the State Director must determine that the following conditions exist:
(A) The applicant or at least one of its principals is a fully qualified and licensed (if necessary under applicable local law) builder by profession, has adequate experience in constructing the type of units proposed as well as projects of similar size, scope, and complexity and will be able to complete the work in accordance with the Agency approved drawings and specifications.
(B) Based upon the information presented in the applicant's financial statements, the applicant is presently able and is likely to continue to be able to provide any funds necessary in excess of the applicant's contribution and the loan amount to complete the project.
(C) The total development cost of the project does not exceed that which is typical for similar type projects in the area. The total development cost recognized by the Agency for each individual case will be determined by the MFH Coordinator with the advice of the State Architect.
(D) The owner-builder has provided sufficient information on all contracts or subcontracts in excess of $10,000 to permit compliance with § 1924.6(a)(11)(iv) of this subpart.
(iii) In addition to the requirements for the State Director to authorize the owner-builder method of construction as indicated in § 1924.13(e)(2) (i) and (ii)
of this subpart, the following additional steps will be taken by the State Director.
(A) If, after a full review of the case documents by the appropriate members of the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the requirements have been met and the construction cost is reasonable, an exception to competitive bidding may be granted. Written documentation of the State Office review results will be placed in the application file.
(B) If, after the full review by the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the construction cost is not competitive with other similar projects in construction and design being built in the area, the applicant will be requested to competitively bid the construction of the project in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
(C) If there is no agreement by the Agency and the applicant as to construction cost and the applicant is not agreeable to any of the aforementioned alternatives, the State Director will cease any further action on the preapplication and inform the applicant of the right to appeal, in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.
(iv) The development cost of the project may include a typical allowance for general overhead, general requirements and a builder's profit. These amounts may be determined by local investigation and also from HUD data for the area. The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractors, material suppliers and equipment lessors having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder may not be permitted a builder's profit, general overhead, and general requirements which exceed the amounts represented on their cost breakdown.
(v) Under no circumstances will loan funds be used to pay the owner/builder or its stockholders, members, directors or officers, directly or indirectly, any profits from the construction of the project except a typical builder's fee for performing the services that would normally be performed by a general contractor under the contract method of construction. Discounts and rebates given the owner-builder in advance must be deducted before the invoices are paid. If discounts or rebates are given after the invoices are paid, the funds must be returned to the supervised bank account or applied on the interim construction loan, as appropriate. Under no circumstances will the dollar amount be placed in the reserve account.
(vi) The plan and specifications must be specific and complete so that there is a clear understanding as to how the facility will be constructed and the materials that will be used.
(vii) When architectural services are required by § 1924.13(a) during the construction and warranty phases they must be provided by an architect who has no identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder. The services to be rendered during the construction and warranty phases include, but are not limited to inspections, changes in the scope of project or work to be done, administration of construction accounts, rejection of work and materials not conforming to the Agency approved drawings and specifications, and other appropriate service listed in § 1924.13(a)(5) (v) and (vi) of this subpart.
(viii) The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest as defined in § 1924.4(i) of this subpart must each provide certification as to the actual cost of the work performed in connection with the construction of the project on Form RD 1924-13 prior to final payment. The construction costs, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, must be audited by a CPA, or LPA licensed on or before December 31, 1970, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, and certain agreed upon procedures (available in any Agency office) performed in accordance with Attestation Standards. In some cases, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will contract directly with a CPA or LPA for the cost certification. In that event, documentation necessary to have the costs of construction certified by an Agency contractor that they were the actual costs of the work performed, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, will be provided. Funds which
were included in the loan for cost certification and which are ultimately not needed because Agency contracts for the cost certification will be returned on the loan.
(A) The CPA or LPA's audit, performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, will include such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures of the applicant/owner-builder (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in connection with the construction of the project he/she considers necessary to express an opinion on the construction costs as reported on Form RD 1924-13. Upon completion of construction and prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion as to whether the construction costs as reported on Form RD 1924-13 present fairly the costs of construction in conformity with eligible construction costs as prescribed in Agency regulations. The Agency reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form RD 1924-13 and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to the Agency. At a minimum, the CPA or LPA shall also perform any additional agreed upon procedures (available in any Agency office) specified by the Agency, performed in accordance with Attestation Standards, of the owner-builder (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in connection with the construction. There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower except for the performance of the examination of the cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation. Any CPA or LPA who acts as the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping services or maintains the official accounting records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project.
(B) Prior to final payment to anyone required to cost certify, the Agency must be provided with a certification and a trade-item breakdown showing the actual cost compared to the estimated cost furnished in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(G) of this section. Form RD 1924-13 is the form of comparative breakdown that must be used, and contains the certification required of the applicant/owner-builder prior to final payment. The amounts for builder's general overhead, general requirements, and builder's profit shall not exceed the amounts represented on the estimate of cost breakdown provided in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(G) of this section for the owner-builder or any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder. Final payment to the owner-builder will be adjusted, if necessary, to assure that the amounts shown on the certificate of actual cost do not exceed the amounts represented on the cost breakdown. Any funds remaining as a result of hard cost savings will be applied to the account as an extra payment or used for eligible loan purposes approved by the Agency as long as the improvements are genuinely needed and will enhance marketability of the project. All increases or decreases of 15 percent or more in line item costs will require documentation as to the reason for the increases or decreases. The State Director may require documentation for increases or decreases of less than 15 percent, if he/she determines it necessary. This information will be required with the cost certification.
(C) Subcontracting development work.
(
1
) Owner-builders will not be allowed to obtain a profit and overhead unless they are performing actual construction. “Actual construction” means “work” as defined in AIA documents: “* * * labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations.” Under this definition, owner-builders who choose to subcontract out construction of the project to another contractor will not obtain a builder's fee (general overhead and profit) when:
(
i
) More than 50 percent of the total cost of the building construction is subcontracted to one subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor, and/or
(
ii
) Seventy-five percent or more with three or fewer subcontractors, material suppliers, and/or equipment lessors.
(
2
)
Note:
If two or more subcontractors have common ownership, they are considered as one subcontractor.
(
3
) How to apply rule:
(
i
) The 50 percent rule will apply when division of the amount of the largest subcontract by the total amount of the building cost results in more than 50 percent.
(
ii
) The 75 percent rule will apply when division of the sum of the amounts of the three largest subcontracts by the total building cost results in 75 percent or more.
(D) Qualified contracting entities. Contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and any other individual or organization sharing an identity of interest and providing materials or services for the project must certify that it is a viable, ongoing trade or business qualified and properly licensed to undertake the work for which it intends to contract. Form RD 1944-31 will be prepared and executed by the contracting entities. The form provides notification to the entities of the penalty, under law, for erroneously certifying to the statements contained therein. Debarment actions will be instituted against entities who fail to disclose an identity of interest in accordance with the provisions of RD Instruction 1940-M (available in any Agency office).
(ix) Requests for payment for work performed by the owner-builder method, shall be permitted to the Agency District Director for review and approval prior to each advance of funds in order to insure that funds are used for authorized purposes. Requests for payment shall be made on Form RD 1924-18 or other professionally recognized form containing the following certification to the Agency:
The undersigned certifies that the work has been carefully inspected and to the best of their knowledge and belief, the quantities shown in this estimate are correct and the work has been performed in accordance with the contract documents.
(Name of Architect)
By:
(Title (Date)
Approved by Owner's Representative: By:
(Title)
Accepted by Agency Representative: By:
(Title)
The review and acceptance of partial payment estimates by the Agency does not attest to the correctness of the quantities shown or that the work has been performed in accordance with the plans and specifications.
(A) If interim financing is available at reasonable rates and terms for the construction period, such financing shall be obtained. Exhibit B of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter shall be used to inform the interim lender that the Agency will not close its loan until the project is complete, ready for occupancy, evidence is furnished indicating that all bills have been paid for work completed on the project, all inspections have been completed and all required approvals have been obtained from any governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project. Upon presentation of proper partial payment estimates containing an estimate of the value of work in place which has been prepared and executed by the owner-builder, certified by the applicant's architect, and accepted by the Agency, the interim lender may advance construction funds in accordance with the provisions of this section. It is suggested that the partial payment not exceed 90 percent of the value of work in place and material suitably stored on site.
(B) If interim financing is not available, partial payments not to exceed 90 percent of the value of work in place and materials suitably stored on site may be made to the owner-builder for that portion of the estimated cost of development guaranteed by a letter of credit or deposits meeting the requirements of § 1924.6(a)(3)(iii) (A), (B) or (C) of this subpart. Partial payments may not exceed 60 percent of the value of work in place in all other cases. The determination of the value of work in place will be based upon an application for payment containing an estimate of the value of work in place which has been prepared and executed by the owner-builder, certified by the borrower's architect, and accepted by the
Agency. Prior to receiving the first partial payment, the owner-builder must submit a schedule of prices or values of the various trades or phases of the work aggregating the total development cost of the project as required in § 1924.13(e)(2)(i) (G) and (H) of this subpart. Each application for payment must be based upon this schedule, and show the total amount owed and paid to date for materials and labor procured in connection with the project. With each application for payment, the owner-builder must also submit evidence showing how the requested partial payment is to be applied, evidence showing that previous partial payments were properly applied, and a signed statement from the applicant's attorney, title insurance company, or local official in charge of recording documents certifying that the public records have been searched and that there are no liens of record. When the District Director has reason to believe that partial payments may not be applied properly, checks will be made payable to persons who furnish materials and labor for eligible purposes in connection with the project.
(x) Under no circumstances shall funds be released for final payment or to pay any items of the builder's profit until the project is 100 percent complete, ready for occupancy, and the owner-builder has completed and properly executed Form RD 1924-13 or complied with the cost certification procedures of § 1924.13(e)(2)(viii) of this subpart.

# Exhibit B to Subpart A of Part 1924—Requirements for Modular/Panelized Housing Units
For the benefit of the Agency this exhibit prescribes evaluation, acceptance, inspection and certification procedures formodular/panelized housing units proposed for use in Agency Rural Housing programs. It applies to proposed development packages provided either under a contract between an Agency borrower and a single contractor or under a conditional commitment. This exhibit also describes the use of background information available through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for analysis of manufactured products. This exhibit also applies to the evaluation of manufactured farm service buildings in paragraph XI, below. For the purpose of this exhibit, County Supervisor and County Office also mean District Director and District Office, respectively.
I. Applicable Standards and Manuals.
A. The HUD Handbook 4950.1, Technical Suitability of Products Program Technical and Processing Procedures, must be followed by housing manufacturers to obtain acceptance of their products. Acceptance documents issued by HUD include: Structural Engineering Bulletins (SEB) on a national basis, Area Letters of Acceptance (ALA) which when accepted by all Area HUD Offices in a HUD region will, in essence, become Regional Letters of Acceptance (RLA), Truss Connector Bulletins (TCB): and, Mechanical Engineering Bulletins (MEB). These documents as well as the Use of Material Bulletins (UM) and Materials Release Bulletins (MR) are addendums to the HUD Minimum Property Standards (MPS), Under handbook guidelines, HUD also examines state agency regulations concerning design, construction and labeling of modular/panelized housing units and designates those states having procedures acceptable for use under HUD programs. Modular/panelized housing produced in these states is called
Category III
and is considered technically suitable for use without further structural analysis.
B. All Agency Offices should maintain a close working relationship with each HUD office in their jurisdiction to assure coordination. Any deviations in structure, materials or design from HUD acceptance documents must comply with one of the other applicable development standards.
II. Modular Housing Units that Require Factory Inspections.
Only those types which cannot be completely inspected on site are required to obtain acceptance from HUD. Those that receive acceptance will be periodically factory inspected by HUD or HUD's designated agency, usually about every 6 months.
III. Panelized Housing Units that Do Not Require Factory Inspections.
A. Housing completely assembled on the building site does not require HUD acceptance. This includes housing that is manufactured but is assembled on the site such as: Precut pieces, log wall houses, trussed roof rafters or floor trusses; open panel walls, and other types that can be completely inspected on site.
B. Housing that is assembled in local materials dealers' yards for moving to local sites and to be purchased by an Agency applicant, will be inspected during construction in the yard by the local Agency County representative. These units must be constructed according to the applicable development standard and not transported out of the local Agency County Office jurisdiction. The inspection must be recorded on Form RD 1924-12, “Inspection Report.”
IV. Manufacturer's Actions Required for Submissions to the Agency are listed in attachment 1 to this exhibit B.

This exhibit prescribes thermal performance construction standards to be used in all housing loan and grant programs. These requirements shall supersede the thermal performance requirements in any of the development standards in § 1924.4(h) of this subpart.

# II. Policy
All loan or grant applications involving new construction (except for new Single Family Housing (SFH)) and all applications for conditional commitments (except for new SFH) shall have drawings and specifications prepared to comply with paragraphs IV A or C and IV D of this exhibit. All new SFH construction shall have drawing and specifications prepared to comply with paragraph IV F of this exhibit.

# III. Definitions
A.
British thermal unit
(Btu) means the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound (.4535 Kg.) of water by one degree Fahrenheit (F). For example, one Btu is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water from 59 degrees F to 60 degrees F.
B.
Glazing
is the material set into a sash or door when used as a natural light source and/or for occupant's views of the outdoors.
C.
“R” value,
thermal resistence, is a unit of measure of the ability to resist heat flow. The higher the R value, the higher the insulating ability.
D.
“U” value
is the overall coefficient of heat transmission and is the combined thermal value of all the materials in a building section. U is the reciprocal of R. Thus U = 1/R or R = 1/U or 1/C where C is the thermal conductance and is the unit of measure of the rate of heat flow for the actual thickness of a material one square foot in area at a temperature of one degree Fahrenheit. The lower the U value, the higher the insulating ability.
E.
Winter degree-day
is a unit based on temperature difference and time. For any one day, when the mean temperature is less than 65 degrees F (18.3 degrees Celsius), there are as many degree-days as the number of degrees difference between the mean temperature for the day and 65 degrees F. The daily mean temperature is computed as half the total of the daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures.
F.
CABO Model Energy Code, 1992 Edition (MEC-92)
—This code sets forth the minimum energy/thermal requirements for the design of new buildings and structures or portions thereof and additions to existing buildings. The MEC is maintained by the Council of American Building Officials (CABO).

# IV. Minimum Requirements
A. All multifamily dwellings to be constructed with Agency loan and/or grant funds and all repair, remodeling, or renovation work performed on single family and multifamily dwellings with Agency loan and/or grant funds shall be in conformance with the following, except as provided in paragraphs IV C 3 and IV D of this exhibit:

Winter degree-days may be obtained from the ASHRAE Handbook; the “NAHB Insulation Manual for Homes/Apartments”; local utilities; and the National Climatic Center, Federal Building, Asheville, NC. Manuals are available from NAHB RF, Rockville, MD 20850, or NMWIA, 382 Springfield Avenue, Summit, NJ 07901. Other sources of degree day data may be used if available from a recognized authority.
2
Insulation must be continuous (i.e. no gaps) above all ceiling joists. In pitched roof construction, compression of insulation at the outside building walls is permitted to allow a 1″ ventilation space under the roof sheathing. For any loose fill insulation, a baffle must be provided. Raised trusses are not required.
3
For floors of heated spaces over unheated basements, unheated garages or unheated crawl spaces, the U value of floor section shall not exceed the value shown. A basement, crawl space, or garage shall be considered unheated unless it is provided with a positive heat supply to maintain a minimum temperature of 50 degrees F. Positive heat supply is defined by ASHRAE as “heat supplied to a space by design or by heat losses occurring from energy-consuming systems or components associated with that space.”
Where the walls of an unheated basement or crawl space are insulated in lieu of floor insulation, the total heat loss attributed to the floor from the heated area shall not exceed the heat loss calculated for floors with required insulation.
Insulation may be omitted from floors over heated basement areas or heated crawl spaces if foundation walls are insulated. The U value of foundation wall sections shall not exceed the value shown. This requirement shall include all foundation wall area, including header joist (band joist), to a point 50 percent of the distance from a finish grade to the basement floor level. Equivalent Uo configurations are acceptable.

# Exhibit J to Subpart A of Part 1924—Manufactured Home Sites, Rental Projects and Subdivisions: Development, Installation and Set-Up
Part A—Introduction
Part B—Construction and Land Development
Part C—Drawings, Specifications, Contract Documents and Other Documentation
Part D—Inspection of Development Work

# Part A—Introduction
I.
Purpose and Scope.
This exhibit describes and identifies acceptable site development, installation and set-up practices and concepts for manufactured homes. It is intended for Agency field personnel, builders, developers, sponsors, and others participating in Agency housing programs.
This exhibit applies to all manufactured homes (except those referenced in exhibit B of this subpart) on scattered sites or in rental projects and subdivisions and covers the requirements for design and construction of manufactured home communities. The Agency may approve alternatives or substitutes if it finds the proposed design satisfactory for the proposed use, and if the materials, installation, device, arrangement, or method of work is at least equivalent to that prescribed in this exhibit considering quality, strength, effectiveness, durability, safety and protection of life and health.
The Agency will require satisfactory evidence to be submitted to substantiate claims made regarding the use of any proposed alternative.
II.
Background.
The Agency has authority to make (1) section 502 Rural Housing (RH) loans with respect to manufactured homes and lots, and (2) section 515 Rural Rental Housing (RRH) loans with respect to manufactured home rental projects.
The manufactured home must be constructed in conformance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standard (FMHCSS) and be permanently attached to a site-built permanent foundation which meets or exceeds the Minimum Property Standards (MPS) for One- and Two-Family Dwellings or Model Building Codes acceptable to the Agency. The manufactured home must be permanently attached to that foundation by anchoring devices adequate to resist all loads identified in the MPS. This includes resistance to ground movements, seismic shaking, potential shearing, overturning and uplift loads caused by wind. Note that anchoring straps or cables affixed to ground anchors other than footings will
not
meet these requirements.
7 CFR part 1970 applies on scattered sites, in subdivisions and rental projects with regard to the development, installation and set-up of manufactured homes. To determine the level of environmental analysis required for a particular application, each manufactured home or lot involved will be considered as equivalent to one housing unit or lot. Because the development, installation and set-up of manufactured home communities, including scattered sites, rental projects, and subdivisions, differ in some requirements from conventional site and subdivision development, two of the purposes of this exhibit are to:
A. Encourage economical and orderly development of such communities and nearby areas, and
B. Promote the safety and health of residents of such communities.
Therefore, this exhibit identifies those required standards and regulations and suggested guidelines for eliminating and preventing health and safety hazards and promoting the economical and orderly development and utilization of land for planning and development of manufactured home communities. The exhibit also provides the requirements for meeting the following:
A.
Resistance to Wind.
Foundations and anchorages shall be designed to resist wind forces specified in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) A-58.1-1982 for the geographic area in which the manufactured home will be sited;
B.
Proper Installation.
The manufacturer's installation instructions provided with each manufactured home shall contain instructions for at least one site-built foundation with interior and/or perimeter supports. Agency field office personnel shall review to determine its adequacy as security for an Agency loan only, the foundation design concept for compliance with this exhibit, the Agency/MPS and any Model Building Code acceptable to the Agency in that particular geographic area; and
C.
Proper Foundation Design.
Manufactured homes shall be installed on a foundation system which is designed and constructed to sustain, within allowable stress and settlement limitations, all applicable loads. Any foundation and anchorage system or method of construction to be used should be analyzed in accordance with well-established principles of mechanics and structural engineering.
III.
Definitions.
For the purpose of this exhibit the following definitions apply:
Accessory Building or Structure.
A subordinate building or structure which is an addition to or supplements the facilities provided by a manufactured home.
Anchoring Systems.
An approved system for securing the manufactured home to the ground or foundation system that will, when properly designed and installed, resist overturning and lateral movement of the home from wind forces.
Contiguous.
Sharing a boundary, adjoining or adjacent. A lot or subdivision is considered to be contiguous to other lots or subdivisions if it is adjoining, touching or adjacent.
Federal manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS).
A 1976 federal standard, commonly known as the HUD Standard, for the construction, design and performance of a manufactured home which meets the needs of the public including the need for quality, durability and safety. Units conforming to the FMHCSS are certified by an affixed label that reads as follows:
AS EVIDENCED BY THIS LABEL NO. ________ THE MANUFACTURER CERTIFIES TO THE BEST OF THE MANUFACTURER'S KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF THAT THIS MANUFACTURED HOME HAS BEEN INSPECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND IS CONSTRUCTED IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE FEDERAL MANUFACTURED HOME CONSTRUCTION AND SAFETY STANDARDS IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF MANUFACTURE. SEE DATA PLATE.

E. Manufactured home sites, rental projects and subdivisions shall not be subject to any adverse influences of adjacent land uses. An adverse influence is considered as one that is out of the acceptable level or range of a recognizable standard or where no standard exists is considered a nuisance irrespective of a site being zoned for manufactured home use. Health, safety and aesthetic consequences of location shall be carefully assessed by inspection of the site prior to selection of development. Undesirable land uses sush as deteriorated residential or commercial areas and noxious industrial properties shall be avoided to ensure compatibility. Other undesirable elements such as heavily traveled highways, airport runways, railroad, or fire hazards and other areas subject to recognizably intolerable noise levels shall be avoided.
F. The requirements for streets shall be those found in subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter.
G. The site design and development shall be in accordance with sound engineering and architectural practices and shall provide for all utilities in a manner which allows adequate, economic, safe, energy efficient and dependable systems with sufficient easements for their required installation and maintenance.
H. Utilities for each manufactured home site, rental housing project or subdivision shall be designed and installed in accordance with subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter; and the State health authority having jurisdiction, and all local laws and regulations requiring approval prior to construction.
I. Exhibit C, section V of this subpart shall be complied with by the applicant, dealer-contractor or builder-developer for manufactured home projects with individual water supply and sewage disposal systems. This exhibit shall be used by the Agency County Supervisors, District Directors, and State Directors in reviewing submissions.

A. The design of the site plan for each manufactured community and scattered site shall meet the fire protection and safety requirements of the local authority responsible for providing the necessary fire protection services.
B. All fire detection and alarm systems, and water supply requirements for fire protection for manufactured communities shall be in accordance with the local authority responsible for providing the necessary fire protection services.
C. Any portion of a manufactured home shall not be closer than the local separation requirements of the development standard for side to side, end to end, and end to side siting. If the exposed composite wall and roof of two or more manufactured homes are proposed to be joined they shall be without openings and constructed of materials which will provide a minimum one-hour fire rating each, or the manufactured homes are separated by a one-hour fire rated barrier designed and approved for such installation and permitted by the authority having jurisdiction.
D. Manufactured homes shall not be positioned vertically (stacked) with one over the other in whole or in part without the specific approval of the authority having jurisdiction.

# Part C—Drawings, Specifications, Contract Documents and Other Documentation
I.
General.
Adequate site development and foundation installation drawings and specfications shall be provided by the applicant or dealer-contractor to the Agency to fully describe the construction and other development work. These documents shall be provided according to the requirements of § 1924.5(f)(1) of this subpart. Contract documents will be prepared in accordance with § 1924.6 and, in the case of multiple family housing construction and development, § 1924.13 of this subpart.
A. The documents recommended shall be used as a guide for drawings and specifications to be submitted in support of all types of loan and/or grant applications involving manufactured homes. Adequate and accurate drawings and specifications are necessary to:
1. Determine the acceptability of the physical environment and improvements,
2. Determine compliance with the applicable standards and codes,
3. Review cost estimates, and
4. Provide a basis for financing, inspections, and the warranty.
B. Detailed floor plans, drawings and specifications are not required for any manufactured home to be installed on a scattered site, in a subdivision or rental housing project. However, a schematic floor plan should be submitted by the applicant when applying for Agency financing. The unit must have an affixed label as specified in exhibit D of this subpart indicating that the unit is constructed to the Agency thermal requirements for the appropriate winter degree days. This will indicate that the manufacturer certifies that the unit has been properly inspected and it meets the Agency Thermal Performance Construction Standard.
C. For proposed construction, the builder or dealer-contractor shall submit with the loan or grant application design calculations, details and drawings for the installation, anchorage and construction of the permanent foundations and perimeter enclosure to be used. Drawings and specifications for foundation systems will be reviewed and examined by either the Agency County Supervisor, District Director, or State Architect/Engineer for foundation support locations, loads and connection requirements specified by the manufacturer as a basis for evaluating foundation compliance with the Agency/MPS or Model Building Code, and for determining design suitability for soil conditions. Drawings and specifications will also be examined by the Agency to determine compliance with all other on-site features not covered by the FMHCSS.
D. Foundation design sections and details of all critical construction points systems, anchorage methods, and structural items shall be scaled as necessary to provide all appropriate information 1:30 (3/8″ = 1′-0″) minimum.
II.
Scattered Sites.
Drawings for single family manufactured housing shall be submitted by the applicant in addition to the requirements of paragraph I above and the requirements of paragraphs II A and D-7 of exhibit C of this subpart.
III.
Subdivisions.
Subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter will be used in preparing and providing supporting documents.
IV.
Rental Housing Projects.
Subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter will be used in preparing and providing supporting documents.
V.
Specifications.
A. Form RD 424-2, “Description of Materials,” or other acceptable and comparable descriptions of all materials used for site development, foundation installation and the permanent perimeter enclosure shall be submitted with the drawings by the applicant.
B. The material identification information shall be in sufficient detail to fully describe the material, size and grade. Where necessary, additional sheets shall be attached as well as manufacturer's specification sheets for equipment and/or special materials.

# Part D—Inspection of Development Work
I.
General.
The following policies will govern the inspection of all manufactured housing development work. This includes scattered sites, subdivisions, rental housing projects and all accessory structures and related facilities unless otherwise indicated.
II.
Inspections.
A. The responsibility for frequency and propose of inspections shall be in accordance with § 1924.9(b) (1), (2) and (3) of this subpart. The inspection requirements of § 1924.13 apply to the planning and conduct of construction work on all 515 housing developments that are more extensive in scope and more complex in nature than those involving an individual manufactured housing unit. The Stage 2 inspection customary for site-built housing when the building is enclosed is not required for manufactured homes.
The Stage 2 inspection for manufactured homes will be made within two working days after erection or placement on the foundation to determine compliance with accepted installation drawings and specifications for installation and set-up and to verify that the correct unit is on the site.
Stages 2 and 3 inspections for manufactured homes may be combined when authorized by the State Director.
B. The borrower will join the County Supervisor or the District Director in making periodic inspections as often as possible and always for the final inspection.
C. The borrower should be encouraged to make enough periodic visits to the site to be familiar with the progress and performance of the work in order to protect the borrower's interest. If the borrower observes or otherwise becomes aware of any fault or defect in the work or nonconformance with the contract documents, the borrower should give prompt written notice thereof to the dealer-contractor and a copy of the notice to the appropriate County Supervisor or District Director.
D. During inspection, it will generally be infeasible to determine whether a manufactured unit erected on a site was properly braced and stiffened during transportation. Inspectors should examine these units to determine that there is no obvious damage or loosening of fastenings that may have occurred during transportation. The dealer-contractor must warrant these units against such damage, which should protect the Agency's interest.
III.
Warranty Plan Coverage.
The warranty requirements for all development work shall be in accordance with § 1924.9(d) of this subpart and 7 CFR part 3550, subpart B.
[51 FR 41603, Nov. 18, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 19283, May 22, 1987; 53 FR 2156, Jan. 26, 1988; 67 FR 78327, Dec. 24, 2002; 81 FR 11029, Mar. 2, 2016]

# Exhibit K to Subpart A of Part 1924—Classifications for Multi-Family Residential Rehabilitation Work

# I. General
This exhibit distinguishes between what the Agency considers maintenance and repair work, moderate rehabilitation and substantial rehabilitation. In all cases, the building or project to be rehabilitated shall be structurally sound. The applicant shall have a structural analysis of the existing building made to determine the adequacy of all structural systems for the proposed rehabilitation.

# II. Definitions
Maintenance and Repair—Work involved in the selective replacement and general maintenance and repair of certain materials, appliances or components of an existing residential building.
Moderate Rehabilitation—All work directly involved in the rearrangement of interior space, the replacement of finish materials or components of the electrical, plumbing, heating or conveyance systems of an existing multi-family residential building. Work and improvements are considered to be more than routine maintenance and repair.
Substantial Rehabilitation—All work directly involved in the rearrangement of interior space that involves alteration of load bearing partitions and columns; the replacement of the electrical, plumbing, heating or conveyance systems; and the addition to and/or major conversion of existing multi-family residential buildings or other building structures.
Moderate rehabilitation and repair shall not be limited to building changes for cosmetic or convenience purposes. In all cases moderate rehabilitation shall involve a minimum of three (3) components of building rehabilitation listed as moderate. Unless combined with other improvements in a project that are considered to be moderate or substantial rehabilitation the items identified as maintenance and repair are considered to be cosmetic and convenience changes.
When a rehabilitation project consists of both moderate and substantial rehabilitation components, those substantial rehabilitation components shall be in accordance with the Agency's development standards and local codes and regulation requirements. Where the majority of project components of building rehabilitation are considered substantial
the project shall be considered in the substantial rehabilitation category.
Those site components of rehabilitation such as landscaping, grading, drainage, fencing, parking areas, recreation areas, water and waste disposal systems, etc., whether considered either maintenance and repair, moderate rehabilitation or substantial rehabilitation shall be in accordance with the Agency's development standards for site development work; all local codes and regulation requirements; and sound engineering and architectural practices.
Any alteration of a structure listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places may be considered either moderate or substantial rehabilitation; however, it shall conform first to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and then to the Agency's requirements. In cases where the Secretary of the Interior's standards cannot be met, rehabilitation will conform to the agreed upon approaches, treatments and techniques resulting from the consultation process between the Agency, the borrower, the State Historic Preservation Officer and the Advisory Council of Historic Preservation.

# III. Components of Multi-Family Building Rehabilitation

Pt. 1924, Subpt. A, Exh. L

# Exhibit L to Subpart A of Part 1924—Insured 10-Year Home Warranty Plan Requirements

# I. Purpose
In recent years, numerous third-party home warranty plans have been developed offering new homeowners varying degrees of protection against builder default and/or major structural defects in their homes. This exhibit establishes the criteria and procedures by which a warranty plan is found acceptable for new construction of single family homes financed by the Agency. An acceptable warranty plan will:
A. Assure that the Agency borrowers receive adequate warranty coverage,
B. In certain circumstances, eliminate the requirement for the Agency personnel to make the first two construction inspections, and
C. Permit a loan up to the market value of the security (less the unpaid principal balance and past due interest of any other liens against the security), even though the Agency personnel may not have performed period inspections during construction.

# II. Types of Warranty Companies
A. An insured warranty company is underwritten by an insurance carrier, licensed to operate as an insurer by the states where the warranty company plans to operate, and has an acceptable rating from a nationally recognized rating company such as A.M. Best Company.
B. A risk retention group is an insurer which is licensed in one state and is authorized, under the Products Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981, to issue its policies in all states. This authority is not challenged by the Agency; however, there remains some question as to the legal propriety of a 10-year insured warranty insurer to be a risk-retention group. If at some future time any state insurance commission or regulatory agency challenges the legal authority of such group, the Agency will reconsider its acceptance of the group.
C. Individual state warranty plans, such as that offered by the State of New Jersey, are backed by the full faith and credit of the state government.

# III. Plan Requirements
To be considered acceptable, a warranty plan must include the following features:
A. The entire cost (fee, premium, etc.) of the coverage is prepaid and coverage automatically transfers to subsequent owners without additional cost.
B. The coverage is not cancellable by the warrantor (builder), warranty company or insurer.
C. The coverage age includes at least the following:
(1) For one year from the effective date, any defects caused by faulty workmanship of defective materials.
(2) During the second year after the effective date, the warranty continues to cover the wiring, piping and duct work of the electrical, plumbing, heating and cooling systems, plus the items in (3).
(3) During the third through the tenth years, the warranty continues to cover major structural defects. A major structural defect is actual damage to the load-bearing portion of the home including damage due to subsidence, expansion or lateral movement of the soil (excluding movement caused by flood or earthquake) which affects its load-bearing function and which vitally effects or is imminently likely to affect use of the home for residential purposes.
D. A system is provided for complaint (claims) handling which includes a conciliation and, if necessary to resolve matters in dispute, arbitration arranged by the American Arbitration Association or similar organization.
E. A construction inspection plan is required if the Agency is to eliminate the first two Agency inspections or permit a full market value loan when Agency inspections are not conducted.

# IV. Information for Review
A. Companies submitting warranty plans for a determination of acceptability must support requests with the following information.
(1) Evidence that the insured warranty company has met the applicable state licensing and/or regulatory requirements in the state in which the company plans to operate.
(2) Evidence that the insurance carrier underwriting the warranty plan is licensed to operate as an insurer in the states in which the company plans to operate and has an acceptable rating from a nationally recognized company such as A.M. Best Company.
(3) State warrenty plan agencies will provide evidence that the plan is backed by the full faith and credit of the state.
(4) A full description of the warranty plan including information on the fees, builder and home registration procedures, required
construction standards, construction inspection procedures, coverage provided and claims procedures.
(5) A sample copy of the warranty information and/or policy which is provided to the homeowner.
(6) Suggested means by which Agency field offices can readily assure that the builder is a member in good standing prior to loan approval and that a warrant will be issued upon the completion of construction prior to the final release of funds.
B. Submission and Acceptance:
(1) Insured warranty companies, except those operating as risk retention groups, and state warranty plan agencies will submit their requests and supporting information to the Agency State Director in the state in which they plan to operate. State Directors will determine the acceptability of insured warranty plans and state warranty plans in their jurisdictions, notify the company or agency of the decision in writing and notify field offices by issuance of a State Supplement including the names and addresses of acceptable warranty companies and any other pertinent information.
(2) Warranty companies claiming authority as risk retention groups will submit their requests and supporting information including certification that it has complied with all requirements of the Products Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-45) and information indicating the state in which it is licensed, information to the Agency National Office, Single Family Housing Processing Division. The National Office will determine the acceptability of the warranty of a risk retention group, notify the company of the decision in writing and notify field offices by issuance of an attachment to this exhibit.

# V. Warranty Performance
A. County Supervisors will report inadequate warranty performance through their District Director to the State Director. State Directors will review the situation, assist in resolving any problems and, if necessary, initiate action under subpart F of part 1942 of this chapter. State Directors will inform, by memorandum, the Director, Single Family Housing Processing Division, National Office, of any problems with warranty performance and if any debarment action is initiated.
B. State Directors will annually monitor each warranty company and/or its insurer to assure continued compliance with state licensing and/or regulatory requirements.

# Attachment 1—Acceptable Warranty Companies
The warranty companies listed below claim authority to act as a risk retention group under the Products Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981 and as such, to operate in all States to provide 10-year home warranties. This authority remains subject to future challenges by any State insurance commissioner or regulatory agency; however, until such challenge is made, the Agency accepts their warranty.

General.
Planning is an evaluation of specific development for a specific site. Planning must take into consideration topography, soils, climate, adjacent land use, environmental impacts, energy efficiency, local economy, aesthetic and cultural values, public and private services, housing and social conditions, and a degree of flexibility to accommodate changing demands. All planning and performing development work is the responsibility of the applicant or developer. All development will be arranged and completed according to applicable local, state, or Federal regulations including applicable health and safety standards, environmental requirements, and requirements of this subpart. When a public authority requires inspections prior to final acceptance, written assurance by the responsible public authority of compliance with local, city, county, state or other public codes, regulations, and ordinances is required prior to final acceptance by RHS.
(1) [Reserved]
(2)
Technical Services.
[Reserved]
(i) [Reserved]
(ii) An applicant or developer for a Multiple Family Housing project or a Single Family Housing site which requires technical services under § 1924.13(a), must contract for the technical services of an architect, engineer, land surveyor, landscape architect, or site planner, as appropriate, to provide complete planning, drawings, and specifications. Such services may be provided by the applicant's or developer's “in house” staff subject to RHS concurrence. Technical services must be performed by professionals who are qualified and authorized to provide such services in the state in which the project would be developed. All technical services must be provided in accordance with the requirements of professional registration or licensing boards. At completion of all construction or completion of a phase or phases of the total project, the persons providing technical services under this section must notify the RHS field office in writing that all work has been completed in substantial conformance with the approved plans and specifications.

(2) [Reserved]
(c)
Multiple Family Housing.
Exhibit C (available in any RHS office) should be used as a guide by the applicant or developer in preparing a proposal and supporting documents for multiple family housing projects.
§ 1924.106
Location.
(a)
General.
It is RHS's policy to promote compact community development and to finance projects that avoid or minimize conversion of wetlands or important farmlands, avoid unwarranted alterations or encroachment on
floodplains, and avoid unwarranted adverse effects to historic properties (including those listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places), when practicable alternatives exist to meet development needs; RHS is prohibited from financing development within the Coastal Barrier Resource System, or on a barrier island. A complete listing of the environmental review requirements is found in 7 CFR part 1970. In order to be eligible for RHS participation:
(1) The site must be located in an eligible area as defined in the program regulations under which the development is being funded or approved.
(2) The site must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.
(b)
Single Family Housing.
In addition to the general requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, sites must provide a desirable, safe, functional, convenient, and attractive living environment for the residents.
(c)
Multiple Family Housing.
Multiple family housing projects shall be located in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (r) of § 1944.215. Locating sites in less than desirable locations of the community because they are in close proximity to undesirable influences such as high activity railroad tracks; adjacent to or behind industrial sites; bordering sites or structures which are not decent, safe, or sanitary; or bordering sites which have potential environmental concerns such as processing plants, etc., is not acceptable. Screening such sites does not make them acceptable. Sites which are not an integral part of a residential community and do not have a reasonable access, either by location or terrain, to essential community facilities such as water, sewerage, schools, shopping, employment opportunities, medical facilities, etc., are not acceptable.
[60 FR 24543, May 9, 1995, as amended at 81 FR 11030, Mar. 2, 2016]
§ 1924.107
Utilities.
All development under this subpart must have adequate, economic, safe, energy efficient, dependable utilities with sufficient easements for installation and maintenance.
(a)
Water and wastewater disposal systems
—(1)
Single Family Housing.
If sites are served by central water or sewer systems, the systems must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. If sites have individual water or sewer systems, they must meet the requirements of the state department of health or other comparable reviewing and regulatory authority and the minimum requirements of exhibit B (available in any RHS field office), paragraphs V and VI. Sites in subdivisions of more than 25 dwelling units on individual systems, or sites that do not meet the requirements of exhibit B, paragraphs V and VI, must have state director concurrence.
(2)
Multiple Family Housing.
Proposals processed under this paragraph shall be served by centrally owned and operated water and wastewater disposal systems unless this is determined by RHS to be economically or environmentally not feasible. All central systems, whether they are public, community, or private, shall meet the design requirements of the state department of health or other comparable reviewing and regulatory authority. The regulatory authority will verify in writing that the water and wastewater systems are in compliance with the current provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, respectively.
(i) Sites which are not presently served by a central system, but are scheduled for tie-in to the central system within 2 years, should have all lines installed during the initial construction. Such sites must have an approved interim water supply or wastewater disposal system installed capable of satisfactory service until the scheduled tie-in occurs.
(ii) In addition to written assurance of compliance with state and local requirements, there must be assurance of continuous service at reasonable rates for central water and wastewater disposal systems. Public ownership is preferred whenever possible. In cases where interim facilities are installed pending extension or construction of permanent public services, the developer must assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the interim facility or establish an entity
for its operation and maintenance which is acceptable to the local governing body. If a system is not or will not be publicly owned and operated, it must comply with one of the following:
(A) Be an organization that meets the ownership and operating requirements for a water or wastewater disposal system that RHS could finance under 7 CFR part 1942, subpart A or be dedicated to and accepted by such an organization.
(B) Be an organization or individual that meets other acceptable methods of ownership and operation as outlined in HUD Handbook 4075.12, “Ownership and Organization of Central Water and Sewerage Systems.” RHS should be assured that the organization has the right, in its sole discretion, to enforce the obligation of the operator of the water and sewerage systems to provide satisfactory continuous service at reasonable rates.
(C) Be adequately controlled as to rates and services by a public body (unit of Government or public services commission).
(iii) Multiple family developments of more than 25 units with individual system must have national office concurrence.
(A) [Reserved]
(B) Supporting information for the proposed individual water systems, covering the following points:
(
1
) In areas where difficulty is anticipated in developing an acceptable water supply, the availability of a water supply will be determined before closing the loan.
(
2
) Documentation must be provided that the quality of the supply meets the chemical, physical, and bacteriological standards of the regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The maximum contaminant levels of U.S. EPA shall apply. Individual water systems must be tested for quantity and bacteriological quality. Where problems are anticipated with chemical quality, chemical tests may be required. Chemical tests would be limited to analysis for the defects common to the area such as iron and manganese, hardness, nitrates, pH, turbidity, color, or other undesirable elements. Polluted or contaminated water supplies are unacceptable. In all cases, assurance of a potable water supply before loan closing is required.
(C) Supporting information for individual wastewater disposal systems with subsurface discharge provided by a soil scientist, geologist, soils engineer, or other person recognized by the local regulatory authority. This data must include the following:
(
1
) Assurance of nonpollution of ground water. The local regulatory authority having jurisdiction must be consulted to ensure that installation of individual wastewater systems will not pollute ground water sources or create other health hazards or otherwise violate State water quality standards.
(
2
) Records of percolation tests. Guidance for performing these tests is included in the EPA design manual, “Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems” and the minimum RHS requirements are in exhibit B, paragraph VI. (These may be waived by the state director when the state has established other acceptable means for allowing onsite disposal.)
(
3
) Determination of soil types and description. The assistance of the SCS or other qualified persons should be obtained for soil type determination and a copy of its recommendations included in the documentation.
(
4
) Description of ground water elevations, showing seasonal variations.
(
5
) Confirmation of space allowances. An accurate drawing to indicate that there is adequate space available to satisfactorily locate the individual water and wastewater disposal systems; likewise, documented assurance of compliance with all local requirements. Structures served by wastewater disposal systems with subsurface discharge require larger sites than those structures served by another type system.
(
6
) Description of exploratory pit observations, if available.
(D) Supporting information for individual wastewater disposal systems with surface discharge covering the following points:
(

# Exhibit B to Subpart C of Part 1924—Site Development Design Requirements
This exhibit prescribes site development requirements to be used in developing residential sites in all housing programs. These requirements cover only those areas which involve health and safety concerns. They are not intended to cover all aspects of site development. Applicants and developers are expected to follow local practice, as a minimum, in all areas of site development not addressed in this exhibit. When State, local, or other requirements are applicable in addition to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's requirements, the most stringent requirement shall apply.
Proper integration of the natural features of a site with the manmade improvements is one of the most critical aspects of residential development. Poor site planning in large scale subdivisions, rental projects and individual sites, has resulted in a loss of valuable private and public natural resources and caused economic burdens and conditions unsuitable for healthy and pleasant living. Proper site design can preserve desirable natural features of the site, minimize expenses for streets and utilities, and provide a safe and pleasant living environment.

Where storm drainage flow is concentrated, permanently maintained facilities shall be provided to prevent significant erosion and other damage or flooding on site or on adjacent properties.
B.
Drainage Design and Flood Hazard Exposure
—1.
Storm Frequency.
Drainage facilities shall be designed for a 10 year storm frequency of 24-hour duration. Full potential development of all contributing areas shall be used as a basis for this determination.
2.
Street Drainage.
Streets shall be useable during runoff equivalent to a 10-year return frequency. Where drainage outfall is inadequate to prevent runoff equivalent to a 10-year return frequency from ponding over 6 inches deep, streets shall be made passable for local commonly used emergency vehicles during runoff equivalent to a 25-year return frequency except where an alternative access street not subject to such ponding is available.
3.
Foundation Drainage.
Appropriate crawl space and foundation drainage shall be provided for the removal of subsurface moisture.
C.
Primary Storm Sewer
—1.
Pipe Size.
Pipe size for the primary storm sewer (any storm sewer or inlet lateral located in a street or other public right-of-way) shall have an inside diameter based on design analysis but not less than 15 inches. Where anticipated runoff from the five-year return frequency rainfall will not fill a 15 inch pipe, a primary storm sewer system usually is unnecessary.
2.
Minimum Gradient.
Minimum gradient shall be selected to provide for self-scouring of the conduit under low-flow conditions and for removal of sediments foreseeable from the drainage area.
3.
Easements.
Easements for storm sewers shall be a minimum of 10 feet in width.
D.
Drainage Swals and Gutters
—1.
Design.
Paved gutters shall have a minimum grade of 0.5 percent. Paved gutters and unpaved drainage swales shall have adequate depth and width to accommodate the maximum foreseeable runoff without overflow. Swales and gutters shall be seeded, sodded, sprigged or paved as appropriate to minimize potential erosion. Side slopes shall be no steeper than 2:1.
2.
Easements.
Surface channels shall have an easement which is at least the width of the channel plus 10 feet.
E.
Downspouts
—1.
Outfall.
Where downspouts are provided, they shall either be connected to an available storm sewer, provided with suitable splash blocks, or empty at acceptable locations onto paved areas so that water drains away from buildings. Downspouts shall not connect to sanitary sewers.
2.
Piped Drainage.
Piped roof drainage from buildings shall be connected to available storm sewers or empty at locations where no erosion or other damage will be caused.
F.
Storm Inlets and Catch Basins
—1.
Openings.
Where inlets are accessible to small children, openings shall have one dimension limited to 6 inch access. Inlet openings in paved areas shall be designed to avoid entrapment or impedence of bicycles, baby carriages, etc.
2.
Access.
Access for cleaning shall be provided to all inlet boxes and catch basins.
G.
Drywells
—Drywells for the disposal of water from foundation drains, crawl spaces, and other small quantity sources shall be permissible where the bottom of drywells project into strata of undistributed porous soil at a level where the bottom of the drywell will be above the ground water table at its highest seasonal elevation.

# V. Water Supply Systems
A.
Individual Water Systems
—1.
General.
a. In this subpart, an individual water system is a system which serves fewer customers or connections than the lower threshold for community systems stated in the Safe Drinking Water Act.
b. The system for an individual household should be capable of delivering a sustained
flow of 5 gpm. A system supplying water to multiple household shall be designed by a Professional Engineer and have sufficient capacity to serve estimated demand. A test of at least 4 hours duration shall be conducted to determine the yield and maximum drawdown for all wells developed as part of an individual water system. This test may be waived by the State Office based on the hydrologic and geologic conditions in the area.
c. Water that requires continual or repetitive treatment to be safe bacterially is not acceptable.
d. After installation, the system should be disinfected in accordance with the recommendations of the health authority. In the absence of a health authority, system cleaning and disinfection should conform with the current EPA Manual of Individual Water Supply Systems.
e. Any method for individual water supply contained herein which is not permitted by the local health authority having jurisdiction shall not be used.
2.
Well Location
—a. A well located within the foundation walls of a dwelling is not acceptable except in arctic and sub-arctic regions.
b. Water which comes from soil formation which may be polluted or contaminated or is fissured or creviced or which is less than 20 feet below the natural ground surface (subject to the requirements of the local health authority) is not acceptable.
c. Individual water supply systems are not acceptable for individual lots in areas where chemical soil poisoning is practiced if the overburden of soil between the ground surface and the water bearing strata is coarse-grained sand, gravel, or porous rock, or is creviced in a manner which will permit the recharge water to carry the toxicants into the zone of saturation.
d. Table 5 shall be used in establishing the minimum acceptable distances between wells and sources of pollution located on either the same or adjoining lots. These distances may be increased by either the health authority having jurisdiction or the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director.

Notes:
1
The horizontal distance between the sewage absorption system and the well, or the chemically poisoned soil and the well, may be reduced to 50 feet only where the ground surface is effectively separated from the water bearing formation by an extensive, continuous impervious strata of clay, hard-pan, or rock. The well shall be constructed so as to prevent the entrance of surface water and contaminants.
2
Other sources of pollution could be fuel oil or gasoline storage tanks, farm yards or chemical storage tanks, etc. The well should be separated from these sources of pollution a distance recommended by the local health authority.
3.
Well Construction
—a. The well shall be constructed to allow the pump to be easily placed and to function properly.
b. All drilled wells shall be provided with a sound, durable and watertight casing capable of sustaining the loads imposed. The casing shall extend from a point several feet below the water level at drawdown or from an impervious strata above the water level, to 12 inches above either the ground surface or the pump room floor. The casing shall be sealed at the upper opening.
c. Bored wells shall be lined with concrete, vitrified clay, or equivalent materials.
d. The space between the casing or liner and the wall of the well hole shall be sealed with cement grout.
e. The well casing shall not be used to convey water except under positive pressure. A separate drop pipe shall be used for suction line.
f. When sand or silt is encountered in the water-bearing formation, the well shall either be gravel packed, or a removable strainer or screen shall be installed.
g. The surface of the ground above and around the well shall be graded to drain surface water away from the well.
h. Openings in the casing, cap, or concrete cover for the entrance of pipes, pump or manholes, shall be made watertight.
i. If a breather is provided, it shall extend above the highest level to which surface water may rise. The breather shall be watertight, and the open end shall be screened and positioned to prevent entry of dust, insects and foregin objects.
4.
Pumps and Equipment
—a. Pumps shall be capable of delivering the volume of water required herein under normal operating pressures within the living unit. Well pump capacity shall not exceed the output of the well.
b. Pumps and equipment shall be mounted to be free of objectionable noises, vibrations, flooding, pollution, and freezing.
c. Suction lines shall terminate below maximum drawdown of the water level in the well.
d. Horizontal segments of suction line shall be placed below the frost line in a sealed casing pipe or in at least 4 inches of concrete. The distance from suction line to sources of pollution shall be not less than shown in table 5.
5.
Storage Tanks
—a. A system for an individual household shall include a pressure tank having a minimum capacity of 42-gallons. However, prepressured tanks and other pressurizing devices are acceptable provided that delivery between pump cycles equals or exceeds that of a 42 gallon tank. Storage capacity on a system for multiple households must be sufficient to meet estimated peak demands.
b. Tanks shall be equipped with a clean-out plug at the lowest point, and if pressurized, a suitable pressure relief valve.
c. When additional storage is necessary because the well yield will not meet the system peak demands, all nonpressurized intermediate tanks shall be designed and installed in a manner that will prevent the pollution or degradation of the water supply.
B.
Community Water Systems
—1.
Definition.
In this subpart, a community water system is a system which meets the definition in the Safe Drinking Water Act.
2.
Design.
A community water system shall be designed by a qualified, professional engineer licensed in the state in which the water system will be located. Community water systems shall comply with all Federal and State laws.

# VI. Wastewater Disposal Systems
Each dwelling shall be provided with a water-carried system adequate to dispose of domestic wastes in a manner which will not create a nuisance, contaminate any existing or prospective water source or water supply, or in any way endanger the public health.
A.
Individual Wastewater Disposal Systems
—1.
General.
a. In this subpart, an individual wastewater disposal system is a sewage disposal system which serves only 1 dwelling unit.
b. When service from an acceptable public or community system is not available or feasible, and ground water and soil conditions are acceptable, an individual system may be used.
c. Each individual wastewater disposal system shall consist of a house sewer, a pretreatment unit (e.g., septic tank, individual package treatment plant), and acceptable absorption system (subsurface absorption field, seepage pit(s), or subsurface absorption bed). The system shall be designed to receive all sanitary sewage (bathrooms, kitchen and laundry) from the dwelling, but not footing or roof drainage. It shall be designed so that gases generated anywhere in the system can easily flow back to the building sewer stack.
2.
Percolation Tests
—a. Percolation tests are required unless a waiver is granted by the National Office. Waivers may be granted on a statewide or local basis in cases where an onsite evaluation of soils would be performed by a qualified soil technician, soil scientist, or engineer. Requests for waivers must describe the qualifications of the person evaluating the soils and discuss the criteria to be used in designing the absorption system.
b. In uniform soils one percolation test shall be made within each area proposed for an absorption system. If significant soil variations are encountered or expected, additional tests shall be made for each variation.
c. Percolation tests shall be conducted in accordance with good practice. Guidance for performing these tests is included in the EPA design manual, “Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems.”
3.
Subsurface Absorption System
—a. Where percolation rates, soil characteristics and site conditions are acceptable, an absorption system may be installed in an area which is well drained, has an acceptable slope, and is acceptable for excavation.
b. Soils with percolation rates less than 1 minute per inch may be used if the soil is replaced with a layer of loamy or fine sand at least 2 feet thick. (Refer to the EPA Design Manual, “Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Disposal System”.)
c. Soils with percolation rates greater than 60 minutes per inch are not acceptable for subsurface wastewater disposal systems.
B.
Community Wastewater Disposal Systems

# Subpart F—Complaints and Compensation for Construction Defects

# Source:
56 FR 40241, Aug. 14, 1991, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1924.251
Purpose.
This subpart contains policies and procedures for receiving and resolving complaints concerning the construction of dwellings and construction, installation and set-up of manufactured homes (herein called “units”), financed by the Rural Development, and for compensating borrowers for structural defects under section 509(c) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended. Provisions of this subpart do not apply to dwellings financed with guaranteed section 502 loans.
§ 1924.252
Policy.
Rural Development is responsible for receiving and resolving all complaints concerning the construction of dwellings and the construction, installation and set-up of units financed by Rural Development. Rural Development must determine whether defects are structural or non-structural. If the defect is structural and is covered by the builder's/dealer-contractor's (the “contractor”) warranty, the contractor is expected to correct the defect. If the contractor cannot or will not correct the defect, the costs of correcting the defect may be paid by the Government, or the borrower may be compensated for correcting the defect, under the provisions of this subpart. If the defect is non-structural but is covered under the provisions of the contractor's warranty or independent home warranty, the contractor is still expected to correct the defect. Rural Development will assist the borrower in obtaining assistance through the independent home warranty company's and/or manufacturer's complaint resolution process. However, if the contractor cannot or will not correct a non-structural defect covered under the provisions of the contractor's warranty, the Government will not pay the costs for correcting the defect, nor will the borrower be compensated for doing so.
§ 1924.253
Definitions.
As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply:
(a)
Newly constructed dwelling.
One which:
(1) Is financed with a section 502 insured loan;
(2) Was constructed substantially or wholly under the contract method, or under a conditional commitment, or, as to only work performed by a contractor or covered by a manufacturer's warranty, under the mutual self-help program;
(3) Was not more than one year old and not previously occupied as a residence at the time financial assistance was granted unless Rural Development has extended the conditional commitment issued on a newly constructed dwelling in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550; and
(4) Had the required construction inspections performed by Rural Development, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), or the Veterans Administration (VA).
(b)
Newly constructed manufactured home (unit).
One which:
(1) Is financed with a section 502 insured loan;
(2) Was not more than one year old and not previously occupied as a residence at the time financial assistance was granted; and
(3) Is built to the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS) and is certified by an affixed label as shown in exhibit J of subpart A of part 1924 of this chapter.
(c)
Non-structural defect.
A construction defect which does not affect the overall useful life, habitability, or structural integrity of the dwelling or unit. Some non-structural defects may be covered under the contractor's warranty. Examples of non-structural defects include, but are not limited to:
(1) Cracks attributed to normal curing or settlement.
(2) Cosmetic defects in cabinets, woodwork, floorcovering, wallcovering, ornamental trim, etc.
(3) Improper or incomplete seeding or sodding of yard, or failure of trees, shrubs, grass and other landscaping items to thrive.
(4) Improper grading of yard, unless the grade is causing damage which may lead to a structural defect.
(d)
Structural defect.
A defect in the dwelling or unit, installation or set-up of a unit, or a related facility or a deficiency in the site or site development which directly and significantly reduces the useful life, habitability, or integrity of the dwelling or unit. The defect may be due to faulty material, poor workmanship, or latent causes that existed when the dwelling or unit was constructed. The term includes, but is not limited to:
(1) Structural failures which directly and significantly affect the basic integrity of the dwelling or unit such as in the foundation, footings, basement walls, slabs, floors, framing, walls, ceiling, or roof.
(2) Major deficiencies in the utility components of the dwelling or unit or
site such as faulty wiring, or failure of sewage disposal or water supply systems located on the property securing the loan caused by faulty materials or improper installation.
(3) Serious defects in or improper installation of heating systems or central air conditioning.
(4) Defects in or improper installation of safety and security devices, such as windows, external doors, locks, smoke detectors, railings, etc., as well as failure to provide or properly install devices to aid occupancy of dwellings by handicapped individuals, where required.
(5) Defects in or improper installation of protective materials, such as insulation, siding, roofing material, exterior paint, etc.
[56 FR 40241, Aug. 14, 1991, as amended at 67 FR 78327, Dec. 24, 2002]
§§ 1924.254-1924.257
[Reserved]
§ 1924.258
Notification of borrowers.
Rural Development will notify by letter all borrowers who receive Section 502 RH financial assistance for a newly constructed dwelling or unit of the provisions of this subpart. Subsequent owners of eligible dwellings will also be notified in accordance with this section. Borrowers will be notified within 30 days after the loan is closed, or within 30 days after final inspection, whichever is later. This notification will contain information concerning time frames for filing claims under this subpart. Rural Development will also notify and advise borrowers of the construction defects procedure at any time construction defects are apparent within the statutory time frame and favorable results cannot be obtained from the contractor. This notification will be documented in the borrower's case file.
§ 1924.259
Handling dwelling construction complaints.
This section describes the procedure for handling construction defect complaints.
(a) Each borrower who complains about construction defects will be requested to make a written complaint using a Rural Development approved format. All known defects will be listed. An oral complaint may be accepted if making a written complaint will impose a hardship on the borrower. If an oral complaint is made, Rural Development will notify the contractor on behalf of the borrower.
(b) The borrower will be informed that if, after 30 calendar days, the defects have not been corrected or other satisfactory arrangements made by the contractor, the borrower should notify Rural Development using a Rural Development approved format.
(c) Rural Development will advise the contractor in writing of the borrower's complaint, the time and date of planned inspection by Rural Development personnel, and request that the contractor accompany the inspector and borrower on a joint inspection of the property in an attempt to resolve the complaint.
(d) If, prior to the planned inspection, the contractor informs Rural Development that the alleged defect(s) has been or will be corrected within 30 calendar days, Rural Development will notify the borrower.
(e) If the case is not resolved as outlined in paragraph (d) of this section, Rural Development will:
(1) [Reserved]
(2) Notify the borrower, contractor and manufacturer, if applicable, in writing of the findings and who has been determined responsible for correcting the defect(s).
(i) If the defects are determined to be covered under the contractor's warranty, Rural Development will advise the contractor that the repairs must be completed within 30 calendar days or other time period agreed to by the borrower, the contractor, and Rural Development.
(ii) Rural Development will further advise the contractor and/or manufacturer that if the defect(s) are not corrected, the Government will consider compensating the borrower for the costs of correcting the defect(s). In such a case, the contractor and/or manufacturer may be liable for costs paid by the Government and may be subject to suspension and/or debarment pursuant to subpart M of part 1940 of this
chapter (available in any Rural Development office). Even if the manufacturer is determined to be solely responsible for the defect, the contractor will still be held liable for correction of the defect.
(3) Should a contractor refuse to correct a defect after being officially requested in writing to do so, Rural Development will promptly institute formal suspension and debarment proceedings against the contractor (as a company and as individual(s)) in accordance with subpart M of part 1940 of this chapter (available in any Rural Development office). The contractor's failure to reply to official correspondence or inability to correct a defect constitutes noncompliance.
(4) If the contractor is willing to correct legitimate defects but the borrower refuses to permit this, Rural Development will document the facts in the borrower's case file. If the borrower chooses to file a claim for compensation for these defects, the circumstances of the borrower's refusal will be reviewed and may be sufficient grounds for disapproval of the claim.
(f)-(h) [Reserved]
§ 1924.260
Handling manufactured housing (unit) construction complaints.
When a borrower who has purchased a manufactured home (or “unit”) complains about construction defects, the borrower will be instructed to first contact the dealer-contractor from whom the unit was purchased. Rural Development will assist the borrower in obtaining assistance through the dealer-contractor's and/or HUD's complaint resolution process. If the dealer-contractor cannot resolve the complaint, the borrower should contact the appropriate State Administrative Agency (SAA) or HUD. If the complaint resolution process does not result in the correction of the defect, the borrower's complaint will be handled in accordance with § 1924.259 of this subpart.
§ 1924.261
Handling complaints involving dwellings covered by an independent or insured home warranty plan.
Borrowers with complaints about dwellings covered by an independent or insured home warranty plan will be instructed to first contact the warranty company and follow the complaint resolution process for that company, with the assistance of Rural Development, if needed. If the complaint is not resolved in this manner, it will be handled under § 1924.259 of this subpart.
§ 1924.262
Handling complaints involving dwellings constructed by the self-help method.
When a borrower whose dwelling was constructed by the self-help method complains about construction defects, Rural Development will determine whether the defect is the result of work performed by a contractor or work performed by the borrower under the guidance of the self-help group. Defects which are determined to be the responsibility of a contractor will be handled in accordance with § 1924.259 of this subpart. Defects determined to be the result of work performed by the borrower are not eligible for compensation under this subpart.
§§ 1924.263-1924.264
[Reserved]
§ 1924.265
Eligibility for compensation for construction defects.
(a) To be eligible for assistance under this subpart, the following criteria must be met:
(1) The approval official, in consultation with the State Architect/Engineer and/or Construction Inspector, must determine that:
(i) The construction is defective in workmanship, material or equipment, or
(ii) The dwelling or unit has not been built in substantial compliance with the approved drawings and specifications, or
(iii) The dwelling or unit does not comply with the Rural Development construction standards in effect at the time the loan was approved or the conditional commitment was issued, or
(iv) The property does not meet code requirements.
(2) The claim must be for one or more of the following:
(i) To pay for repairs;
(ii) To compensate the owner for repairs;
(iii) To pay emergency living or other expenses resulting from the defect; or
(iv) To acquire title to property.
(3) The dwelling or unit must be newly constructed as defined in § 1924.253 of this subpart and financed with an insured Section 502 RH loan.
(4) The claim seeking compensation from Rural Development must be filed with Rural Development within 18 months after the date financial assistance is granted. Defects for which claims are filed beyond the 18-month period must have been documented by Rural Development in the borrower's case file or on the form designated by Rural Development (available in any Rural Development office), prior to expiration of the 18-month period. For loans made to construct a new dwelling or erect a new manufactured housing unit, financial assistance is granted on the date of final construction inspection and acceptance by the borrower and Rural Development. Claims must be submitted by completing the designated form (available in any Rural Development office).
(5) Any obligation of the contractor to correct the defect(s) under a contractor's warranty must have expired, or the contractor is responsible for making corrections under the contractor's warranty but is unable or unwilling to do so.
(b) Subsequent owners of eligible dwellings or units who are also Section 502 borrowers may be eligible to receive compensation for construction defects. These owners will be notified in accordance with § 1924.258 of this subpart. However, the claim for compensation must be filed in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section within the 18-month period established for the original rural housing (RH) borrower.
§ 1924.266
Purposes for which claims may be approved.
(a)
Eligible purposes.
A claim may be approved to:
(1) Pay, or reimburse the borrower for costs already paid, to repair major structural defects which are completed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Rural Development. Repairs must be made by a reputable licensed contractor and a warranty covering the repairs will be issued by the contractor when the repairs are completed, as prescribed in subpart A of this part. Payment will be based on actual cost of the development and the borrower must provide evidence to reasonably establish the development cost. Workmanship and materials used in repairs must be consistent with the level of quality specified in the original dwelling or unit specifications and/or comparable to the items being replaced. Payment may be made:
(i) To cover damages which are a direct result of the defect to permanent enhancements made, such as landscaping, completion of unfinished living spaces, etc., of the dwelling or unit, installation or set-up of the unit, or related facilities, and
(ii) For costs approved by Rural Development for professional reports by engineers, architects or others needed to determine cause of or means to repair the defect.
(2) Reimburse the borrower for funds expended for emergency repairs. Emergency repairs are those repairs necessary to preserve the integrity of the structure, to prevent damage or further damage to personal property or fixtures in the dwelling or unit and related facilities, or to prevent or eliminate immediate health hazards. Receipts or other evidence of borrower's expenditures must be provided.
(3) Acquire title to the property by the Government and, when appropriate, compensate the claimant for any loss of borrower contribution at the time the loan was closed. Conveyance of properties under this section will be handled in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550.
(i) Before Rural Development accepts a conveyance, the borrower must attempt to sell the dwelling or unit in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550, if the dwelling or unit is considered decent, safe and sanitary as prescribed in 7 CFR part 3550. If the property is sold, Rural Development will:
(A) Pay the borrower's relocation expenses, including temporary living expenses as prescribed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, until another suitable property can be located;
(B) Pay related sales expenses, as prescribed in 7 CFR part 3550, if the property is sold for less than the debt against it;
(C) Release the borrower from personal liability for the remaining Rural Development debt; and
(D) Process an application for a new RH loan if the borrower so desires and is still eligible for Rural Development assistance.
(ii) If the dwelling or unit is not considered decent, safe and sanitary as prescribed in 7 CFR part 3550, Rural Development should accept a voluntary conveyance of the property under the provisions of 7 CFR part 3550. Compensation for properties taken into inventory under this paragraph may not exceed the difference between the present market value of the security as established by the appraisal when the loan was made and the amount of the Rural Development loan and any prior liens.
(iii) A borrower contribution which may be compensated for under this paragraph may be such things as:
(A) A borrower's land or cash contribution,
(B) Development work done by the borrower under the self-help program or borrower method of construction, the cost of which was not included in the loan funds,
(C) Attorney fees, abstract costs or title insurance costs actually paid by the claimant in connection with closing the loan.
(4) Pay or reimburse the borrower for temporary living expenses, miscellaneous expenses, storage of household goods and moving expenses incurred as a result of the defect.
(i) Payment under this paragraph may be made under either of the following circumstances:
(A) The property is acquired by the Government in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550 and Rural Development determines that the dwelling is not habitable and the severity of the defect(s) prevents the property from being repaired and made suitable as a permanent residence for the borrower.
(B) The property is not acquired by the Government but Rural Development determines that the dwelling is not habitable or must be vacated in order to repair the defects.
(ii) Claims for compensation under paragraph (a)(4) of this section are limited as follows:
(A) Compensation may be granted for temporary living expenses for not more than 45 calendar days per claim unless a longer period is authorized by Rural Development. Compensation will be paid for actual cost to the claimant not to exceed the Government per diem rate for the area where the borrower's dwelling or unit is located. Reimbursement may be claimed for expenses such as food, lodging, laundering, etc., which would not have been incurred had the claimant remained in the house.
(B) Compensation may be granted for actual miscellaneous expenses not to exceed $500 to cover such items as utility connect and disconnect fees.
(C) Compensation may be granted for moving and storage expenses not to exceed $5,000 unless authorized by Rural Development and not to exceed the actual cost of moving the claimant household with personal belongings a distance of not more than 50 miles from the original residence. Compensation for storage expenses may not exceed that amount paid to store household furnishings for 45 days.
(D) A strict accounting of the use of such funds must be maintained by the borrower and will be verified by Rural Development.
(5) Compensate the claimant for reasonable interest paid on loans obtained for the sole purpose of correcting structural defects or other approved purposes under this section.
(b)
Ineligible purposes.
Compensation will not be granted for:
(1) Completion of a dwelling or unit or installation of materials/items required under the construction contract and/or specifications.
(2) Defective items which were not completed under the contract method or under the conditional commitment and supported by a builder's warranty. Work performed under the borrower method or self-help program without a warranty by a responsible party is not eligible for compensation.
(3) Damage caused by defective design, workmanship, or material in
making enhancements to or remodeling the dwelling or unit or related facilities which were not financed or approved by Rural Development.
(4) The loss of past, present or future wages or salary directly or indirectly resulting from the defect.
(5) Treatment for physical or psychological damages including medical and dental claims.
(6) Death benefits or funeral expenses.
(7) Damages encountered as a result of war, civil disorder, flood, tornado, lightning, earthquake or acts of nature which the structure was not designed to withstand.

(a) The County Supervisor will be responsible for ascertaining that all mortgaged real estate is listed properly for tax purposes.
(b) The County Supervisor will be responsible for taking all actions in connection with taxes as may be necessary to protect the Government's security interests. Any unusual situations that may arise with respect to tax servicing should be referred to the State Office for consideration.
(c) The County Supervisor will encourage each borrower to pay taxes promptly in order to avoid any penalties. Normally, this can be accomplished through routine servicing of loans by emphasizing the advantages of setting aside sufficient income to meet tax obligations when they become due. Taxes will be adequately budgeted for those borrowers with whom Form RD 431-2, “Farm and Home Plan,” is developed. Each borrower will be encouraged to notify the County Supervisor when he has paid his taxes. After the delinquent date, it will be necessary for the County Supervisor to determine the borrowers whose taxes are delinquent. The Multi-Family Housing Information System (MFIS) will be used in posting servicing actions on delinquent taxes.

§ 1925.4
Servicing delinquent taxes.
(a) The County Supervisor will contact each borrower with a delinquent tax and make every practical effort to have him pay the tax with his own funds. He will use the Management System Card for follow-up of delinquent taxes. If the delinquent tax is not paid and the borrower comes to the office with proceeds for application on the Agency account secured by the real estate, the County Office personnel will endeavor to get the borrower to use the proceeds to pay the delinquent tax. If the amount of the delinquent tax is less than the amount of the proposed payment, the difference will be applied on the Agency account in accordance with the policy outlined in subpart A of part 1951 of this chapter.
(b) Prior (usually about 90 days) to the time it is legally possible for action to be taken that will cause the borrower to lose title or right of possessions of the security property or the use of essential water, the County Supervisor will contact the borrower and definitely determine if he will pay the delinquent tax immediately. If the borrower is unable or unwilling to pay the delinquent tax with his own funds after every appropriate effort has been made to have him do so, the County Supervisor will refer to RD Instruction 2024-A and utilize the Type 60 Purchase Order System to pay the amount of the delinquent taxes plus the amount of any accrued penalty to bring taxes current.
(1) In an exceptional case where reasons for delinquent taxes have been removed and planned income during the next year covers payment of current obligations plus delinquent taxes not vouchered, only the delinquent taxes will be paid that could cause the borrower to lose title or right of possession of security property.
(2) If the Government is holding a mortgage other than a first mortgage on the property, do not initiate payment request until the County Supervisor has determined that (i) the prior lien holder will not pay the delinquent tax, (ii) the Government's security will be jeopardized if the delinquent tax is not paid, and (iii) the value of the security is sufficient to justify the advance.

§ 1927.53
Costs of title clearance and closing of transactions.
The borrower or the seller, or both, in compliance with the terms of the sales contract or option will be responsible for payment of all costs of title clearance and closing of the transaction and will arrange for payment before the transaction is closed. These costs will include any costs of abstracts of title, land surveys, attorney's fees, owner's and lender's policies of title insurance, obtaining curative material, notary fees, documentary stamps, recording costs, tax monitoring service, and other expenses necessary to complete the transaction.
§ 1927.54
Requirements for closing agents.
(a)
Form of title certification.
State Offices are directed to require title insurance for all loan closings unless the agency determines that the use of title insurance is not available or is economically not feasible for the type of loan involved or the area of the state where the loan will be closed. If title insurance is used, State Offices are authorized to require a closing protection letter issued by an approved title insurance company to cover the closing agent, if available. A closing protection letter need not be furnished when the closing is conducted by the title insurance company.
(b)
Approval of closing agent.
An attorney or title company may act as a closing agent and close agency real estate loans, provide necessary title clearance, and perform such other duties as required in this subpart. A closing agent will be responsible for closing agency loans and disbursing both agency loan funds and funds provided by the borrower in connection with the agency loan so as to obtain title and security position as required by the agency. The closing agent must be covered by a fidelity bond which will protect the agency unless a closing protection letter is provided to the agency. The borrower will select the approved closing agent. If title clearance is by an attorney's opinion, the agency will approve the attorney who will perform the closing in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The attorney will be approved after submitting a certification acceptable to the agency. If title certification is by means of a policy of title insurance, the title company which will issue the policy must have been approved in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. A closing agent's delay in providing services without justification in connection with agency loans may be a basis for not approving the closing agent in future cases.
(c)
Approval of attorneys.
Any attorney selected by an applicant, who will be providing title clearance where the certificate of title will be an attorney's opinion, must submit an agency form certifying to professional liability insurance coverage. If the attorney is also the closing agent, fidelity coverage for the attorney and any employee having access to the funds must be provided. The agency will determine the appropriate level of such insurance. Required insurance will, as a minimum, cover the amount of the loan to be closed. The agency will approve the form stipulating the bond coverage. The agency will approve any attorney who is duly licensed to practice law in the state where the real estate security is located and who complies with the bonding and insurance requirements in this section. If the certification of title will be by means of title insurance, any attorney or closing agent designated as an approved attorney or closing agent by the approved title insurance company which will issue the policy of title insurance will be acceptable, and when covered by a closing protection letter, will not be required to obtain professional liability insurance or a fidelity bond. Each approved title insurance company may provide a master list of their approved attorneys that are covered by its closing protection letters to the State Office and, in such cases the attorneys are approved for closings for that title insurance company. Delay in providing closing services without justification may be a basis for not approving the attorney in future cases.
(d)
Approval of title companies.
A title company acting as a closing agent, or as an issuing agent for a title insurance company, must be covered by a title insurance company closing protection letter or submit an agency form certifying to fidelity coverage to cover all employees having access to the loan funds. The agency will determine the appropriate level of such coverage and will approve the form stipulating the bond coverage. Delay in providing closing services without justification may be a basis for not approving the company in future cases. Each approved title insurance company may provide a master list of their approved title companies that are covered by its closing protection letter to the State Office and, in such cases the title companies on the list are approved for closings for that title insurance company.
(e)
Approval of title insurance companies.
The agency will approve any title
insurance company which issues policies of title insurance in the State where the security property is located if:
(1) The form of the owner's and lender's policies of title insurance (including required endorsements) to be used in closing agency loans are acceptable to the agency, and will contain only standard types of exceptions and exclusions approved in advance by the agency;
(2) The title insurance company is licensed to do business in the state (if a license is required); and
(3) The title insurance company is regulated by a State Insurance Commission, or similar regulator, or if not, the title insurance company submits copies of audited financial statements, or other approved financial statements satisfactory to the agency, which show that the company has the financial ability to cover losses arising out of its activities as a title insurance company and under any closing protection letters issued by the title insurance company.
(4) Delay in providing services without justification may be a basis for not approving the company.
(f) [Reserved]
(g)
Conflict of interest.
A closing agent who has, or whose spouse, children, or business associates have, a financial interest in the real estate which will secure the agency debt shall not be involved in the title clearance or loan closing process. Financial interest includes having either an equity, creditor, or debtor interest in any corporation, trust, or partnership with a financial interest in the real estate which will secure the agency debt.
(h)
Debarment or suspension.
No attorney, title company, title insurance company, or closing agent, currently debarred or suspended from participating in Federal programs, may participate in any aspect of the agency loan closing and title clearance process.
(i)
Special provisions.
Closing agents are responsible for having current knowledge of the requirements of State law in connection with loan closing and title clearance and should advise the agency of any changes in State law which necessitate changes in the agency's State mortgage forms and State Supplements.
(j) [Reserved]
§ 1927.55
Title clearance services.
(a)
Responsibilities of closing agents.
Services to be provided to the agency and the borrower by a closing agent in connection with the transaction vary depending on whether a title insurance policy or title opinion is being furnished. The closing agent is expected to perform these services without unnecessary delay.
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Ordering title services.
Application for title examination or insurance will be made by the borrower to a title company or attorney. The lender's policy will be for at least the amount of the loan. The United States of America will be named as the insured lender.
(d)
Use of title opinion.
If a title opinion will be issued, a title examination will include searches of all relevant land title and other records, so as to express an opinion as to the title of the property and the steps necessary to obtain the appropriate title and security position to issue a title opinion as required by this subpart. The closing agent or approved attorney will determine:
(1) The legal description and all owners of the real property;
(2) Whether there are any exceptions affecting the property and advise the approval official and borrower of the nature and effect of outstanding interests or exceptions, prior sales of part of the property, judgments, or interests to assist in determining which exceptions must be corrected in order for the borrowers to obtain good and marketable title of record in accordance with prevailing title examination standards, and for the agency to obtain a valid lien of the required priority;
(3) Whether there are outstanding Federal, State, or local tax claims (including taxes which under State law may become a lien superior to a previously attaching mortgage lien) or homeowner's association assessment liens;
(4) Whether outstanding judgments of record, bankruptcy, insolvency, divorce, or probate proceedings involving
any part of the property, whether already owned by the borrower, or to be acquired by assumption or with loan funds, or involving the borrower or the seller exist;
(5) If a water right is to be included in the security for the loan, and if so, the full legal description of the water right;
(6) In addition to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if wetlands easements or other conservation easements have been placed on the property;
(7) What measures are required for preparing, obtaining, or approving curative material, conveyances, and security instruments, and
(8) That sufficient copies of these interests and exceptions are provided as requested by the approval official.
(e)
Use of title insurance.
When title insurance is to be obtained, the approval official will be furnished with a title insurance binder disclosing any defects in, exceptions to, and encumbrances against, the title, the conditions to be met to make the title insurable and in the condition required by the agency, and the curative or other actions to be taken before closing of the transaction. The binder must include a commitment to issue a lender policy in an amount at least equal the amount of the loan, except in instances where there may be an outstanding owner's policy in favor of the borrower. Not withstanding the provisions of this section, the instance of an assumption without a subsequent loan, the existing policy may be continued if the coverage meets or exceeds the assumption balance and the title company agrees in writing to extend coverage in full force and effect.
(f) [Reserved]
§ 1927.56
Scheduling loan closing.
The agency, in coordination with the closing agent, will arrange a loan closing and send loan closing instructions, on an agency form to the closing agent when the agency determines that the exceptions shown on the preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder will not adversely affect the suitability, security value, or successful operation of the property and all other agency conditions to closing have been satisfied.
§ 1927.57
Preparation of closing documents.
(a)
Preparation of deeds.
The closing agent, unless prohibited by law, will prepare, complete, or approve documents, including deeds, necessary for title clearance and closing of the transaction and provide the agency with the policy of title insurance or title opinion providing the lien priority required by the agency and subject only to exceptions approved by the agency. Agency forms will be used when required by this part.
(1)-(2) [Reserved]

Any changes made by deletion, substitution, or addition (excluding filling in blanks) will be initialed in the margin by all persons signing the mortgage.
(10) [Reserved]
(11)
Mortgages on leasehold estates.
When the agency security interest is a leasehold estate, unless State law or State Supplement otherwise provides, the real estate mortgage or deed of trust form, available in any agency office, will be modified as follows:
(i) In the space provided on the mortgage for the description of the real property security, the leasehold estate and the land covered by the lease must be described. The following language must be used unless modified by a State Supplement:

(d)
Preparation of protective instruments.

(1)
Prior lienholder's agreement.
If any liens (other than agency liens or tax liens to local governmental authorities) or security agreements (hereafter called “liens”), with priority over the agency mortgage will remain against the real property securing the loan, the lienholders must execute, in recordable form, agreements containing all of the following provisions unless prior approval for different provisions has been obtained from the National Office:
(i) The prior lienholder shall agree not to declare the lien in default or accelerate the indebtedness secured by the prior lien for a specific period of time after notice to the agency. The agreement must:
(A) Provide that the specified period of time will not commence until the lienholder gives written notice of the borrower's default and the prior lienholder's intention to accelerate the indebtedness to the agency office servicing the loan,
(B) Include the address of the agency servicing office,
(C) Give the agency the option to cure any monetary default by paying the amount of the borrower's delinquent payments to the prior lienholder, or pay the obligation in full and have the lien assigned to the agency, and
(D) Provide that the prior lienholder will not declare the lien in default for any nonmonetary reason if the agency commences liquidation proceedings against the property and thereafter acquires the property.
(ii) When the prior lien secures future advances, including the lienholder's costs for borrower liquidation or bankruptcy, which under State law have priority over the mortgage being taken (or an agency mortgage already held), the prior lienholder shall agree not to make advances for purposes other than taxes, insurance or payments on other prior liens without written consent of the agency.
(iii) The prior lienholder shall consent to the agency making (or transferring) the loan and taking (or retaining) the related mortgage if the prior lien instrument prohibits a loan or mortgage (or transfer) without the prior lienholder's consent.
(iv) The prior lienholder shall consent to the agency transferring the property subject to the prior lien after the agency has obtained title to the property either by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance if the prior lien instrument prohibits such transfer without the prior lienholder's consent.
(2)-(3) [Reserved]
(4)
Agreement by holder of seller's interest under land purchase contract.
If the buyer's interest in the security property is that of a buyer under a land purchase contract, it will be necessary for the seller to execute, in recordable form, an agreement containing all of the following provisions:

This period of time will be 90 days unless a State Supplement provides otherwise. The agreement shall give the agency the option to cure any monetary default by paying the amount of the buyer's delinquent payments to the seller, or paying the seller in full and having the contract assigned to the agency.
(iv) The seller shall consent to the agency making the loan and taking a security interest in the borrower's interest under the land purchase contract as security for the agency loan.
(v) The seller shall agree not to take any actions to foreclose or forfeit the interest of the buyer under the land purchase contract because the agency has acquired the buyer's interest under the land purchase contract by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance, or because the agency has subsequently sold or assigned the buyer's interest to a third party who will assume the buyer's obligations under the land purchase contract.
(vi) When the agency acquires a buyer's interest under a land purchase contract by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, the agency will not be deemed to have assumed any of the buyer's obligations under the contract, provided that the failure of the agency to perform any such obligations while it holds the buyer's interest is a ground to commence an action to terminate the land purchase contract.
(5)-(6) [Reserved]
(e) [Reserved]
§ 1927.58
Closing the transaction.
The closing agent will cooperate with the approval official, borrower, seller, and other necessary parties to arrange the time and place of closing. The transaction may be closed when the agency determines that the agency requirements for the loan have been satisfied and the closing agent or approved attorney can issue or cause to be issued a policy of title insurance or final title opinion as of the date of closing showing title vested as required by the agency, the lien of the agency's mortgage in the priority required by the agency, and title to the mortgaged property subject only to those exceptions approved in writing by the agency. The loan will be considered closed when the mortgage is filed for record and the required lien is obtained.
(a)
Disbursement of loan funds.
When the closing agent indicates that the conditions necessary to close the loan have been met, loan funds will be forwarded to the closing agent. Loan funds will not be disbursed prior to filing of the mortgage for record; however, when necessary, loan funds may be placed in escrow before the mortgage is filed for record and disbursed after it is filed. No development funds will be kept in escrow by the closing agent after loan closing, unless approved by the agency. Loan funds for the payment of a lien may be disbursed only upon the recording of a discharge, satisfaction, or release of prior lien interests (or assignment where necessary to protect the interests of the agency).
(b)
Title examination and liens or claims against borrowers.
If there are exceptions or recorded items which have arisen since the preliminary title opinion, the transaction will not be closed until these entries have been cleared of record or approved by the agency. The closing agent will advise the approval official of the nature of such intervening instruments and the effect they may have on obtaining a valid mortgage of the priority required or the title insurance policy to be issued.
(c)
Taxes and assessments.
The closing agent will determine if all taxes and assessments against the property which are due and payable are paid at or before the time of loan closing. If the seller and the borrower have agreed to prorate any taxes or assessments which are not yet due and payable for the year in which the closing of the transaction takes place, the seller's proportionate share of the taxes and assessments will be deducted from the proceeds to be paid to seller at closing and will be added to the amount required to be paid by borrower at closing. Appropriate prorations as agreed upon between the borrower and seller may also be made for taxes paid by the seller which are applicable to a period
after the closing date, and for common area maintenance fees, prepaid rentals, insurance (unless the borrower is to obtain a new policy of insurance), and growing crops.
(d)
Affidavit regarding work of improvement
—(1)
Execution by borrower.
If required by State Supplement, the closing agent will require that an affidavit regarding work of improvement, provided by the agency, be completed and executed when a loan is being made to a borrower who already owns the real estate to be mortgaged. This affidavit will be executed by the borrower at closing.
(2)
Execution by seller.
If required by State Supplement, the closing agent will require that an affidavit regarding work of improvement, provided by the agency, be completed and executed (including acknowledgment) by the seller when the agency is making a loan to a borrower to enable the borrower to acquire the property (including transfers). This affidavit will be executed by the seller at closing.
(3)
Legal insufficiency of affidavit form.
If the agency affidavit regarding work of improvement is not legally sufficient in a particular State, a State form approved by OGC will be used. A similar form that may be required by a title insurance company may be substituted for the agency form.
(4)
Recording.
The affidavit will not be recorded unless the closing agent deems it necessary and State law permits.
(5)
Delay in closing.
The loan will not be closed if, at the loan closing, the seller (in a sale transaction) or the borrower (in a nonpurchase money loan situation) indicates that construction, repair, or remodeling has been commenced or completed on the property, or related materials or services have been delivered to or performed on the property within the time limit specified in the affidavit, unless a State Supplement provides otherwise. The closing agent will notify the approval official, who will determine if the work of improvement could result in a lien prior to the agency lien. The State Office will, with the advice and concurrence of OGC, provide in a State Supplement the period of time to be used in completing the affidavit.
(e)-(f) [Reserved]
(g)
Return of loan documents to approval official after loan closing.
Within 1 day after loan closing, the closing agent will return completed and executed copies of the loan closing instructions, the executed original promissory note, and all other documents required for loan closing (except the mortgage), to the approval official. If the recorded mortgage is customarily returned to the borrower or closing agent after recording, then it must be forwarded to the approval official immediately.
