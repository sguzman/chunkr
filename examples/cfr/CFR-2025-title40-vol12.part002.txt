If the performance test is for a combustion control device, you must first determine which regulated material compounds are present in the inlet gas stream (
i.e.,
uncontrolled emissions) using process knowledge or the screening procedure described in Method 18. Quantify the emissions for the regulated material compounds present in the inlet gas stream for both the inlet and outlet gas streams for the combustion device.
(G) To determine inlet and outlet concentrations of TOC, use Method 25 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Measure the total gaseous non-methane organic (TGNMO) concentration of the inlet and outlet vent streams using the procedures of Method 25. Use the TGNMO concentration in Equations 4 and 5 of paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.
(H) Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used instead of Method 25 to measure inlet and outlet concentrations of TOC if the condition in either paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(H)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section is met.
(
1
) The concentration at the inlet to the control system and the required level of control would result in exhaust TGNMO concentrations of 50 parts per million by volume or less.
(
2
) Because of the high efficiency of the control device, the anticipated TGNMO concentration of the control device exhaust is 50 parts per million by volume or less, regardless of the inlet concentration.
(I) If the uncontrolled or inlet gas stream to the control device contains formaldehyde, you must conduct emissions testing according to paragraphs (e)(2)(iv)(I)(
1
) through (
3
) of this section.
(
1
) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(I)(
3
) of this section, if you elect to comply with a percent reduction requirement and formaldehyde is the principal regulated material compound (
i.e.,
greater than 50 percent of the regulated material compounds in the stream by volume), you must use
Method 316 or 320 of appendix A to this part, to measure formaldehyde at the inlet and outlet of the control device. Use the percent reduction in formaldehyde as a surrogate for the percent reduction in total regulated material emissions.
(
2
) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(I)(
3
) of this section, if you elect to comply with an outlet total organic regulated material concentration or TOC concentration limit, and the uncontrolled or inlet gas stream to the control device contains greater than 10 percent (by volume) formaldehyde, you must use Method 316 or 320 of appendix A to this part, to separately determine the formaldehyde concentration. Calculate the total organic regulated material concentration or TOC concentration by totaling the formaldehyde emissions measured using Method 316 or 320 and the other regulated material compound emissions measured using Method 18 or 25/25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(
3
) You may elect to use ASTM D6348-12e1 (incorporated by reference, § 63.14) in lieu of Method 316 or 320 of appendix A to this part as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(I)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section. To comply with this paragraph, the test plan preparation and implementation in the Annexes to ASTM D6348-03 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) Sections Al through A8 are mandatory; the percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte using Equation A5.5 of ASTM D6348-03 Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique); and in order for the test data to be acceptable for a compound, the %R must be 70% ≥ R ≤ 130%. If the %R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, then the test data is not acceptable for that compound and the test must be repeated for that analyte (
i.e.,
the sampling and/or analytical procedure should be adjusted before a retest). The %R value for each compound must be reported in the test report, and all field measurements must be corrected with the calculated %R value for that compound by using the following equation:
Reported Results = (Measured Concentration in the Stack × 100)/%R.
(3) An owner or operator using a halogen scrubber or other halogen reduction device to control process vent and transfer rack halogenated vent streams in compliance with a referencing subpart, who is required to conduct a performance test to determine compliance with a control efficiency or emission limit for hydrogen halides and halogens, shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(3) (i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) For an owner or operator determining compliance with the percent reduction of total hydrogen halides and halogens, sampling sites shall be located at the inlet and outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device used to reduce halogen emissions. For an owner or operator determining compliance with a kilogram per hour outlet emission limit for total hydrogen halides and halogens, the sampling site shall be located at the outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, Method 26 or Method 26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used to determine the concentration, in milligrams per dry standard cubic meter, of total hydrogen halides and halogens that may be present in the vent stream. The mass emissions of each hydrogen halide and halogen compound shall be calculated from the measured concentrations and the gas stream flow rate.
(iii) To determine compliance with the percent removal efficiency, the mass emissions for any hydrogen halides and halogens present at the inlet of the halogen reduction device shall be summed together. The mass emissions of the compounds present at the outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device shall be summed together. Percent reduction shall be determined by comparison of the summed inlet and outlet measurements.
(iv) To demonstrate compliance with a kilogram per hour outlet emission limit, the test results must show that the mass emission rate of total hydrogen halides and halogens measured at the outlet of the scrubber or other halogen reduction device is below the
kilogram per hour outlet emission limit specified in a referencing subpart.

(iii) Where data is collected from an automated continuous parameter monitoring system, the owner or operator may calculate and retain block hourly average values from each 15-minute block average period or from at least one measured value per minute if measured more frequently than once per minute, and discard all but the most recent three valid hours of continuous (15-minute or shorter) records, if the hourly averages do not exclude periods of CPMS breakdown or malfunction. An automated CPMS records the measured data and calculates the hourly averages through the use of a computerized data acquisition system.
(iv) A record as required by an alternative approved under a referencing subpart.
(2)
Excluded data.
Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section shall not be included in any average computed to determine compliance with an emission limit in a referencing subpart.
(i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, preventive maintenance, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
(ii) Periods of non-operation of the process unit (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies; and
(iii) Startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions, if the owner or operator operates the source during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a) and maintains the records specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(3)
Records of daily averages.
In addition to the records specified in paragraph (a), owners or operators shall keep records as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section and submit reports as specified in § 63.999(c), unless an alternative recordkeeping system has been requested and approved under a referencing subpart.
(i) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, daily average values of each continuously monitored parameter shall be calculated from data meeting the specifications of
paragraph (b)(2) of this section for each operating day and retained for 5 years.
(A) The daily average shall be calculated as the average of all values for a monitored parameter recorded during the operating day. The average shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous, or the period of operation per operating day if operation is not continuous (e.g., for transfer racks the average shall cover periods of loading). If values are measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may be used to calculate the daily average instead of all measured values.
(B) The operating day shall be the period defined in the operating permit or in the Notification of Compliance Status. It may be from midnight to midnight or another daily period.
(ii) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an operating day are within the range established in the Notification of Compliance Status or in the operating permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were within the range and retain this record for 5 years rather than calculating and recording a daily average for that operating day. In such cases, the owner or operator may not discard the recorded values as allowed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
(4) [Reserved]
(5)
Alternative recordkeeping.
For any parameter with respect to any item of equipment associated with a process vent or transfer rack (except low throughput transfer loading racks), the owner or operator may implement the recordkeeping requirements in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section as alternatives to the recordkeeping provisions listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. The owner or operator shall retain each record required by paragraphs (b)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section as provided in a referencing subpart.
(i) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average value, and is not required to retain more frequently monitored operating parameter values, for a monitored parameter with respect to an item of equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (F) of this section are met. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the Notification of Compliance Status as specified in § 63.999(b)(5) or, if the Notification of Compliance Status has already been submitted, in the Periodic Report immediately preceding implementation of the requirements of this paragraph, as specified in § 63.999(c)(6)(iv).
(A) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or impossible data during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns or malfunctions (e.g., a temperature reading of −200 °C on a boiler), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
(B) The monitoring system generates a running average of the monitoring values, updated at least hourly throughout each operating day, that have been obtained during that operating day, and the capability to observe this average is readily available to the Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(B)(
1
) through (
3
) of this section. All instances in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
(
1
) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum established limits;
(
2
) The running average is based on at least six one-hour average values; and
(
3
) The running average reflects a period of operation other than a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.
(C) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns or malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (e.g., pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
(D) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an alarm, if the running average parameter value
calculated under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section reaches a set point that is appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is being monitored.
(E) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, at the times specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(E)(
1
) through (
3
) of this section. The owner or operator shall document that the required verifications occurred.
(
1
) Upon initial installation.
(
2
) Annually after initial installation.
(
3
) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting the monitoring system that might reasonably be expected to alter the monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this section.
(F) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(F)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section.
(

) Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.
(
2
) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and of how compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) through (E) of this section. The description shall identify the location and format (e.g., on-line storage; log entries) for each required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall retain both the current and the most recent superseded description. The description, and the most recent superseded description, shall be retained as provided in the subpart that references this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(F)(
1
) of this section.
(
3
) A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring system that would reasonably be expected to affect its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.
(
4
) Owners and operators subject to paragraph (b)(5)(i)(F)(
2
) of this section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as long as the description is current, but not less than 5 years from the date of its creation. The current description shall be retained on-site at all times or be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The owner or operator shall retain the most recent superseded description at least until 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded description shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer that provides access within 2 hours after a request) at least 6 months after being superseded. Thereafter, the superseded description may be stored off-site.
(ii) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, and a period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily average value for that parameter for that unit of equipment, for any operating day when the daily average value is less than the maximum, or greater than the minimum established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and the monitoring were required and/or approved by the Administrator.
(A) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report, as specified in § 63.999(c)(6)(i). The notification shall identify the parameter and unit of equipment.
(B) If there is an excursion as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased recording daily averages as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining the daily average value for each operating day, and shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report, as specified in § 63.999(c). The
owner or operator shall continue to retain each daily average value until another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.
(C) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (F) of this section for the duration specified in a referencing subpart. For any week, if compliance with paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (D) of this section does not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one parameter value during a period of operation other than a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.
(6)(i) For the purposes of this section, an excursion means that the daily average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
(A) The daily average value during any startup, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be considered an excursion if the owner or operator operates the source during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a) and maintains the records specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(B) An excused excursion, as described in paragraph (b)(6)(ii), does not count toward the number of excursions for the purposes of this subpart.
(ii) One excused excursion for each control device or recovery device for each semiannual period is allowed. If a source has developed a startup, shutdown and malfunction plan, and a monitored parameter is outside its established range or monitoring data are not collected during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction (and the source is operated during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a)) or during periods of nonoperation of the process unit or portion thereof (resulting in cessation of the emissions to which monitoring applies), then the excursion is not a violation and, in cases where continuous monitoring is required, the excursion does not count as the excused excursion for determining compliance.

In liquid service
means that a piece of equipment in regulated material service is not in gas or vapor service.
In organic hazardous air pollutant or in organic HAP service
means that a piece of equipment either contains or contracts a fluid (liquid or gas) that is at least 5 percent by weight of total organic HAP's as determined according to the provisions of § 63.180(d) of subpart H. The provisions of § 63.180(d) of subpart H also specify how to determine that a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service.
In regulated material service
means, for the purposes of this subpart, equipment which meets the definition of “in VOC service”, “in VHAP service”, “in organic hazardous air pollutant service,” or “in other chemicals or groups of chemicals service” as defined in the referencing subpart.
In-situ sampling systems
means nonextractive samplers or in-line samplers.
In vacuum service
means that equipment is operating at an internal pressure which is at least 5 kilopascals below ambient pressure.
Initial startup
means for new sources, the first time the source begins production. For additions or changes not defined as a new source by this subpart, initial startup means the first time additional or changed equipment is put into operation. Initial startup does not include operation solely for testing of equipment. Initial startup does not include subsequent startup of process units following malfunction or process unit shutdowns. Except for equipment leaks, initial startup also does not include subsequent startups (of process units following changes in product for flexible operation units or following recharging of equipment in batch unit operations).
Instrumentation system
means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (
e.g.,
composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only valves nominally 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches) and smaller, and connectors nominally 1.91 centimeters (0.75 inches) and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems for the purposes of this subpart. Valves greater than nominally 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches) and connectors greater than nominally 1.91 centimeters (0.75 inches) associated with instrumentation systems are not considered part of instrumentation systems and must be monitored individually.
Liquids dripping
means any visible leakage from the seal including dripping, spraying, misting, clouding, and ice formation. Indications of liquids dripping include puddling or new stains that are indicative of an existing evaporated drip.
Nonrepairable
means that it is technically infeasible to repair a piece of equipment from which a leak has been detected without a process unit or affected facility shutdown.
Open-ended valve or line
means any valve, except relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid and one side open to atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.
Organic monitoring device
means a unit of equipment used to indicate the concentration level of organic compounds based on a detection principle
such as infra-red, photo ionization, or thermal conductivity.
Pressure release
means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.
Pressure relief device or valve
means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.
Process unit
means the equipment specified in the definitions of process unit in the applicable referencing subpart. If the referencing subpart does not define process unit, then for the purposes of this part, process unit means the equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture an intended product.
Process unit shutdown
means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a process unit, or part of a process unit, consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be affected. The following are not considered process unit shutdowns:
(1) An unscheduled work practice or operations procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for less than 24 hours.
(2) An unscheduled work practice or operations procedure that would stop production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process unit, or part of the process unit, of materials and start up the unit, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process unit shutdown.
(3) The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production.
Referencing subpart
means the subpart which refers an owner or operator to this subpart.
Regulated material,
for purposes of this subpart, refers to gases from volatile organic liquids (VOL), volatile organic compounds (VOC), hazardous air pollutants (HAP), or other chemicals or groups of chemicals that are regulated by the referencing subpart.
Regulated source
for the purposes of this subpart, means the stationary source, the group of stationary sources, or the portion of a stationary source that is regulated by a referencing subpart.
Relief device or valve
means a valve used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge can result from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
Repaired,
for the purposes of this subpart means the following:
(1) Equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak as defined in the applicable sections of this subpart, and
(2) Equipment, unless otherwise specified in applicable provisions of this subpart, is monitored as specified in § 63.1004(b) and, as applicable in §§ 63.1004(c) and 63.1015 of this part as appropriate, to verify that emissions from the equipment are below the applicable leak definition.
Routed to a process or route to a process
means the emissions are conveyed to any enclosed portion of a process unit where the emissions are predominantly recycled and/or consumed in the same manner as a material that fulfills the same function in the process and/or transformed by chemical reaction into materials that are not regulated materials and/or incorporated into a product; and /or recovered.
Sampling connection system
means an assembly of equipment within a process unit or affected facility used during periods of representative operation to take samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take nonroutine grab samples is not considered a sampling connection system.
Screwed (threaded) connector
means a threaded pipe fitting where the threads are cut on the pipe wall and the fitting requires only two pieces to make the connection (
i.e.,
the pipe and the fitting).
Sensor
means a device that measures a physical quantity or the change in a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, pH, or liquid level.
Set pressure
means the pressure at which a properly operating pressure relief device begins to open to relieve atypical process system operating pressure.
Start-up
means the setting into operation of a piece of equipment or a control device that is subject to this subpart.

(1)
Monitoring method.
Monitoring shall comply with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(2)
Detection instrument performance criteria.
(i) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the representative composition of the process fluid, and not for each individual HAP, VOC or other regulated material individual chemical compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, water, or other inerts that are not regulated materials, the representative stream response factor shall be calculated on an inert-free basis. The response factor may be determined at any concentration for which monitoring for leaks will be conducted.
(ii) If there is no instrument commercially available that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the representative response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Detection instrument calibration procedure.
The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(4)
Detection instrument calibration gas.
Calibration gases shall be zero air (less than 10 parts per million of hydrocarbon in air); and a mixture of methane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million; or a mixture of n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 parts per million. A calibration gas other than methane in air or n-hexane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or n-hexane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more compounds to be measured in air.
(5)
Monitoring performance.
Monitoring shall be performed when the equipment is in regulated material service or is in use with any other detectable material.
(6)
Monitoring data.
Monitoring data obtained prior to the regulated source becoming subject to the referencing subpart that do not meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section may still be used to initially qualify for less frequent monitoring under the provisions in § 63.1006(a)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) for valves provided the departures from the criteria specified or from the specified monitoring frequency of § 63.1006(b)(3) are minor and do not significantly affect the quality of the data. Examples of minor departures are monitoring at a slightly different frequency (such as every six weeks instead of monthly or quarterly), following the performance criteria of section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 instead of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or monitoring at a different leak definition if the data would indicate the presence or absence of a leak at the concentration specified in the referencing subpart. Failure to use a calibrated instrument is not considered a minor departure.
(c)
Instrument monitoring using background adjustments.
The owner or operator may elect to adjust or not to adjust the instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects not to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. In such case, all instrument readings shall be compared directly to the applicable leak definition for the monitored equipment to determine whether there is a leak or to determine compliance with § 63.1011(b) (pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service) or § 63.1012(f) (compressors). If an owner or operator elects to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
(1) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section shall apply.
(2) The background level shall be determined, using the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(3) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible (as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A).
(4) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level shall be compared to the applicable leak definitions for the monitored equipment to determine whether there is a leak or to determine compliance with § 63.1011(b) (pressure relief devices in gas and vapor service) or § 63.1012(f) (compressors).
(d)
Sensory monitoring methods.
Sensory monitoring, as required under this subpart, shall consist of detection of a potential leak to the atmosphere by visual, audible, olfactory, or any other detection method.

(4) “Repair delayed” and the reason for the delay if a leak is not repaired within 15 calendar days after discovery of the leak as specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) and (e)(4)(ii) of this section.
(i) The owner or operator may develop a written procedure that identifies the conditions that justify a delay of repair. The written procedures may be included as part of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, as required by the referencing subpart for the source, or may be part of a separate document that is maintained at the plant site. In such cases, reasons for delay of repair may be documented by citing the relevant sections of the written procedure.
(ii) If delay of repair was caused by depletion of stocked parts, there must be documentation that the spare parts were sufficiently stocked on site before depletion and the reason for depletion.
(5) Dates of process unit or affected facility shutdowns that occur while the equipment is unrepaired.

Process unit shutdown
means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a process unit, or part of a process unit, consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be affected. The following are not considered process unit shutdowns:
(1) An unscheduled work practice or operations procedure that stops production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for less than 24 hours.
(2) An unscheduled work practice or operations procedure that would stop production from a process unit, or part of a process unit, for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process unit, or part of the process unit, of materials and start up the unit, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process unit shutdown.

A relief valve discharge can result from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
Repaired,
for the purposes of this subpart, means that equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak as defined in the applicable sections of this subpart and unless otherwise specified in applicable provisions of this subpart, is monitored as specified in §§ 63.1023(b) and (c) to verify that emissions from the equipment are below the applicable leak definition.
Routed to a process or route to a process
means the emissions are conveyed to any enclosed portion of a process unit where the emissions are predominantly recycled and/or consumed in the same manner as a material that fulfills the same function in the process and/or transformed by chemical reaction into materials that are not regulated materials and/or incorporated into a product; and/or recovered.
Sampling connection system

(1)
Monitoring method.
Monitoring shall comply with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except as otherwise provided in this section.
(2)
Detection instrument performance criteria.
(i) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2, paragraph (a) of Method 21 shall be for the representative composition of the process fluid not each individual VOC in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, water or other inerts that are not HAP or VOC, the representative stream response factor shall be determined on an inert-free basis. The response factor may be determined at any concentration for which monitoring for leaks will be conducted.
(ii) If there is no instrument commercially available that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the representative response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Detection instrument calibration procedure.
The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(4)
Detection instrument calibration gas.
Calibration gases shall be zero air (less than 10 parts per million of hydrocarbon in air); and the gases specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.
(i) Mixtures of methane in air at a concentration no more than 2,000 parts per million greater than the leak definition concentration of the equipment monitored. If the monitoring instrument's design allows for multiple calibration scales, then the lower scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is no higher than 2,000 parts per million above the concentration specified as a leak, and the highest
scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is approximately equal to 10,000 parts per million. If only one scale on an instrument will be used during monitoring, the owner or operator need not calibrate the scales that will not be used during that day's monitoring.
(ii) A calibration gas other than methane in air may be used if the instrument does not respond to methane or if the instrument does not meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or more of the compounds to be measured in air.
(5)
Monitoring performance.
Monitoring shall be performed when the equipment is in regulated material service or is in use with any other detectable material.
(6)
Monitoring data.
Monitoring data obtained prior to the regulated source becoming subject to the referencing subpart that do not meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section may still be used to qualify initially for less frequent monitoring under the provisions in § 63.1025(a)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) for valves or § 63.1027(b)(3) for connectors provided the departures from the criteria or from the specified monitoring frequency of § 63.1025(b)(3) or (b)(4) or § 63.1027(b)(3) are minor and do not significantly affect the quality of the data. Examples of minor departures are monitoring at a slightly different frequency (such as every 6 weeks instead of monthly or quarterly), following the performance criteria of section 3.1.2, paragraph (a) of Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 instead of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or monitoring using a different leak definition if the data would indicate the presence or absence of a leak at the concentration specified in this subpart. Failure to use a calibrated instrument is not considered a minor departure.
(c)
Instrument monitoring using background adjustments.
The owner or operator may elect to adjust or not to adjust the instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects not to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section. In such cases, all instrument readings shall be compared directly to the applicable leak definition for the monitored equipment to determine whether there is a leak or to determine compliance with § 63.1030(b) (pressure relief devices) or § 63.1031(f) (alternative compressor standard). If an owner or operator elects to adjust instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall monitor the equipment according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
(1) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section shall apply.
(2) The background level shall be determined, using the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(3) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(4) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level shall be compared to the applicable leak definition for the monitored equipment to determine whether there is a leak or to determine compliance with § 63.1030(b) (pressure relief devices) or § 63.1031(f) (alternative compressor standard).
(d)
Sensory monitoring methods.
Sensory monitoring consists of visual, audible, olfactory, or any other detection method used to determine a potential leak to the atmosphere.
(e)
Leaking equipment identification and records.
(1) When each leak is detected pursuant to the monitoring specified in paragraph (a) of this section, a weatherproof and readily visible identification, shall be attached to the leaking equipment.
(2) When each leak is detected, the information specified in § 63.1024(f) shall be recorded and kept pursuant to the referencing subpart, except for the information for connectors complying with the 8 year monitoring period allowed under § 63.1027(b)(3)(iii) shall be kept 5 years beyond the date of its last use.
§ 63.1024
Leak repair.
(a)
Leak repair schedule.
The owner or operator shall repair each leak detected as soon as practical, but not later than 15 calendar days after it is detected, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. A first attempt at repair as defined in this subpart shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected. First attempt at repair for pumps includes, but is not limited to, tightening the packing gland nuts and/or ensuring that the seal flush is operating at design pressure and temperature. First attempt at repair for valves includes, but is not limited to, tightening the bonnet bolts, and/or replacing the bonnet bolts, and/or tightening the packing gland nuts, and/or injecting lubricant into the lubricated packing.

Valve subgrouping.
For a process unit or a group of process units to which this subpart applies, an owner or operator may choose to subdivide the valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units and apply the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section to each subgroup. If the owner or operator elects to subdivide the valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units, then the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (b)(4)(viii) of this section apply.
(i) The overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units to be subdivided shall be less than 2 percent leaking valves, as detected according to paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section and as calculated according to paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2) of this section.
(ii) The initial assignment or subsequent reassignment of valves to subgroups shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) through (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.
(A) The owner or operator shall determine which valves are assigned to each subgroup. Valves with less than one year of monitoring data or valves not monitored within the last twelve months must be placed initially into the most frequently monitored subgroup until at least one year of monitoring data have been obtained.
(B) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a less frequently monitored subgroup to a more frequently monitored subgroup provided that the valves to be reassigned were monitored during the most recent monitoring period for the less frequently monitored subgroup. The monitoring results must be included with that less frequently monitored subgroup's associated percent leaking valves calculation for that monitoring event.
(C) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a more frequently monitored subgroup to a less frequently monitored subgroup provided that the valves to be reassigned have not leaked for the period of the less frequently monitored subgroup (e.g., for the last 12 months, if the valve or group of valves is to be reassigned to a subgroup being monitored annually). Nonrepairable valves may not be reassigned to a less frequently monitored subgroup.
(iii) The owner or operator shall determine every 6 months if the overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units is less than 2 percent leaking valves and so indicate the performance in the next Periodic Report. If the overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units is 2 percent leaking valves or greater, the owner or operator shall no longer subgroup and shall revert to the program required in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section for that applicable process unit or group of process units. An owner or operator can again elect to comply with the valve subgrouping procedures of paragraph (b)(4) of this section if future overall performance of total valves in the process unit or group of process units is again less than 2 percent. The overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units shall be calculated as a weighted average of the percent leaking valves of each subgroup according to Equation number 1:
ER29JN99.010
where:
%V
LO
= Overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units
%V
Li
= Percent leaking valves in subgroup i, most recent value calculated according to the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2) of this section.

(A) Which valves are assigned to each subgroup,
(B) Monitoring results and calculations made for each subgroup for each monitoring period,
(C) Which valves are reassigned, the last monitoring result prior to reassignment, and when they were reassigned, and
(D) The results of the semiannual overall performance calculation required in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
(v) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later than 30 days prior to the beginning of the next monitoring period of the decision to subgroup valves. The notification shall identify the participating process units and the number of valves assigned to each subgroup, if applicable, and may be included in the next Periodic Report.
(vi) The owner or operator shall submit in the periodic reports the information specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(vi)(A) and (b)(4)(vi)(B).
(A) Total number of valves in each subgroup, and
(B) Results of the semiannual overall performance calculation required by paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
(vii) To determine the monitoring frequency for each subgroup, the calculation procedures of paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be used.
(viii) Except for the overall performance calculations required by paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section, each subgroup shall be treated as if it were a process unit for the purposes of applying the provisions of this section.
(c)
Percent leaking valves calculation
—(1)
Calculation basis and procedures.
(i) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the compliance date of this part or upon revision of an operating permit whether to calculate percent leaking valves on a process unit or group of process units basis. Once the owner or operator has decided, all subsequent percentage calculations shall be made on the same basis and this shall be the basis used for comparison with the subgrouping criteria specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.
(ii) The percent leaking valves for each monitoring period for each process unit or valve subgroup, as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, shall be calculated using the following equation:
ER29JN99.011
where:
%V
L
= Percent leaking valves.
V
L
= Number of valves found leaking, excluding nonrepairable valves, as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and including those valves found leaking pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2)(iii)(A) and (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
V
T
= The sum of the total number of valves monitored.
(2)
Calculation for monitoring frequency.
When determining monitoring frequency for each process unit or valve subgroup subject to monthly, quarterly, or semiannual monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last two monitoring periods. When determining monitoring frequency for each process unit or valve subgroup subject to annual or biennial (once every 2 years) monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last three monitoring periods.
(3)
Nonrepairable valves.
(i) Nonrepairable valves shall be included in the calculation of percent leaking valves the first time the valve is identified as leaking and nonrepairable and as required to comply with paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. Otherwise, a number of nonrepairable valves (identified and included in the percent leaking valves calculation in a previous period) up to a maximum of 1 percent of the total number of valves in regulated material service at a process unit or affected facility may be excluded from calculation of percent leaking valves for subsequent monitoring periods.
(ii) If the number of nonrepairable valves exceeds 1 percent of the total number of valves in regulated material service at a process unit or affected facility, the number of nonrepairable valves exceeding 1 percent of the total
number of valves in regulated material service shall be included in the calculation of percent leaking valves.
(d)
Leak repair.
(1) If a leak is determined pursuant to paragraph (b), (e)(1), or (e)(2) of this section, then the leak shall be repaired using the procedures in § 63.1024, as applicable.
(2) After a leak has been repaired, the valve shall be monitored at least once within the first 3 months after its repair. The monitoring required by this paragraph is in addition to the monitoring required to satisfy the definition of repaired and first attempt at repair.
(i) The monitoring shall be conducted as specified in § 63.1023(b) and (c) of this section, as appropriate, to determine whether the valve has resumed leaking.
(ii) Periodic monitoring required by paragraph (b) of this section may be used to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, if the timing of the monitoring period coincides with the time specified in this paragraph.

# Subpart VV—National Emission Standards for Oil-Water Separators and Organic-Water Separators

# Source:
61 FR 34195, July 1, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.1040
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart apply to the control of air emissions from oil-water separators and organic-water separators for which another subpart of 40 CFR parts 60, 61, or 63 references the use of this subpart for such air emission control. These air emission standards for oil-water separators and organic-water separators are placed here for administrative convenience and only apply to those owners and operators of facilities subject to the other subparts that reference this subpart. The provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A—General Provisions do not apply to this subpart except as noted in the subpart that references this subpart.
§ 63.1041
Definitions.
All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined in both this section and in another subpart that references the use of this subpart, then the definition in this
subpart shall take precedence when implementing this subpart.
Closure device
means a cap, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that, when the device is secured in the closed position, prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an opening in a fixed roof or floating roof. Closure devices include devices that are detachable from the cover (e.g., a sampling port cap), manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring-loaded pressure relief valve).
Continuous seal
means a seal that forms a continuous closure that completely covers the space between the edge of the floating roof and the wall of a separator. A continuous seal may be constructed of fastened segments so as to form a continuous seal.
Fixed roof
means a cover that is mounted on a separator in a stationary position and does not move with fluctuations in the level of the liquid managed in the separator.
Floating roof
means a pontoon-type or double-deck type cover that rests upon and is supported by the liquid managed in a separator.
Liquid-mounted seal
means a foam- or liquid-filled continuous seal that is mounted between the wall of the separator and the floating roof, and the seal is in contact with the liquid in a separator.
Oil-water separator
means a separator as defined for this subpart that is used to separate oil from water.
Organic-water separator
means a separator as defined for this subpart that is used to separate organics from water.
Metallic shoe seal
means a continuous seal that is constructed of metal sheets which are held vertically against the wall of the separator by springs, weighted levers, or other mechanisms and is connected to the floating roof by braces or other means. A flexible coated fabric (envelope) spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the floating roof.
No detectable organic emissions
means no escape of organics to the atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in § 63.1046(a) of this subpart.
Regulated-material
means the material (e.g. waste, wastewater, off-site material) required to be managed in separators using air emission controls in accordance with the standards specified in this subpart.
Safety device
means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to equipment by venting gases or vapors during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purpose of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
Separator
means a waste management unit, generally a tank, that is used to separate oil or organics from water. A separator consists of not only the separation unit but also the forebay and other separator basins, skimmers, weirs, grit chambers, sludge hoppers, and bar screens that are located directly after the individual drain system and prior to any additional treatment units such as an air flotation unit clarifier or biological treatment unit. Examples of a separator include an API separator, parallel-plate interceptor, and corrugated-plate interceptor with the associated ancillary equipment.

[64 FR 38991, July 20, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 1268, Jan. 8, 2001]
§ 63.1046
Test methods and procedures.
(a) Procedure for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.
(1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.
(2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.
(3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.
(4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and
(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.
(6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.
(8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.
(i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
(ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
(9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
(i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic
emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.
(ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.
(b) Procedure for performing floating roof seal gap measurements for the purpose of complying with this subpart.
(1) The owner or operator shall determine the total surface area of gaps in the primary seal and in the secondary seal individually.
(2) The seal gap measurements shall be performed at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof supports.
(3) Seal gaps, if any, shall be measured around the entire perimeter of the floating roof in each place where 0.32-centimeter (cm) (
1/8
inch) diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the wall of the separator and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.
(4) For a seal gap measured under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the gap surface area shall be determined by using probes of various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the separator wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective circumferential distance.
(5) The total gap area shall be calculated by adding the gap surface areas determined for each identified gap location for the primary seal and the secondary seal individually, and then dividing the sum for each seal type by the nominal perimeter of the separator basin. These total gap areas for the primary seal and secondary seal then are compared to the respective standards for the seal type as specified in § 63.1043(b)(2) of this subpart.

# Subpart WW—National Emission Standards for Storage Vessels (Tanks)—Control Level 2

# Source:
64 FR 34918, June 29, 1999, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.1060
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart apply to the control of air emissions from storage vessels for which another subpart references the use of this subpart for such air emission control. These air emission standards for storage vessels are placed here for administrative convenience and only apply to those owners and operators of facilities subject to a referencing subpart. The provisions of subpart A (General Provisions) of this part do not apply to this subpart except as noted in the referencing subpart.
§ 63.1061
Definitions.
All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in this section.
Capacity
means the volume of liquid that is capable of being stored in a vessel, determined by multiplying the vessel's internal cross-sectional area by the internal height of the shell.
Deck cover
means a device which covers an opening in a floating roof deck. Some deck covers move horizontally relative to the deck (i.e., a sliding cover).
Empty
or
emptying
means the partial or complete removal of stored liquid from a storage vessel. Storage vessels that contain liquid only as wall or bottom clingage, or in pools due to bottom irregularities, are considered completely empty.
External floating roof
or
EFR
means a floating roof located in a storage vessel without a fixed roof.
Fill
or
filling
means the introduction of liquid into a storage vessel, but not necessarily to capacity.
Fixed roof
means a roof that is mounted (i.e., permanently affixed) on a storage vessel and that does not move with fluctuations in stored liquid level.
Flexible fabric sleeve seal
means a seal made of an elastomeric fabric (or other material) which covers an opening in a floating roof deck, and which allows the penetration of a fixed roof support column. The seal is attached to the rim of the deck opening and extends to the outer surface of the column. The seal is draped (but does not contact the stored liquid) to allow the horizontal movement of the deck relative to the column.
Floating roof
means a roof that floats on the surface of the liquid in a storage vessel. A floating roof substantially covers the stored liquid surface (but is not necessarily in contact with the entire surface), and is comprised of a deck, a rim seal, and miscellaneous deck fittings.
Initial fill
or
initial filling means
the first introduction of liquid into a storage vessel that is either newly constructed or has not been in liquid service for a year or longer.
Internal floating roof
or
IFR
means a floating roof located in a storage vessel with a fixed roof. For the purposes of this subpart, an external floating roof located in a storage vessel to which a fixed roof has been added is considered to be an internal floating roof.
Liquid-mounted seal
means a resilient or liquid-filled rim seal designed to contact the stored liquid.
Mechanical shoe seal
or
metallic shoe seal
means a rim seal consisting of a band of metal (or other suitable material) as the sliding contact with the wall of the storage vessel, and a fabric seal to close the annular space between the band and the rim of the floating roof deck. The band is typically formed as a series of sheets (shoes) that are overlapped or joined together to form a ring. The lower end of the band extends into the stored liquid.
Pole float
means a float located inside a guidepole that floats on the surface of the stored liquid. The rim of the float has a wiper or seal that extends to the inner surface of the pole.
Pole sleeve
means a device which extends from either the cover or the rim of an opening in a floating roof deck to the outer surface of a pole that passes through the opening. The sleeve extends into the stored liquid.
Pole wiper
means a seal that extends from either the cover or the rim of an opening in a floating roof deck to the outer surface of a pole that passes through the opening.
Referencing subpart
means the subpart that refers an owner or operator to this subpart.
Rim seal
means a device attached to the rim of a floating roof deck that spans the annular space between the deck and the wall of the storage vessel. When a floating roof has only one such device, it is a primary seal; when there are two seals (one mounted above the other), the lower seal is the primary seal and the upper seal is the secondary seal.
Slotted guidepole
means a guidepole or gaugepole that has slots or holes through the wall of the pole. The slots or holes allow the stored liquid to flow into the pole at liquid levels above the lowest operating level.
Storage vessel
or
Tank
means a stationary unit that is constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (such as wood, concrete, steel, fiberglass, or plastic) which provide structural support and is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids or other materials.
Vapor-mounted seal
means a rim seal designed not to be in contact with the stored liquid. Vapor-mounted seals may include, but are not limited to, resilient seals and flexible wiper seals.

(v) Gaps of more than 0.32 centimeters (
1/8
inch) between any deck fitting gasket, seal, or wiper (required by paragraph (a) of this section) and any surface that it is intended to seal.
(2) Tank-top inspections of IFR's shall be conducted by visually inspecting the floating roof deck, deck fittings, and rim seal through openings in the fixed roof. Any of the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section constitutes inspection failure. Identification of holes or tears in the rim seal is required only for the seal that is visible from the top of the storage vessel.
(3) Seal gap inspections for EFR's shall determine the presence and size of gaps between the rim seals and the wall of the storage vessel by the procedures specified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Any exceedance of the gap requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) and (d)(3)(iii) of this section constitutes inspection failure.
(i) Rim seals shall be measured for gaps at one or more levels while the EFR is floating, as specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) through (d)(3)(i)(F) of this section.
(A) The inspector shall hold a 0.32 centimeter (
1/8
inch) diameter probe vertically against the inside of the storage vessel wall, just above the rim seal, and attempt to slide the probe down between the seal and the vessel wall. Each location where the probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the vessel wall constitutes a gap.
(B) The length of each gap shall be determined by inserting the probe into the gap (vertically) and sliding the probe along the vessel wall in each direction as far as it will travel freely without binding between the seal and the vessel wall. The circumferential length along which the probe can move freely is the gap length.
(C) The maximum width of each gap shall be determined by inserting probes of various diameters between the seal and the vessel wall. The smallest probe diameter should be 0.32 centimeter, and larger probes should have diameters in increments of 0.32 centimeter. The diameter of the largest probe that can be inserted freely anywhere along the length of the gap is the maximum gap width.
(D) The average width of each gap shall be determined by averaging the minimum gap width (0.32 centimeter) and the maximum gap width.
(E) The area of a gap is the product of the gap length and average gap width.
(F) The ratio of accumulated area of rim seal gaps to storage vessel diameter shall be determined by adding the area of each gap, and dividing the sum by the nominal diameter of the storage vessel. This ratio shall be determined separately for primary and secondary rim seals.
(ii) The ratio of seal gap area to vessel diameter for the primary seal shall not exceed 212 square centimeters per meter of vessel diameter (10 square inches per foot of vessel diameter), and the maximum gap width shall not exceed 3.81 centimeters (1.5 inches).
(iii) The ratio of seal gap area to vessel diameter for the secondary seal shall not exceed 21.2 square centimeters per meter (1 square inch per foot), and the maximum gap width shall not exceed 1.27 centimeters (0.5 inches), except when the secondary seal must be pulled back or removed to inspect the primary seal.
(e)
Repair requirements.
Conditions causing inspection failures under paragraph (d) of this section shall be repaired as specified in paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.
(1) If the inspection is performed while the storage vessel is not storing liquid, repairs shall be completed before the refilling of the storage vessel with liquid.
(2) If the inspection is performed while the storage vessel is storing liquid, repairs shall be completed or the vessel removed from service within 45 days. If a repair cannot be completed and the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, the owner or operator may use up to 2 extensions of up to 30 additional days each. Documentation of a decision to use an extension shall include a description of the failure, shall document that alternate storage capacity is unavailable, and shall specify a schedule of actions that will ensure that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be completely emptied as soon as practical.

# Definitions
§ 63.1082
What definitions do I need to know?
(a) Unless defined in paragraph (b) of this section, definitions for terms used in this subpart are provided in the Clean Air Act, § 63.1103(e), and 40 CFR 61.341.
(b) The following definitions apply to terms used in this subpart:
Continuous butadiene waste stream
means the continuously flowing process wastewater from the following equipment: The aqueous drain from the debutanizer reflux drum, water separators on the C4 crude butadiene transfer piping, and the C4 butadiene storage equipment; and spent wash water from the C4 crude butadiene carbonyl wash system. The continuous butadiene waste stream does not include butadiene streams generated from sampling, maintenance activities, or shutdown purges. The continuous butadiene waste stream does not include butadiene streams from equipment that is currently an affected source subject to the control requirements of another NESHAP. The continuous butadiene waste stream contains less than 10 parts per million by weight (ppmw) of benzene.
Dilution steam blowdown waste stream
means any continuously flowing process wastewater stream resulting from the quench and compression of cracked gas (the cracking furnace effluent) at an ethylene production unit and is discharged from the unit. This stream typically includes the aqueous or oily-water stream that results from condensation of dilution steam (in the cracking furnace quench system), blowdown from dilution steam generation systems, and aqueous streams separated from the process between the cracking furnace and the cracked gas dehydrators. The dilution steam blowdown waste stream does not include blowdown that has not contacted HAP-containing process materials. Before July 6, 2023, the dilution steam blowdown waste stream does not include dilution steam blowdown streams generated from sampling, maintenance activities, or shutdown purges. Beginning on July 6, 2023, the dilution steam blowdown streams generated from sampling, maintenance activities, or shutdown purges are included in the definition of dilution steam blowdown waste stream.
Heat exchange system
means any cooling tower system or once-through cooling water system (e.g., river or pond water). A heat exchange system can include more than one heat exchanger and can include an entire recirculating or once-through cooling system.
Process wastewater
means water which comes in contact with benzene or butadiene during manufacturing or processing operations conducted within an ethylene production unit. Process wastewater is not organic wastes, process fluids, product tank drawdown, cooling water blowdown, steam trap condensate, or landfill leachate. Process wastewater includes direct-contact cooling water.
Spent caustic waste stream
means the continuously flowing process wastewater stream that results from the use of a caustic wash system in an ethylene production unit. A caustic wash system is commonly used at ethylene production units to remove acid gases and sulfur compounds from process streams, typically cracked gas. Before July 6, 2023, the spent caustic waste stream does not include spent caustic streams generated from sampling, maintenance activities, or shutdown purges. Beginning on July 6, 2023, the spent caustic streams generated from sampling, maintenance activities, or shutdown purges are included in the definition of spent caustic waste stream.

# Monitoring Requirements for Heat Exchange Systems
§ 63.1086
How must I monitor for leaks to cooling water?
Except as specified in § 63.1085(e) and paragraph (e) of this section, you must monitor for leaks to cooling water by monitoring each heat exchange system according to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, monitoring each heat exchanger according to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, or monitoring a surrogate parameter according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. Except as specified in § 63.1085(e) and paragraph (e) of this section, if you elect to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you may use alternatives in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section for determining the mean entrance concentration.
(a)
Heat exchange system.
Monitor cooling water in each heat exchange system for the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart (either total or speciated)
or other representative substances (e.g., total organic carbon or volatile organic compounds (VOC)) that indicate the presence of a leak according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) You define the equipment that comprises each heat exchange system. For the purposes of implementing paragraph (a) of this section, a heat exchange system may consist of an entire heat exchange system or any combinations of heat exchangers such that, based on the rate of cooling water at the entrance and exit to each heat exchange system and the sensitivity of the test method being used, a leak of 3.06 kg/hr or greater of the HAP in Table 1 to this subpart would be detected. For example, if the test you decide to use has a sensitivity of 1 ppmv for total HAP, you must define the heat exchange system so that the cooling water flow rate is 51,031 liters per minute or less so that a leak of 3.06 kg/hr can be detected.
(2) Monitoring periods. For existing sources, monitor cooling water as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Monitor heat exchange systems at new sources according to the specifications in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
(i) Monitor monthly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in either paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) or (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, as appropriate.
(A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring monthly for a 6-month period, monitor quarterly thereafter until a leak is detected.
(B) If a leak is detected, monitor monthly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
(ii) Monitor weekly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as appropriate.
(A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring weekly for a 6-month period, monitor monthly thereafter until a leak is detected.
(B) If a leak is detected, monitor weekly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of the repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3) Determine the concentration of the monitored substance in the heat exchange system cooling water using any method listed in 40 CFR part 136. Use the same method for both entrance and exit samples. You may validate 40 CFR part 136 methods for the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart according to the procedures in appendix D to this part. Alternative methods may be used upon approval by the Administrator.
(4) Take a minimum of three sets of samples at each entrance and exit.
(5) Calculate the average entrance and exit concentrations, correcting for the addition of make-up water and evaporative losses, if applicable. Using a one-sided statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of significance, if the exit mean concentration is at least 10 percent greater than the entrance mean of the HAP (total or speciated) in Table 1 to this subpart or other representative substance, and the leak is at least 3.06 kg/hr, you have detected a leak.
(b)
Individual heat exchangers.
Monitor the cooling water at the entrance and exit of each heat exchanger for the HAP in Table 1 to this subpart (either total or speciated) or other representative substances (e.g., total organic carbon or VOC) that indicate the presence of a leak in a heat exchanger according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) Monitoring periods. For existing sources, monitor cooling water as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Monitor each heat exchanger at new sources according to the specifications in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(i) Monitor monthly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section, as appropriate.
(A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring monthly for a 6-month period, monitor quarterly thereafter until a leak is detected.
(B) If a leak is detected, monitor monthly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of repair,
monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(ii) Monitor weekly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as appropriate.
(A) If no leaks are detected by monitoring weekly for a 6-month period, monitor monthly thereafter until a leak is detected.
(B) If a leak is detected, monitor weekly until the leak has been repaired. Upon completion of the repair, monitor according to the specifications in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(2) Determine the concentration of the monitored substance in the cooling water using any method listed in 40 CFR part 136, as long as the method is sensitive to concentrations as low as 10 ppmv. Use the same method for both entrance and exit samples. Validation of 40 CFR part 136 methods for the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart may be determined according to the provisions of appendix D to this part. Alternative methods may be used upon approval by the Administrator.
(3) Take a minimum of three sets of samples at each heat exchanger entrance and exit.
(4) Calculate the average entrance and exit concentrations, correcting for the addition of make-up water and evaporative losses, if applicable. Using a one-sided statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of significance, if the exit mean concentration is at least 1 ppmw or 10 percent greater than the entrance mean, whichever is greater, you have detected a leak.
(c)
Surrogate parameters.
You may elect to comply with the requirements of this section by monitoring using a surrogate indicator of leaks, provided that you comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. Surrogate indicators that could be used to develop an acceptable monitoring program are ion specific electrode monitoring, pH, conductivity, or other representative indicators.
(1) You shall prepare and implement a monitoring plan that documents the procedures that will be used to detect leaks of process fluids into cooling waters. The plan shall require monitoring of one or more process parameters or other conditions that indicate a leak. Monitoring that is already being conducted for other purposes may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section. The plan shall include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) A description of the parameter or condition to be monitored and an explanation of how the selected parameter or condition will reliably indicate the presence of a leak.
(ii) The parameter level(s) or condition(s) that shall constitute a leak. This shall be documented by data or calculations showing that the selected levels or conditions will reliably identify leaks. The monitoring must be sufficiently sensitive to determine the range of parameter levels or conditions when the system is not leaking. When the selected parameter level or condition is outside that range, you have detected a leak.
(iii) Monitoring periods. For existing sources, monitor cooling water as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. Monitor heat exchange systems at new sources according to the specifications in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.
(A) Monitor monthly for 6 months, both initially and following completion of a leak repair. Then monitor as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A)(
1
) or (c)(1)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section, as appropriate.
(1) If no leaks are detected, monitor quarterly thereafter until a leak is detected.

(2) If a leak is identified by audio, visual, or olfactory inspection, a method listed in 40 CFR part 136, or any other means other than those described
in the monitoring plan, and the method(s) specified in the plan could not detect the leak, you shall revise the plan and document the basis for the changes. You shall complete the revisions to the plan no later than 180 days after discovery of the leak.
(3) You shall maintain, at all times, the monitoring plan that is currently in use. The current plan shall be maintained on-site, or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provide access within 2 hours after a request. If the monitoring plan is changed, you must retain the most recent superseded plan for at least 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded plan shall be retained on-site or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provide access within 2 hours after a request.
(d)
Simplifying assumptions for entrance mean concentration.
If you are complying with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you may elect to determine the entrance mean concentration as specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) Assume that the entrance mean concentration of the monitored substance is zero; or,
(2) Determine the entrance mean concentration of a monitored substance at a sampling location anywhere upstream of the heat exchanger or heat exchange system, provided that there is not a reasonable opportunity for the concentration to change at the entrance to each heat exchanger or heat exchange system.
(e) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1081(a), you must perform monitoring to identify leaks of total strippable hydrocarbons from each heat exchange system subject to the requirements of this subpart according to the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section.

(ii) The inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange system prior to any heat exchanger. If multiple heat exchange systems use the same water feed (
i.e.,
inlet water from the same primary water source), you may monitor at one representative location and use the monitoring results for that sampling location for all heat exchange systems that use that same water feed.
(3)
Monitoring method.
If you comply with the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration leak action level as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, you must comply with the requirements in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.

If a leak is detected as specified in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, then you must monitor weekly until the leak has been repaired according to the requirements in § 63.1087(c) or (d). Once the leak has been repaired according to the requirements in § 63.1087(c) or (d), monthly monitoring for the heat exchange system may resume.
(B) If you have not completed the initial weekly monitoring for 6-months of the heat exchange system as specified in § 63.1086(a)(2)(ii) or (b)(1)(ii), or if you elect to comply with paragraph (e) of this section rather than paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section upon startup, then you must initially monitor weekly for 6-months beginning upon startup and monitor monthly thereafter. If a leak is detected as specified in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, then you must monitor weekly until the leak has been repaired according to the requirements in § 63.1087(c) or (d). Once the leak has been repaired according to the requirements in § 63.1087(c) or (d), monthly monitoring for the heat exchange system may resume.
(iii) For each heat exchange system that is part of an ethylene production affected source that commences construction or reconstruction after October 9, 2019, you must initially monitor weekly for 6-months beginning upon startup and monitor monthly thereafter using a leak action level defined
as a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 6.2 ppmv or, for heat exchange systems with a recirculation rate of 10,000 gallons per minute or less, you may use a leak action level defined as a total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate from the heat exchange system (as methane) of 0.18 kg/hr if the heat exchange system has a recirculation rate of 10,000 gallons per minute or less. If a leak is detected as specified in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, then you must monitor weekly until the leak has been repaired according to the requirements in § 63.1087(c) or (d). Once the leak has been repaired according to the requirements in § 63.1087(c) or (d), monthly monitoring for the heat exchange system may resume.
(5)
Leak definition.
A leak is defined as described in paragraph (e)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
(i) For once-through heat exchange systems for which the inlet water feed is monitored as described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, a leak is detected if the difference in the measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from the location specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section equals or exceeds the leak action level.
(ii) For all other heat exchange systems, a leak is detected if a measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i), (ii), or (e)(2)(i) of this section equals or exceeds the leak action level.

# Repair Requirements for Heat Exchange Systems
§ 63.1087
What actions must I take if a leak is detected?
Except as specified in § 63.1085(f) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, if a leak is detected, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section unless repair is delayed according to § 63.1088.
(a) Repair the leak as soon as practical but not later than 45 calendar days after you received the results of monitoring tests that indicated a leak. You must repair the leak unless you demonstrate that the results are due to a condition other than a leak.
(b) Once the leak has been repaired, use the monitoring requirements in § 63.1086 within 7 calendar days of the repair or startup, whichever is later, to confirm that the heat exchange system has been repaired.
(c) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1081(a), if a leak is detected using the methods described in § 63.1086(e), you must repair the leak to reduce the concentration or mass emissions rate to below the applicable leak action level as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after identifying the leak, except as specified in § 63.1088(d). Repair must include re-monitoring at the monitoring location where the leak was identified according to the method specified in § 63.1086(e)(3) to verify that the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate is below the applicable leak action level. Repair may also include performing the additional monitoring in paragraph (d) of this section to verify that the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration is below the applicable leak action level. Actions that can be taken to achieve repair include but are not limited to:
(1) Physical modifications to the leaking heat exchanger, such as welding the leak or replacing a tube;
(2) Blocking the leaking tube within the heat exchanger;
(3) Changing the pressure so that water flows into the process fluid;
(4) Replacing the heat exchanger or heat exchanger bundle; or
(5) Isolating, bypassing, or otherwise removing the leaking heat exchanger from service until it is otherwise repaired.
(d) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1081(a), if you detect a leak when monitoring a cooling tower return line according to § 63.1086(e)(1)(i), you may conduct additional monitoring of each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers associated with the heat exchange system for which the leak was detected, as provided in § 63.1086(e)(1)(ii). If no leaks
are detected when monitoring according to the requirements of § 63.1086(e)(1)(ii), the heat exchange system is considered to have met the repair requirements through re-monitoring of the heat exchange system, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
[67 FR 46271, July 12, 2002, as amended at 85 FR 40421, July 6, 2020]
§ 63.1088
In what situations may I delay leak repair, and what actions must I take for delay of repair?
You may delay the repair of heat exchange systems if the leaking equipment is isolated from the process. At any time before the compliance dates specified in § 63.1081(a), you may also delay repair if repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown, and you meet one of the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1081(a), paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section no longer apply; instead, you may delay repair if the conditions in paragraph (d) of this section are met.
(a) If a shutdown is expected within the next 2 months of determining delay of repair is necessary, you are not required to have a special shutdown before that planned shutdown.
(b) If a shutdown is not expected within the next 2 months of determining delay of repair is necessary, you may delay repair if a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the potential emissions from delaying repair until the next shutdown of the process equipment associated with the leaking heat exchanger. You must document the basis for the determination that a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the emissions likely to result from delay of repair. The documentation process must include the activities in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) State the reason(s) for delaying repair.
(2) Specify a schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.
(3) Calculate the potential emissions from the leaking heat exchanger by multiplying the concentration of HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart (or other monitored substances) in the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger by the flow rate of the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger and by the expected duration of the delay.
(4) Determine emissions of HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart (or other monitored substances) from purging and depressurizing the equipment that will result from the unscheduled shutdown for the repair.
(c) If repair is delayed because the necessary equipment, parts or personnel are not available, you may delay repair a maximum of 120 calendar days. You must demonstrate that the necessary equipment, parts or personnel were not available.
(d) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1081(a), you may delay repair when one of the conditions in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section is met and the leak is less than the delay of repair action level specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. You must determine if a delay of repair is necessary as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after first identifying the leak.
(1) If the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown and the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate is initially and remains less than the delay of repair action level for all monitoring periods during the delay of repair, then you may delay repair until the next scheduled shutdown of the heat exchange system. If, during subsequent monitoring, the delay of repair action level is exceeded, then you must repair the leak within 30 days of the monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded the delay of repair action level.
(2) If the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel are not available and the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate is initially and remains less than the delay of repair action level for all monitoring periods during the delay of repair, then you may delay the repair for a maximum of 120 calendar days. You must demonstrate that the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel were not available. If, during subsequent monitoring, the delay of repair action level is exceeded, then you
must repair the leak within 30 days of the monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded the delay of repair action level.
(3) The delay of repair action level is a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 62 ppmv or, for heat exchange systems with a recirculation rate of 10,000 gallons per minute or less, the delay of repair action level is a total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate (as methane) or 1.8 kg/hr. The delay of repair action level is assessed as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
(i) For once-through heat exchange systems for which the inlet water feed is monitored as described in § 63.1086(e)(2)(ii), the delay of repair action level is exceeded if the difference in the measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in § 63.1086(e)(2)(i) and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from the location specified in § 63.1086(e)(2)(ii) equals or exceeds the delay of repair action level.
(ii) For all other heat exchange systems, the delay of repair action level is exceeded if a measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in § 63.1086(e)(1)(i) and (ii) or § 63.1086(e)(2)(i) equals or exceeds the delay of repair action level.
[67 FR 46271, July 12, 2002, as amended at 85 FR 40421, July 6, 2020]

# Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Heat Exchange Systems
§ 63.1089
What records must I keep?
You must keep the records in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, according to the requirements of § 63.1109(c).
(a) Monitoring data required by § 63.1086 that indicate a leak, the date the leak was detected, or, if applicable, the basis for determining there is no leak.
(b) The dates of efforts to repair leaks.
(c) The method or procedures used to confirm repair of a leak and the date the repair was confirmed.
(d) At any time before the compliance dates specified in § 63.1081(a), you must keep documentation of delay of repair as specified in § 63.1088(a) through (c). Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1081(a), the requirement to keep documentation of delay of repair as specified in § 63.1088(a) through (c) no longer applies; instead, you must keep documentation of delay of repair as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) The reason(s) for delaying repair.
(2) A schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.
(3) The date and concentration or mass emissions rate of the leak as first identified and the results of all subsequent monitoring events during the delay of repair.
(4) An estimate of the potential total hydrocarbon emissions from the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for each required delay of repair monitoring interval following the applicable procedures in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) If you comply with the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration leak action level, as specified in § 63.1086(e)(4), you must calculate the mass emissions rate by complying with the requirements of § 63.1086(e)(3)(ii) or by determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water at the monitoring location where the leak was detected. If the monitoring location is an individual cooling tower riser, determine the total cooling water mass flow rate to the cooling tower. Cooling water mass flow rates may be determined using direct measurement, pump curves, heat balance calculations, or other engineering methods. If you determine the mass flow rate of the cooling water, calculate the mass emissions rate by converting the stripping gas leak concentration (in ppmv as methane) to an equivalent liquid concentration, in parts per million by weight (ppmw), using equation 7-1 from “Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources” (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) and multiply the equivalent liquid concentration by the mass flow rate of the cooling water.
(ii) For delay of repair monitoring intervals prior to repair of the leak, calculate the potential total hydrocarbon emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the monitoring interval by multiplying the mass emissions rate, determined in § 63.1086(e)(3)(ii) or paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, by the duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval. The duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight on the day of the previous monitoring event or at midnight on the day the repair would have been completed if the repair had not been delayed, whichever is later, and ending at midnight of the day the of the current monitoring event.
(iii) For delay of repair monitoring intervals ending with a repaired leak, calculate the potential total hydrocarbon emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the final delay of repair monitoring interval by multiplying the duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval by the mass emissions rate determined for the last monitoring event prior to the re-monitoring event used to verify the leak was repaired. The duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight of the day of the last monitoring event prior to re-monitoring to verify the leak was repaired and ending at the time of the re-monitoring event that verified that the leak was repaired.
(e) At any time before the compliance dates specified in § 63.1081(a), if you validate a 40 CFR part 136 method for the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart according to the procedures in appendix D to this part, then you must keep a record of the test data and calculations used in the validation. On the compliance dates specified in § 63.1081(a), this requirement no longer applies.
[67 FR 46271, July 12, 2002, as amended at 85 FR 40422, July 6, 2020]
§ 63.1090
What reports must I submit?
If you delay repair for your heat exchange system, you must report the delay of repair in the semiannual report required by § 63.1110(e). If the leak remains unrepaired, you must continue to report the delay of repair in semiannual reports until you repair the leak. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, you must include the information in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section in the semiannual report.
(a) The fact that a leak was detected, and the date that the leak was detected.
(b) Whether or not the leak has been repaired.
(c) The reasons for delay of repair. If you delayed the repair as provided in § 63.1088(b), documentation of emissions estimates.
(d) If a leak remains unrepaired, the expected date of repair.
(e) If a leak is repaired, the date the leak was successfully repaired.
(f) For heat exchange systems subject to § 63.1085(e) and (f), Periodic Reports must include the information specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section, in lieu of the information specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
(1) The number of heat exchange systems at the plant site subject to the monitoring requirements in § 63.1085(e) and (f) during the reporting period.
(2) The number of heat exchange systems subject to the monitoring requirements in § 63.1085(e) and (f) at the plant site found to be leaking during the reporting period.
(3) For each monitoring location where the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate was determined to be equal to or greater than the applicable leak definitions specified in § 63.1086(e)(5) during the reporting period, identification of the monitoring location (
e.g.,
unique monitoring location or heat exchange system ID number), the measured total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate, the date the leak was first identified, and, if applicable, the date the source of the leak was identified;
(4) For leaks that were repaired during the reporting period (including delayed repairs), identification of the monitoring location associated with the repaired leak, the total strippable
hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate measured during re-monitoring to verify repair, and the re-monitoring date (
i.e.,
the effective date of repair); and
(5) For each delayed repair, identification of the monitoring location associated with the leak for which repair is delayed, the date when the delay of repair began, the date the repair is expected to be completed (if the leak is not repaired during the reporting period), the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate and date of each monitoring event conducted on the delayed repair during the reporting period, and an estimate of the potential total hydrocarbon emissions over the reporting period associated with the delayed repair.

# Background for Waste Requirements
§ 63.1091
What do the waste requirements do?
This subpart requires you to comply with 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF, National Emission Standards for Benzene Waste Operations. There are some differences between the ethylene production waste requirements and those of subpart FF.
§ 63.1092
What are the major differences between the requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF, and the waste requirements for ethylene production sources?
The major differences between the requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF, and the requirements for ethylene production sources are listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
(a) The requirements for ethylene production sources apply to all ethylene production sources that are part of a major source. The requirements do not include a provision to exempt sources with a total annual benzene quantity less than 10 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) from control requirements.
(b) The requirements for ethylene production sources apply to continuous butadiene waste streams which do not contain benzene quantities that would make them subject to the management and treatment requirements of 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF.
(c) The requirements for ethylene production sources do not include the compliance options at 40 CFR 61.342(c)(3)(ii), (d) and (e) for sources with a total annual benzene quantity less than 10 Mg/yr.
(d) If you transfer waste off-site, you must comply with the requirements in § 63.1096 rather than 40 CFR 61.342(f).

# Applicability for Waste Requirements
§ 63.1093
Does this subpart apply to my waste streams?
The waste stream provisions of this subpart apply to your waste streams if you own or operate an ethylene production facility expressly referenced to this subpart XX from subpart YY of this part.

§ 63.1096
What requirements must I comply with if I transfer waste off-site?
If you elect to transfer waste off-site, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
(a) Include a notice with the shipment or transport of each waste stream. The notice shall state that the waste stream contains organic HAP that are to be treated in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. When the transport is continuous or ongoing (for example, discharge to a publicly-owned treatment works), the notice shall be submitted to the treatment operator initially and whenever there is a change in the required treatment.
(b) You may not transfer the waste stream unless the transferee has submitted to the Administrator a written certification that the transferee will manage and treat any waste stream received from a source subject to the requirements of this subpart in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.
(c) By providing this written certification to the Administrator, the certifying entity accepts responsibility for compliance with the regulatory provisions in this subpart with respect to any shipment of waste covered by the written certification. Failure to abide by any of those provisions with respect to such shipments may result in enforcement action by EPA against the certifying entity in accordance with the enforcement provisions applicable to violations of those provisions by owners or operators of sources.
(d) The certifying entity may revoke the written certification by sending a written statement to the Administrator and you. The notice of revocation must provide at least 90 days notice that the certifying entity is rescinding acceptance of responsibility for compliance with the regulatory provisions of this subpart. Upon expiration of the notice period, you may not transfer the waste stream to that off-site treatment operation. Written certifications and revocation statements to the Administrator from the transferees of waste shall be signed by the responsible official of the certifying entity, provide the name and address of the certifying entity, and be sent to the appropriate EPA Regional Office at the addresses listed in 40 CFR 63.13. Such written certifications are not transferable by the treater to other off-site waste treatment operators.

For sources that reclassify from major source to area source status, the applicable provisions of § 63.9(j) and (k) apply. Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c), for ethylene production affected sources, §§ 63.7(a)(4), (c), (e)(4), and (g)(2), 63.9(k), and 63.10(b)(2)(vi) also apply.
(c)
Research and development facilities.
The provisions of this subpart do not apply to research and development facilities, consistent with section 112(b)(7) of the Act.
(d)
Primary product determination and applicability.
The primary product of a process unit shall be determined according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Paragraphs (d)(3), (4), and (5) of this section discuss compliance for those process units operated as flexible operation units.
(1) If a process unit only manufactures one product, then that product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.
(2) If a process unit is designed and operated as a flexible operation unit, the primary product shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section based on the anticipated operations for the 5 years following the promulgation date for existing affected sources and for the first 5 years after initial startup for new affected sources.
(i) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture one product for the greatest percentage of operating time over the five-year period, then that product shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.
(ii) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture multiple products equally based on operating time, then the product with the greatest production on a mass basis over the five-year period shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.
(3) Once the primary product of a process unit has been determined to be a product produced by a source category subject to this subpart, the owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with the standards for the primary product production process unit.
(4) The determination of the primary product for a process unit, including the assessment of applicability of this subpart to process units that are designed and operated as flexible operation units, shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4) when the primary product is determined to be a product produced by a source category subject to requirements under this subpart. The Notification of Compliance Status shall include the information specified in either paragraph (d)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section. If the primary product is determined to be something other than a product produced by a source category subject to requirements under this subpart, the owner or operator shall retain information, data, and analyses used to document the basis for the determination that the primary product is not produced by a source category subject to requirements under this subpart.
(i) If the process unit manufactures only one product subject to requirements under this subpart, the identity of that product.
(ii) If the process unit is designed and operated as a flexible operation unit, the information specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, as appropriate.
(A) The identity of the primary product.
(B) Information concerning operating time and/or production mass for each product that was used to make the determination of the primary product under paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(5) When a flexible operation unit that is subject to this subpart is producing a product other than a product subject to this subpart, or is producing a product subject to this subpart that is not the primary product, the owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (d)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section for each emission point.
(i) The owner or operator shall control emissions during the production of all products in accordance with the requirements for the production of the primary product. As appropriate, the owner or operator shall demonstrate that the parameter monitoring level established for the primary product is also appropriate for those periods when products other than the primary product are being produced. Documentation of this demonstration shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).
(ii) The owner or operator shall determine, for the production of each product, whether control is required in accordance with the applicable criteria for the primary product in § 63.1103. If control is required, the owner or operator shall establish separate parameter monitoring levels, as appropriate, for the production of each product. The parameter monitoring levels developed shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).
(e)
Storage vessel ownership determination.
To determine the process unit to which a storage vessel shall belong, the
owner or operator shall sequentially follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (8) of this section, stopping as soon as the determination is made.
(1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of this part on the date of promulgation for an affected source under the generic MACT, that storage vessel shall belong to the process unit subject to the other subpart.
(2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit.
(3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit located on the same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into or output from the storage vessel (i.e., the process unit has the predominant use of the storage vessel.)
(4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if only one of those process units is subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall belong to that process unit.
(5) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are subject to standards under this subpart that have different primary products, then the owner or operator shall assign the storage vessel to any one of the process units sharing the storage vessel.
(6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding the date of promulgation of standards for an affected source under this subpart or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following the promulgation date of standards for an affected source under this subpart for existing affected sources, whichever is more representative of the expected operations for that storage vessel, and based on the expected utilization for the 5 years after initial startup for new affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required by § 63.1110(a)(4). If the predominant use changes, the redetermination of predominant use shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.
(7) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending material to) another process unit; ceases to receive material from (or send material to) a process unit; or if the applicability of this subpart to a storage vessel has been determined according to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) through (6) of this section and there is a significant change in the use of the storage vessel that could reasonably change the predominant use, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to the storage vessel.
(8) Where a storage vessel is located at a major source that includes one or more process units that place material into, or receive materials from, the storage vessel, but the storage vessel is located in a tank farm, the applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (e)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) The storage vessel may only be assigned to a process unit that utilizes the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage vessel for that product (or raw material, as appropriate). With respect to any process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage vessel connected by hard-piping to the process unit and to the storage vessel in the tank farm so that product or raw material entering or leaving the process unit flows into (or from) the intervening storage vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in the tank farm.
(ii) If there is only one process unit at a major source that meets the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.
(iii) If there are two or more process units at the major source that meet the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those process units according to the provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section. The predominant use shall be determined among only
those process units that meet the criteria of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section.
(f)
Recovery operation equipment ownership determination.
To determine the process unit to which recovery equipment shall belong, the owner or operator shall sequentially follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) of this section, stopping as soon as the determination is made.
(1) If recovery operation equipment is already subject to another subpart of this part on the date standards are promulgated for an affected source, that recovery operation equipment shall belong to the process unit subject to the other subpart.
(2) If recovery operation equipment is used exclusively by a single process unit, the recovery operation shall belong to that process unit.
(3) If recovery operation equipment is shared among process units, then the recovery operation equipment shall belong to that process unit that has the greatest input into or output from the recovery operation equipment (i.e., that process unit has the predominant use of the recovery operation equipment).
(4) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operation equipment that is shared among process units and if one of those process units is a process unit subject to this subpart, the recovery operation equipment shall belong to the process unit subject to this subpart.
(5) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operation equipment that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are process units that have different primary products and that are subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the recovery operation equipment to any one of those process units.
(6) If the predominant use of recovery operation equipment varies from year to year, then the predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding the promulgation date of standards for an affected source under this subpart or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following the promulgation date for standards for an affected source under this subpart for existing affected sources, whichever is the more representative of the expected operations for the recovery operations equipment, and based on the expected utilization for the first 5 years after initial startup for new affected sources. This determination shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required by § 63.1110(a)(4). If the predominant use changes, the redetermination of predominant use shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.
(7) If there is an unexpected change in the utilization of recovery operation equipment that could reasonably change the predominant use, the owner or operator shall redetermine to which process unit the recovery operation belongs by reperforming the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(2) through (6) of this section.
(g)
Overlap with other regulations.
Paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this section specify the applicability of this subpart YY emission point requirements when other rules may apply. Where this subpart YY allows an owner or operator an option to comply with one or another regulation to comply with this subpart YY, an owner or operator must report which regulation they choose to comply with in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).

§ 63.1101
Definitions.
All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given them in the Act, in 40 CFR 63.2 (General Provisions), and in this section. The definitions in this section do not apply to waste requirements for ethylene production sources.
Annual average concentration,
as used in the wastewater provisions, means the flow-weighted annual average concentration, as determined according to the procedures specified in § 63.144(b).
Annual average flow rate,
as used in the wastewater provisions, means the annual average flow rate, as determined according to the procedures specified in § 63.144(c).
Batch cycle
refers to manufacturing a product from start to finish in a batch unit operation.
Batch emission episode
means a discrete venting episode that may be associated with a single unit operation. A unit operation may have more than one batch emission episode per batch cycle. For example, a displacement of vapor resulting from the charging of a vessel with organic HAP will result in a discrete emission episode. If the vessel is then heated, there may also be another discrete emission episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded vapor. Both emission episodes may occur during the same batch cycle in the same vessel or unit operation. There are possibly other emission episodes that may occur from the vessel or other process equipment, depending on process operations.
Batch unit operation
means a unit operation involving intermittent or discontinuous feed into equipment and, in general, involves the emptying of equipment after the batch cycle ceases and prior to beginning a new batch cycle. Mass, temperature, concentration and other properties of the process may vary with time. Addition of raw material and withdrawal of product do
not simultaneously occur in a batch unit operation.
Bottoms receiver
means a tank that collects distillation bottoms before the stream is sent for storage or for further downstream processing.
By compound
means by individual stream components, not carbon equivalents.
Capacity
means the volume of liquid that is capable of being stored in a storage vessel, determined by multiplying the vessel's internal cross-sectional area by the internal height of the shell.
Closed vent system
means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device. A closed vent system does not include the vapor collection system that is part of any tank truck or railcar or the loading arm or hose that is used for vapor return. For transfer racks, the closed vent system begins at, and includes, the first block valve on the downstream side of the loading arm or hose used to convey displaced vapors.
Combined vent stream
means a process vent that is comprised of at least one gas stream from a batch unit operation manifolded with at least one gas stream from a continuous unit operation.
Compliance equipment
means monitoring equipment used by an owner or operator of an affected source under this subpart to demonstrate compliance with an operation or emission limit standard.
Continuous parameter monitoring system
or
CPMS
means the total equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this subpart, and that is used to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of process or control system parameters.
Continuous unit operation
means a unit operation where the inputs and outputs flow continuously. Continuous unit operations typically approach steady-state conditions. Continuous unit operations typically involve the simultaneous addition of raw material and withdrawal of the product.
Control device
means, with the exceptions noted below, a combustion device, recovery device, recapture device, or any combination of these devices used to comply with this subpart or a referencing subpart. For process vents from continuous unit operations at affected sources in source categories where the applicability criteria includes a TRE index value, recovery devices are not considered to be control devices. Primary condensers on steam strippers or fuel gas systems are not considered to be control devices.
Day
means a calendar day.
Distillate receiver
means overhead receivers, overhead accumulators, reflux drums, and condenser(s) including ejector condenser(s) associated with a distillation unit.
Distillation unit
means a device or vessel in which one or more feed streams are separated into two or more exit streams, each exit stream having component concentrations different from those in the feed stream(s). The separation is achieved by the redistribution of the components between the liquid and the vapor phases by vaporization and condensation as they approach equilibrium within the distillation unit. Distillation unit includes the distillate receiver, reboiler, and any associated vacuum pump or steam jet.
Emission point
means an individual process vent, storage vessel, transfer rack, wastewater stream, kiln, fiber spinning line, equipment leak, or other point where a gaseous stream is released.
Equipment
means each of the following that is subject to control under this subpart: pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling collection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, instrumentation system in organic hazardous air pollutant service as defined in § 63.1103 for the applicable process unit, whose primary product is a product produced by a source category subject to this subpart.
Equivalent method
means any method of sampling and analysis for an air pollutant that has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to have a consistent and quantitatively
known relationship to the reference method, under specified conditions.
Excess emissions
means emissions in excess of those that would have occurred if there were no start-up, shutdown, or malfunction and the owner or operator complied with the relevant provisions of this subpart.
Final recovery device
means the last recovery device on a process vent stream from a continuous unit operation at an affected source in a source category where the applicability criteria includes a TRE index value. The final recovery device usually discharges to a combustion device, recapture device, or directly to the atmosphere.
Flexible operation unit
means a process unit that manufactures different chemical products periodically by alternating raw materials or operating conditions.
Fuel gas
means gases that are combusted to derive useful work or heat.
Fuel gas system
means the offsite and onsite piping and flow and pressure control system that gathers gaseous stream(s) generated by onsite operations, may blend them with other sources of gas, and transports the gaseous stream for use as a fuel gas in combustion devices or in-process combustion equipment, such as furnaces and gas turbines, either singly or in combination.
Group 1 wastewater stream
means a process wastewater stream at an existing or new source that meets the criteria for Group 1 status in § 63.132(c).
Group 2 wastewater stream
means a process wastewater stream that does not meet the definition of a Group 1 wastewater stream.
Halogens and hydrogen halides
means hydrogen chloride (HCl), chlorine (Cl2), hydrogen bromide (HBr), bromine (Br2), and hydrogen fluoride (HF).
Impurity
means a substance that is produced coincidentally with the primary product, or is present in a raw material. An impurity does not serve a useful purpose in the production or use of the primary product and is not isolated.
Initial startup
means, for new sources, the first time the source begins production. For additions or changes not defined as a new source by this subpart, initial startup means the first time additional or changed equipment is put into operation. Initial startup does not include operation solely for testing equipment. Initial startup does not include subsequent startup (as defined in this section) of process units following malfunctions or process unit shutdowns. Except for equipment leaks, initial startup also does not include subsequent startups (as defined in this section) of process units following changes in product for flexible operation units or following recharging of equipment in batch unit operations.
Low throughput transfer rack
means a transfer rack that transfers less than a total of 11.8 million liters per year of liquid containing regulated HAP.
Maintenance wastewater
means wastewater generated by the draining of process fluid from components in the process unit, whose primary product is a product produced by a source category subject to this subpart, into an individual drain system prior to or during maintenance activities. Maintenance wastewater can be generated during planned and unplanned shutdowns and during periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of activities that can generate maintenance wastewaters include descaling of heat exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of distillation column traps, draining of low legs and high point bleeds, draining of pumps into an individual drain system, and draining of portions of the process unit, whose primary product is a product produced by a source category subject to this subpart, for repair.
Malfunction
means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner which causes, or has the potential to cause, the emission limitations in an applicable standard to be exceeded.

Acrylic and modacrylic fibers production
means the production of either of the following synthetic fibers composed of acrylonitrile units:
(i) Acrylic fiber.
(ii) Modacrylic fiber.
Acrylonitrile solution polymerization
means a process where acrylonitrile and comonomers are dissolved in a solvent to form a polymer solution (typically polyacrylonitrile). The polyacrylonitrile is soluble in the solvent. In contrast to suspension polymerization, the resulting reactor polymer solution (spin dope) is filtered and pumped directly to the fiber spinning process.
Acrylonitrile suspension polymerization
means a polymerization process where small drops of acrylonitrile and comonomers are suspended in water in the presence of a catalyst where they polymerize under agitation. Solid beads of polymer are formed in this suspension reaction which are subsequently filtered, washed, refiltered, and dried. The beads must be subsequently redissolved in a solvent to create a spin dope prior to introduction to the fiber spinning process.
Fiber spinning line
means the group of equipment and process vents associated with acrylic or modacrylic fiber spinning operations. The fiber spinning line includes (as applicable to the type of spinning process used) the blending and dissolving tanks, spinning solution filters, wet spinning units, spin bath tanks, and the equipment used downstream of the spin bath to wash, dry, or draw the spun fiber.
In organic hazardous air pollutant or in organic HAP service
means, for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources, that a piece of equipment either contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or gas) that is at least 10 percent by weight of total organic HAP as determined according to the provisions of § 63.180(d). The provisions of § 63.180(d) also specify how to determine that a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service.
Modacrylic fiber
means a manufactured synthetic fiber in which the fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of at least 35 percent by weight of acrylonitrile units but less than 85 percent by weight of acrylonitrile units.
Seal
means, for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources complying with the requirements of § 63.1033(b) or § 63.167(a) on or after October 8, 2014, that instrument monitoring of the open-ended valve or line conducted according to the method

(2)
Definitions.
Connector
means flanged, screwed, or other joined fittings used to connect two pipelines or a pipeline and a piece of equipment. A common connector is a flange. Joined fittings welded completely around the circumference of the interface are not considered connectors for the purposes of this subpart.
Equipment
means each pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, and instrumentation system in hydrogen fluoride service; and any control devices or closed-vent systems used to comply with this subpart.
Hydrogen fluoride production
means a process engaged in the production and recovery of hydrogen fluoride by reacting calcium fluoride with sulfuric acid. For the purpose of implementing this subpart, hydrogen fluoride production is not a process that produces gaseous hydrogen fluoride for direct reaction with hydrated aluminum to form aluminum fluoride (i.e., the hydrogen fluoride is not recovered as an intermediate or final product prior to reacting with the hydrated aluminum).
In hydrogen fluoride service
means that a piece of equipment either contains or contacts a hydrogen fluoride process fluid (liquid or gas).
In vacuum service
means that equipment is operating at an internal pressure which is at least 5 kilopascals below ambient pressure.
Instrumentation system
means a group of equipment components used to condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions (e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, other types of equipment may also be included in these systems.
Kiln seal
means the mechanical or hydraulic seals at both ends of the kiln, designed to prevent the infiltration of moisture and air through the interface of the rotating kiln and stationary pipes and equipment attached to the kiln during normal vacuum operation of the kiln (operation at an internal pressure of at least 0.25 kilopascal [one inch of water] below ambient pressure).
Leakless pump
means a pump whose seals are submerged in liquid, a magnetically-driven pump, a pump equipped with a dual mechanical seal system that includes a barrier fluid system, a canned pump, or other pump that is designed with no externally actuated shaft penetrating the pump housing.
Open-ended valve or line
means any valve, except relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid and one side open to the atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.
Pressure release
means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.
Pressure relief device or valve
means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.
Relief device or valve
means a valve used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge can result from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
Repaired
for the purpose of this regulation means equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak identified by sensory monitoring.
Sampling connection system
means an assembly of equipment within a process unit or affected facility used during periods of representative operation to take samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take nonroutine grab samples is not considered a sampling connection system.
Sensory monitoring
means the detection of a potential leak to the atmosphere by walk-through visual, audible, or olfactory monitoring. Comprehensive component-by-component inspection is not required.
Shift
means the time a shift operator normally works, typically 8 or 12 hours.

Definitions.
Decoking operation
means the coke combustion activity that occurs inside the radiant tube(s) in the ethylene cracking furnace firebox. Coke combustion activities during decoking can also occur in other downstream equipment such as the process gas outlet piping and transfer line exchangers or quench points.
Ethylene process vent
means a gas stream with a flow rate greater than 0.005 standard cubic meters per minute containing greater than 20 parts per million by volume HAP that is continuously discharged during operation of an ethylene production unit. On and after July 6, 2023, ethylene process vent means a gas stream with a flow rate greater than 0.005 standard cubic meters per minute containing greater than 20 parts per million by volume HAP that is continuously or periodically discharged during operation of an ethylene production unit. Ethylene process vents are gas streams that are discharged to the atmosphere (or the point of entry into a control device, if any) either directly or after passing
through one or more recovery devices. Ethylene process vents do not include:
(A) Pressure relief device discharges;
(B) Gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas system, including any flares using fuel gas, of which less than 50 percent of the fuel gas is derived from an ethylene production unit;
(C) Gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas system whereby any flares using fuel gas, of which 50 percent or more of the fuel gas is derived from an ethylene production unit, comply with § 63.1103(e)(4) beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c);
(D) Leaks from equipment regulated under this subpart;

The ethylene production unit includes the separation of ethylene and/or propylene from associated streams such as a C
4
product, pyrolysis gasoline, and pyrolysis fuel oil. Ethylene production does not include the manufacture of SOCMI chemicals such as the production of butadiene from the C
4
stream and aromatics from pyrolysis gasoline.
Force majeure event
means a release of HAP, either directly to the atmosphere from a pressure relief device or discharged via a flare, that is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator to result from an event beyond the owner or operator's control, such as natural disasters; acts of war or terrorism; loss of a utility external to the ethylene production unit (
e.g.,
external power curtailment), excluding power curtailment due to an interruptible service agreement; and fire or explosion originating at a near or adjoining facility outside of the ethylene production unit that impacts the ethylene production unit's ability to operate.
Organic HAP
means the compounds listed in Table 1 to subpart XX of this part.
Periodically discharged
means gas stream discharges that are intermittent for which the total organic HAP concentration is greater than 20 parts per million by volume and total volatile organic compound emissions are 50 pounds per day or more. These intermittent discharges are associated with routine operations, maintenance activities, startups, shutdowns, malfunctions, or process upsets and do not include pressure relief device discharges or discharges classified as maintenance vents.
Pressure-assisted multi-point flare
means a flare system consisting of multiple flare burners in staged arrays whereby the vent stream pressure is used to promote mixing and smokeless operation at the flare burner tips. Pressure-assisted multi-point flares are designed for smokeless operation at velocities up to Mach = 1 conditions (
i.e.,
sonic conditions), can be elevated or at ground level, and typically use cross-lighting for flame propagation to combust any flare vent gases sent to a particular stage of flare burners.
Pressure relief device
means a valve, rupture disk, or similar device used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage. A pressure relief device discharge can result from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause. Such devices include conventional, spring-actuated relief valves, balanced bellows relief valves, pilot-operated relief valves, rupture disks, and breaking, buckling, or shearing pin devices. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.
Radiant tube(s)
means any portion of the tube coil assembly located within the ethylene cracking furnace firebox whereby a thermal cracking reaction of hydrocarbons (in the presence of steam) occurs. Hydrocarbons and steam pass through the radiant tube(s)
of the ethylene cracking furnace during normal operation and coke is removed from the inside of the radiant tube(s) during decoking operation.
Relief valve

Waste stream
means the waste generated by a particular process unit, product tank, or waste management unit. The characteristics of the waste stream (e.g., flow rate, HAP concentration, water content) are determined at the point of waste generation. Examples of a waste stream include process wastewater, product tank drawdown, sludge and slop oil removed from waste management units, and landfill leachate.

Flares.
Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c), if a steam-assisted, air-assisted, non-assisted, or pressure-assisted multi-point flare is used as a control device for an emission point subject to the requirements in Table 7 to this section, then the owner or operator must meet the applicable requirements for flares as specified in §§ 63.670 and 63.671 of subpart CC, including the provisions in Tables 12 and 13 to subpart CC of this part, except as specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (xiv) of this section. This requirement also applies to any flare using fuel gas from a fuel gas system, of which 50 percent or more of the fuel gas is derived from an ethylene production unit, being used to control an emission point subject to the requirements in Table 7 of this section. For purposes of compliance with this paragraph, the following terms are defined in § 63.641 of subpart CC: Assist air, assist steam, center steam, combustion zone, combustion zone gas, flare, flare purge gas, flare supplemental gas, flare sweep gas, flare vent gas, lower steam, net heating value, perimeter assist air, pilot gas, premix assist air, total steam, and upper steam.
(i) The owner or operator may elect to comply with the alternative means of emissions limitation requirements specified in of § 63.670(r) of subpart CC in lieu of the requirements in § 63.670(d) through (f) of subpart CC, as applicable. However, instead of complying with § 63.670(r)(3) of subpart CC, the owner or operator must submit the alternative means of emissions limitation request following the requirements in § 63.1113.
(ii) Instead of complying with § 63.670(o)(2)(i) of subpart CC, the owner or operator must develop and implement the flare management plan no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c).
(iii) Instead of complying with § 63.670(o)(2)(iii) of subpart CC, if required to develop a flare management plan and submit it to the Administrator, then the owner or operator must also submit all versions of the plan in portable document format (PDF) to the EPA following the procedure specified in § 63.9(k), except any medium submitted through U.S. mail must be sent to the attention of the Ethylene Production Sector Lead.
(iv) Section 63.670(o)(3)(ii) of subpart CC and all references to § 63.670(o)(3)(ii) of subpart CC do not apply. Instead, the owner or operator must comply with the maximum flare tip velocity operating limit at all times.
(v) Substitute “ethylene production unit” for each occurrence of “petroleum refinery.”
(vi) Each occurrence of “refinery” does not apply.
(vii) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(4)(vii)(G) of this section, if a pressure-assisted multi-point flare is used as a control device for an emission point subject to the requirements in Table 7 to this section, then the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(vii)(A) through (F) of this section.
(A) The owner or operator is not required to comply with the flare tip velocity requirements in § 63.670(d) and (k) of subpart CC;
(B) The owner or operator must comply with the NHVcz requirements in § 63.670(e)(2) of subpart CC;
(C) The owner or operator must determine the 15-minute block average NHVvg using only the direct calculation method specified in § 63.670(l)(5)(ii) of subpart CC;
(D) Instead of complying with § 63.670(b) and (g) of subpart CC, if a pressure-assisted multi-point flare uses cross-lighting on a stage of burners rather than having an individual pilot flame on each burner, the owner or operator must operate each stage of the pressure-assisted multi-point flare with a flame present at all times when regulated material is routed to that stage of burners. Each stage of burners that cross-lights in the pressure-assisted multi-point flare must have at least two pilots with at least one continuously lit and capable of igniting all regulated material that is routed to that stage of burners. Each 15-minute block during which there is at least one minute where no pilot flame is present on a stage of burners when regulated material is routed to that stage is a deviation of the standard. Deviations in different 15-minute blocks from the same event are considered separate deviations. The pilot flame(s) on each stage of burners that use cross-lighting must be continuously monitored by a thermocouple or any other equivalent device used to detect the presence of a flame;
(E) Unless the owner or operator of a pressure-assisted multi-point flare chooses to conduct a cross-light performance demonstration as specified in this paragraph, the owner or operator must ensure that if a stage of burners on the flare uses cross-lighting, that the distance between any two burners in series on that stage is no more than 6 feet when measured from the center of one burner to the next burner. A distance greater than 6 feet between any two burners in series may be used provided the owner or operator conducts a performance demonstration that confirms the pressure-assisted multi-point flare will cross-light a minimum of three burners and the spacing between the burners and location of the pilot flame must be representative of the projected installation. The compliance demonstration must be approved by the permitting authority and a copy of this approval must be maintained onsite. The compliance demonstration report must include: A protocol describing the test methodology used, associated test method QA/QC parameters, the waste gas composition and NHVcz of the gas tested, the velocity of the waste gas tested, the pressure-assisted multi-point flare burner tip pressure, the time, length, and duration of the test, records of whether a successful cross-light was observed over all of the burners and the length of time it took for the burners to cross-light, records
of maintaining a stable flame after a successful cross-light and the duration for which this was observed, records of any smoking events during the cross-light, waste gas temperature, meteorological conditions (
e.g.,
ambient temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity), and whether there were any observed flare flameouts; and
(F) The owner or operator of a pressure-assisted multi-point flare must install and operate pressure monitor(s) on the main flare header, as well as a valve position indicator monitoring system for each staging valve to ensure that the flare operates within the proper range of conditions as specified by the manufacturer. The pressure monitor must meet the requirements in Table 13 to subpart CC of this part.
(G) If a pressure-assisted multi-point flare is operating under the requirements of an approved alternative means of emission limitations, the owner or operator shall either continue to comply with the terms of the alternative means of emission limitations or comply with the provisions in paragraphs (e)(4)(vii)(A) through (F) of this section.

(B) Calibration gas cylinders must be certified to an accuracy of 2 percent and traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards.
(C) For unknown gas components that have similar analytical mass fragments to calibration compounds, the owner or operator may report the unknowns as an increase in the overlapped calibration gas compound. For unknown compounds that produce mass fragments that do not overlap calibration compounds, the owner or operator may use the response factor for the nearest molecular weight hydrocarbon in the calibration mix to quantify the unknown component's NHV
vg
.
(D) The owner or operator may use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify any unknown components detected with a higher molecular weight than n-pentane.
(E) The owner or operator must perform an initial calibration to identify mass fragment overlap and response factors for the target compounds.
(F) The owner or operator must meet applicable requirements in Performance Specification 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, for continuous monitoring system acceptance including, but not limited to, performing an initial multi-point calibration check at three concentrations following the procedure in Section 10.1 and performing the periodic calibration requirements listed for gas chromatographs in Table 13 to subpart CC of this part, for the process mass spectrometer. The owner or operator may use the alternative sampling line temperature allowed under Net Heating Value by Gas Chromatograph in Table 13 to subpart CC of this part.
(G) The average instrument calibration error (CE) for each calibration compound at any calibration concentration must not differ by more than 10 percent from the certified cylinder gas value. The CE for each component in the calibration blend must be calculated using the following equation:
ER06JY20.000
Where:
C
m
= Average instrument response (ppm)
C
a
= Certified cylinder gas value (ppm)
(ix) An owner or operator using a gas chromatograph or mass spectrometer for compositional analysis for net heating value may choose to use the CE of NHV
measured
versus the cylinder tag value NHV as the measure of agreement for daily calibration and quarterly audits in lieu of determining the compound-specific CE. The CE for NHV at any calibration level must not differ by more than 10 percent from the certified cylinder gas value. The CE for must be calculated using the following equation:
ER06JY20.001
Where:
NHV
measured
= Average instrument response (Btu/scf)
NHV
a
= Certified cylinder gas value (Btu/scf)
(x) Instead of complying with § 63.670(p) of subpart CC, the owner or operator must keep the flare monitoring records specified in § 63.1109(e).
(xi) Instead of complying with § 63.670(q) of subpart CC, the owner or operator must comply with the reporting requirements specified in § 63.1110(d) and (e)(4).
(xii) When determining compliance with the pilot flame requirements specified in § 63.670(b) and (g), substitute “pilot flame or flare flame” for each occurrence of “pilot flame.”
(xiii) When determining compliance with the flare tip velocity and combustion zone operating limits specified in § 63.670(d) and (e), the requirement effectively applies starting with the 15-minute block that includes a full 15 minutes of the flaring event. The owner or operator is required to demonstrate compliance with the velocity and NHVcz requirements starting with the block that contains the fifteenth minute of a flaring event. The owner or operator is not required to demonstrate compliance for the previous 15-minute block in which the event started and contained only a fraction of flow.
(xiv) In lieu of meeting the requirements in §§ 63.670 and 63.671 of subpart CC, an owner or operator may submit a request to the Administrator for approval of an alternative test method in accordance with § 63.7(f). The alternative test method must be able to demonstrate on an ongoing basis at least once every 15-minutes that the flare meets 96.5% combustion efficiency and provide a description of the alternative recordkeeping and reporting that would be associated with the alternative test method. The alternative test method request may also include a request to use the alternative test method in lieu of the pilot or flare flame monitoring requirements of 63.670(g).
(5)
Maintenance vents.
Unless an extension is requested in accordance with the provisions in § 63.6(i) of subpart A, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c), an owner or operator may designate an ethylene process vent as a maintenance vent if the vent is only used as a result of startup, shutdown, maintenance, or inspection of equipment where equipment is emptied, depressurized, degassed, or placed into service. The owner or operator must comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section for each maintenance vent.
(i) Prior to venting to the atmosphere, remove process liquids from the equipment as much as practical and depressurize the equipment to either: A flare meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, or a non-flare control device meeting the requirements specified in § 63.982(c)(2) of subpart SS, until one of the following conditions, as applicable, is met.
(A) The concentration of the vapor in the equipment served by the maintenance vent is less than 10 percent of its lower explosive limit (LEL).
(B) If there is no ability to measure the concentration of the vapor in the equipment based on the design of the equipment, the pressure in the equipment served by the maintenance vent is reduced to 5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) or less. Upon opening the maintenance vent, active purging of the equipment cannot be used until the concentration of the vapors in the maintenance vent (or inside the equipment if the maintenance is a hatch or similar type of opening) is less than 10 percent of its LEL.
(C) The equipment served by the maintenance vent contains less than 50 pounds of total volatile organic compounds (VOC).
(D) If, after applying best practices to isolate and purge equipment served by a maintenance vent, none of the applicable criterion in paragraphs (e)(5)(i)(A) through (C) of this section can be met prior to installing or removing a blind flange or similar equipment blind, then the pressure in the equipment served by the maintenance vent must be reduced to 2 psig or less before installing or removing the equipment blind. During installation or removal of the equipment blind, active purging of the equipment may be used provided the equipment pressure at the location where purge gas is introduced remains at 2 psig or less.
(ii) Except for maintenance vents complying with the alternative in paragraph (e)(5)(i)(C) of this section, the owner or operator must determine the concentration of the vapor or, if applicable, equipment pressure using process instrumentation or portable measurement devices and follow procedures for calibration and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications.
(iii) For maintenance vents complying with the alternative in paragraph (e)(5)(i)(C) of this section, the owner or operator must determine mass of VOC in the equipment served by the maintenance vent based on the equipment size and contents after considering any contents drained or purged from the equipment. Equipment size may be determined from equipment design specifications. Equipment contents may be determined using process knowledge.
(6)
Bypass lines.
Beginning on the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c), the use of a bypass line at any time on a closed vent system to divert emissions subject to the requirements in Table 7 to § 63.1103(
e
) to the atmosphere or to a control device not meeting the requirements specified in Table 7 of this subpart is an emissions standards violation. If the owner or operator is subject to the bypass monitoring requirements of § 63.983(a)(3) of subpart SS, then the owner or operator must continue to comply with the requirements in § 63.983(a)(3) of subpart SS and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in §§ 63.998(d)(1)(ii) and 63.999(c)(2) of subpart SS, in addition to paragraph (e)(9) of this section, the recordkeeping requirements specified in § 63.1109(g), and the reporting requirements specified in § 63.1110(e)(6). For purposes of compliance with this paragraph, the phrase “Except for equipment needed for safety purposes such as pressure relief devices, low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, and open-ended valves or lines” in § 63.983(a)(3) does not apply; instead, the exemptions specified in paragraph (e)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section apply.
(i) Except for pressure relief devices subject to 40 CFR 63.1107(h)(4), equipment such as low leg drains and equipment subject to the requirements specified in paragraph (f) of Table 7 to § 63.1103(e) are not subject to this paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
(ii) Open-ended valves or lines that use a cap, blind flange, plug, or second valve and follow the requirements specified in § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) or follow requirements codified in another regulation that are the same as § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) are not subject to this paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
(7)
Decoking operation standards for ethylene cracking furnaces.
Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c), the owner or operator must comply with paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section and also use at least two of the control measures specified in paragraphs (e)(7)(ii) through (v)
of this section to minimize coke combustion emissions from the decoking of the radiant tube(s) in each ethylene cracking furnace.
(i) During normal operations, conduct daily inspections of the firebox burners and repair all burners that are impinging on the radiant tube(s) as soon as practical, but not later than 1 calendar day after the flame impingement is found. The owner or operator may delay burner repair beyond 1 calendar day provided the repair cannot be completed during normal operations, the burner cannot be shutdown without significantly impacting the furnace heat distribution and firing rate, and action is taken to reduce flame impingement as much as possible during continued operation. If a delay of repair is required to fully resolve burner flame impingement, repair must be completed following the next planned decoking operation (and before returning the ethylene cracking furnace back to normal operations) or during the next ethylene cracking furnace complete shutdown (when the ethylene cracking furnace firebox is taken completely offline), whichever is earlier. An inspection may include, but is not limited to: visual inspection of the radiant tube(s) for localized bright spots (this may be confirmed with a temperature gun), use of luminescent powders injected into the burner to illuminate the flame pattern, or identifying continued localized coke buildup that causes short runtimes between decoking cycles. A repair may include, but is not limited to: Taking the burner out of service, replacing the burner, adjusting the alignment of the burner, adjusting burner configuration, making burner air corrections, repairing a malfunction of the fuel liquid removal equipment, or adding insulation around the radiant tube(s).
(ii) During decoking operations, beginning before the expected end of the air-in decoke time, continuously monitor (or use a gas detection tube or equivalent sample technique every three hours to monitor) the CO
2
concentration in the combined decoke effluent downstream of the last component being decoked for an indication that the coke combustion in the ethylene cracking furnace radiant tube(s) is complete. The owner or operator must immediately initiate procedures to stop the coke combustion once the CO
2
concentration at the outlet consistently reaches a level that indicates combustion of coke is complete and site decoke completion assurance procedures have been concluded.
(iii) During decoking operations, continuously monitor the temperature at the radiant tube(s) outlet when air is being introduced to ensure the coke combustion occurring inside the radiant tube(s) is not so aggressive (
i.e.,
too hot) that it damages either the radiant tube(s) or ethylene cracking furnace isolation valve(s). The owner or operator must immediately initiate procedures to reduce the temperature at the radiant tube(s) outlet once the temperature reaches a level that indicates combustion of coke inside the radiant tube(s) is too aggressive.
(iv) After decoking, but before returning the ethylene cracking furnace back to normal operations, verify that decoke air is no longer being added.
(v) After decoking, but before returning the ethylene cracking furnace back to normal operations and/or during normal operations, inject materials into the steam or feed to reduce coke formation inside the radiant tube(s) during normal operation.
(8)
Ethylene cracking furnace isolation valve inspections.
Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c), the owner or operator must conduct ethylene cracking furnace isolation valve inspections as specified in paragraphs (e)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) Prior to decoking operation, inspect the applicable ethylene cracking furnace isolation valve(s) to confirm that the radiant tube(s) being decoked is completely isolated from the ethylene production process so that no emissions generated from decoking operations are sent to the ethylene production process. If poor isolation is identified, then the owner or operator must rectify the isolation issue prior to continuing decoking operations to prevent leaks into the ethylene production process, unless the owner or operator determines that damage to the radiant tube(s) or ethylene cracking furnace could occur if the repair was attempted
prior to completing a decoking operation and/or prior to the ethylene cracking furnace being shut down.
(ii) Prior to returning the ethylene cracking furnace to normal operations after a decoking operation, inspect the applicable ethylene cracking furnace isolation valve(s) to confirm that the radiant tube(s) that was decoked is completely isolated from the decoking pot or furnace firebox such that no emissions are sent from the radiant tube(s) to the decoking pot or furnace firebox once the ethylene cracking furnace returns to normal operation. If poor isolation is identified, then the owner or operator must rectify the isolation issue prior to continuing normal operations to prevent product from escaping to the atmosphere through the decoking pot or furnace firebox.
(9)

Cyanide chemicals manufacturing applicability, definitions, and requirements
—(1)
Applicability
—(i)
Affected source.
For the cyanide chemicals manufacturing source category, the affected source shall include each cyanide chemicals manufacturing process
unit located at a major source, as defined in section 112(a) of the Act.

(2)
Definitions. Andrussow process unit
means a process unit that produces hydrogen cyanide by reacting methane and ammonia in the presence of oxygen over a platinum/rhodium catalyst. An Andrussow process unit begins at the point at which the raw materials are stored and ends at the point at which refined hydrogen cyanide is reacted as a raw material in a downstream process, burned on-site as fuel in a boiler or industrial furnace, or is shipped offsite. If raw hydrogen cyanide from the reactor is reacted with sodium hydroxide to form sodium cyanide prior to the refining process, the unit operation where sodium cyanide is formed is considered to be part of the Andrussow process unit.
Blausaure Methane Anlage (BMA) process unit
means a process unit that produces hydrogen cyanide by reacting methane and ammonia over a platinum catalyst. A BMA process unit begins at the point at which raw materials are stored and ends at the point at which refined hydrogen cyanide is reacted as a raw material in a downstream process, burned on-site as a fuel in a boiler or industrial furnace, or is shipped offsite. If raw hydrogen cyanide from the reactor is reacted with sodium hydroxide to form sodium cyanide prior to the refining process, the unit operation where sodium cyanide is formed is considered to be part of the BMA process unit.
Byproduct
means a chemical that is produced coincidentally during the production of another chemical.
Cyanide chemicals manufacturing process unit
or
CCMPU
means the equipment assembled and connected by hard-piping or duct work to process raw materials to manufacture, store, and transport a cyanide chemicals product. A cyanide chemicals manufacturing process unit shall be limited to any one of the following: an Andrussow process unit, a BMA process unit, a sodium cyanide process unit, or a Sohio hydrogen cyanide process unit. For the purpose of this subpart, a cyanide chemicals manufacturing process unit includes reactors and associated unit operations; associated recovery devices; and any feed, intermediate and product storage vessels, product transfer racks, and connected ducts and piping. A cyanide chemicals manufacturing process unit includes pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, instrumentation systems, and control devices or systems.
Cyanide chemicals product
means either hydrogen cyanide, potassium cyanide, or sodium cyanide which is manufactured as the intended product of a CCMPU or a byproduct of the Sohio process. Other hydrogen cyanide, potassium cyanide, or sodium cyanide byproducts, impurities, wastes, and trace contaminants are not considered to be cyanide chemicals products.
Dry-end process vent
means a process vent originating from the drum filter or any other unit operation in the dry end of a sodium cyanide manufacturing process unit. For the purposes of this subpart, the dry end of the sodium cyanide process unit begins in the unit operation where water is removed from the sodium cyanide, usually in the drum filter, and ends when the sodium cyanide is used as a raw material in a downstream process, or is shipped offsite.
Free cyanide
means chemical species of cyanide that are dissolved in water and are bioavailable and known for their toxic effects on living organisms. This refers to the sum of molecular hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and cyanide ion (CN
-
) dissolved in water. Included in this definition are the dissolved products of cyanide salts (including potassium cyanide [KCN] and sodium cyanide [NaCN]), as these salts dissociate to cyanide ion and hydrogen cyanide when added to water.
Organic HAP
means, for purposes of applicability of the requirements of
this subpart, all hydrogen cyanide compounds.
Raw hydrogen cyanide
means hydrogen cyanide that has not been through the refining process. Raw hydrogen cyanide usually has a hydrogen cyanide concentration less than 10 percent.
Refined hydrogen cyanide
means hydrogen cyanide that has been through the refining process. Refined hydrogen cyanide usually has a hydrogen cyanide concentration greater than 99 percent.
Refining process
means the collection of equipment in a cyanide chemicals manufacturing processing unit used to concentrate raw hydrogen cyanide from a concentration around 10 percent or less to refined hydrogen cyanide at a concentration greater than 99 percent.
Sodium cyanide process unit
means a process unit that produces sodium cyanide by reacting hydrogen cyanide and sodium hydroxide via the neutralization, or wet, process. A sodium cyanide process unit begins at the unit operation where refined hydrogen cyanide is reacted with sodium hydroxide and ends at the point the solid sodium cyanide product is shipped offsite or used as a raw material in a downstream process. If raw hydrogen cyanide is reacted with sodium hydroxide to form sodium cyanide prior to the hydrogen cyanide refining process, the unit operation where sodium cyanide is formed is not considered to be part of the sodium cyanide process unit. For this type of process, the sodium cyanide process unit begins at the point that the aqueous sodium cyanide stream leaves the unit operation where the sodium cyanide is formed. In situations where potassium hydroxide is substituted for sodium hydroxide to produce potassium cyanide, the process unit is still considered a sodium cyanide process unit.
Sohio hydrogen cyanide process unit
means a process unit that produces hydrogen cyanide as a byproduct of the acrylonitrile production process when acrylonitrile is manufactured using the Sohio process. A Sohio hydrogen cyanide process unit begins at the point the hydrogen cyanide leaves the unit operation where the hydrogen cyanide is separated from the acrylonitrile (usually referred to as the heads column). The Sohio hydrogen cyanide process unit ends at the point refined hydrogen cyanide is reacted as a raw material in a downstream process, burned on-site as fuel in a boiler or industrial furnace, or is shipped offsite. If raw hydrogen cyanide is reacted with sodium hydroxide to form sodium cyanide prior to the refining process, the unit operation where sodium cyanide is formed is considered to be part of the Sohio hydrogen cyanide process unit.
Wet-end process vent
means a process vent originating from the reactor, crystallizer, or any other unit operation in the wet end of the sodium cyanide process unit. For the purposes of this subpart, the wet end of the sodium cyanide process unit begins at the point at which the raw materials are stored and ends just prior to the unit operation where water is removed from the sodium cyanide, usually in the drum filter. Wastewater streams containing discarded wastewater from the sodium cyanide production process are not considered to be part of the wet-end sodium cyanide process. Discarded wastewater that is no longer used in the production process is considered to be process and/or maintenance wastewater. Vents from process and maintenance wastewater operations are not wet-end process vents.
(3)
Requirements.
Table 9 to this section specifies the cyanide chemicals manufacturing standards applicable to existing and new sources. Applicability assessment procedures and methods are specified in § 63.1104. An owner or operator of an affected source is not required to perform applicability tests or other applicability assessment procedures if they opt to comply with the most stringent requirements for an applicable emission point pursuant to this subpart. General compliance, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements are specified in §§ 63.1108 through 63.1112. Before May 18, 2022, minimization of emissions from startup, shutdown, and malfunctions must be addressed in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by § 63.1111; the plan must also establish reporting and recordkeeping of such events. A startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is not required on and after May 18, 2022 and the requirements specified
in § 63.1111 no longer apply; however, for historical compliance purposes, a copy of the plan must be retained and available on-site for 5 years after May 18, 2022. Procedures for approval of alternative means of emission limitations are specified in § 63.1113.
(4)
Determination of overall HAP emission reduction for a process unit.
(i) The owner or operator shall determine the overall HAP emission reduction for process vents in a process unit using Equation 1 of this section. The overall organic HAP emission reduction shall be determined for all process vents in the process unit.

= Overall HAP emission reduction for the group of process vents in the CCMPU, percent.
E
unc
,i = Uncontrolled HAP emissions from process vent i that is controlled by using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device, kg/yr.
n = Number of process vents in the process unit that are controlled by using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device.
R
i
= Control efficiency of the combustion, recovery, or recapture device used to control HAP emissions from vent i, determined in accordance with paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section.
E
unc
,j = Uncontrolled HAP emissions from process vent j that is not controlled by using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device, kg/yr.
m = Number of process vents in the process unit that are not controlled by using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device.
(ii) The control efficiency shall be assigned as specified in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section.
(A) If the process vent is controlled using a flare in accordance with the provisions of § 63.987, or a combustion device in accordance with the provisions of § 63.988(b)(2), for which a performance test has not been conducted, the control efficiency shall be assumed to be 98 weight-percent. For hydrogen-fueled flares, an owner or operator may use a control efficiency greater than 98 weight-percent if they can provide engineering calculations and supporting information demonstrating a greater control efficiency.
(B) If the process vent is controlled using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device for which a performance test has been conducted in accordance with the provisions of § 63.997, the control efficiency shall be the efficiency determined by the performance test.
(5)
Source category specific modifications to testing procedures.
(i) When identifying equipment subject to any equipment leak requirements, an owner or operator is allowed to designate specific components of such equipment as never being safe to monitor with their Notification of Compliance Status report and periodic compliance reports. In order for an owner or operator to designate such equipment as never being safe to monitor, they must certify that monitoring such equipment at any time the CCMPU is operating is never safe (e.g., monitoring this equipment would present an unreasonable hazard or preclude testing personnel from meeting emergency evacuation requirements). If it is demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction that equipment designated by the owner or operator as never safe to monitor is appropriately designated, an owner or operator will not be required to monitor such equipment.
(ii) For process vent hydrogen cyanide emissions that are vented to a control device other than a flare during startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the design evaluation must include documentation that the control device
being used achieves the required control efficiency during the reasonably expected maximum flow rate and emission rate during startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
(iii) If a facility controls process vent emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction by using a flare, an owner or operator is not required to perform flow rate and heat content testing as specified in § 63.987(b)(3)(ii) and (iii). In lieu of performing flow rate and heat content testing, an owner or operator is required to submit engineering calculations that substantiate that a flare meets the applicable heat content or flow rates, or provide data from a compliance assessment that the flare is in compliance under worst case conditions (e.g., maximum operating conditions).
(iv) If flare velocity and net heating value testing, as specified in § 63.11(b)(6)(ii) and (b)(7)(i), would create an unreasonable hazard for testing personnel, an owner or operator is allowed to submit engineering calculations that substantiate vent stream velocity and heat content of a flare in lieu of test data. These calculations are required to be submitted with the facilities' compliance test notification report for approval by the Administrator.
(v) The data from any performance test method used to measure HCN concentrations must be validated using EPA Method 301 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A).
(vi) For compliance with the wastewater free cyanide analysis provisions of table 9 to § 63.1103(g), free cyanide is to be measured according to ASTM D4282-15 or ASTM D7237-18 (both incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).

(a)
General.
The provisions of this section provide calculation and measurement methods for criteria that are required by § 63.1103 to be used to determine applicability of the control requirements for process vents from continuous unit operations. The owner or operator of a process vent is not required to determine the criteria specified for a process vent that is being controlled (including control by flare) in accordance with the applicable weight-percent, TOC concentration, or organic HAP concentration requirement in § 63.1103.
(b)
Sampling sites.
For purposes of determining process vent applicability criteria, the sampling site shall be located as specified in (b)(1) through (4) of this section, as applicable.
(1)
Sampling site location if TRE determination is required.
If the applicability criteria specified in the applicable table of § 63.1103 includes a TRE index value, the sampling site for determining volumetric flow rate, regulated organic HAP concentration, total organic HAP or TOC concentration, heating value, and TRE index value, shall be after the final recovery device (if any recovery devices are present) but prior to the inlet of any control device that is present, and prior to release to the atmosphere.
(2)
Sampling site location if TRE determination is not required.
If the applicability criteria specified in the applicable table of § 63.1103 does not include a TRE index value, the sampling site for determining volumetric flow rate, regulated organic HAP concentration, total organic HAP or TOC concentration, and any other specified parameter shall be at the exit from the unit operation before any control device.
(3)
Sampling site selection method.
Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling site. No traverse site selection method is needed for process vents smaller than 0.10 meter (0.33 foot) in nominal inside diameter.
(4)
Sampling site when a halogen reduction device is used prior to a combustion device.
An owner or operator using a scrubber to reduce the process vent halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 0.45 kilograms per hour (0.99 pound per hour) prior to a combustion
control device in compliance with § 63.1103 (as appropriate) shall determine the halogen atom mass emission rate prior to the combustion device according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.
(c)
Applicability assessment requirements.
The TOC or organic HAP concentrations, process vent volumetric flow rates, process vent heating values, process vent TOC or organic HAP emission rates, halogenated process vent determinations, process vent TRE index values, and engineering assessments for process vent control applicability assessment requirements are to be determined during maximum representative operating conditions for the process, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, or unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions. For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources, carbon black production affected sources, cyanide chemicals manufacturing affected sources, polycarbonate production affected sources, and ethylene production affected sources, operations during periods of malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of an applicability test. For all other affected sources, operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of an applicability test.
(d)
Exceptions.
For a process vent stream that consists of at least one process vent from a batch unit operation manifolded with at least one process vent from a continuous unit operation, the TRE shall be calculated during periods when one or more batch emission episodes are occurring that result in the highest organic HAP emission rate (in the combined vent stream that is being routed to the recovery device) that is achievable during the 6-month period that begins 3 months before and ends 3 months after the TRE calculation, without causing any of the situations described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) to occur.

§ 63.1107
Equipment leaks.
(a) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can reasonably be expected to contain equipment in organic HAP service is presumed to be in organic HAP service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in organic HAP service, it must be determined that the percent organic HAP content can be reasonably expected not to exceed the percent by weight control applicability criteria specified in § 63.1103 for an affected source on an annual average basis. For purposes of determining the percent organic HAP content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used. For purposes of determining the percent organic HAP content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment for the ethylene production affected sources, the following methods shall be used for equipment: For equipment in gas and vapor service, as that term is defined in Subpart UU of this part, shall use Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; for equipment in liquid service, as that term is defined in Subpart UU of this part, shall use a combination of Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, SW-846-8260B (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14); and SW-846-8270D (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), as appropriate.
(b) An owner or operator may use good engineering judgment rather than the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section to determine that the percent organic HAP content does not exceed the percent by weight control applicability criteria specified in § 63.1103 for an affected source. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service, however, the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
(c) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in organic HAP service, the determination can be revised after following the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section, or by documenting that a change in the process or raw materials no longer causes the equipment to be in organic HAP service.
(d) Samples used in determining the percent organic HAP content shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.
(e)
Requirements for pressure relief devices.
For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, except as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section for pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service.

The requirements of paragraphs (a)(3), (6), and (7) of this section apply to all affected sources.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the emission limitations and established parameter ranges of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. However, if a startup, shutdown, malfunction or period of non-operation of one portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to comply with the specific provisions to which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable provisions of this subpart and any of the subparts that are referenced by this subpart during startup, shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-operation.
(2) If equipment leak requirements are referenced by this subpart for a subject source category, such requirements shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, process unit shutdown (as defined in § 63.1101), or non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the equipment leak requirements apply.
(3) For batch unit operations, shutdown does not include the normal periods between batch cycles; and startup does not include the recharging of
batch unit operations, or the transitional conditions due to changes in product.
(4) (i) For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, and beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c) for ethylene production affected sources, specified in § 63.1102(d) for cyanide chemicals manufacturing, and specified in § 63.1102(e) for carbon black production affected sources, the emission limitations and established parameter ranges of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. Equipment leak requirements shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the equipment leak requirements apply.
(ii) At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the affected source.
(5) During startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission standards of this subpart and the subparts referenced by this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions. The measures to be taken shall be identified in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (if applicable), and may include, but are not limited to, air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the affected source. Back-up control devices are not required, but may be used if available. Compliance with an inadequate startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan developed pursuant to § 63.1111 is not a shield for failing to comply with good operation and maintenance requirements.
(6) Malfunctions shall be corrected as soon as practical after their occurrence.
(7) Operation and maintenance requirements established pursuant to section 112 of the Act are enforceable, independent of emissions limitations or other requirements in relevant standards.
(b)
Compliance assessment procedures
—(1)
Parameter monitoring: compliance with operating conditions.
Compliance with the required operating conditions for the monitored control devices or recovery devices may be determined by, but is not limited to, the parameter monitoring data for emission points that are required to perform continuous monitoring. For each excursion, except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall be deemed to have failed to have applied the control in a manner that achieves the required operating conditions.
(i) An excursion that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not a violation.
(ii) Excused excursions are not allowed for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources, polycarbonate production affected sources, and beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c) for ethylene production affected sources, specified in § 63.1102(d) for cyanide chemicals manufacturing affected sources, and specified in § 63.1102(e) for carbon black production affected sources. For all other affected sources, including ethylene production, cyanide chemicals manufacturing, and
carbon black production affected sources, prior to the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c) through (e), an excused excursion, as described in § 63.998(b)(6)(ii), is not a violation.
(2)
Parameter monitoring: Excursions.
An excursion is not a violation in cases where continuous monitoring is required and the excursion does not count toward the number of excused excursions (as described in § 63.998(b)(6)(ii)), if the conditions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section are met, except that the conditions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section do not apply for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources, polycarbonate production affected sources, and beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c) for ethylene production affected sources, specified in § 63.1102(d) for cyanide chemicals manufacturing affected sources, and specified in § 63.1102(e) for carbon black production affected sources. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow or excuse a monitoring parameter excursion caused by any activity that violates other applicable provisions of this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.
(i) During periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction (and the source is operated during such periods in accordance with § 63.1111(a)), or
(ii) During periods of non-operation of the affected source or portion thereof (resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies).
(3)
Operation and maintenance procedures.
Determination of whether acceptable operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator. This information may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan under § 63.1111, if applicable), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the affected source, and alternatives approved as specified in § 63.1113.
(4)

For carbon black production affected sources, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(e), in addition to initial performance test requirements to demonstrate compliance with process vent requirements, subsequent performance tests are required no later than 60 months after the preceding performance test in accordance with the procedures specified in § 63.997(e) for initial performance tests.
(B) For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources, polycarbonate production affected sources, and beginning no later than
the compliance dates specified in § 63.1102(c) for ethylene production affected sources, specified in § 63.1102(d) for cyanide chemicals manufacturing affected sources, and specified in § 63.1102(e) for carbon black production affected sources, performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator or an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(iii)
Operation and maintenance requirements.
The Administrator may determine compliance with the operation and maintenance standards of this subpart by, but not limited to, evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements, including the evaluation of monitoring data, as specified in this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.
(5)
Design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards.
The Administrator may determine compliance with design, equipment, work practice, or operational requirements by, but is not limited to, review of records, inspection of the affected source, and by evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements as specified in this subpart, and in the subparts referenced by this subpart.
(c)
Finding of compliance.
The Administrator may make a finding concerning an affected source's compliance with an emission standard or operating and maintenance requirement as specified in, but not limited to, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, upon obtaining all of the compliance information required by the relevant standard (including the written reports of performance test results, monitoring results, and other information, if applicable) and any information available to the Administrator to determine whether proper operation and maintenance practices are being used. Standards in this subpart and methods of determining compliance are in metric units followed by the equivalents in English units. The Administrator will make findings of compliance with the numerical standards of this subpart using metric units.
(d)
Compliance time.
All terms that define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually), unless specified otherwise in the section or subsection that imposes the requirement, refer to the standard calendar periods.
(1) Notwithstanding time periods specified for completion of required tasks, time periods may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as specified in § 63.1110(h). For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.
(2) When the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified in paragraph (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.
(i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for tasks that must be performed annually; or
(ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which the initial compliance deadline occurs.
(3) In all instances where a provision requires completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the specified period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.

§ 63.1111
Startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
(a)
Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.
Before May 18, 2022, the requirements of this paragraph (a) apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources. On and after May 18, 2022, the requirements of this paragraph (a) apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources, carbon black production affected sources, cyanide chemicals manufacturing affected sources, and polycarbonate production affected sources. On and after July 6, 2023, the requirements of this paragraph (a) apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources, carbon black production affected sources, cyanide chemicals manufacturing affected sources, ethylene production affected sources, and polycarbonate production affected sources.
(1)
Description and purpose of plan.
The owner or operator of an affected source shall develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that describes, in detail, procedures for operating and maintaining the affected source during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. This plan shall also include a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment used to comply with relevant standards under this subpart. The plan shall also address routine or otherwise predictable CPMS malfunctions. This plan shall be developed by the owner or operator by the affected source's compliance date under this subpart. The requirement to develop this plan shall be incorporated into the source's title V permit. This requirement is optional for equipment that must comply with subparts TT or UU under this subpart. It is not optional for equipment equipped with a closed vent system and control device subject to this subpart and subpart SS of this part. The purpose of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) To ensure that owners or operators are prepared to correct malfunctions as soon as practical after their occurrence, in order to minimize excess emissions of regulated organic HAP; and
(ii) To reduce the reporting burden associated with periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (including corrective action taken to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation).
(2) Operation of source. During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart YY shall operate and maintain such affected source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the extent practical. The general duty to minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission levels that would be required by the applicable standard at other times if this is not consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, nor does it require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by this section), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
(3)
Use of additional procedures.
To satisfy the requirements of this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator of an affected source may use the affected source's standard operating procedures (SOP) manual, or an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or other plan, provided the alternative plans meet all the requirements of this section and are made available for inspection when requested by the Administrator.
(4)
Revisions to the plan.
Based on the results of a determination made under § 63.1108(b)(3), the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of an affected source make changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for that source. The Administrator may require reasonable revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan if the Administrator finds that the plan is inadequate as specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section:
(i) Does not address a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event of the CPMS, the air pollution control equipment, or the affected source that has occurred; or
(ii) Fails to provide for the operation of the affected source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the extent practical; or
(iii) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment as quickly as practicable; or
(iv) Does not provide adequate measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions to the extent practical as specified in § 63.1108(a)(5).
(5)
Additional malfunction plan requirements.
If the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan fails to address or inadequately addresses an event that meets the characteristics of a malfunction but was not included in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan at the time the owner or operator developed the plan, the owner or operator shall revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan within 45 days after the event to include detailed procedures for operating and maintaining the affected source during similar malfunction events and a program of corrective action for similar malfunctions of process or air pollution control equipment or CPMS.
(b)
Startup, shutdown, and malfunction reporting requirements.
Before May 18, 2022, the requirements of this paragraph (b) apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources. On and after May 18, 2022, the requirements of this paragraph (b) apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources, carbon black production affected sources, cyanide chemicals manufacturing affected sources, and polycarbonate production affected sources. On and after July 6, 2023, the requirements of this paragraph (b) apply to all affected sources
except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources, carbon black production affected sources, cyanide chemicals manufacturing affected sources, ethylene production affected sources, and polycarbonate production affected sources.
(1)
Periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction reporting requirements.
If actions taken by an owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction of an affected source, or of a control device or monitoring system required for compliance (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) are consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's plan, then the owner or operator shall state such information in a startup, shutdown, and malfunction report. During the reporting period, reports shall only be required for startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions during which excess emissions, as defined in § 63.1108(a)(5), occur during the reporting period. A startup, shutdown, and malfunction report can be submitted as part of a Periodic Report required under § 63.1110(a)(5), or on a more frequent basis if specified otherwise under this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart or as established otherwise by the permitting authority in the affected source's title V permit. The startup, shutdown, and malfunction report shall be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar half (or other calendar reporting period, as appropriate), unless the information is submitted with the Periodic Report. The report shall include the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this section.
(i) The name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official certifying its accuracy.
(ii) The number of startup, shutdown, and malfunction events and the total duration of all periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for the reporting period if the total duration amounts to either of the durations in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. Records of the number of CPMS startup, shutdown, and malfunction events and the total duration of all periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for the reporting period are required under § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section.
(A) Total duration of periods of malfunctioning of a CPMS equal to or greater than 5 percent of that CPMS operating time for the reporting period; or
(B) Total duration of periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for an affected source equal to or greater than 1 percent of that affected source's operating time for the reporting period.
(iii) Records documenting each startup, shutdown and malfunction event as required under § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(F).
(iv) Records documenting the total duration of operating time as required under § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(H).
(2)
Immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports.
Notwithstanding the allowance to reduce the frequency of reporting for startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any time an action taken by an owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) during which excess emissions occur is not consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's plan, the owner or operator shall report the actions taken for that event within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan, followed by a letter delivered or postmarked within 7 working days after the end of the event. The immediate report required under this paragraph shall contain the name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official who is certifying its accuracy, explaining the circumstances of the event, the reasons for not following the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and whether any excess emissions and/or parameter monitoring exceedances are believed to have occurred. Notwithstanding the requirements of the previous sentence, after the effective date of an approved permit program in the State in which an affected source is located, the owner or operator may make alternative reporting arrangements, in advance, with the permitting authority in that State. Procedures governing the arrangement of alternative reporting requirements under this paragraph are specified in § 63.1110(h).
(c)

Extension of compliance, and performance test, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting waivers and alternatives.
(a)
Extension of compliance
—(1)
Extension of compliance with emission standards.
Until an extension of compliance has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to the requirements of this subpart shall comply with all applicable requirements of this subpart.
(2)
Extension of compliance for early reductions and other reductions.
(i)
Early reductions.
Pursuant to section 112(i)(5) of the Act, if the owner or operator of an existing source demonstrates that the source has achieved a reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants in accordance with the provisions of subpart D of this part, the Administrator will grant the owner or operator an extension of compliance with specific requirements of this part, as specified in subpart D of this part.
(ii)
Other reductions.
Pursuant to section 112(i)(6) of the Act, if the owner or operator of an existing source has installed best available control technology (BACT) (as defined in section 169(3) of the Act) or technology required to meet a lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) (as defined in section 171 of the Act) prior to the promulgation of an emission standard in this part applicable to such source and the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) controlled pursuant to the BACT or LAER installation, the Administrator will grant the owner or operator an extension of compliance with such emission standard that will apply until the date 5 years after the date on which such installation was achieved, as determined by the Administrator.
(3)
Request for extension of compliance.
Paragraphs (a)(4) through (7) of this section concern requests for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this part (except requests for an extension of compliance
under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section will be handled through procedures specified in subpart D of this part).
(4)
Requests for extensions of compliance for section 112 standards.
(i)
Section 112(d) standards.
(A) The owner or operator of an existing source who is unable to comply with a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source up to 1 additional year to comply with the standard, if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls. The owner or operator of an affected source who has requested an extension of compliance under this paragraph and who is otherwise required to obtain a title V permit shall apply for such permit or apply to have the source's title V permit revised to incorporate the conditions of the extension of compliance. The conditions of an extension of compliance granted under this paragraph will be incorporated into the affected source's title V permit according to the provisions of part 70 or Federal title V regulations in this chapter (42 U.S.C. 7661), whichever are applicable.
(B) Any request under this paragraph for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate authority not later than 12 months before the affected source's compliance date (as specified in § 63.1102) for sources that are not including emission points in an emissions average, or not later than 18 months before the affected source's compliance date (as specified in § 63.1102) for sources that are including emission points in an emissions average. Emission standards established under this part may specify alternative dates for the submittal of requests for an extension of compliance if alternatives are appropriate for the source categories affected by those standards, e.g., a compliance date specified by the standard is less than 12 (or 18) months after the standard's effective date.
(ii)
Section 112(f) standards.
The owner or operator of an existing source unable to comply with a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source up to 2 years after the standard's effective date to comply with the standard. The Administrator may grant such an extension if he/she finds that such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls and that steps will be taken during the period of the extension to assure that the health of persons will be protected from imminent endangerment. Any request for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this paragraph shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator not later than 15 days after the effective date of the relevant standard.
(5)
Requests for extensions of compliance for BACT or LAER.
The owner or operator of an existing source who has installed BACT or technology required to meet LAER (as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) prior to the promulgation of a relevant emission standard in this part may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source 5 years from the date on which such installation was achieved, as determined by the Administrator, to comply with the standard. Any request for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this paragraph shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator not later than 120 days after the promulgation date of the standard. The Administrator may grant such an extension if he or she finds that the installation of BACT or technology to meet LAER controls the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) that would be controlled at that source by the relevant emission standard.
(6)
Contents of request.
(i) The request for a compliance extension under paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall include the following information:
(A) A description of the controls to be installed to comply with the standard;
(B) A compliance schedule, including the date by which each step toward compliance will be reached. At a minimum, the list of dates shall include:
(
1

(15) [Reserved]
(16)
Administrator's authority.
The granting of an extension under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under section 114 of the Act.
(b)
Waiver of performance tests
—(1)
Applicability of this section.
Until a waiver of a performance testing requirement has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section.
(2)
General.
Individual performance tests may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting the relevant standard(s) on a continuous basis, or the source is being operated under an extension of compliance, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.
(3)
Request to waive a performance test.
(i) If a request is made for an extension of compliance under paragraph (a) of this section, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall accompany the information required for the request for an extension of compliance. If no extension of compliance is requested or if the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall be submitted at least 60 days before the performance test if a site-specific test plan is not submitted.
(ii) If an application for a waiver of a subsequent performance test is made, the application may accompany any required compliance progress report, compliance status report, or excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report, but it shall be submitted at least 60 days before the performance test if a site-specific test plan is not submitted.
(iii) Any application for a waiver of a performance test shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for a waiver, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the affected source performing the required test.
(4)
Approval of request to waive performance test.
The Administrator will approve or deny a request for a waiver of a performance test made under paragraph (b)(3) of this section when he/she—
(i) Approves or denies an extension of compliance under paragraph (a) of this section; or
(ii) Approves or disapproves a site-specific test plan; or
(iii) Makes a determination of compliance following the submission of a required compliance status report or excess emissions and continuous monitoring systems performance report; or

(5)
Administrator's authority.
Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the affected source.
(c)
Use of an alternative monitoring method
—(1)
General.
Until permission to use an alternative monitoring method has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section and the relevant standard.
(2)
Alternatives to monitoring methods.
After receipt and consideration of written application, the Administrator may approve alternatives to any monitoring methods or procedures of this part including, but not limited to, the following:
(i) Alternative monitoring requirements when installation of a CMS specified by a relevant standard would not provide accurate measurements due to liquid water or other interferences caused by substances within the effluent gases;
(ii) Alternative monitoring requirements when the affected source is infrequently operated;
(iii) Alternative monitoring requirements to accommodate CEMS that require additional measurements to correct for stack moisture conditions;
(iv) Alternative locations for installing CMS when the owner or operator can demonstrate that installation at alternate locations will enable accurate and representative measurements;
(v) Alternate methods for converting pollutant concentration measurements to units of the relevant standard;
(vi) Alternate procedures for performing daily checks of zero (low-level) and high-level drift that do not involve use of high-level gases or test cells;
(vii) Alternatives to the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) test methods or sampling procedures specified by any relevant standard;
(viii) Alternative CMS that do not meet the design or performance requirements in this part, but adequately demonstrate a definite and consistent relationship between their measurements and the measurements of opacity by a system complying with the requirements as specified in the relevant standard. The Administrator may require that such demonstration be performed for each affected source; or
(ix) Alternative monitoring requirements when the effluent from a single affected source or the combined effluent from two or more affected sources is released to the atmosphere through more than one point.
(3)
Conflicts between alternative and required methods.
If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative monitoring method, requirement, or procedure, the Administrator may require the use of a method, requirement, or procedure specified in this section or in the relevant standard. If the results of the specified and alternative method, requirement, or procedure do not agree, the results obtained by the specified method, requirement, or procedure shall prevail.
(4)(i)
Request to use alternative monitoring method.
An owner or operator who wishes to use an alternative monitoring method shall submit an application to the Administrator as described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The application may be submitted at any time provided that the monitoring method is not used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard or other requirement. If the alternative monitoring method is to be used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard, the application shall be submitted not later than with the site-specific test plan required, or with the site-specific performance evaluation plan (if requested), or at least 60 days before the performance evaluation is scheduled to begin.
(ii) The application shall contain a description of the proposed alternative monitoring system and a performance evaluation test plan, if required. In addition, the application shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for an alternative monitoring method, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the affected source using the required method.
(iii) The owner or operator may submit the information required in this paragraph well in advance of the submittal dates specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section to ensure a timely review by the Administrator in order to meet the compliance demonstration date specified in this section or the relevant standard.
(5)
Approval of request to use alternative monitoring method.
(i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of approval or intention to deny approval of the request to use an alternative monitoring method within 30 days after receipt of the original request and within 30 days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted. Before disapproving any request to use an alternative monitoring method, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to disapprove the request together with—
(A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended disapproval is based; and
(B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present additional information to the Administrator before final action on the request. At the time the Administrator notifies the applicant of his or her intention to disapprove the request, the Administrator will specify how much time the owner or operator will have after being notified of the intended disapproval to submit the additional information.
(ii) The Administrator may establish general procedures and criteria in a relevant standard to accomplish the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section.
(iii) If the Administrator approves the use of an alternative monitoring method for an affected source under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the owner or operator of such source shall continue to use the alternative monitoring method until he or she receives approval from the Administrator to use another monitoring method as allowed
by this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.
(6)
Alternative to the relative accuracy test.
An alternative to the relative accuracy test for CEMS specified in a relevant standard may be requested as follows:
(i)
Criteria for approval of alternative procedures.
An alternative to the test method for determining relative accuracy is available for affected sources with emission rates demonstrated to be less than 50 percent of the relevant standard. The owner or operator of an affected source may petition the Administrator under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section to substitute the relative accuracy test in section 7 of Performance Specification 2 with the procedures in section 10 if the results of a performance test conducted according to the requirements specified in this subpart or subpart referenced by this subpart demonstrate that the emission rate of the pollutant of interest in the units of the relevant standard is less than 50 percent of the relevant standard. For affected sources subject to emission limitations expressed as control efficiency levels, the owner or operator may petition the Administrator to substitute the relative accuracy test with the procedures in section 10 of Performance Specification 2 if the control device exhaust emission rate is less than 50 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement. The alternative procedures do not apply if the CEMS is used continuously to determine compliance with the relevant standard.
(ii)
Petition to use alternative to relative accuracy test.
The petition to use an alternative to the relative accuracy test shall include a detailed description of the procedures to be applied, the location and the procedure for conducting the alternative, the concentration or response levels of the alternative relative accuracy materials, and the other equipment checks included in the alternative procedure(s). The Administrator will review the petition for completeness and applicability. The Administrator's determination to approve an alternative will depend on the intended use of the CEMS data and may require specifications more stringent than in Performance Specification 2.
(iii)
Rescission of approval to use alternative to relative accuracy test.
The Administrator will review the permission to use an alternative to the CEMS relative accuracy test and may rescind such permission if the CEMS data from a successful completion of the alternative relative accuracy procedure indicate that the affected source's emissions are approaching the level of the relevant standard. The criterion for reviewing the permission is that the collection of CEMS data shows that emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the relevant standard for any averaging period, as specified in the relevant standard. For affected sources subject to emission limitations expressed as control efficiency levels, the criterion for reviewing the permission is that the collection of CEMS data shows that exhaust emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement for any averaging period, as specified in the relevant standard. The owner or operator of the affected source shall maintain records and determine the level of emissions relative to the criterion for permission to use an alternative for relative accuracy testing. If this criterion is exceeded, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 10 days of such occurrence and include a description of the nature and cause of the increased emissions. The Administrator will review the notification and may rescind permission to use an alternative and require the owner or operator to conduct a relative accuracy test of the CEMS as specified in section 7 of Performance Specification 2.
(d)
Waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
(1) Until a waiver of a recordkeeping or reporting requirement has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart and any subparts referenced by this subpart.
(2) Recordkeeping or reporting requirements may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the
affected source is achieving the relevant standard(s), or the source is operating under an extension of compliance, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request. Electronic reporting to the EPA cannot be waived, and as such, compliance with the provisions of this paragraph does not relieve owners or operators of affected facilities of the requirement to submit electronic reports required in this subpart to the EPA.
(3) If an application for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is made, the application shall accompany the request for an extension of compliance under paragraph (a) of this section, any required compliance progress report or compliance status report required under this part or in the source's title V permit, or an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report required under § 63.999(c) or another subpart referenced by this subpart, whichever is applicable. The application shall include whatever information the owner or operator considers useful to convince the Administrator that a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is warranted.
(4) The Administrator will approve or deny a request for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements under this paragraph when he/she—
(i) Approves or denies an extension of compliance under paragraph (a) of this section; or
(ii) Makes a determination of compliance following the submission of a required Notification of Compliance Status report or excess emissions and continuous monitoring systems performance report; or
(iii) Makes a determination of suitable progress towards compliance following the submission of a compliance progress report, whichever is applicable.
(5) A waiver of any recordkeeping or reporting requirement granted under this paragraph may be conditioned on other recordkeeping or reporting requirements deemed necessary by the Administrator.
(6) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the affected source.

§ 63.1113
Procedures for approval of alternative means of emission limitation.
(a)
Alternative means of emission limitation.
An owner or operator of an affected source may request a determination of alternative means of emission limitation to the requirements of design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards of this subpart or of a subpart referenced by this subpart. If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in HAP emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards (but not performance standards) in this subpart, the Administrator will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement.
(1) The notice may condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.
(2) Any such notice shall be published only after public notice and an opportunity for public comment.
(b)
Content of submittal.
(1) In order to obtain approval, any person seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the Administrator information showing that the alternative means achieves equivalent emission reductions. An owner or operator of an affected source seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance who has not previously performed testing shall also submit a proposed test plan. If the owner or operator seeks permission to use an alternative means of compliance based on previously performed testing, they shall submit the results of testing, a description of the procedures followed
in testing or monitoring, and a description of pertinent conditions during testing or monitoring.
(2) The owner or operator who requests an alternative means of emissions limitation shall submit a description of the proposed testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting that will be used and the proposed basis for demonstrating compliance.
(3) For storage vessels, the owner or operator shall include the results of actual emissions tests using full-size or scale-model storage vessels that accurately collect and measure all regulated HAP emissions using a given control technique, and that accurately simulate wind and account for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric pressure, or an engineering analysis that the Administrator determines to be an accurate method of determining equivalence.
(4) For proposed alternatives to equipment leak requirements referenced by this subpart, the owner or operator shall also submit the information specified in and meet the requirements for alternate means of emission limitation specified in the referenced subparts.

# Subpart CCC—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Steel Pickling—HCl Process Facilities and Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration Plants

# Source:
64 FR 33218, June 22, 1999, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.1155
Applicability.
(a) The provisions of this subpart apply to the following facilities and plants that are major sources for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) or are parts of facilities that are major sources for HAP:
(1) All new and existing steel pickling facilities that pickle carbon steel using hydrochloric acid solution that contains 6 percent or more by weight HCl and is at a temperature of 100 °F or higher; and
(2) All new and existing hydrochloric acid regeneration plants.
(3) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to facilities that pickle carbon steel without using hydrochloric
acid, to facilities that pickle only specialty steel, or to acid regeneration plants that regenerate only acids other than hydrochloric acid.
(b) For the purposes of implementing this subpart, the affected sources at a facility or plant subject to this subpart are as follows: Continuous and batch pickling lines, hydrochloric acid regeneration plants, and hydrochloric acid storage vessels.
(c) Table 1 to this subpart specifies the provisions of this part 63, subpart A that apply and those that do not apply to owners and operators of steel pickling facilities and hydrochloric acid regeneration plants subject to this subpart.
(d) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, the owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the owner or operator fails to meet the burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
(1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a standard, the owner or operator must timely meet the reporting requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
(i) The violation was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal and usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design, or better operation and maintenance practices; and did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
(ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when exceeded violation occurred. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
(iii) The frequency, amount, and duration of the violation (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and
(iv) If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
(v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the violation on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and
(vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
(vii) All of the actions in response to the violation were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
(viii) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
(ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
(2)
Report.
The owner of operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. This affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation report or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period).

During the performance test for each emission control device, the owner or operator using a wet scrubber to achieve compliance shall establish site-specific operating parameter values for the minimum scrubber makeup water flow rate and, for scrubbers that operate with recirculation, the minimum recirculation water flow rate. During the emission test, each operating parameter must be monitored continuously and recorded with sufficient frequency to establish a representative average value for that parameter, but no less frequently than once every 15 minutes. The owner or operator shall determine the operating parameter monitoring values as the averages of the values recorded during any of the runs for which results are used to establish the emission concentration or collection efficiency per paragraph (a)(2) of this section. An owner or operator may conduct multiple performance tests to establish alternative compliant operating parameter values. Also, an owner or operator may reestablish compliant operating parameter values as part of any performance test that is conducted subsequent to the initial test or tests.
(c)
Establishment of hydrochloric acid regeneration plant operating parameters.
(1) During the performance test for hydrochloric acid regeneration plants, the owner or operator shall establish site-specific operating parameter values for the minimum process offgas temperature and the maximum proportion of excess air fed to the process as described in § 63.1162(b)(1) of this subpart. During the emission test, each operating parameter must be monitored and recorded with sufficient frequency to establish a representative average value for that parameter, but no less frequently than once every 15 minutes for parameters that are monitored continuously. Amount of iron in the spent pickle liquor shall be determined for each run by sampling the liquor every 15 minutes and analyzing a composite of the samples. The owner or operator shall determine the compliant monitoring values as the averages of the values recorded during any of the runs for which results are used to establish the emission concentration per paragraph (a)(2) of this section. An owner or operator may conduct multiple performance tests to establish alternative compliant operating parameter values. Also, an owner or operator may reestablish compliant operating parameter values as part of any performance test that is conducted subsequent to the initial test or tests.
(2) [Reserved]
(d)
Test methods.
(1) The following test methods in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine compliance under §§ 63.1157(a), 63.1157(b), 63.1158(a), and 63.1158(b) of this subpart:
(i) Method 1, to determine the number and location of sampling points, with the exception that no traverse point shall be within one inch of the stack or duct wall;
(ii) Method 2, to determine gas velocity and volumetric flow rate;
(iii) Method 3, to determine the molecular weight of the stack gas;
(iv) Method 4, to determine the moisture content of the stack gas; and
(v) Method 26A, “Determination of Hydrogen Halide and Halogen Emissions from Stationary Sources—Isokinetic Method,” to determine the HCl mass flows at the inlet and outlet of a control device or the concentration of HCl discharged to the atmosphere, and also to determine the concentration of Cl
2
discharged to the atmosphere from acid regeneration plants. If compliance with a collection
efficiency standard is being demonstrated, inlet and outlet measurements shall be performed simultaneously. The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 60 minutes and the minimum sample volume 0.85 dry standard cubic meters (30 dry standard cubic feet). The concentrations of HCl and Cl
2
shall be calculated for each run as follows:
C
HCl
(ppmv) = 0.659 C
HCl
(mg/dscm),
and C
C12
(ppmv) = 0.339 C
C12
(mg/dscm),
where C(ppmv) is concentration in ppmv and C(mg/dscm) is concentration in milligrams per dry standard cubic meter as calculated by the procedure given in Method 26A.

§ 63.1162
Monitoring requirements.
(a) The owner or operator of a new, reconstructed, or existing steel pickling facility or acid regeneration plant subject to this subpart shall:
(1) Conduct performance tests to measure the HCl mass flows at the control device inlet and outlet or the concentration of HCl exiting the control device according to the procedures described in § 63.1161 of this subpart. Performance tests shall be conducted either annually or according to an alternative schedule that is approved by the applicable permitting authority, but no less frequently than every 2
1/2
years or twice per title V permit term. If any performance test shows that the HCl emission limitation is being exceeded, then the owner or operator is in violation of the emission limit.
(2) In addition to conducting performance tests, if a wet scrubber is used as the emission control device, install, operate, and maintain systems for the measurement and recording of the scrubber makeup water flow rate and, if required, recirculation water flow rate. These flow rates must be monitored continuously and recorded at least once per shift while the scrubber is operating. Operation of the wet scrubber with excursions of scrubber makeup water flow rate and recirculation water flow rate less than the minimum values established during the performance test or tests will require initiation of corrective action as specified by the maintenance requirements in § 63.1160(b)(2) of this subpart.
(3) If an emission control device other than a wet scrubber is used, install, operate, and maintain systems for the measurement and recording of the appropriate operating parameters.
(4) Failure to record each of the operating parameters listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is a violation of the monitoring requirements of this subpart.
(5) Each monitoring device shall be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within 5 percent and shall be calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions but not less frequently than once per year.
(6) The owner or operator may develop and implement alternative monitoring requirements subject to approval by the Administrator.
(b) The owner or operator of a new, reconstructed, or existing acid regeneration plant subject to this subpart shall also install, operate, and maintain systems for the measurement and recording of the:
(1) Process offgas temperature, which shall be monitored continuously and recorded at least once every shift while the facility is operating in production mode; and
(2) Parameters from which proportion of excess air is determined. Proportion of excess air shall be determined by a combination of total air flow rate, fuel flow rate, spent pickle liquor addition rate, and amount of iron in the spent pickle liquor, or by any other combination of parameters approved by the Administrator in accordance with § 63.8(f) of subpart A of this part. Proportion of excess air shall be determined and recorded at least once every shift while the plant is operating in production mode.
(3) Each monitoring device must be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within 5 percent and must be calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions but not less frequently than once per year.
(4) Operation of the plant with the process offgas temperature lower than
the value established during performance testing or with the proportion of excess air greater than the value established during performance testing is a violation of the operational standard specified in § 63.1159(a) of this subpart.
(c) The owner or operator of an affected hydrochloric acid storage vessel shall inspect each vessel semiannually to determine that the closed-vent system and either the air pollution control device or the enclosed loading and unloading line, whichever is applicable, are installed and operating when required.

Where can I find definitions of key words used in this subpart?
The definitions of key words used in this subpart are in the Clean Air Act (Act), in § 63.2 of the general provisions in subpart A of this part, and in § 63.1196 of this subpart.
§ 63.1177
Am I subject to this subpart?
You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an existing, new, or reconstructed mineral wool production facility that is located at a plant site that is a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions, meaning the plant emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAPs at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.

# Standards
§ 63.1178
For cupolas, what standards must I meet?
(a) You must control emissions from each cupola as specified in Table 2 to this subpart.
(b) You must meet the following operating limits for each cupola:
(1) Begin within one hour after the alarm on a bag leak detection system sounds, and complete in a timely manner, corrective actions as specified in your operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan required by § 63.1187 of this subpart.
(2) When the alarm on a bag leak detection system sounds for more than five percent of the total operating time in a six-month reporting period, develop and implement a written quality improvement plan (QIP) consistent with the compliance assurance monitoring requirements of § 64.8(b)-(d) of 40 CFR part 64.
(3) Additionally, on or after the applicable compliance date for each new or reconstructed cupola, you must either:
(i) Maintain the operating temperature of the incinerator so that the average operating temperature for each three-hour block period never falls below the average temperature established during the performance test, or
(ii) Maintain the percent excess oxygen in the cupola at or above the level established during the performance test. You must determine the percent excess oxygen using the following equation:
ER29JY15.000
Where:
Percent excess oxygen = Percentage of excess oxygen present above the stoichiometric balance of 1.00, (%).
1.00 = Ratio of oxygen in a cupola combustion chamber divided by the stoichiometric quantity of oxygen required to obtain complete combustion of fuel.
Oxygen available = Quantity of oxygen introduced into the cupola combustion zone.
Fuel demand for oxygen = Required quantity of oxygen for stoichiometric combustion of the quantity of fuel present.

# Additional Monitoring Information
§ 63.1184
What do I need to know about the design specifications, installation, and operation of a bag leak detection system?
A bag leak detection system must meet the following requirements:
(a) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.
(b) The sensor on the bag leak detection system must provide output of relative PM emissions.
(c) The bag leak detection system must have an alarm that will sound automatically when it detects an increase in relative PM emissions greater than a preset level.
(d) The alarm must be located in an area where appropriate plant personnel will be able to hear it.
(e) For a positive-pressure fabric filter, each compartment or cell must have a bag leak detector. For a negative-pressure or induced-air fabric filter, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter. If multiple bag leak detectors are required (for either type of fabric filter), detectors may share the system instrumentation and alarm.
(f) Each triboelectric bag leak detection system must be installed, operated, adjusted, and maintained so that it follows EPA's “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance” (EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997). Other bag leak detection systems must be installed, operated, adjusted, and maintained so that they follow the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.
(g) At a minimum, initial adjustment of the system must consist of establishing the baseline output in both of the following ways:
(1) Adjust the range and the averaging period of the device.
(2) Establish the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.
(h) After initial adjustment, the range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time may not be adjusted except as specified in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan required by § 63.1187 of this subpart. In no event may the range be increased by more than 100 percent or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 365 day period unless a responsible official as defined in § 63.2 of the general provisions in subpart A of this part certifies in writing to the Administrator that the fabric filter has been inspected and found to be in good operating condition.
§ 63.1185
How do I establish the average operating temperature of an incinerator?
(a) During the performance test, you must establish the average operating temperature of an incinerator as follows:
(1) Continuously measure the operating temperature of the incinerator.
(2) Determine and record the average temperatures in consecutive 15-minute blocks.
(3) Determine and record the arithmetic average of the recorded average temperatures measured in consecutive 15-minute blocks for each of the one-hour performance test runs.
(4) Determine and record the arithmetic average of the three one-hour average temperatures during the performance test runs. The average of the three one-hour performance test runs establishes the temperature level to use to monitor compliance.
(b) To comply with the requirements for maintaining the operating temperature of an incinerator after the performance test, you must measure and record the average operating temperature of the incinerator as required by §§ 63.1182 and 63.1183 of this subpart. This average operating temperature of the incinerator is based on the arithmetic average of the one-hour average temperatures for each consecutive three-hour period and is determined in the same manner described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.
§ 63.1186
How may I change the compliance levels of monitored parameters?
You may change control device and process operating parameter levels established during performance tests and used to monitor compliance if you do the following:
(a) You must notify the Administrator of your desire to expand the range of a control device or process operating parameter level.
(b) Upon approval from the Administrator, you must conduct additional performance tests at the proposed new control device or process operating parameter levels. Before operating at these levels, the performance test results must verify that, at the new levels, you comply with the emission limits in §§ 63.1178 and 63.1179 of this subpart.
§ 63.1187

Pt. 63, Subpt. DDD, App. A

# Appendix A to Subpart DDD of Part 63—Free Formaldehyde Analysis of Insulation Resins by the Hydroxylamine Hydrochloride Method

# 1. Scope
The method in this appendix was specifically developed for water-soluble phenolic resins that have a relatively high free-formaldehyde (FF) content such as insulation resins. It may also be suitable for other phenolic resins, especially those with a high FF content.

# 2. Principle
2.1 a. The basis for this method is the titration of the hydrochloric acid that is liberated when hydroxylamine hydrochloride reacts with formaldehyde to form formaldoxine:
HCHO + NH2OH:HCl → CH2:NOH + H2O + HCl
b. Free formaldehyde in phenolic resins is present as monomeric formaldehyde, hemiformals, polyoxymethylene hemiformals, and polyoxymethylene glycols. Monomeric formaldehyde and hemiformals react rapidly with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, but the polymeric forms of formaldehyde must hydrolyze to the monomeric state before they can react. The greater the concentration of free formaldehyde in a resin, the more of that formaldehyde will be in the polymeric form. The hydrolysis of these polymers is catalyzed by hydrogen ions.
2.2 The resin sample being analyzed must contain enough free formaldehyde so that the initial reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride will produce sufficient hydrogen
ions to catalyze the depolymerization of the polymeric formaldehyde within the time limits of the test method. The sample should contain approximately 0.3 grams (g) free formaldehyde to ensure complete reaction within 5 minutes.

# 3. Apparatus
3.1 Balance, readable to 0.01 g or better.
3.2 pH meter, standardized to pH 4.0 with pH 4.0 buffer and pH 7 with pH 7.0 buffer.
3.3 50-mL burette for 1.0 N sodium hydroxide.
3.4 Magnetic stirrer and stir bars.
3.5 250-mL beaker.
3.6 50-mL graduated cylinder.
3.7 100-mL graduated cylinder.
3.8 Timer.

# 4. Reagents
4.1 Standardized 1.0 N sodium hydroxide solution.
4.2 Hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution, 100 grams per liter, pH adjusted to 4.00.
4.3 Hydrochloric acid solution, 1.0 N and 0.1 N.
4.4 Sodium hydroxide solution, 0.1 N.
4.5 50/50 v/v mixture of distilled water and methyl alcohol.

# 5. Procedure
5.1 Determine the sample size as follows:
a. If the expected FF is greater than 2 percent, go to Part A in 5.1.c to determine sample size.
b. If the expected FF is less than 2 percent, go to Part B in 5.1.d to determine sample size.
c. Part A: Expected FF ≥2 percent.
Grams resin = 60/expected percent FF
I. The following table shows example levels:
Expected percent free formaldehyde
Sample size, grams

30.0
5
12.0
8
7.5
10
6.0

5.0
15
4.0
ii. It is very important to the accuracy of the results that the sample size be chosen correctly. If the milliliters of titrant are less than 15 mL or greater than 30 mL, reestimate the needed sample size and repeat the tests.
d. Part B: Expected FF
2 percent
Grams resin = 30/expected percent FF
I. The following table shows example levels:
Expected percent free formaldehyde
Sample size, grams

30
0.5
60
ii. If the milliliters of titrant are less than 5 mL or greater than 30 mL, reestimate the needed sample size and repeat the tests.
5.2 Weigh the resin sample to the nearest 0.01 grams into a 250-mL beaker. Record sample weight.
5.3 Add 100 mL of the methanol/water mixture and stir on a magnetic stirrer. Confirm that the resin has dissolved.
5.4 Adjust the resin/solvent solution to pH 4.0, using the prestandardized pH meter, 1.0 N hydrochloric acid, 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, and 0.1 N sodium hydroxide.
5.5 Add 50 mL of the hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution, measured with a graduated cylinder. Start the timer.
5.6 Stir for 5 minutes. Titrate to pH 4.0 with standardized 1.0 N sodium hydroxide. Record the milliliters of titrant and the normality.

# 6. Calculations
ER01JN99.018

# 7. Method Precision and Accuracy
Test values should conform to the following statistical precision:
Variance = 0.005
Standard deviation = 0.07
95% Confidence Interval, for a single determination = 0.2
