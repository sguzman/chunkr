§ 52.1323
Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Missouri's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards. Continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980, for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each successive January of Additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued the previous January. New source review permits issued pursuant to section 173 of the Clean Air Act will not be deemed valid by EPA unless the provisions of Section V of the emission offset interpretive rule published on January 16, 1979 (44 FR 3274) are met.
(b) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-2.290 as identified under § 52.1320, paragraph (c)(65), with the understanding that any alternative compliance plans issued under this rule must be approved by EPA as individual SIP revisions. In the absence of such approval, the enforceable requirements of the SIP would be the reduction requirements stated in the rule.
(c) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-2.230 as identified under § 52.1320, paragraph (c)(70), with the understanding that any alternative compliance plans issued under this rule must be approved by EPA as individual SIP revisions. In the absence of such approval, the enforceable requirements of the SIP would be the emission limits stated in the rule.
(d) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-5.340 as identified under § 52.1320, paragraph (c)(71), with the understanding that any alternative compliance plans issued under this rule must be approved as individual SIP revisions. In the absence of such approval, the enforceable requirements of the SIP would be the reduction requirements stated in the rule.
(e) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-5.330 as identified under § 52.1320, paragraph (c)(72), under the following terms, to which the state of Missouri has agreed: Subsections (5)(B)3 and (7)(B) of the rule contain provisions whereby the director of the Missouri Air Pollution Control Program has discretion to establish compliance determination procedures and equivalent alternative emission limits for individual sources. Any such director discretion determinations under this rule must be submitted to EPA for approval as individual SIP revisions. In
the absence of EPA approval, the enforceable requirements of the SIP are the applicable emission limit(s) in subsection (4)(B) and the compliance determination provisions stated in subsection(5)(B)1 or (5)(B)2.
(f) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-6.120 as identified under § 52.1320(c)(76), under the following terms, to which the state of Missouri has agreed. Subparagraph (2)(B)2.B.(IV) contains a provision whereby the Director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources has discretion to approve revisions to the Doe Run Herculaneum work practice manual. Any revisions to the work practice manual, pursuant to this rule, must be submitted to EPA for approval as an individual SIP revision. Thus, any existing federally approved work practices remain in effect, until such time that subsequent revisions are submitted to EPA and approved as SIP revisions.
(g) The Missouri portion of the Kansas City metropolitan area was designated as nonattainment for ozone in 40 CFR part 81. Therefore, the Administrator approves continuation of the 7.8 RVP limit as federally enforceable in the Kansas City metropolitan area, even after the area is redesignated to attainment, because of its nonattainment designation effective January 6, 1992. Also, the requirement for 7.8 psi RVP volatility is deemed necessary to ensure attainment and maintenance of the ozone standard as demonstrated by the emissions inventory projections (based on use of 7.8 psi RVP) in Missouri's ozone maintenance plan for the Kansas City metropolitan area.
(h) Missouri rule 10 CSR 10-6.300 was rescinded on September 15, 2022.
(i) Emission limitations and related provisions which are established in Missouri's operation permits as federally enforceable conditions shall be enforceable by EPA. EPA reserves the right to deem permit conditions not federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to appropriate procedures, and be based upon the permit, permit approval procedures, or permit requirements which do not conform with the operating permit program requirements or the requirements of EPA's underlying regulations.
(j) Missouri rule 10 CSR 10-6.300 was rescinded on September 15, 2022.
(k) The state of Missouri revised 10 CSR 10-2.390 for Kansas City and 10 CSR 10-5.480 for St. Louis to update the transportation conformity requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart T, effective November 14, 1995.
(l) The Administrator conditionally approves Missouri emergency rule 10 CSR 10-2.330 under § 52.1320(c)(98). Full approval is contingent on the state submitting the permanent rule, to the EPA, by November 30, 1997.
(m) The Administrator approves Missouri rule 10 CSR 10-2.330 under § 52.1320(c)(105). This fulfills the requirements of the conditional approval granted effective November 10, 1997, as published on October 9, 1997.
(n) Missouri rule 10 CSR 10-2.330 was rescinded on April 12, 2021.
(o) The Administrator conditionally approves the Missouri SIP revisions that address the requirements of RACT under the 8-hour ozone NAAQS under § 52.1320(c). Full approval is contingent on Missouri submitting RACT rules for inclusion into the Missouri SIP to address the Solvent Cleanup Operations CTG, to the EPA, no later than December 31, 2012.
(p) For the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS:
(1)
Disapproval.
Missouri state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted on June 10, 2019, to address the Clean Air Act (CAA) infrastructure requirements of section 110(a)(2) for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS, is disapproved for section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) (prongs 1 and 2).

national ambient air quality standard by December 31, 2000. This determination is based on air quality monitoring data from 1998, 1999, and 2000.
(c)
Determination of Attainment.
EPA has determined, July 14, 2015, based on quality-assured air monitoring data for 2007-2009 and 2012-2014 ambient air quality data, that the Libby, MT fine particulate matter (PM
2.5
) nonattainment area attained the 1997 annual PM
2.5
national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). Therefore, EPA has met the requirement of CAA section 188(b)(2) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date or as expeditiously as practicable, whether the area attained the 1997 annual PM
2.5
NAAQS. Additionally, this determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual PM
2.5
NAAQS. If EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that this area no longer meets the 1997 annual PM
2.5
NAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.
(d) On August 3, 2016, the State of Montana submitted a maintenance plan for the Missoula PM
10
nonattainment area and requested that this area be redesignated to attainment for the PM
10
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The redesignation request and maintenance plan satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.
(e) On July 23, 2019, the State of Montana submitted limited maintenance plans for the Columbia Falls, Kalispell and Libby PM
10
nonattainment areas and requested that these areas be redesignated to attainment for the PM
10
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The redesignation request and limited maintenance plans satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.
(f) On March 23, 2020, the State of Montana submitted limited maintenance plans for the Butte PM
10
nonattainment areas and requested that this area be redesignated to attainment for the PM

§ 52.1375
Control strategy: Lead.
(a) Determination—EPA has determined that the East Helena Lead nonattainment area has attained the lead national ambient air quality standards through calendar year 1999. This determination is based on air quality data currently in the AIRS database (as of the date of our determination, June 18, 2001).
(b) Redesignation to attainment—The EPA has determined that the East Helena lead (Pb) nonattainment area has met the criteria under CAA section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment for the 1978 Pb NAAQS. The EPA is therefore redesignating the East Helena 1978 Pb nonattainment area to attainment.
(c) Maintenance plan approval—The EPA is approving the maintenance plan for the East Helena nonattainment area for the 1978 Pb NAAQS submitted by the State of Montana on October 28, 2018.

ExxonMobil emission limits and compliance determining methods—
(1)
Introduction.
The provisions for ExxonMobil cover the following units:
(i) The Primary process flare and the Turnaround flare. The Primary process flare is the flare normally used by ExxonMobil. The Turnaround flare is the flare ExxonMobil uses for about 30 to 40 days every 5 to 6 years when the facility's major SO
2
source, the fluid catalytic cracking unit, is not normally operating.
(ii) The following refinery fuel gas combustion units: The FCC CO Boiler, F-2 crude/vacuum heater, F-3 unit, F-3X unit, F-5 unit, F-700 unit, F-201 unit, F-202 unit, F-402 unit, F-551 unit, F-651 unit, standby boiler house (B-8 boiler), and Coker CO Boiler (only when the Yellowstone Energy Limited Partnership (YELP) facility is receiving ExxonMobil Coker unit flue gas or whenever the ExxonMobil Coker is not operating).
(iii) Coker CO Boiler stack.
(2)
Flare requirements—
(i)
Emission limit.
The total combined emissions of SO
2
from the Primary process and Turnaround refinery flares shall not exceed 150.0 pounds per 3-hour period.
(ii)
Compliance determining method.
Compliance with the emission limit in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. If volumetric flow monitoring device(s) installed and concentration monitoring methods used to measure the gas stream to the Primary Process flare cannot measure the gas stream to the Turnaround flare, ExxonMobil may apply to EPA for alternative measures to determine the volumetric flow rate and total sulfur concentration of the gas stream to the Turnaround flare. Before EPA will approve such alternative measures, ExxonMobil must agree that the Turnaround flare will be used only during refinery turnarounds of limited duration and frequency—no more than 60 days once every five (5) years—which restriction shall be considered an enforceable part of this FIP. Such alternative measures may consist of reliable flow estimation parameters to estimate volumetric flow rate and manual sampling of the gas stream to the flare to determine total sulfur concentrations, or such other measures that EPA finds will provide accurate estimations of SO
2
emissions from the Turnaround flare.
(3)
Refinery fuel gas combustion requirements—
(i)
Emission limits.
The applicable emission limits are contained in section 3(A)(1) of ExxonMobil's 2000 exhibit and section 3(B)(2) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit.
(ii)
Compliance determining method.
For the limits referenced in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the compliance determining methods specified in section 4(B) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit shall be followed except when the H
2
S concentration in the refinery fuel gas stream exceeds 1200 ppmv as measured by the H
2
S CEMS required by section 6(B)(3) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit (the H
2
S CEMS.) When such value is exceeded, the following compliance monitoring method shall be employed:
(A) ExxonMobil shall measure the H
2
S concentration in the refinery fuel gas according to the procedures in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section and calculate the emissions according to the equations in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.
(B) Within four (4) hours after the H
2
S CEMS measures an H
2
S concentration in the refinery fuel gas stream greater than 1200 ppmv, ExxonMobil shall initiate sampling of the refinery fuel gas stream at the fuel header on a once-per-hour frequency using length-of-stain detector tubes pursuant to ASTM Method D4810-06, “Standard Test Method for Hydrogen Sulfide in Natural Gas Using Length-of-Stain Detector Tubes” (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (j) of this section) with the appropriate sample tube range. If the results exceed the tube's range, another tube of a higher range must be used until results are in the tube's range. ExxonMobil shall continue to use the length-of-stain detector tube method at this frequency until the H
2
S CEMS measures an H
2
S concentration in the refinery fuel gas stream equal to or less than 1200 ppmv continuously over a 3-hour period.
(C) When the length-of-stain detector tube method is required, SO
2
emissions from refinery fuel gas combustion shall be calculated as follows: the Hourly emissions shall be calculated using equation 1, 3-hour emissions shall be calculated using equation 2, and the Daily emissions shall be calculated using equation 3.
Equation 1: E
H
= K * C
H
* Q
H
Where:
E
H
= Refinery fuel gas combustion hourly emissions in pounds per hour, rounded to the nearest tenth of a pound;
K= 1.688 × 10
−7
in (pounds/standard cubic feet (SCF))/parts per million (ppm);
C
H
= Hourly refinery fuel gas H
2
S concentration in ppm determined by the length-of-stain detector tube method as required by paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; and
Q
H
= actual fuel gas firing rate in standard cubic feet per hour (SCFH), as measured by the monitor required by section 6(B)(8) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit.
Equation 2: (Refinery fuel gas combustion 3-hour emissions) = ∑ (Hourly emissions within the 3-hour period as determined by equation 1).
Equation 3: (Refinery fuel gas combustion daily emissions) = ∑ (3-hour emissions within the day as determined by equation 2).
(4)

When ExxonMobil's Coker unit is operating and Coker unit flue gases are burned in the Coker CO Boiler, the applicable emission limits are contained in section 3(B)(1) of ExxonMobil's 2000 exhibit.
(ii)
Compliance determining method.
(A) Compliance with the emission limits referenced in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section shall be determined by measuring the SO
2
concentration and flow rate in the Coker CO Boiler stack according to the procedures in paragraphs (f)(4)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section and calculating emissions according to the equations in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(D) of this section.
(B) Beginning on May 21, 2008, ExxonMobil shall operate and maintain a CEMS to measure sulfur dioxide concentrations in the Coker CO Boiler stack. Whenever ExxonMobil's Coker unit is operating and Coker unit flue gases are exhausted through the Coker CO Boiler stack, the CEMS shall be operational and shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) concentration measurement per minute, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, and meet the CEMS Performance Specifications contained in section 6(C) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit, except that ExxonMobil shall perform a Cylinder Gas Audit (CGA) or Relative Accuracy Audit (RAA) which meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix F, within eight (8) hours of when the Coker unit flue gases begin exhausting through the Coker CO Boiler stack. ExxonMobil shall perform an annual Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA) on the CEMS and notify EPA in writing of each annual RATA a minimum of 25 working days prior to actual testing.
(C) Beginning on May 21, 2008, ExxonMobil shall operate and maintain a continuous stack flow rate monitor to measure the stack gas flow rates in the Coker CO Boiler stack. Whenever ExxonMobil's Coker unit is operating and Coker unit flue gases are exhausted through the Coker CO Boiler stack, this CEMS shall be operational and shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) flow rate measurement per minute, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, and meet the Stack Gas Flow Rate Monitor Performance Specifications of section 6(D) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit, except that ExxonMobil shall perform an annual Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA) on the CEMS and notify EPA in writing of each annual RATA a minimum of 25 working days prior to actual testing.

Flare compliance determining method.
(1) Compliance with the emission limits in paragraphs (d)(2)(i), (e)(2)(i), (f)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(i) of this section shall be determined by measuring the total sulfur concentration and volumetric flow rate of the gas stream to the flare(s) (corrected to one (1) atmosphere pressure and 68 °F) and using the methods contained in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section. The volumetric flow rate of the gas stream to the flare(s) shall be determined in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (h)(2) of this section and the total sulfur concentration of the gas stream to the flare(s) shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
(2)
Flare flow monitoring:
(i) Within 365 days after receiving EPA approval of the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section, each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section shall install and calibrate, and, thereafter, calibrate, maintain and operate, a continuous flow monitoring system capable of measuring the volumetric flow of the gas stream to the flare(s) in accordance with the specifications contained in paragraphs (h)(2)(iii) through (vi) of this section. The flow monitoring system shall require more than one flow monitoring device or flow measurements at more than one location if one monitor cannot measure the total volumetric flow to each flare.
(ii) Volumetric flow monitors meeting the proposed volumetric flow monitoring specifications below should be able to measure the majority of volumetric flow in the gas streams to the flare. However, in rare events (e.g., upset conditions) the flow to the flare may exceed the range of the monitor. In such cases, or when the volumetric flow monitor or monitors are not working, other methods approved by EPA in
the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rate to the flare, which shall then be used to calculate SO
2
emissions. In quarterly reports, sources shall indicate when these other methods are used.
(iii) The flare gas stream volumetric flow rate shall be measured on an actual wet basis, converted to Standard Conditions, and reported in SCFH. The minimum detectable velocity of the flow monitoring device(s) shall be 0.1 feet per second (fps). The flow monitoring device(s) shall continuously measure the range of flow rates corresponding to velocities from 0.5 to 275 fps and have a manufacturer's specified accuracy of ±5% of the measured flow over the range of 1.0 to 275 fps and ±20% of the measured flow over the range of 0.1 to 1.0 fps. The volumetric flow monitor(s) shall feature automated daily calibrations at low and high ranges. The volumetric flow monitor(s) shall be calibrated annually according to manufacturer's specifications.
(iv) For correcting flow rate to standard conditions (defined as 68 °F and 760 mm, or 29.92 inches, of Hg), temperature and pressure shall be monitored continuously. Temperature and pressure shall be monitored in the same location as volumetric flow, and the temperature and pressure monitors shall be calibrated prior to installation according to manufacturer's specifications and, thereafter, annually to meet accuracy specifications as follows: The temperature monitor shall be calibrated to within ±2.0% at absolute temperature and the pressure monitor shall be calibrated to within ±5.0 mmHg;
(v) The flow monitoring device(s) shall be calibrated prior to installation to demonstrate accuracy of the measured flow to within 5.0% at flow rates equivalent to 30%, 60%, and 90% of monitor full scale.
(vi) Each volumetric flow device shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) flow rate measurement per minute, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, and be installed in a manner and at a location that will allow for accurate measurements of the total volume of the gas stream going to each flare. Each temperature and pressure monitoring device shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) measurement per minute, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, and be installed in a manner that will allow for accurate measurements.
(vii) In addition to the continuous flow monitors, facilities may use flare water seal monitoring devices to determine whether there is flow going to the flare. If used, owners or operators shall install, calibrate, operate, and maintain these devices according to manufacturer's specifications. The devices shall include a continuous monitoring system that:
(A) Monitors the status of the water seal to indicate when flow is going to the flare;
(B) Automatically records the time and duration when flow is going to the flare; and
(C) Verifies that the physical seal has been restored after flow has been sent to the flare.
If the water seal monitoring devices indicate that there is no flow going to the flare, yet the continuous flow monitor is indicating flow, the presumption will be that no flow is going to the flare.
(viii) Each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section, that does not certify that only natural gas or an inert gas is used for both the pilot gas and purge gas, shall determine the volumetric flow of each pilot gas and purge gas stream for which natural gas or inert gas is not used by one of the following methods:
(A) Measure the volumetric flow of the gas using continuous flow monitoring devices on an actual wet basis, converted to Standard Conditions, and reported in SCFH. Each flow monitoring device shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) flow rate measurement per minute, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, and be installed in a manner and at a location that will allow for accurate measurements of the total volume of the gas.
Gas flow rate monitor accuracy determinations shall be required at least once every 48 months or more frequently at routine refinery turn-around. In cases when the flow monitoring device or devices are not working or the range of the monitoring device(s) is exceeded, other methods approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall be used to determine volumetric flow of the gas which shall then be used to calculate SO
2
emissions. In quarterly reports, sources shall indicate when other methods are used; or
(B) Use parameters and methods approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section to calculate the volumetric flows of the gas, in SCFH.
(3)
Flare concentration monitoring:
(i) Within 365 days after receiving EPA approval of the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section, each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section shall determine the total sulfur concentration of the gas stream to the flare(s) using either continuous total sulfur analyzers or grab or integrated sampling with lab analysis, as described in the following paragraphs:
(A) Continuous total sulfur concentration monitoring. If a facility chooses to use continuous total sulfur concentration monitoring, the following requirements apply:
(
1
) The facility shall install and calibrate, and, thereafter, calibrate, maintain and operate, a continuous total sulfur concentration monitoring system capable of measuring the total sulfur concentration of the gas stream to each flare. Continuous monitoring shall occur at a location or locations that are representative of the gas combusted in the flare and be capable of measuring the normally expected range of total sulfur in the gas stream to the flare. The concentration monitoring system shall require more than one concentration monitoring device or concentration measurements at more than one location if one monitor cannot measure the total sulfur concentration to each flare. Total sulfur concentration shall be reported as H
2
S or SO
2
in ppm. In cases when the total sulfur analyzer or analyzers are not working or the concentration of the total sulfur exceeds the range of the analyzer(s), other methods, approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section, shall be used to determine total sulfur concentrations, which shall then be used to calculate SO
2
emissions. In quarterly reports, sources shall indicate when these other methods are used.
(
2
) The total sulfur analyzer(s) shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) concentration measurement per 15 minutes, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, be installed, certified (on a concentration basis), and operated in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 5, and be subject to and meet the quality assurance and quality control requirements (on a concentration basis) of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix F.
(
3
) Each affected facility named in paragraph (a) of this section shall notify the Air Program Contact at EPA's Montana Operations Office, Federal Building, 10 West 15th Street, Suite 3200, Helena, MT 59626, in writing of each Relative Accuracy Test Audit a minimum of 25 working days prior to the actual testing.
(B) Grab or integrated total sulfur concentration monitoring: If a facility chooses grab or integrated sampling instead of continuous total sulfur concentration monitoring, the facility shall comply with the methods specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) (“Grab Sampling”) or (h)(3)(B)(i)(B)(
2
) (“Integrated Sampling”), and the requirements of paragraphs (h)(3)(i)(B)(
3
) (“Sample Analysis”), (h)(3)(i)(B)(
4
) (“Exemptions”), and (h)(3)(i)(B)(
5
) (“Missing or Unanalyzed Sample”) of this section, as follows:
(
1
)
Grab Sampling.
Each facility that chooses to use grab sampling shall meet the following requirements: if the flow rate of the gas stream to the flare in any consecutive 15-minute period continuously exceeds 0.5 feet per second (fps) and the water seal monitoring device, if any, indicates that flow is going to the flare, a grab sample shall be collected within 15 minutes. The
grab sample shall be collected at a location that is representative of the gas combusted in the flare. Thereafter, the sampling frequency shall be one (1) grab sample every three (3) hours, which shall continue until the velocity of the gas stream going to the flare in any consecutive 15-minute period is continuously 0.5 fps or less. Samples shall be analyzed according to paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section. The requirements of this paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) shall apply to each flare at a facility for which the sampling threshold is exceeded.
(
2
)
Integrated Sampling.
Each facility that chooses to use integrated sampling shall meet the following requirements: if the flow rate of the gas stream to the flare in any consecutive 15-minute period continuously exceeds 0.5 feet per second (fps) and the water seal monitoring device, if any, indicates that flow is going to the flare, a sample shall be collected within 15 minutes. The sample shall be collected at a location that is representative of the gas combusted in the flare. The sampling frequency, thereafter, shall be a minimum of one (1) aliquot for each 15-minute period until the sample container is full, or until the end of a 3-hour period is reached, whichever comes sooner. Within 30 minutes thereafter, a new sample container shall be placed in service, and sampling on this frequency, and in this manner, shall continue until the velocity of the gas stream going to the flare in any consecutive 15-minute period is continuously 0.5 fps or less. Samples shall be analyzed according to paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section. The requirements of this paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(
2
) shall apply to each flare at a facility for which the sampling threshold is exceeded.
(
3
) Samples shall be analyzed using ASTM Method D4468-85 (Reapproved 2000) “Standard Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and Rateometric Colorimetry,” (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (j) of this section) ASTM Method D5504-01 (Reapproved 2006) “Standard Test Method for Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence,” (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (j) of this section) or 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A-5, Method 15A “Determination of Total Reduced Sulfur Emissions From the Sulfur Recovery Plants in Petroleum Refineries.” Total sulfur concentration shall be reported as H
2
S or SO
2
in ppm.
(
4
)
Exemptions.
For facilities using a sampling method specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) (“Grab Sampling”) or (h)(3)(i)(B)(
2
) (“Integrated Sampling”) of this section, obtaining a sample is not required if flaring is a result of a catastrophic or other unusual event, including a major fire or an explosion at the facility, such that collecting a sample at the EPA-approved location during the relevant period is infeasible or constitutes a safety hazard, provided that the owner or operator shall collect a sample at an alternative location if feasible, safe, and representative of the flaring event. The owner or operator shall demonstrate to EPA that it was infeasible or unsafe to collect a sample or to collect a sample at the sampling location approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section. The owner or operator shall also demonstrate to EPA that any sample collected at an alternative location is representative of the flaring incident. If a facility experiences ongoing difficulties collecting grab or integrated samples in accordance with its flare monitoring plan approved by EPA pursuant to paragraph (h)(5) of this section, EPA may require the facility to revise its flare monitoring plan and use continuous total sulfur concentration monitoring as described in paragraph (h)(3)(i)(A) of this section or other reliable method to determine total sulfur concentrations of the gas stream to the flare.
(
5
)
Missing or Unanalyzed Samples.
For facilities using a sampling method specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) (“Grab Sampling”) or (h)(3)(i)(B)(
2
) (“Integrated Sampling”) of this section, if a required sample is not obtained or analyzed for any reason, other methods approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall be used to determine total sulfur concentrations, which shall then be used
to calculate SO
2
emissions. In quarterly reports, sources shall indicate when these other methods are used.
(
6
)
Reporting.
For facilities using a sampling method specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) (“Grab Sampling”) or (h)(3)(i)(B)(
2
) (“Integrated Sampling”) of this section, since normally only one (1) sample per flare will be analyzed for a 3-hour period, the total sulfur concentration of a sample obtained during a given 3-hour period shall be substituted for each hour of such 3-hour period. If integrated sampling for a flare produces more than one (1) sample container during a 3-hour period, and the gas in each container is analyzed separately, the concentrations for the containers shall be averaged. For that flare, the resulting average shall be substituted for each hour of the 3-hour period during which the sampling occurred. The substituted hourly total sulfur concentrations determined per this paragraph shall be used to determine hourly emissions from the flare.
(ii) Each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section that does not certify that only natural gas or an inert gas is used for both the pilot gas and purge gas shall determine the H
2
S concentration of each pilot gas and purge gas stream for which natural gas or inert gas is not used by one of the following methods:
(A) Measure the H
2
S concentration of the gas by continuous H
2
S analyzer. The H
2
S concentration analyzer(s) shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) concentration measurement per three (3) minutes, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, be installed, certified (on a concentration basis), and operated in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2, and be subject to and meet the quality assurance and quality control requirements (on a concentration basis) of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix F. In cases where the H
2
S analyzer or analyzers are not working or the H
2
S concentration exceeds the range of the analyzer(s), other methods approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall be used to determine the H
2
S concentration of the gas, which shall then be used to calculate SO
2
emissions. In quarterly reports, sources shall indicate when other methods are used; or
(B) Use methods approved by EPA as part of the facility's flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section to estimate the H
2
S concentration of the gas.
(4)
Calculation of SO
2
emissions from flares.
Methods for calculating hourly and 3-hour SO
2
emissions from flares shall be submitted to EPA as part of the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section. Following approval by EPA, such methods shall be followed for calculating hourly and 3-hour SO

PM

State implementation plan development in group II areas.
The state of Nebraska committed to conform to the PM
10
regulations as set forth in 40 CFR part 51. In a letter to Morris Kay, EPA, dated February 5, 1988, Mr. Dennis Grams, Director, Nebraska Department of Environmental Control, stated:
(a) An area in the City of Omaha and the area in and around the Village of Weeping Water have been classified as Group II areas for the purpose of PM
10
State Implementation Plan (SIP) development. The specific boundaries of these areas are identified in our letter of October 6, 1987, to Carl Walter. In accordance with the requirements for PM
10
SIP development, the State of Nebraska commits to perform the following PM
10
monitoring and SIP development activities for these Group II areas:
(1) Gather ambient PM
10
data, at least to the extent consistent with minimum EPA requirements and guidance.
(2) Analyze and verify the ambient PM
10
data and report 24-hour exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for PM
10
to the Regional Office within 45 days of each exceedance.
(3) When an appropriate number of verifiable exceedances of the 24-hour standard occur, calculated according to section 2.0 of the PM
10
SIP Development Guideline, or when an exceedance of the annual PM
10
standard occurs, acknowledge that a nonattainment problem exists and immediately notify the Regional Office.
(4) Within 30 days of the notification referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, or within 37 months of promulgation of the PM
10
standards, whichever comes first, determine whether measures in the existing SIP will assure timely attainment and maintenance of the PM
10
standards and immediately notify the Regional Office.
(5) Within 6 months of the notification referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, adopt and submit to EPA a PM
10
control strategy that assures attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than 3 years from approval of the committal SIP.
An emission inventory will be compiled for the identified Group II areas. If either area is found to be violating the PM
10
standards, the inventory will be completed as part of the PM
10
SIP for that area on a schedule consistent with that outlined in paragraphs 3, 4, and 5. If the PM
10
standards are not violated, the inventory will be completed not later than July 1, 1989, and submitted to EPA not later than August 31, 1990, as part of the determination of adequacy of the current SIP to attain and maintain the PM
10
air quality standards.
(b) We request that the total suspended particulate nonattainment areas in Omaha and Weeping Water (all
secondary nonattainment) and Louisville (Primary nonattainment) be redesignated to unclassifiable.
[54 FR 21063, May 16, 1989]
§ 52.1424
Operating permits.
Emission limitations and related provisions which are established in Nebraska operating permits as Federally enforceable conditions shall be enforceable by EPA. The EPA reserves the right to deem permit conditions not Federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to appropriate procedures and be based upon the permit, permit approval procedures, or permit requirement which do not conform with the operating permit program requirements or the requirements of EPA underlying regulations.

The organization of this table generally follows from the organization of the State of Nevada's original 1972 SIP, which was divided into 12 sections. Nonattainment and maintenance plans, among other types of plans, are listed under Section 5 (Control Strategy). Lead SIPs and Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance SIPs are listed after Section 12 followed by nonregulatory or quasi-regulatory statutory provisions approved into the SIP. Regulatory statutory provisions are listed in 40 CFR 52.1470(c).

§ 52.1473
General requirements.
(a) The requirements of § 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met in Washoe County, since the plan does not provide procedures for making emission data, as correlated with allowable emissions, available to the public. In addition, Chapter 020.065 of the “Air Pollution Control Regulations” of the District Board of Health of Washoe County in the Northwest Nevada Intrastate Region is disapproved since it contains provisions which restrict the public availability of emission data as correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures.
(b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable plan.
(2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions
from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31.
(3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
(4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

§ 52.1475
[Reserved]
§ 52.1476
Control strategy: Particulate matter.
(a) [Reserved]
(b) The following rule and portions of the control strategy are disapproved since they do not provide the degree of control needed to attain and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter.
(1) NAQR Article 7.2.7,
Particulate Matter;
Table 4.2,
Emissions Inventory Summary for Particulates
and Table 5.2,
Summary of Control Strategy Analysis for Particulates,
from the Nevada Control Strategy, submitted on October 7, 1976.
(c) The following rules are disapproved because they relax the emission limitation on particulate matter.
(1) Clark County District Board of Health, Table 27.1, (Particulate Matter from Process Matter), submitted on July 24, 1979.
(2) Nevada Air Quality Regulations, Article 4, Rule 4.34, (Visible Emission from Stationary Sources), submitted on December 29, 1978, and Rule 4.3.6, (Visible Emission from Stationary Sources), submitted on June 24, 1980.

§ 52.1477
Nevada air pollution emergency plan.
Section 6.1.5 of the Emergency Episode Plan submitted on December 29, 1978 is disapproved since termination of the episode is left to the discretion of the Control Officer and not specified criteria and it does not meet the requirements of 40 CFR 51.16 and Appendix L. The old rule 6.1.5 submitted on January 28, 1972 is retained.
[45 FR 46385, July 10, 1980]

[61 FR 57333, Nov. 6, 1996]
§ 52.1479
Source surveillance.
(a) The requirements of § 51.211 of this chapter are not met, except in Clark County, since the plan does not provide adequate legally enforceable procedures for requiring owners or operators of stationary sources to maintain records of, and periodically report, information on the nature and amount of emissions.
(b) The requirements of § 51.214 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not provide adequate legally enforceable procedures to require stationary sources subject to emission standards to submit information relating to emissions and operation of the emission monitors to the State as specified in Appendix P of part 51.
[37 FR 10878, May 31, 1972, as amended at 38 FR 12709, May 14, 1973; 40 FR 55331, Nov. 28, 1975; 43 FR 36933, Aug. 21, 1978; 51 FR 40677, Nov. 7, 1986]

§ 52.1484
[Reserved]
§ 52.1485
Significant deterioration of air quality.
(a) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air Act are not met, since the plan, except as it applies to the Clark County Health District, does not include approvable procedures for preventing the significant deterioration of air quality.
(b) Regulation for preventing significant deterioration of air quality. The provisions of § 52.21 except paragraph (a)(1) are incorporated and made a part of the applicable State plan for the State of Nevada except for that portion applicable to the Clark County Health District.
(c) All applications and other information required pursuant to § 52.21 from sources located in the jurisdiction of the State of Nevada shall be submitted to the Director, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, 201 South Fall Street, Carson City, Nevada instead of the EPA Region 9 Office.

§ 52.1486
Control strategy: Hydrocarbons and ozone.
(a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since the plan does not provide for the attainment and maintenance of the national standard for ozone in the Las Vegas Intrastate Region (§ 81.80 of this chapter).
[45 FR 67347, Oct. 10, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 40676, Nov. 7, 1986]
§ 52.1487
Public hearings.
(a) The requirements of § 51.102 (a) and (e) of this chapter are not met since NAQR, Article 2.11.4.2 allows variances (compliance schedules), to be renewed without a public hearing, thus allowing further postponement of the final compliance date for sources whose emissions contribute to violations of the national standards. Therefore, NAQR, Article 2.11.4.2 is disapproved.
[43 FR 1343, Jan. 24, 1978, as amended at 51 FR 40675, Nov. 7, 1986]
§ 52.1488
Visibility protection.
(a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met, because the plan does not include approvable procedures for protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.
(b) Regulation for visibility monitoring and new source review. The provisions of § 52.28 are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable plan for the State of Nevada except for that portion applicable to the Clark County Department of Air Quality and Environmental Management.

§ 52.1528
Control strategy: Carbon monoxide.
(a) Approval—On February 1, 1999, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services submitted a revision to the State Implementation Plan to remove the Nashua Inspection/Maintenance program for carbon monoxide that ceased operating on January 1, 1995. The Nashua Inspection/Maintenance was originally approved at § 52.1520(c)(39). The Nashua Inspection/Maintenance program was replaced with controls consisting of the existing federal Tier 1 emission standards for new vehicles and the federal reformulated gasoline program.
(b) Approval—On February 2, 1999, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services submitted a request to redesignate the City of Manchester carbon monoxide nonattainment area to attainment for carbon monoxide. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1990 attainment year) emission inventory for carbon monoxide, a demonstration of maintenance of the carbon monoxide NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2010 for carbon monoxide, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit additional information in eight years acknowledging that the maintenance plan will remain in effect through the year 2020, as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the carbon monoxide NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), New Hampshire will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measures includes the enhanced safety inspection program and New Hampshire's low emission vehicle program (NLEV) as
contingency measures. The redesignation request establishes a motor vehicle emissions budget of 55.83 tons per day for carbon monoxide to be used in determining transportation conformity for the Manchester area. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively.
(c) Approval—On February 2, 1999, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services submitted a request to redesignate the City of Nashua carbon monoxide nonattainment area to attainment for carbon monoxide. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1990 attainment year) emission inventory for carbon monoxide, a demonstration of maintenance of the carbon monoxide NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2010 for carbon monoxide, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit additional information in eight years acknowledging that the maintenance plan will remain in effect through the year 2020, as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the carbon monoxide NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), New Hampshire will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measures includes the enhanced safety inspection program and New Hampshire's low emission vehicle program (NLEV) as contingency measures. The redesignation request establishes a motor vehicle emissions budget of 60.13 tons per day for carbon monoxide to be used in determining transportation conformity for the Nashua area. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively.
(d) Approval—On May 30, 2007, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services submitted a modification to the Nashua maintenance plan approved in paragraph (c) of this section. New Hampshire will not conduct CO monitoring in Nashua, but instead commits to continue to collect and review CO monitoring data from nearby Manchester, NH on an on-going basis. In the event the second highest CO concentration in any calendar year monitored in Manchester reaches 75 percent of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour national ambient air quality standard for CO, New Hampshire will, within 9 months of recording such concentrations, re-establish a CO monitoring site in Nashua consistent with EPA siting criteria, and resume analyzing and reporting those data. New Hampshire commits to implement its contingency program in Nashua in the event that a CO violation is monitored at the re-established Nashua monitoring site at any time during the maintenance period. If the Manchester CO monitor measures a violation of the either the federal 1-hour or 8-hour NAAQS for CO, contingency measures will be implemented in Nashua as well, until a re-established CO monitor in Nashua shows that the area is in attainment of the CO standard.
(e) Approval—On August 1, 2012, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services submitted modifications to the Manchester and Nashua maintenance plans approved in paragraph (b) and (c) respectively of this section. The Manchester and Nashua current carbon monoxide maintenance plans are both converted to limited maintenance plans for the remainder of their second-ten year maintenance periods which terminate on January 29, 2021. Future carbon monoxide transportation conformity evaluations for Manchester and Nashua will for the length of their limited maintenance plans be considered to satisfy the regional emissions analysis and “budget test” requirements. In addition, New Hampshire will no longer conduct CO monitoring in Manchester, New Hampshire as addressed in paragraph (d) of this section. The Manchester monitoring site is replaced with the Londonderry Moose Hill station in Londonderry, New Hampshire with triggers to reestablish CO monitoring sites in
Manchester and Nashua if elevated CO levels are recorded in Londonderry.

) to be used in transportation conformity in the New Hampshire portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area.
(c)
Determination of Attainment.
Effective March 18, 2008, EPA is determining that the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.
(d) Approval—Revision to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services on May 28, 2008. This revision establishes Year 2009 motor vehicle emission budgets of 15.31 tons per summer day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 28.53 tons per summer day of nitrogen oxides (NO
X
) to be used in transportation conformity in the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.
(e) Determination of Attainment. Effective April 18, 2011, EPA is determining that the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard based on 2007-2009 monitoring data. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (
see
40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply. In addition, this area met its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 1997 ozone standard.
(f)
Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard.
Effective June 28, 2012, EPA is determining that the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, by the area's applicable attainment date of November 15, 2007, based on 2005-2007 complete, certified, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area.
(g)
Determination of Attainment.
Effective November 29, 2012, EPA is determining that the Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, by the area's applicable attainment date of November 15, 1999, based on 1997-1999 complete, certified, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area. Separate from and independent of this determination, EPA is determining that the Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester serious one-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the one-hour ozone standard since 1999 and continues to attain based on complete, quality-assured data ozone monitoring data through 2011.

§ 52.1576
Determinations of attainment.
(a) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2008 to 2010, EPA determined that Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area (the Philadelphia Area) attained the 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of June 15, 2011. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Philadelphia Area nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).
(b) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2007 to 2009, EPA determined that the Philadelphia-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE fine particle (PM
2.5
) nonattainment area attained the 1997 annual PM
2.5
National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of April 5, 2010. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 179(c) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Philadelphia-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE PM
2.5
nonattainment area is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 179(d).
(c) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the three-year period 2005 to 2007, EPA determined, as of June 18, 2012, that the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) one-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet its applicable one-hour ozone attainment date of November 15, 2007. Separate from and independent of this determination, based on 2008-2010 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area, and data for 2011, EPA determined, as of June 18, 2012, that the NY-NJ-CT one-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the one-hour ozone standard.
(d) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2013 to 2015, Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE marginal ozone nonattainment area has attained the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of July 20, 2016. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE marginal ozone nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date pursuant to section 181(b)(2)(A).
(e) EPA has determined, as of August 21, 2019, that the Warren County Nonattainment Area has attained the 3-hour, 24-hour, and annual 1971 sulfur dioxide national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). This determination (informally known as a Clean Data Determination) is based on air quality monitoring data, air quality dispersion modeling information, and other supporting information. This determination suspends the requirements for the State to submit a reasonable further progress plan, attainment demonstration, contingency measures and any other plan elements relating to attainment of the 3-hour, 24-hour, and annual
1971 SO
2
NAAQS for as long as the area continues to meet each NAAQS.

§ 52.1577
Compliance schedules.
(a) [Reserved]
(b) The requirements of § 51.261 of this chapter are not met since Chapter 7, section 7.1(c) of New Jersey's “Air Pollution Control Code” permits certain sources to defer compliance with Chapter 7 until after the required date for attainment of the national standards for particulate matter.
(c) The requirements of § 51.262(a) of this chapter are not met since Chapter 7 of New Jersey's “Air Pollution Control Code” does not provide for periodic increments of progress toward compliance for those sources with compliance schedules extending over a period of 18 or more months.
(d)
Regulation for increments of progress.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner or operator of any stationary source in the State of New Jersey to which an exception extending beyond January 31, 1974, is applicable under Chapter 7, section 7.1(c) of the New Jersey Air Pollution Control Code shall, no later than 120 days following the effective date of this paragraph, submit to the Administrator for approval, a proposed compliance schedule that demonstrates compliance with the emission limitations prescribed by Chapter 7 of the New Jersey Air Pollution Control Code as expeditiously as practicable but no later than July 31, 1975. The compliance schedule shall provide for periodic increments of progress towards compliance. The dates for achievement of such increments shall be specified. Increments of progress shall include, but not be limited to: Submittal of the final control plan to the Administrator; letting of necessary contracts for construction or process changes or issuance of orders for the purchase of component parts to accomplish emission control or process modification; initiation of onsite construction or installation of emission control equipment or process change; completion of onsite construction or installation of emission control equipment or process modification; and final compliance.
(2) Where any such owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that compliance with the applicable regulations will be achieved on or before January 31, 1974, no compliance schedule shall be required.
(3) Any owner or operator required to submit a compliance schedule pursuant to this paragraph shall within 5 days after the deadline for each increment of progress, certify to the Administrator whether or not the required increment of the approved compliance schedule has been met.
(4) Any compliance schedule adopted by the State and approved by the Administrator shall satisfy the requirements of this paragraph for the affected source.

Review of new sources and modifications.
(a) Subchapter 18 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled, “Control and Prohibitions of Air Pollution from Ambient Air Quality in Nonattainment Areas (Emission Offset Rule),” N.J.A.C. 7:27-18.1
et seq.,
as submitted to EPA on August 5, 1980 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, is approved for the entire State of New Jersey, with the following provisions:
(1) The definition of “significant emission increase” as it appears in section 7:27-18.1, entitled, “Definitions,” is disapproved. The following definition of “significant emission increase” is applicable: “An increase, since December 21, 1976, in the rate of allowable emissions, including fugitive pollutant emissions, at a facility of any criteria pollutant greater than or equal to 50 tons per year, 1,000 pounds per day, or 100 pounds per hour, not including decreases in the rates of allowable emissions except where such decreases are contemporaneous with emission increases. The increase in the rates of allowable emissions shall be the cumulative total of increases from all new or altered equipment for which permits
have been issued on or after December 21, 1976 and for which permit applications have been received by the Department, and the fugitive emissions associated with that equipment. The hourly and daily rates shall apply only with respect to a pollutant for which a national ambient air quality standard for a period not exceeding 24 hours has been established.
(2) Subsection (e)(1) under section 7:27-18.2, entitled, “General Provisions,” is disapproved and replaced with the following: “The requirements of paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section shall again become applicable when proposed new construction or alterations at the facility would cause the increase in the rate of allowable emissions of that criteria pollutant to again exceed 50 tons per year, 1,000 pounds per day, or 100 pounds per hour whichever is most restrictive. The accumulation of increases in the rate of allowable emissions shall resume from zero after each application of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.”

§ 52.1580
Conditional approval.
(a)
Enhanced inspection and maintenance.
(1) The State of New Jersey's March 27, 1996 submittal for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, as amended on November 27, 1996 and April 22, 1997, is conditionally approved based on certain contingencies, for an interim period to last 18 months. If New Jersey fails to start its program by November 15, 1997, the interim approval granted under the provisions of the NHSDA, which EPA believes allows the State to take full credit in its 15 percent plan for all of the emission reduction credits in its proposal, will convert to a disapproval after a finding letter is sent to the State by EPA. If the State fails to submit to EPA the final modeling demonstrating that its program will meet the relevant enhanced I/M performance standard by February 1, 1998, the conditional approval will automatically convert to a disapproval as explained under Section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act.
(2) In addition to the above condition, the State must correct eight minor, or de minimis, deficiencies related to the CAA requirements for enhanced I/M. The minor deficiencies are listed in EPA's conditional interim final rulemaking on New Jersey's motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program published on May 14, 1997. Although satisfaction of these deficiencies does not affect the conditional interim approval status of the State's rulemaking, these deficiencies must be corrected in the final I/M SIP revision to be submitted at the end of the 18-month interim period.
(3) EPA is also approving this SIP revision under Section 110(k), for its strengthening effect on the plan.

Control strategy: Carbon monoxide.
(a) Approval—The September 28, 1995 revision to the carbon monoxide state implementation plan for Camden County and the Nine not-classified areas (the city of Trenton, the City of Burlington, the Borough of Penns Grove (part), the Borough of Freehold, the City of Morristown, the City of Perth Amboy, the City of Toms River, the Borough of Somerville, and the City of Atlantic City). This revision included a maintenance plan which demonstrated continued attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for carbon monoxide through the year 2007.
(b) The base year carbon monoxide emission inventory requirement of section 187(a)(1) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments has been satisfied for the entire State. The inventory was submitted on November 15, 1992 and amended on September 28, 1995 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection as a revision to the carbon monoxide State Implementation Plan.
(c) Approval—The November 15, 1992, October 4, 1993, and August 7, 1998 revisions to the carbon monoxide state implementation plan for the New Jersey portion of the New York—Northern

Finally, the State must transmit any relevant additional material EPA may request, and it must notify the public of an approved set of emission limits at the time it transmits notice of those limits to EPA.
(2) Emission limitations required by subsections 16.5(a), 16.6(a) and 16.6(b) are applicable requirements of the New Jersey SIP for the purposes of section 113 of the Clean Air Act and shall be enforceable by EPA and by citizens in the same manner as other requirements of the SIP; except that emission limitations adopted by the State under and which comply with subsections 16.6(c) (4) and (5) shall be the applicable requirements of the New Jersey SIP in lieu of those contained in subsections 16.5(a), 16.6(a) and 16.6(b) and shall be enforceable by EPA and by citizens, if the State meets the requirements set out in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(3) Although EPA approves the variance provisions in subchapter 7:27-16.9 and 7:27-16.10, in order to be considered as part of the SIP, each variance issued under these provisions must be submitted to and approved by EPA as a SIP revision.
(4) The December 17, 1979 version of Subchapter 16 is approved as a part of the SIP only to the extent that it addresses compliance dates for Group I Control Techniques Guideline source categories.
(b) Subchapter 17 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled “Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Toxic Substances,” N.J.A.C. 7:27-17.1 et seq. as revised on October 17, 1979 and effective December 17, 1979, is approved for the regulation of perchloroethylene dry cleaners, as further clarified in a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection memorandum “Subchapter 17 Requirements for Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning Systems” dated October 25, 1982.
(c) The November 15, 1993 SIP revision submitted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy demonstrates the fulfillment of section 182(b)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act for states to adopt RACT regulations for all sources for which EPA has issued a CTG before enactment of the 1990 Clean Air Act.
(d)(1) The base year ozone precursor emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments has been satisfied for the Atlantic City, New York/ Northern New Jersey/Long Island, Philadelphia/Wilmington/ Trenton, and Allentown/Bethlehem/Easton areas of New Jersey. The inventory was submitted on November 15, 1993 and amended on November 21, 1994 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection as a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP). Revisions to the 1990 base year emission inventory dated December 31, 1996 for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas of New Jersey have been approved. Revisions to the 1990 base year emission inventory dated February 10, 1999 for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas of New Jersey have been approved.

(l)
Attainment Determination.
EPA is determining that the 1-hour ozone nonattainment areas in New Jersey listed below have attained the 1-hour ozone standard on the date listed and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) (contingency measures) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to these areas.
(1) Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton (consisting of Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Gloucester, Mercer, and Salem Counties) as of November 15, 2005. EPA also has determined, as of November 15, 2005, the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area is not subject to the imposition of the section 185 penalty fees.
(2) Atlantic City (consisting of Atlantic and Cape May Counties) as of
January 6, 2010.
(m)(1) The 2008 Reasonable Further Progress Plans and associated 2008 ozone projection year emission inventories for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
(2) The contingency measures for failure to meet the 2008 RFP Plan milestones for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
(3) The moderate area Reasonably Available Control Measure Analysis for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
(4) The 2008 motor vehicle emissions budgets for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
(5) The general conformity budgets for McGuire AFB and Lakehurst NAS included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
(6) The Statewide reasonably available control technology (RACT) analysis for the 8-hour ozone standard included in the August 1, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision is approved based on EPA's approval of the April 9, 2010 and April 21, 2010 SIP revisions.
(n)(1)
Attainment determination.
EPA has determined, as of March 26, 2012, that based on 2008 to 2010 ambient air quality data, Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone
NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
(2) EPA has determined, as of June 18, 2012, that based on 2007 to 2009 complete, quality-assured and certified ambient air quality data, additional data showing continued attainment through 2011, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT, eight-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS.
(o)(1) The 1997 8-hour ozone attainment demonstration for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT nonattainment area included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision is approved and satisfies the requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act.
(2) The 1997 8-hour ozone attainment demonstration for the New Jersey portion of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment area included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision is approved and satisfies the requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act.
(p)
Rescission of clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard.
Effective June 3, 2016, the EPA is determining that complete quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2012-2014 show the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT 1997 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. Therefore, the EPA is rescinding the clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard only. The prior determination (
see
paragraph (n)(2)) is in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918. The prior determination suspended the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS. This rescission of the clean data determination will result in a SIP Call for a new ozone attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard, for this area only. If the revised plan is approved by the EPA as demonstrating reasonable further progress and attainment for the more stringent 2008 NAAQS by the Moderate area attainment date, and is approved by the EPA as containing adequate contingency measures for the 2008 NAAQS, then the plan would be deemed to have also satisfied requirements of the SIP Call associated with violations for the 1997 NAAQS.
(q)
Negative declarations.
The State of New Jersey has certified to the satisfaction of the EPA that no sources are located in the State which are covered by the following Control Techniques Guidelines:
(1) Oil and Natural Gas Industry (October 2016).

(b) Before any steam or electric power generating facility in Zone 3, as defined in N.J.A.C. 7:27-10.1, burning fuel oil on June 4, 1979, having a rated hourly gross heat input greater than 200,000,000 British Thermal Units (BTU's), and capable of burning coal without major reconstruction or construction, which facility was in operation prior to May 6, 1968, or group of such facilities having a combined rated hourly capacity greater than 450,000,000 BTU's may be permitted by the State to convert to the use of coal, the State shall submit to EPA a copy of the proposed permit together with an air quality analysis employing methodology acceptable to EPA. If EPA determines, on the basis of the submitted analysis, that the proposed coal conversion will not interfere with the attainment or maintenance of air quality standards and will not be the cause for any Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) increment to be exceeded, then the permit authorizing conversion may become effective immediately upon the publication of such a determination (as a Notice) in the
Federal Register.
If EPA determines that the submitted analysis is inadequate or that it shows that the proposed conversion will interfere with attainment or maintenance of air quality standards or cause any PSD increment to be exceeded, then EPA shall so inform the State of its determination, and the permit authorizing conversion shall not become effective and conversion shall not occur until an adequate analysis is submitted or, if necessary, until a control strategy revision which would require any necessary emission reductions is submitted by the State and placed into effect as an EPA approved revision to the implementation plan. In addition, this same procedure shall apply to any State permit applied for that would authorize a relaxation in the sulfur-in-coal limitation at any such facility, as defined above in this paragraph, having already been granted a permit to convert to coal.
(c) The U.S. Gypsum Co. in Clark, New Jersey is permitted to burn fuel oil with a sulfur content of 2.0 percent, by weight, at either Boiler #1, #2 or #3 until March 31, 1985 or until Boiler #4 is ready to burn coal, whichever occurs first. Such oil burning must conform with New Jersey requirements and conditions as set forth in applicable regulations and administrative orders.

§ 52.1622
Approval status.
With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves New Mexico's state implementation plan under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all applicable requirements of Parts C and D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, except as noted below.
(a) The revisions to the New Mexico SIP definition of “Subject to Regulation” at 20.2.74.7 (AZ)(2)(
a
) NMAC to implement the GHG Biomass Deferral
as submitted on January 8, 2013 are disapproved.
(b) [Reserved]
[81 FR 32241, May 23, 2016]
§ 52.1623
Conditional approval.
(a)
General Conformity.
(1) A letter, dated April 22, 1998, from the Chief of Air Quality Bureau New Mexico Environment Department to the EPA Regional Office, commits the State to remove Section 110.C from its rule for making the State's rule consistent with Federal rule. Specifically, the letter states that:
This letter is regarding our general conformity rule, 20 NMAC 2.98—Conformity of General Federal Actions to the State Implementation Plan. We have been reviewing paragraph 110.C under Section 110—Reporting Requirements. This is the paragraph in which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had submitted a comment of concern to EPA, during EPA's proposed/final approval period for our rule. This comment caused EPA to withdraw its approval. The FAA had commented that New Mexico was more stringent than EPA, since our rule does not apply to non-Federal agencies. Our analysis has determined that our inclusion of this paragraph may make our rule more stringent than EPA, and should not have been included. The paragraph had originally come from a STAPPA/ALAPCO model rule. New Mexico had never intended to be more stringent than EPA with regards to general conformity. Hence, the State commits to putting 20 NMAC 2.98 on our regulatory agenda and plan to delete this paragraph within one year from the
Federal Register
publication of final notice of conditional approval to New Mexico's general conformity SIP.
(2) If the State ultimately fails to meet its commitment to remove this section from its rule within one year of publication of this conditional approval, then EPA's conditional action will automatically convert to a final disapproval.
(b) [Reserved]

§ 52.1627
Control strategy and regulations: Carbon monoxide.
(a)
Part D Approval.
The Albuquerque/Bernalillo County carbon monoxide maintenance plan as adopted on April 13, 1995, meets the requirements of Section 172 of the Clean Air Act, and is therefore approved.
(b) Approval—The Albuquerque/Bernalillo County carbon monoxide limited maintenance plan revision dated September 7, 2004, meets the requirements of section 172 of the Clean Air Act, and is therefore approved.

§ 52.1634
Significant deterioration of air quality.
(a) The plan submitted by the Governor of New Mexico on February 21, 1984 (as adopted by the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board (NMEIB) on January 13, 1984), August 19, 1988 (as revised and adopted by the NMEIB on July 8, 1988), and July 16, 1990 (as revised and adopted by the NMEID on March 9, 1990), Air Quality Control Regulation 707—Permits, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and its Supplemental document, is approved as meeting the requirements of part C, Clean Air Act for preventing significant deterioration of air quality. Additionally, on November 2, 1988, EPA approved New Mexico's stack height regulation into the SIP (53 FR 44191), thereby satisfying the conditions of EPA's conditional approval of the State's PSD program on February 27, 1987 (52 FR 5964). Therefore, the conditional approval was converted to a full approval on July 15, 2011.
(b) The requirements of section 160 through 165 of the Clean Air Act are not met for federally designated Indian lands. Therefore, the provisions of § 52.21 except paragraph (a)(1) are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable implementation plan, and are applicable to sources located on land under the control of Indian governing bodies.
(c) The plan submitted by the Governor in paragraph (a) of this section for Prevention of Significant Deterioration is not applicable to Bernalillo County. Therefore, the following plan described below is applicable to sources located within the boundaries of Bernalillo County (including the City of Albuquerque). This plan, submitted by the Governor of New Mexico on
April 14, 1989, August 7, 1989, May 1, 1990, May 17, 1993, May 24, 2006, August 16, 2010, and December 15, 2010 and respectively adopted on March 8, 1989, July 12, 1989, April 11, 1990, February 10, 1993, December 22, 2005, April 13, 2006, July 28, 2010, and December 10, 2010, by the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board, containing Part 61—Prevention of Significant Deterioration is approved as meeting the requirements of part C of the Clean Air Act for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality.

§ 52.1635
Rules and regulations.
(a)
Part D disapproval:
The requirements of § 51.281 of this chapter are not met since the measurement provisions of Sections A, B.2, and B.3 of New Mexico Regulation 506 make these sections unenforceable. Therefore, Sections A, B.2, and B.3 of Regulation 506 are disapproved.
(b)
Regulation for measurement of emission limitations (particulate matter from nonferrous smelters).
(1) This regulation applies to new and existing nonferrous smelters as they are defined in New Mexico Regulation 506. The requirements of this paragraph replace the requirements of Sections A, B.2, and B.3 of Regulation 506. All other requirements of Regulation 506 are approved as part of the plan.
(2) No person owning or operating a new nonferrous smelter shall permit, cause, suffer, or allow particulate matter emissions to the atmosphere in excess of 0.03 grains per dry standard cubic foot (as defined in 40 CFR part 60) of discharge gas.
