(e) Before September 15, 2020, for each SSM event subject to an initial startup period as described in § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2), or a malfunction period as described in § 63.2850(e)(2), record the items in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section by the end of the calendar month following each month in which the initial startup period or malfunction period occurred. The provisions of this paragraph (e) do not apply on and after September 15, 2020.
(1) A description and date of the SSM event, its duration, and reason it qualifies as an initial startup or malfunction.
(2) An estimate of the solvent loss in gallons for the duration of the initial startup or malfunction period with supporting documentation.
(3) A checklist or other mechanism to indicate whether the SSM plan was followed during the initial startup or malfunction period.
(f) On and after September 15, 2020, for each initial startup period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2), record the items in paragraphs (f)(1) through (6) of this section by the end of the calendar month following each month in which the initial startup period occurred.
(1) A description and dates of the initial startup period, and reason it qualifies as an initial startup.
(2) An estimate of the solvent loss in gallons for the duration of the initial startup or malfunction period with supporting documentation.
(3) Nominal design rate of the extractor and operating rate of the extractor for the duration of the initial startup period, or permitted production rate and actual production rate of your source for the duration of the initial startup period.
(4) Measured values for temperature and pressure for the desolventizing and oil distillation units associated with solvent recovery.
(5) Information to indicate the mineral oil absorption system was operating at all times during the initial startup period.
(6) Information to indicate the solvent condensers were operating at all times during the initial startup period.
(g) On and after September 15, 2020, keep the records of deviations specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section for each compliance determination you make in which the compliance ratio exceeds 1.00 as determined under § 63.2840(c) or if you deviate from the work practice standard for an initial startup period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2).
(1) The number of deviations, and the date and duration of each deviation. For deviations from the compliance ratio, the date of the deviation is the date the compliance ratio determination is made. The duration of the deviation from the compliance ratio is the length of time taken to address the cause of the deviation, including the duration of any malfunction, and return the affected unit(s) to its normal or usual manner of operation. For deviations from the work practice standard during the initial startup period, the date of the deviation is the date(s) when the facility fails to comply with any of the work practice standard in § 63.2840(h). The duration of the deviation from the work practice standard is the length of time taken to return to the work practice standards.
(2) A statement of the cause of each deviation (including unknown cause, if applicable).
(3) For each deviation, a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.
(4) Actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.2840(g), and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.
(5) If you deviate from the work practice standard for an initial startup period, a description of the deviation from the work practice standard.
(h) Any records required to be maintained by this part that are submitted electronically via EPA's CEDRI may be maintained in electronic format. This ability to maintain electronic copies does not affect the requirement for facilities to make records, data, and reports available upon request to a delegated air agency or EPA as part of an on-site compliance evaluation.

(5) Approval of major alternatives to recordkeeping and reporting under § 63.10(f) and as defined in § 63.90.
§ 63.2872
What definitions apply to this subpart?
Terms used in this subpart are defined in the sources listed:
(a) The Clean Air Act, section 112(a).
(b) In 40 CFR 63.2, the NESHAP General Provisions.
(c) In this section as follows:
Accounting month
means a time interval defined by a business firm during which corporate economic and financial factors are determined on a consistent and regular basis. An accounting month will consist of approximately 4 to 5 calendar weeks and each accounting month will be of approximate equal duration. An accounting month may not correspond exactly to a calendar month, but 12 accounting months will correspond exactly to a calendar year.
Actual solvent loss
means the gallons of solvent lost from a source during 12 operating months as determined in accordance with § 63.2853.
Agricultural product
means any commercially grown plant or plant product.
Allowable HAP loss
means the gallons of HAP that would have been lost from a source if the source was operating at the solvent loss factor for each listed oilseed type. The allowable HAP loss in gallons is determined by multiplying the tons of each oilseed type processed during the previous 12 operating months, as determined in accordance with § 63.2855, by the corresponding oilseed solvent loss factor (gal/ton) listed in Table 1 of § 63.2840, and by the dimensionless constant 0.64, and summing the result for all oilseed types processed.
Area source
means any source that does not meet the major source definition.
As received
is the basis upon which all oilseed measurements must be determined and refers to the oilseed chemical and physical characteristics as initially received by the source and prior to any oilseed handling and processing.
Batch operation
means any process that operates in a manner where the addition of raw material and withdrawal of product do not occur simultaneously. Typically, raw material is added to a process, operational steps occur, and a product is removed from the process. More raw material is then added to the process and the cycle repeats.
Calendar month
means 1 month as specified in a calendar.
Compliance date
means the date on which monthly compliance recordkeeping begins. For existing sources, recordkeeping typically begins 3 years after the effective date of the subpart. For new and reconstructed sources, recordkeeping typically begins upon initial startup, except as noted in § 63.2834.
Compliance ratio
means a ratio of the actual HAP loss in gallons from the previous 12 operating months to an allowable HAP loss in gallons, which is
determined by using oilseed solvent loss factors in Table 1 of § 63.2840, the weighted average volume fraction of HAP in solvent received for the previous 12 operating months, and the tons of each type of listed oilseed processed in the previous 12 operating months. Months during which no listed oilseed is processed, or months during which the § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2) initial startup period or, before September 15, 2020, the § 63.2850(e)(2) malfunction period applies, are excluded from this calculation. Equation 2 of § 63.2840 is used to calculate this value. If the value is less than or equal to 1.00, the source is in compliance. If the value is greater than 1.00, the source is deviating from compliance.
Continuous operation
means any process that adds raw material and withdraws product simultaneously. Mass, temperature, concentration and other properties typically approach steady-state conditions.
Conventional desolventizer
means a desolventizer toaster that operates with indirect and direct-contact steam to remove solvent from the extracted meal. Oilseeds processed in a conventional desolventizer produce crude vegetable oil and crude meal products, such as animal feed.
Corn germ dry milling
means a source that processes corn germ that has been separated from the other corn components using a “dry” process of mechanical chafing and air sifting.
Corn germ wet milling
means a source that processes corn germ that has been separated from other corn components using a “wet” process of centrifuging a slurry steeped in a dilute sulfurous acid solution.
Exempt period
means a period of time during which a source processes agricultural products not defined as listed oilseed.
Extraction solvent
means an organic chemical medium used to remove oil from an oilseed. Typically, the extraction solvent is a commercial grade of hexane isomers which have an approximate HAP content of 64 percent by volume.
Hazardous air pollutant (HAP)
means any substance or mixture of substances listed as a hazardous air pollutant under section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act.
Initial startup date
means the first calendar day that a new, reconstructed or significantly modified source processes any listed oilseed.
Initial startup period
means a period of time from the initial startup date of a new, reconstructed, or significantly modified source, for which you choose to operate the source under an initial startup period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2), until the date your source operates for 15 consecutive days at or above 90 percent of the nominal design rate of the extractor or at or above 90 percent of the permitted production rate for your source. The initial startup period following initial startup of a new or reconstructed source may not exceed 6 calendar months. The initial startup period following a significant modification may not exceed 3 calendar months. Solvent and oilseed inventory information recorded during the initial startup period is excluded from use in any compliance ratio determinations.
Large cottonseed plant
means a vegetable oil production process that processes 120,000 tons or more of cottonseed and other listed oilseed during all normal operating periods in a 12 operating months period used to determine compliance.
Malfunction period
means a period of time between the beginning and end of a process malfunction and the time reasonably necessary for a source to correct the malfunction for which you choose to operate the source under a malfunction period subject to § 63.2850(e)(2). This period may include the duration of an unscheduled process shutdown, continued operation during a malfunction, or the subsequent process startup after a shutdown resulting from a malfunction. During a malfunction period, a source complies with the standards by minimizing HAP emissions to the extent practicable. Therefore, solvent and oilseed inventory information recorded during a malfunction period is excluded from use in any compliance ratio determinations.
Mechanical extraction
means removing vegetable oil from oilseeds using only mechanical devices such as presses or screws that physically force the
oil from the oilseed. Mechanical extraction techniques use no organic solvents to remove oil from an oilseed.
Nonoperating month
means any entire calendar or accounting month in which a source processes no agricultural product.
Nonoperating period
means any period of time in which a source processes no agricultural product. This operating status does not apply during any period in which the source operates under an initial startup period as described in § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2), or a malfunction period, as described in § 63.2850(e)(2).
Normal operating period
or
normal operation
means any period of time in which a source processes a listed oilseed that is not categorized as an initial startup period as described in § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2), or, before September 15, 2020, a malfunction period as described in § 63.2850(e)(2). At the beginning and ending dates of a normal operating period, solvent and oilseed inventory information is recorded and included in the compliance ratio determination.
Oilseed or listed oilseed
means the following agricultural products: corn germ, cottonseed, flax, peanut, rapeseed (for example, canola), safflower, soybean, and sunflower.
Oilseed solvent loss factor
means a ratio expressed as gallons of solvent loss per ton of oilseed processed. The solvent loss factors are presented in Table 1 of § 63.2840 and are used to determine the allowable HAP loss.
Operating month
means any calendar or accounting month in which a source processes any quantity of listed oilseed, excluding any entire calendar or accounting month in which the source operated under an initial startup period as described in § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2), or, before September 15, 2020, a malfunction period as described in § 63.2850(e)(2). An operating month may include time intervals characterized by several types of operating status. However, an operating month must have at least one normal operating period.
Significant modification
means the addition of new equipment or the modification of existing equipment that:
(1) Significantly affects solvent losses from your vegetable oil production process;
(2) The fixed capital cost of the new components represents a significant percentage of the fixed capital cost of building a comparable new vegetable oil production process;
(3) The fixed capital cost of the new equipment does not constitute reconstruction as defined in § 63.2; and
(4) Examples of significant modifications include replacement of or major changes to solvent recovery equipment such as extractors, desolventizer-toasters/dryer-coolers, flash desolventizers, and distillation equipment associated with the mineral oil system, and equipment affecting desolventizing efficiency and steady-state operation of your vegetable oil production process such as flaking mills, oilseed heating and conditioning equipment, and cracking mills.
Small cottonseed plant
means a vegetable oil production process that processes less than 120,000 tons of cottonseed and other listed oilseed during all normal operating periods in a 12 operating months period used to determine compliance.
Solvent extraction
means removing vegetable oil from listed oilseed using an organic solvent in a direct-contact system.
Solvent working capacity
means the volume of extraction solvent normally retained in solvent recovery equipment. Examples include components such as the solvent extractor, desolventizer-toaster, solvent storage and working tanks, mineral oil absorption system, condensers, and oil/solvent distillation system.
Specialty desolventizer
means a desolventizer that removes excess solvent from soybean meal using vacuum conditions, energy from superheated solvent vapors, or reduced operating conditions (e.g., temperature) as compared to the typical operation of a conventional desolventizer. Soybeans processed in a specialty desolventizer result in high-protein vegetable meal products for human and animal consumption, such as calf milk replacement products and meat extender products.
Vegetable oil production process
means the equipment comprising a continuous process for producing crude vegetable
oil and meal products, including specialty soybean products, in which oil is removed from listed oilseeds through direct contact with an organic solvent. Process equipment typically includes the following components: oilseed preparation operations (including conditioning, drying, dehulling, and cracking), solvent extractors, desolventizer-toasters, meal dryers, meal coolers, meal conveyor systems, oil distillation units, solvent evaporators and condensers, solvent recovery system (also referred to as a mineral oil absorption system), vessels storing solvent-laden materials, and crude meal packaging and storage vessels. A vegetable oil production process does not include vegetable oil refining operations (including operations such as bleaching, hydrogenation, and deodorizing) and operations that engage in additional chemical treatment of crude soybean meals produced in specialty desolventizer units (including operations such as soybean isolate production).

You must comply with this subpart if you meet the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
(a) You own or operate a drying and curing oven at a wet-formed fiberglass mat production facility.
(b) Your drying and curing oven or the facility at which your drying and curing oven is located is a major source of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). A major source is any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or can potentially emit, considering controls, in the aggregate, 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year of a single HAP or 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year of any combination of HAP.
§ 63.2982
What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
(a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing affected source. The affected source (the portion of your plant covered by this subpart) is each wet-formed fiberglass mat drying and curing oven.
(b) An affected source is a new affected source if you commenced construction of the affected source after May 26, 2000, and you meet the applicability criteria in § 63.2981 at start-up.
(c) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria as defined in § 63.2.
(d) An affected source is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.

# Emission Limitations
§ 63.2983
What emission limits must I meet?
(a) You must limit the formaldehyde emissions from each drying and curing oven by either:
(1) Limiting emissions of formaldehyde to 0.03 kilograms or less per megagram (0.05 pounds per ton) of fiberglass mat produced; or
(2) Reducing uncontrolled formaldehyde emissions by 96 percent or more.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 63.2984
What operating limits must I meet?
(a) You must maintain operating parameters within established limits or ranges specified in your operation, maintenance, and monitoring (OMM) plan described in § 63.2987. If there is a
deviation of any of the specified parameters from the limit or range specified in the OMM plan, you must address the deviation according to paragraph (b) of this section. You must comply with the operating limits specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section:
(1) You must operate the thermal oxidizer so that the average operating temperature in any 3-hour block period does not fall below the temperature established during your performance test and specified in your OMM plan, except during periods when using a non-HAP binder.
(2) You must not use a resin with a free-formaldehyde content greater than that of the resin used during your performance test and specified in your OMM plan.

Fiberglass mat production rate
means the weight of finished fiberglass mat produced per hour of production including any trim removed after the binder is applied and before final packaging.
Loss-on-ignition
means the percentage decrease in weight of fiberglass mat measured before and after it has been ignited to burn off the applied binder. The loss-on-ignition is used to monitor the weight percent of binder in fiberglass mat.
Maximum residence time
means the longest time, during normal operation and excluding periods of ramping up to speed during startup, that a particular point on the fiberglass mat remains in the drying and curing oven. It is determined for each line by the equation:
T = L/S
Where:
T is the residence time, in seconds;
L is the length of the drying and curing oven, in feet; and
S is the slowest line speed normally operated on the line, excluding periods of ramping up to speed during startup, in feet per second.
Non-HAP binder
means a binder formulation that does not contain any substance that is required to be listed in Section 3 of a safety data sheet (SDS) pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) and that is a HAP as defined in section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act. In designating a non-HAP binder under this subpart, you may not rely on the SDS for a binder where the manufacturer has withheld the specific chemical identity, including the chemical name, other specific identification of a hazardous chemical, or the exact percentage (concentration) of the substance in a mixture from Section 3 of the SDS. You may not withhold this information when making the case that the binder is a non-HAP binder for the purposes of § 63.2996.
Nonwoven wet-formed fiberglass mat manufacturing
means the production of a fiberglass mat by bonding glass fibers to each other using a resin solution. Nonwoven wet-formed fiberglass mat manufacturing is also referred to as wet-formed fiberglass mat manufacturing.
Roofing square
means the amount of finished product needed to cover an area 10 feet by 10 feet (100 square feet) of finished roof.

Shutdown ends when the maximum residence time has elapsed after binder-infused fiberglass mat ceases to enter the drying and curing oven.
Startup
after February 28, 2019 for affected sources that commence construction or reconstruction after April 6, 2018, and after August 27, 2019 for all other affected sources, means the setting in operation of the drying and curing of binder-infused fiberglass mat for any purpose. Startup begins when binder-infused fiberglass mat enters the oven to be dried and cured for the first time or after a shutdown event.
Thermal oxidizer
means an air pollution control device that uses controlled flame combustion inside a combustion chamber to convert combustible materials to noncombustible gases.
Urea-formaldehyde content in binder formulation
means the mass-based percent of urea-formaldehyde resin in the total binder mix as it is applied to the glass fibers to form the mat.

# Appendix A to Subpart HHHH of Part 63—Method for Determining Free-Formaldehyde in Urea-Formaldehyde Resins by Sodium Sulfite (Iced

# Cooled)

# 1.0 Scope
This procedure corresponds to the Housing and Urban Development method of determining free-formaldehyde in urea-formaldehyde resins. This method applies to samples that decompose to yield formaldehyde under the conditions of other free-formaldehyde methods. The primary use is for urea-formaldehyde resins.

# 2.0 Part A—Testing Resins
Formaldehyde will react with sodium sulfite to form the sulfite addition products and liberate sodium hydroxide (NaOH); however, at room temperature, the methanol groups present will also react to liberate NaOH. Titrate at 0 degrees Celsius (°C) to minimize the reaction of the methanol groups.
2.1 Apparatus Required.
2.1.1 Ice crusher.
2.1.2 One 100-milliliter (mL) graduated cylinder.
2.1.3 Three 400-mL beakers.
2.1.4 One 50-mL burette.
2.1.5 Analytical balance accurate to 0.1 milligrams (mg).
2.1.6 Magnetic stirrer.
2.1.7 Magnetic stirring bars.
2.1.8 Disposable pipettes.
2.1.9 Several 5-ounce (oz.) plastic cups.
2.1.10 Ice cube trays (small cubes).
2.2 Materials Required.
2.2.1 Ice cubes (made with distilled water).

# Appendix B to Subpart HHHH of Part 63—Method for the Determination of Loss-on-Ignition

# 1.0 Purpose
The purpose of this test is to determine the loss-on-ignition (LOI) of wet-formed fiberglass mat.

# 2.0 Equipment
2.1 Scale sensitive to 0.001 gram (g).
2.2 Drying oven equipped with a means of constant temperature regulation and mechanical air convection.
2.3 Furnace designed to heat to at least 625 °C (1,157 °F) and controllable to ±25 °C (±45 °F).
2.4 Crucible, high form, 250 milliliter (mL).
2.5 Desiccator.
2.6 Pan balance (see Note 2 in 4.9)

# 3.0 Sample Collection Procedure
3.1 Obtain a sample of mat in accordance with Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI) method 1007 “Sample Location.”
3.2 Use a 5- to 10-g sample cut into pieces small enough to fit into the crucible.
3.3 Place the sample in the crucible. (
Note 1:
To test without the use of a crucible, see Note 2 after Section 4.8.)
3.4 Condition the sample in the furnace set at 105 ±3 °C (221 ±9 °F) for 5 minutes ±30 seconds.

# 4.0 Procedure
4.1 Condition each sample by drying for 5 minutes ±30 seconds at 105 ±3 °C (22 ±5 °F).
4.2 Remove the test sample from the furnace and cool in the desiccator for 30 minutes in the standard atmosphere for testing glass textiles.
4.3 Place the empty crucible in the furnace at 625 ±25 °C (1,157 ±45 °F). After 30 minutes, remove and cool the crucible in the standard atmosphere (TAPPI method 1008) for 30 minutes.
4.4 Identify each crucible with respect to each test sample of mat.
4.5 Weigh the empty crucible to the nearest 0.001 g. Record this weight as the tare mass, T.
4.6 Place the test sample in the crucible and weigh to the nearest 0.001 g. Record this weight as the initial mass, A.
4.7 Place the test sample and crucible in the furnace and ignite at 625 ±25 °C (1,157 ±45 °F).
4.8 After ignition for at least 30 minutes, remove the test sample and crucible from the furnace and cool in the desiccator for 30 minutes in the standard atmosphere (TAPPI method 1008).
4.9 Remove each crucible, and test each sample separately from the desiccator, and immediately weigh each sample to the nearest 0.001 g. Record this weight as the ignited mass, B. (
Note 2:
When it is known that no ash residue separates from the test sample during the weighing and igniting processes, you may weigh the sample separately without the crucible. When this occurs, the tare mass (T) equals zero. With appropriate care, you can dry and weigh a single piece of mat and place with tongs into the ignition oven on appropriate refractory supports. When the ignition time is over, remove the sample as an intact fragile web and weigh it directly on a pan balance.)

# 5.0 Calculation
5.1 Calculate the LOI for each sample as follows:
ER11AP02.027
Where:
A = initial mass of crucible and sample before ignition (g);
B = mass of crucible and glass residue after ignition (g); and
T = tare mass of crucible, (g) (see Note 2).
5.2 Report the percent LOI of the glass mat to the nearest 0.1 percent.

# 6.0 Precision
The repeatability of this test method for measurements on adjacent specimens from the same sample of mat is better than 1 percent.

(1) You may choose to use a single grouping under paragraph (a) of this section for all of your electrodeposition primer, primer-surfacer, topcoat, final repair, glass bonding primer, and glass bonding adhesive operations.
(2) You may choose to use a single grouping under paragraph (b) of this section for all of your primer-surfacer, topcoat, final repair, glass bonding primer, and glass bonding adhesive operations as long as each of your electrodeposition primer systems
meets the operating limits of § 63.3092(a) or (b).
(3) You may choose to use one or more groupings under paragraph (a) of this section for the electrodeposition primer, primer-surfacer, topcoat, final repair, glass bonding primer, and glass bonding adhesive operations from one or more of your paint lines; and one or more groupings under paragraph (b) of this section for the primer-surfacer, topcoat, final repair, glass bonding primer, and glass bonding adhesive operations from the remainder of your paint lines, as long as each electrodeposition primer system associated with each paint line you include in a grouping under paragraph (b) of this section meets the operating limits of § 63.3092(a) or (b). For example, if your facility has three paint lines, you may choose to use one grouping under paragraph (a) of this section for two of the paint lines; and a separate grouping under paragraph (b) of this section for the third paint line, as long as the electrodeposition primer system associated with the paint line you include in the grouping under paragraph (b) of this section meets the operating limits of § 63.3092(a) or (b).

# Compliance Requirements for Adhesive, Sealer, and Deadener
§ 63.3150
By what date must I conduct the initial compliance demonstration?
You must complete the initial compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements of § 63.3151. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3083 and ends on the last day of the month following the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next month. You must determine the mass average organic HAP content of the materials used each month for each group of materials for which an emission limitation is established in § 63.3090(c) and (d) or § 63.3091(c) and (d). The initial compliance demonstration includes the calculations according to § 63.3151 and supporting documentation showing that during the initial compliance period, the mass average organic HAP content for each group of materials was equal to or less than the applicable emission limits in § 63.3090(c) and (d) or § 63.3091(c) and (d).
§ 63.3151
How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?
You must separately calculate the mass average organic HAP content of the materials used during the initial compliance period for each group of materials for which an emission limit is established in § 63.3090(c) and (d) or § 63.3091(c) and (d). If every individual material used within a group of materials meets the emission limit for that group of materials, you may demonstrate compliance with that emission limit by documenting the name and the organic HAP content of each material used during the initial compliance period. If any individual material used within a group of materials exceeds the emission limit for that group of materials, you must determine the mass average organic HAP content according to the procedures of paragraph (d) of this section.
(a)
Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each material used.
You must determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each material used during the compliance period by using one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1)
Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63).
You may use Method 311 for determining the mass fraction of organic HAP. Use the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when performing a Method 311 test.
(i) Count each organic HAP in table 5 to this subpart that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not listed in table 5 to this subpart) is measured to be 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to count it. Express the mass fraction of each organic HAP you count as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (
e.g.,
0.3791).
(ii) Calculate the total mass fraction of organic HAP in the test material by adding up the individual organic HAP mass fractions and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (
e.g.,
0.7638 truncates to 0.763).
(2)
EPA Method 24 (appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60).
For coatings, you may use EPA Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP. As an alternative to using EPA Method 24, you may use ASTM D2369-10 (Reapproved 2015)
e
(incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14).
(3)
Alternative method.
You may use an alternative test method for determining the mass fraction of organic HAP once the Administrator has approved it. You must follow the procedure in § 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.
(4)
Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material.
You may rely on information other than that generated by the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, such as manufacturer's formulation data, if it represents each organic HAP in table 5 to this subpart that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more and at 1.0 percent by mass or
more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not listed in table 5 of this subpart) is 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to count it. If there is a disagreement between such information and results of a test conducted according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, then the test method results will take precedence, unless after consultation, the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the enforcement authority that the facility's data are correct.
(5)
Solvent blends.
Solvent blends may be listed as single components for some materials in data provided by manufacturers or suppliers. Solvent blends may contain organic HAP which must be counted toward the total organic HAP mass fraction of the materials. When neither test data nor manufacturer's data for solvent blends are available, you may use the default values for the mass fraction of organic HAP in the solvent blends listed in Table 3 or 4 to this subpart. If you use the tables, you must use the values in Table 3 for all solvent blends that match Table 3 entries, and you may only use Table 4 if the solvent blends in the materials you use do not match any of the solvent blends in Table 3 and you only know whether the blend is aliphatic or aromatic. However, if the results of a Method 311 test indicate higher values than those listed on Table 3 or 4 to this subpart, the Method 311 results will take precedence, unless after consultation, the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the enforcement authority that the data from Table 3 or 4 are correct.
(b)
Determine the density of each material used.
Determine the density of each material used during the compliance period from test results using ASTM D1475-13 (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14) or for powder coatings, test method A or test method B of ASTM D5965-02 (Reapproved 2013) (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14), or information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material. If there is disagreement between ASTM D1475-13 test results or ASTM D5965-02 (Reapproved 2013), test method A or test method B test results and the supplier's or manufacturer's information, the test results will take precedence unless after consultation, the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the enforcement authority that the facility's data are correct.
(c)
Determine the volume of each material used.
Determine the volume (liters) of each material used during each month by measurement or usage records.
(d)
Determine the mass average organic HAP content for each group of materials.
Determine the mass average organic HAP content of the materials used during the initial compliance period for each group of materials for which an emission limit is established in § 63.3090(c) and (d) or § 63.3091(c) and (d), using Equations 1 and 2 of this section.
(1) Calculate the mass average organic HAP content of adhesive and sealer materials other than components of the glass bonding system used in the initial compliance period using Equation 1 of this section:
ER26AP04.034
Where:
C
avg, as
= Mass average organic HAP content of adhesives and sealer materials used, kg/kg.
Vol
as, j
= Volume of adhesive or sealer material, j, used, liters.
D
as, j
= Density of adhesive or sealer material, j, used, kg per liter.
W
as, j
= Mass fraction of organic HAP in adhesive or sealer material, j, kg/kg.
r = Number of adhesive and sealer materials used.
(2) Calculate the mass average organic HAP content of deadener materials used in the initial compliance period using Equation 2 of this section:
ER26AP04.035
Where:
C
avg, d
= Mass average organic HAP content of deadener material used, kg/kg.
Vol
d, m
= Volume of deadener material, m, used, liters.
D
d, m
= Density of deadener material, m, used, kg per liter.
W
d, m
= Mass fraction of organic HAP in deadener material, m, kg/kg.
s = Number of deadener materials used.
(e)
Compliance demonstration.
The mass average organic HAP content for the compliance period must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3090(c) and (d) or § 63.3091(c) and (d). You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.3130 and 63.3131. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.3110, you must submit a statement that the coating operations were in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the mass average organic HAP content was less than or equal to the applicable emission limits in § 63.3090(c) and (d) or § 63.3091(c) and (d), determined according to this section.
[69 FR 22623, Apr. 26, 2004, as amended at 85 FR 41129, July 8, 2020]
§ 63.3152
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?
(a) To demonstrate continuous compliance, the mass average organic HAP content for each compliance period, determined according to § 63.3151(a) through (d), must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3090(c) and (d) or § 63.3091(c) and (d). A compliance period consists of 1 month. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 63.3150 is a compliance period consisting of that month.
(b) If the mass average organic HAP emission content for any compliance period exceeds the applicable emission limit in § 63.3090(c) and (d) or § 63.3091(c) and (d), this is a deviation from the emission limitations for that compliance period and must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3110(c)(6) and 63.3120(a)(5).
(c) You must maintain records as specified in §§ 63.3130 and 63.3131.

Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation.
Determine the mass of organic
HAP emissions reduced for each controlled coating operation during each month. The emission reduction determination quantifies the total organic HAP emissions captured by the emission capture system and destroyed or removed by the add-on control device. Use the procedures in paragraph (j) of this section to calculate the mass of organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances. For each controlled coating operation using a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance, use the procedures in paragraph (k) of this section to calculate the organic HAP emission reduction.
(j)
Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation not using liquid-liquid material balances.
For each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances, calculate the mass of organic HAP emission reduction for the controlled coating operation, excluding all periods of time in which a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an operating limit or from any CPMS requirement for the capture system or control device serving the controlled coating operation occurred, during the month using Equation 2 of this section. The calculation of mass of organic HAP emission reduction for the controlled coating operation during the month applies the emission capture system efficiency and add-on control device efficiency to the mass of organic HAP contained in the coatings and thinners that are used in the coating operation served by the emission capture system and add-on control device during each month. Except as provided in paragraph (p) of this section, for any period of time in which a deviation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, from an operating limit or from any CPMS requirement of the capture system or control device serving the controlled coating operation occurred, you must assume zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control device.

to the applicable emission limitation in § 63.3090(a) or § 63.3091(a). You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.3130 and 63.3131. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.3110, you must submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3090(a) or § 63.3091(a) and you achieved the operating limits required by § 63.3093 and the work practice standards required by § 63.3094.

§ 63.3162
[Reserved]
§ 63.3163
How do I conduct periodic performance tests and demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?
(a) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.3090(a) or § 63.3091(a), the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period, determined according to the procedures in § 63.3161, must be equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in § 63.3090(a) or § 63.3091(a). A compliance period consists of 1 month. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 63.3160 is a compliance period consisting of that month. You must perform the calculations in § 63.3161 on a monthly basis.
(b) If the organic HAP emission rate for any 1 month compliance period exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.3090(a) or § 63.3091(a), this is a deviation from the emission limitation for that compliance period and must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3110(c)(6) and 63.3120(a)(6).
(c) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each operating limit required by § 63.3093 that applies to you, as specified in table 1 to this subpart, and you must conduct performance tests as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(1) If an operating parameter is out of the allowed range specified in Table 1 to this subpart, this is a deviation from the operating limit that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3110(c)(6) and 63.3120(a)(6).
(2) If an operating parameter deviates from the operating limit specified in Table 1 to this subpart, then you must assume that the emission capture system and add-on control device were achieving zero efficiency during the time period of the deviation except as provided in § 63.3161(p).
(3) Except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.3161(k) for controlled coating operations, you must conduct periodic performance tests of add-on controls and establish the operating limits required by § 63.3093 within 5 years following the previous performance test. You must conduct the first periodic performance
test before July 8, 2023, unless you are already required to complete periodic performance tests as a requirement of renewing your facility's operating permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 and have conducted a performance test on or after July 8, 2022. Thereafter you must conduct a performance test no later than 5 years following the previous performance test. Operating limits must be confirmed or reestablished during each performance test. For any control device for which you are using the catalytic oxidizer control option at § 63.3167(b) and following the catalyst maintenance procedures in § 63.3167(b)(6), you are not required to conduct periodic control device performance testing as specified by this paragraph. For any control device for which instruments are used to continuously measure organic compound emissions, you are not required to conduct periodic control device performance testing as specified by this paragraph. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to measuring emission capture system efficiency.
(d) You must meet the requirements for bypass lines in § 63.3168(b) for control devices other than solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances. If any bypass line is opened and emissions are diverted to the atmosphere when the coating operation is running, this is a deviation that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3110(c)(6) and 63.3120(a)(6). For the purposes of completing the compliance calculations specified in § 63.3161(k), you must assume that the emission capture system and add-on control device were achieving zero efficiency during the time period of the deviation.
(e) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the work practice standards in § 63.3094. If you did not develop a work practice plan, if you did not implement the plan, or if you did not keep the records required by § 63.3130(n), this is a deviation from the work practice standards that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3110(c)(6) and 63.3120(a)(6).
(f) If there were no deviations from the emission limitations, submit a statement as part of the semiannual compliance report that you were in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3090(a) or § 63.3091(a), § 63.3090(b) or § 63.3091(b), or § 63.3092(a) or § 63.3092(b), you achieved the operating limits required by § 63.3093, and you achieved the work practice standards required by § 63.3094 during each compliance period.
(g) [Reserved]
(h) Before January 5, 2021, consistent with §§ 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations that occur during a period of SSM of the emission capture system, add-on control device, or coating operation that may affect emission capture or control device efficiency are not violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating in accordance with § 63.6(e)(1). The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur during a period you identify as a SSM are violations according to the provisions in § 63.6(e). On and after January 5, 2021, the provisions of this paragraph no longer apply.
(i) [Reserved]
(j) You must maintain records as specified in §§ 63.3130 and 63.3131.
[69 FR 22623, Apr. 26, 2004, as amended at 71 FR 20464, Apr. 20, 2006; 85 FR 41130, July 8, 2020]
§ 63.3164
What are the general requirements for performance tests?
(a) You must conduct each applicable performance test required by §§ 63.3160, 63.3163, and 63.3171 according to the requirements in § 63.7(e)(1) and under the conditions in this section unless you obtain a waiver of the performance test according to the provisions in § 63.7(h).
(1)
Representative coating operation operating conditions.
You must conduct the performance test under representative operating conditions for the coating operation. Before January 5, 2021, operations during periods of SSM, and during periods of nonoperation do not constitute representative conditions. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent
normal operation. On and after January 5, 2021, operations during periods of startup, shutdown, or nonoperation do not constitute representative conditions for purposes of conducting a performance test. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(2)
Representative emission capture system and add-on control device operating conditions.
You must conduct the performance test when the emission capture system and add-on control device are operating at a representative flow rate, and the add-on control device is operating at a representative inlet concentration. You must record information that is necessary to document emission capture system and add-on control device operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation.
(b) You must conduct each performance test of an emission capture system according to the requirements in § 63.3165. You must conduct each performance test of an add-on control device according to the requirements in § 63.3166.
[69 FR 22623, Apr. 26, 2004, as amended at 85 FR 41130, July 8, 2020]
§ 63.3165
How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?
You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine capture efficiency as part of the performance test required by §§ 63.3160 and 63.3163. For purposes of this subpart, a spray booth air seal is not considered a natural draft opening in a PTE or a temporary total enclosure provided you demonstrate that the direction of air movement across the interface between the spray booth air seal and the spray booth is into the spray booth. For purposes of this subpart, a bake oven air seal is not considered a natural draft opening in a PTE or a temporary total enclosure provided you demonstrate that the direction of air movement across the interface between the bake oven air seal and the bake oven is into the bake oven. You may use lightweight strips of fabric or paper, or smoke tubes to make such demonstrations as part of showing that your capture system is a PTE or conducting a capture efficiency test using a temporary total enclosure. You cannot count air flowing from a spray booth air seal into a spray booth as air flowing through a natural draft opening into a PTE or into a temporary total enclosure unless you elect to treat that spray booth air seal as a natural draft opening. You cannot count air flowing from a bake oven air seal into a bake oven as air flowing through a natural draft opening into a PTE or into a temporary total enclosure unless you elect to treat that bake oven air seal as a natural draft opening.
(a)
Assuming 100 percent capture efficiency.
You may assume the capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met:
(1) The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a PTE and directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.
(2) All coatings and thinners used in the coating operation are applied within the capture system, and coating solvent flash-off and coating curing and drying occurs within the capture system. For example, this criterion is not met if parts enter the open shop environment when being moved between a spray booth and a curing oven.
(b)
Measuring capture efficiency.
If the capture system does not meet both of the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, then you must use one of the five procedures described in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section to measure capture efficiency. The capture efficiency measurements use TVH capture efficiency as a surrogate for organic HAP capture efficiency. For the protocols in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the capture efficiency measurement must consist of three test runs. Each test run must be at least 3 hours duration or the length of a production run, whichever is longer, up to 8 hours. For the purposes of this
test, a production run means the time required for a single part to go from the beginning to the end of production, which includes surface preparation activities and drying or curing time.
(c)
Liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure.
The liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol compares the mass of liquid TVH in materials used in the coating operation to the mass of TVH emissions not captured by the emission capture system. Use a temporary total enclosure or a building enclosure and the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section to measure emission capture system efficiency using the liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol.
(1) Either use a building enclosure or construct an enclosure around the coating operation where coatings and thinners are applied, and all areas where emissions from these applied coatings and thinners subsequently occur, such as flash-off, curing, and drying areas. The areas of the coating operation where capture devices collect emissions for routing to an add-on control device, such as the entrance and exit areas of an oven or spray booth, must also be inside the enclosure. The enclosure must meet the applicable definition of a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.
(2) Use Method 204A or F of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to determine the mass fraction of TVH liquid input from each coating and thinner used in the coating operation during each capture efficiency test run. To make the determination, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the methods.
(3) Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the total mass of TVH liquid input from all the coatings and thinners used in the coating operation during each capture efficiency test run.
ER26AP04.018
Where:
TVH
i
= Mass fraction of TVH in coating or thinner, i, used in the coating operation during the capture efficiency test run, kg TVH per kg material.
Vol
i
= Total volume of coating or thinner, i, used in the coating operation during the capture efficiency test run, liters.
D
i
= Density of coating or thinner, i, kg material per liter material.
n = Number of different coatings and thinners used in the coating operation during the capture efficiency test run.
(4) Use Method 204D or E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions that are not captured by the emission capture system; they are measured as they exit the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during each capture efficiency test run. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
(i) Use Method 204D if the enclosure is a temporary total enclosure.
(ii) Use Method 204E if the enclosure is a building enclosure. During the capture efficiency measurement, all organic compound emitting operations inside the building enclosure, other than the coating operation for which capture efficiency is being determined, must be shut down, but all fans and blowers must be operating normally.
(5) For each capture efficiency test run, determine the percent capture efficiency of the emission capture system using Equation 2 of this section:
ER26AP04.019
Where:
CE = Capture efficiency of the emission capture system vented to the add-on control device, percent.
TVH
used
= Total mass of TVH liquid input used in the coating operation during the capture efficiency test run, kg.
TVH
uncaptured
= Total mass of TVH that is not captured by the emission capture system and that exits from the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during the capture efficiency test run, kg.
(6) Determine the capture efficiency of the emission capture system as the average of the capture efficiencies measured in the three test runs.
(d)
Gas-to-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or a building enclosure.
The gas-to-gas protocol compares the mass of TVH emissions captured by the emission capture system to the mass of TVH emissions not captured. Use a temporary total enclosure or a building enclosure and the procedures in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section to measure emission capture system efficiency using the gas-to-gas protocol.
(1) Either use a building enclosure or construct an enclosure around the coating operation where coatings and thinners are applied, and all areas where emissions from these applied coatings and thinners subsequently occur, such as flash-off, curing, and drying areas. The areas of the coating operation where capture devices collect emissions generated by the coating operation for routing to an add-on control device, such as the entrance and exit areas of an oven or a spray booth, must also be inside the enclosure. The enclosure must meet the applicable definition of a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.
(2) Use Method 204B or C of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions captured by the emission capture system during each capture efficiency test run as measured at the inlet to the add-on control device. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
(i) The sampling points for the Method 204B or C measurement must be upstream from the add-on control device and must represent total emissions routed from the capture system and entering the add-on control device.
(ii) If multiple emission streams from the capture system enter the add-on control device without a single common duct, then the emissions entering the add-on control device must be simultaneously or sequentially measured in each duct, and the total emissions entering the add-on control device must be determined.
(3) Use Method 204D or E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions that are not captured by the emission capture system; they are measured as they exit the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during each capture efficiency test run. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
(i) Use Method 204D if the enclosure is a temporary total enclosure.
(ii) Use Method 204E if the enclosure is a building enclosure. During the capture efficiency measurement, all organic compound emitting operations inside the building enclosure, other than the coating operation for which capture efficiency is being determined, must be shut down, but all fans and blowers must be operating normally.
(4) For each capture efficiency test run, determine the percent capture efficiency of the emission capture system using Equation 3 of this section:
ER26AP04.020
Where:
CE = Capture efficiency of the emission capture system vented to the add-on control device, percent.

TVH
uncaptured
= Total mass of TVH that is not captured by the emission capture system and that exits from the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during the capture efficiency test run, kg.
(5) Determine the capture efficiency of the emission capture system as the average of the capture efficiencies measured in the three test runs.
(e)
Panel testing to determine the capture efficiency of flash-off or bake oven emissions.
You may conduct panel testing to determine the capture efficiency of flash-off or bake oven emissions using ASTM Method D5087-02, “Standard Test Method for Determining Amount of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Released from Solventborne Automotive Coatings and Available for Removal in a VOC Control Device (Abatement)” (incorporated by reference,

see
§ 63.14). You may conduct panel testing on representative coatings as described in “Protocol for Determining the Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Primer-Surfacer and Topcoat” EPA-453/R-08-002 (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14).

In this case, all of the coatings in a panel test grouping would have the same transfer efficiency.)
(2) Calculate the mass of VOC per volume of coating for coating, i, or the composite mass of VOC per volume of coating for the group of coatings including coating, i, used during the month in the spray booth(s) preceding the flash-off area or bake oven for which the panel test is conducted, kg, using Equation 6 of this section:

see
§ 63.14).
(3) As an alternative, you may choose to express the results of your panel tests in units of mass of VOC per mass of coating solids deposited and convert such results to a percent using Equation 7 of this section. If you panel test representative coatings, then you may convert the panel test result for each representative coating either to a unique percent capture efficiency for each coating grouped with that representative coating by using coating specific values for the mass of coating solids deposited per mass of coating used, mass fraction VOC, transfer efficiency, and mass fraction solids in Equations 7 and 8 of this section; or to a composite percent capture efficiency for the group of coatings by using composite values for the group of coatings for the mass of coating solids deposited per mass of coating used and average values for the mass of VOC per volume of coating, average values for the group of coatings for mass fraction VOC, transfer efficiency, and mass fraction solids in Equations 7 and 8 of this section. If you panel test each coating, then you must convert the panel test result for each coating to a unique percent capture efficiency for that coating by using coating specific values for the mass of coating solids deposited per mass of coating used, mass fraction VOC, transfer efficiency, and mass fraction solids in Equations 7 and 8 of this section.

(Transfer efficiency also may be determined by testing representative coatings. The same coating groupings may be appropriate used for both transfer efficiency testing and panel testing. In this case, all of the coatings in a panel test grouping would have the same transfer efficiency.)
(f)
Alternative capture efficiency procedure.
As an alternative to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c) through (e) and (g) of this section, you may determine capture efficiency using any other capture efficiency protocol and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the DQO or LCL approach as described in appendix A to subpart KK of this part.

§ 63.3166
How do I determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency?
You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency as part of the performance test required by § 63.3160, § 63.3163, or § 63.3171. You must conduct three test runs as specified in § 63.7(e)(3), and each test run must last at least 1 hour.
(a) For all types of add-on control devices, use the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Use EPA Method 1 or 1A of appendix A-1 to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to select sampling sites and velocity traverse points.
(2) Use EPA Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, or 2F of appendix A-1, or 2G of appendix A-2 to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.
(3) Use EPA Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A-2 to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight. The ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14), may be used as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.
(4) Use EPA Method 4 of appendix A-3 to 40 CFR part 60 to determine stack gas moisture.
(5) Methods for determining gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular weight, and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during each test run.
(b) Measure total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon at the inlet and outlet of the add-on control device simultaneously, using either EPA Method 25 or 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. You must use the same method for both the inlet and outlet measurements.
(1) Use Method 25 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be more than 50 parts per million by volume (ppmv) at the control device outlet.
(2) Use Method 25A if the add-on control device is an oxidizer and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be 50 ppmv or less at the control device outlet.
(3) Use Method 25A if the add-control device is not an oxidizer.
(4) You may use EPA Method 18 of appendix A-6 to 40 CFR part 60 to subtract methane emissions from measured total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon.
(c) If two or more add-on control devices are used for the same emission stream, then you must measure emissions at the outlet of each device. For example, if one add-on control device is a concentrator with an outlet for the high-volume, dilute stream that has been treated by the concentrator, and a second add-on control device is an oxidizer with an outlet for the low-volume, concentrated stream that is treated with the oxidizer, you must measure emissions at the outlet of the
oxidizer and the high volume dilute stream outlet of the concentrator.
(d) For each test run, determine the total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rates for the inlet and the outlet of the add-on control device, using Equation 1 of this section. If there is more than one inlet or outlet to the add-on control device, you must calculate the total gaseous organic mass flow rate using Equation 1 of this section for each inlet and each outlet and then total all of the inlet emissions and total all of the outlet emissions.

§ 63.3167
How do I establish the add-on control device operating limits during performance tests?
During the performance tests required by §§ 63.3160, 63.3163, and 63.3171 (and described in §§ 63.3164 and 63.3166), you must establish the operating limits required by § 63.3093 according to this section, unless you have received approval for alternative monitoring and operating limits under § 63.8(f) as specified in § 63.3093.
(a)
Thermal oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a thermal oxidizer, establish the operating limit according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
(2) Use all valid data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the performance test. This average combustion temperature is the minimum 3-hour average operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.
(3) As an alternative, if the latest operating permit issued before April 26, 2007, for the thermal oxidizer at your facility contains recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the combustion temperature that are consistent with the requirements for thermal oxidizers in 40 CFR 60.395(c), then you may set the minimum operating limit for the combustion temperature for each such thermal oxidizer at your affected source at 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average combustion temperature during the performance test of that thermal oxidizer. If you do not have an operating permit for the thermal oxidizer at your facility and the latest construction permit issued before April 26, 2007, for the thermal oxidizer at your facility
contains recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the combustion temperature that are consistent with the requirements for thermal oxidizers in 40 CFR 60.395(c), then you may set the minimum operating limit for the combustion temperature for each such thermal oxidizer at your affected source at 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average combustion temperature during the performance test of that thermal oxidizer. If you use 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the combustion temperature maintained during the performance test as the minimum operating limit for a thermal oxidizer, then you must keep the combustion temperature set point on that thermal oxidizer no lower than 14 degrees Celsius (25 degrees Fahrenheit) below the lower of that set point during the performance test for that thermal oxidizer and the average combustion temperature maintained during the performance test for that thermal oxidizer.
(b)
Catalytic oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) or paragraphs (b)(4) through (6) of this section.
(1) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.
(2) Use all valid data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed and the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test. The minimum 3-hour average operating limits for your catalytic oxidizer are the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test of that catalytic oxidizer and 80 percent of the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test of that catalytic oxidizer, except during periods of low production, the latter minimum operating limit is to maintain a positive temperature gradient across the catalyst bed. A low production period is when production is less than 80 percent of production rate during the performance test of that catalytic oxidizer.
(3) As an alternative, if the latest operating permit issued before April 26, 2007, for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility contains recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the temperature before the catalyst bed that are consistent with the requirements for catalytic oxidizers in 40 CFR 60.395(c), then you may set the minimum operating limits for each such catalytic oxidizer at your affected source at 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer and 80 percent of the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer, except during periods of low production the latter minimum operating limit is to maintain a positive temperature gradient across the catalyst bed. If you do not have an operating permit for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility and the latest construction permit issued before April 26, 2007, for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility contains recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the temperature before the catalyst bed that are consistent with the requirements for catalytic oxidizers in 40 CFR 60.395(c), then you may set the minimum operating limits for each such catalytic oxidizer at your affected source at 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer and 80 percent of the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer, except during periods of low production the latter minimum operating limit is to maintain a positive temperature gradient across the catalyst bed. A low production period is when production is less than 80 percent of production rate during the performance test. If you use 28 degrees Celsius
(50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test as the minimum operating limits for a catalytic oxidizer, then you must keep the set point for the temperature just before the catalyst bed on that catalytic oxidizer no lower than 14 degrees Celsius (25 degrees Fahrenheit) below the lower of that set point during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer and the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer.
(4) As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use all valid data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed during the performance test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.
(5) If the latest operating permit issued before April 26, 2007, for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility contains recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the temperature before the catalyst bed that are consistent with the requirements for catalytic oxidizers in 40 CFR 60.395(c), then you may set the minimum operating limit for each such catalytic oxidizer at your affected source at 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer. If you do not have an operating permit for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility and the latest construction permit issued before April 26, 2007, for the catalytic oxidizer at your facility contains recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the temperature before the catalyst bed that are consistent with the requirements for catalytic oxidizers in 40 CFR 60.395(c), then you may set the minimum operating limit for each such catalytic oxidizer at your affected source at 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer. If you use 28 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test as the minimum operating limit for a catalytic oxidizer, then you must keep the set point for the temperature just before the catalyst bed on that catalytic oxidizer no lower than 14 degrees Celsius (25 degrees Fahrenheit) below the lower of that set point during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer and the average temperature just before the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test for that catalytic oxidizer.
(6) You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor according to paragraph (b)(4) or (b)(5) of this section. The plan must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (
i.e.
, conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's recommended procedures. If problems are found during the catalyst activity test, you must replace the catalyst bed or take other corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations.
(ii) Monthly external inspection of the catalytic oxidizer system, including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.
(iii) Annual internal inspection of the catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found during the annual internal inspection of the catalyst, you must replace the catalyst bed or take other corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations. If the catalyst bed is replaced and is not of like or better kind and quality as
the old catalyst, then you must conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency according to § 63.3166. If a catalyst bed is replaced and the replacement catalyst is of like or better kind and quality as the old catalyst, then a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency is not required and you may continue to use the previously established operating limits for that catalytic oxidizer.
(c)
Regenerative carbon adsorbers.
If your add-on control device is a regenerative carbon adsorber, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) You must monitor and record the total regeneration desorbing gas (
e.g.,
steam or nitrogen) mass flow for each regeneration cycle and the carbon bed temperature after each carbon bed regeneration and cooling cycle for the regeneration cycle either immediately preceding or immediately following the performance test.
(2) The operating limits for your carbon adsorber are the minimum total desorbing gas mass flow recorded during the regeneration cycle and the maximum carbon bed temperature recorded after the cooling cycle.
(d)
Condensers.
If your add-on control device is a condenser, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.
(2) Use all valid data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature maintained during the performance test. This average condenser outlet gas temperature is the maximum 3-hour average operating limit for your condenser.
(e)
Concentrators.
If your add-on control device includes a concentrator, you must establish operating limits for the concentrator according to paragraphs (e)(1) and (2)of this section.
(1) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the desorption gas inlet temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three runs of the performance test.
(2) Use all valid data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average desorption gas inlet temperature. The minimum operating limit for the concentrator is 8 degrees Celsius (15 degrees Fahrenheit) below the average desorption gas inlet temperature maintained during the performance test for that concentrator. You must keep the set point for the desorption gas inlet temperature no lower than 6 degrees Celsius (10 degrees Fahrenheit) below the lower of that set point during the performance test for that concentrator and the average desorption gas inlet temperature maintained during the performance test for that concentrator.
(f)
Emission capture systems.
For each capture device that is not part of a PTE that meets the criteria of § 63.3165(a) and that is not capturing emissions from a downdraft spray booth or from a flash-off area or bake oven associated with a downdraft spray booth, establish an operating limit for either the gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure, as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. The operating limit for a PTE is specified in Table 1 to this subpart.
(1) During the capture efficiency determination required by §§ 63.3160 and 63.3163 and described in §§ 63.3164 and 63.3165, you must monitor and record either the gas volumetric flow rate or the duct static pressure for each separate capture device in your emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs at a point in the duct between the capture device and the add-on control device inlet.
(2) Calculate and record the average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure for the three test runs for each capture device, using all valid data. This average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure is the minimum operating limit for that specific capture device.

§ 63.3168
What are the requirements for continuous parameter monitoring system installation, operation, and maintenance?
(a)
General.
You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraphs (c), (e), (f), and (g) of this section according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section. You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section according to paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) of this section.
(1) The CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period. You must have a minimum of four equally-spaced successive cycles of CPMS operation in 1 hour.
(2) You must determine the average of all recorded readings for each successive 3-hour period of the emission capture system and add-on control device operation.
(3) You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check of the CPMS.
(4) You must maintain the CPMS at all times in accordance with § 63.3100(d) and have readily available necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.
(5) Before January 5, 2021, you must operate the CPMS and collect emission capture system and add-on control device parameter data at all times that a controlled coating operation is operating, except during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, if applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments). On and after January 5, 2021, you must operate the CPMS and collect emission capture system and add-on control device parameter data at all times that a controlled coating operation is operating in accordance with § 63.3100(d).
(6) Before January 5, 2021, you must not use emission capture system or add-on control device parameter data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities when calculating data averages. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating the data averages for determining compliance with the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits. On and after January 5, 2021, startups and shutdowns are normal operation for this source category. Emissions from these activities are to be included when determining if the standards specified in §§ 63.3090, 63.3091, 63.3092, 63.4292, and 63.4293 are being attained. You must not use emission capture system or add-on control device parameter data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities when calculating data averages. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating the data averages for determining compliance with the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits.
(7) A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the CPMS to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. Before January 5, 2021, any period for which the monitoring system is out of control and data are not available for required calculations is a deviation from the monitoring requirements. On and after January 5, 2021, except for periods of required quality assurance or control activities, any period during which the CPMS fails to operate and record data continuously as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or generates data that cannot be included in calculating averages as specified in this paragraph (a)(7) constitutes a deviation from the monitoring requirements.
(b)
Capture system bypass line.
You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section for each emission capture system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
(1) You must monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism controlling the bypass line in a nondiverting position in such a way that the valve or closure mechanism cannot be opened without creating a record that the valve was opened. The method used to monitor or secure the valve or closure
mechanism must meet one of the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i)
Flow control position indicator.
Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow control position indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes and provides a record indicating whether the emissions are directed to the add-on control device or diverted from the add-on control device. The time of occurrence and flow control position must be recorded, as well as every time the flow direction is changed. The flow control position indicator must be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
(ii)
Car-seal or lock-and-key valve closures.
Secure any bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. You must visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position, and the emissions are not diverted away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
(iii)
Valve closure monitoring.
Ensure that any bypass line valve is in the closed (nondiverting) position through monitoring of valve position at least once every 15 minutes. You must inspect the monitoring system at least once every month to verify that the monitor will indicate valve position.
(iv)
Automatic shutdown system.
Use an automatic shutdown system in which the coating operation is stopped when flow is diverted by the bypass line away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere when the coating operation is running. You must inspect the automatic shutdown system at least once every month to verify that it will detect diversions of flow and shut down the coating operation.

A compliance period consists of 1 month. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 63.3170 is a compliance period consisting of that month. You must perform the calculations in § 63.3171 on a monthly basis.
(b) If the organic HAP emission rate for any 1 month compliance period exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.3090(b) or § 63.3091(b), this is a deviation from the emission limitation for that compliance period and must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3110(c)(6) and 63.3120(a)(6).
(c) You must meet the requirements of § 63.3163(c) through (j).
§ 63.3174
What are the requirements for a capture system or add-on control device which is not taken into account when demonstrating compliance with the applicable emission limitations?

# Appendix A to Subpart IIII of Part 63—Determination of Capture Efficiency of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Spray Booth Emissions From Solvent-borne Coatings Using Panel Testing
1.0 Applicability, Principle, and Summary of Procedure.
1.1 Applicability.
This procedure applies to the determination of capture efficiency of automobile and light-duty truck spray booth emissions from solvent-borne coatings using panel testing. This procedure can be used to determine capture efficiency for partially controlled spray booths (
e.g.,
automated spray zones controlled and manual spray zones not controlled) and for fully controlled spray booths.
1.2 Principle.
1.2.1 The volatile organic compounds (VOC) associated with the coating solids deposited on a part (or panel) in a controlled spray booth zone (or group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones) partition themselves between the VOC that volatilize in the controlled spray booth zone (principally between the spray gun and the part) and the VOC that remain on the part (or panel) when the part (or panel) leaves the controlled spray booth zone. For solvent-borne coatings essentially all of the VOC associated with the coating solids deposited on a part (or panel) in a controlled spray booth zone that volatilize in the controlled spray booth zone pass through the waterwash and are exhausted from the controlled spray booth zone to the control device.
1.2.2 The VOC associated with the overspray coating solids in a controlled spray booth zone partition themselves between the VOC that volatilize in the controlled spray booth zone and the VOC that are still tied to the overspray coating solids when the overspray coating solids hit the waterwash. For solvent-borne coatings almost all of the VOC associated with the overspray coating solids that volatilize in the controlled spray booth zone pass through the waterwash and are exhausted from the controlled spray booth zone to the control device. The exact fate of the VOC still tied to the overspray coating solids when the overspray coating solids hit the waterwash is unknown. This procedure assumes that none of the VOC still tied to the overspray coating solids when the overspray coating solids hit the waterwash are captured and delivered to the control device. Much of this VOC may become entrained in the water along with the overspray coating solids. Most of the VOC that become entrained in the water along with the overspray coating solids leave the water, but the point at which this VOC leave the water is unknown. Some of the VOC still tied to the overspray coating solids when the overspray coating solids hit the waterwash may pass through the waterwash and be exhausted from the controlled spray booth zone to the control device.
1.2.3 This procedure assumes that the portion of the VOC associated with the overspray coating solids in a controlled spray booth zone that volatilizes in the controlled spray booth zone, passes through the waterwash and is exhausted from the controlled spray booth zone to the control device is equal to the portion of the VOC associated with the coating solids deposited on a part (or panel) in that controlled spray booth zone that volatilizes in the controlled spray booth zone, passes through the waterwash, and is exhausted from the controlled spray booth zone to the control device. This assumption is equivalent to treating all of the coating solids sprayed in the controlled spray booth zone as if they are deposited coating solids (
i.e.,
assuming 100 percent transfer efficiency) for purposes of using a panel test to determine spray booth capture efficiency.
1.2.4 This is a conservative (low) assumption for the portion of the VOC associated with the overspray coating solids in a controlled spray booth zone that volatilizes in the controlled spray booth zone. Thus, this assumption results in an underestimate of conservative capture efficiency. The overspray coating solids have more travel time and distance from the spray gun to the waterwash than the deposited coating solids have between the spray gun and the part (or panel). Therefore, the portion of the VOC associated with the overspray coating solids in a controlled spray booth zone that volatilizes in the controlled spray booth zone should be greater than the portion of the VOC associated with the coating solids deposited on a part (or panel) in that controlled spray booth zone that volatilizes in that controlled spray booth zone.
1.3 Summary of Procedure.
1.3.1 A panel test is performed to determine the mass of VOC that remains on the panel when the panel leaves a controlled spray booth zone. The total mass of VOC associated with the coating solids deposited on the panel is calculated.
1.3.2 The percent of the total VOC associated with the coating solids deposited on the panel in the controlled spray booth zone that remains on the panel when the panel leaves the controlled section of the spray booth is then calculated from the ratio of the two previously determined masses. The percent of the total VOC associated with the coating solids deposited on the panel in the controlled spray booth zone that is captured and delivered to the control device equals 100 minus this percentage. (The mass of VOC associated with the coating solids deposited on the panel which is volatilized and captured
in the controlled spray booth zone equals the difference between the total mass of VOC associated with the coating solids deposited on the panel and the mass of VOC remaining with the coating solids deposited on the panel when the panel leaves the controlled spray booth zone.)
1.3.3 The percent of the total VOC associated with the coating sprayed in the controlled spray booth zone that is captured and delivered to the control device is assumed to be equal to the percent of the total VOC associated with the coating solids deposited on the panel in the controlled spray booth zone that is captured and delivered to the control device. The percent of the total VOC associated with the coating sprayed in the entire spray booth that is captured and delivered to the control device can be calculated by multiplying the percent of the total VOC associated with the coating sprayed in the controlled spray booth zone that is captured and delivered to the control device by the fraction of coating sprayed in the spray booth that is sprayed in the controlled spray booth zone.
2.0 Procedure.
2.1 You may conduct panel testing to determine the capture efficiency of spray booth emissions. You must follow the instructions and calculations in this appendix A, and use the panel testing procedures in ASTM Method D5087-02, “Standard Test Method for Determining Amount of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Released from Solvent-borne Automotive Coatings and Available for Removal in a VOC Control Device (Abatement)” (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14), or the guidelines presented in “Protocol for Determining the Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Primer-Surfacer and Topcoat” EPA-453/R-08-002 (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14). You must weigh panels at the points described in section 2.5 of this appendix A and perform calculations as described in sections 3 and 4 of this appendix A. You may conduct panel tests on the production paint line in your facility or in a laboratory simulation of the production paint line in your facility.
2.2 You may conduct panel testing on representative coatings as described in “Protocol for Determining the Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Primer-Surfacer and Topcoat” EPA-453/R-08-002 (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14). If you panel test representative coatings, then you may calculate either a unique percent capture efficiency value for each coating grouped with that representative coating, or a composite percent capture efficiency value for the group of coatings. If you panel test each coating, then you must convert the panel test result for each coating to a unique percent capture efficiency value for that coating.
2.3 Identification of Controlled Spray Booth Zones.
You must identify each controlled spray booth zone or each group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones to be tested. (For example, a controlled bell zone immediately followed by a controlled robotic zone.) Separate panel tests are required for non-contiguous controlled spray booth zones. The flash zone between the last basecoat zone and the first clearcoat zone makes these zones non-contiguous.
2.4 Where to Apply Coating to the Panel.
If you are conducting a panel test for a single controlled spray booth zone, then you must apply coating to the panel only in that controlled spray booth zone. If you are conducting a panel test for a group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones, then you must apply coating to the panel only in that group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones.
2.5 How to Process and When to Weigh the Panel.
The instructions in this section pertain to panel testing of coating, i, or of the coating representing the group of coatings that includes coating, i.
2.5.1 You must weigh the blank panel. (Same as in bake oven panel test.) The mass of the blank panel is represented by W
blank,i
(grams).
2.5.2 Apply coating, i, or the coating representing coating, i, to the panel in the controlled spray booth zone or group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones being tested (in plant test), or in a simulation of the controlled spray booth zone or group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones being tested (laboratory test).
2.5.3 Remove and weigh the wet panel as soon as the wet panel leaves the controlled spray booth zone or group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones being tested. (Different than bake oven panel test.) This weighing must be conducted quickly to avoid further evaporation of VOC. The mass of the wet panel is represented by W
wet,i
(grams).
2.5.4 Return the wet panel to the point in the coating process or simulation of the coating process where it was removed for weighing.
2.5.5 Allow the panel to travel through the rest of the coating process in the plant or laboratory simulation of the coating process. You must not apply any more coating to the panel after it leaves the controlled spray booth zone (or group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones) being tested. The rest of the coating process or simulation of the coating process consists of:
2.5.5.1 All of the spray booth zone(s) or simulation of all of the spray booth zone(s) located after the controlled spray booth zone or group of contiguous controlled spray
booth zones being tested and before the bake oven where the coating applied to the panel is cured,
2.5.5.2 All of the flash-off area(s) or simulation of all of the flash-off area(s) located after the controlled spray booth zone or group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones being tested and before the bake oven where the coating applied to the panel is cured, and
2.5.5.3 The bake oven or simulation of the bake oven where the coating applied to the panel is cured.
2.5.6 After the panel exits the bake oven, you must cool and weigh the baked panel. (Same as in bake oven panel test.) The mass of the baked panel is represented by W
baked,i
(grams).
3.0 Panel Calculations.
The instructions in this section pertain to panel testing of coating, i, or of the coating representing the group of coatings that includes coating, i.
3.1 The mass of coating solids (from coating, i, or from the coating representing coating, i, in the panel test) deposited on the panel equals the mass of the baked panel minus the mass of the blank panel as shown in Equation A-1.

4.0 Converting Panel Result to Percent Capture.
The instructions in this section pertain to panel testing of for coating, i, or of the coating representing the group of coatings that includes coating, i.
4.1 If you panel test representative coatings, then you may convert the panel test result for each representative coating from section 3.3 of this appendix A either to a unique percent capture efficiency value for each coating grouped with that representative coating by using coating specific values for the mass fraction coating solids and mass fraction VOC in section 4.2 of this appendix A, or to a composite percent capture efficiency value for the group of coatings by using the average values for the group of coatings for mass fraction coating solids and mass fraction VOC in section 4.2 of this appendix A. If you panel test each coating, then you must convert the panel test result for each coating to a unique percent capture efficiency value by using coating specific values for the mass fraction coating solids and mass fraction VOC in section 4.2 of this appendix A. The mass fraction of VOC in the
coating and the mass fraction of solids in the coating must be determined by Method 24 (appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60) or by following the guidelines for combining analytical VOC content and formulation solvent content presented in “Protocol for Determining the Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Primer-Surfacer and Topcoat” EPA-453/R-08-002 (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14).

see
§ 63.14).
4.3 The percent of VOC for coating, i, or composite percent of VOC for the group of coatings including coating, i, associated with the coating sprayed in the controlled spray booth zone (or group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones) being tested that is captured in the controlled spray booth zone or group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones being tested, CE

# Source:
67 FR 72341, Dec. 4, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.3280
What is in this subpart?
This subpart describes the actions you must take to reduce emissions of organic hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from paper and other web coating operations. This subpart establishes emission standards for web coating lines and specifies what you must do to comply if you own or operate a facility with web coating lines that is a major source of HAP. Certain requirements apply to all who are subject to this subpart; others depend on the means you use to comply with an emission standard.
§ 63.3290
Does this subpart apply to me?
The provisions of this subpart apply to each new and existing facility that is a major source of HAP, as defined in § 63.2, at which web coating lines are operated.
§ 63.3300
Which of my emission sources are affected by this subpart?
The affected source subject to this subpart is the collection of all web coating lines at your facility. This includes web coating lines engaged in the coating of metal webs that are used in flexible packaging, and web coating lines engaged in the coating of fabric substrates for use in pressure sensitive tape and abrasive materials. Web coating lines specified in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section are not part of the affected source of this subpart.
(a) Any web coating line that is stand-alone equipment under subpart KK of this part (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Printing and Publishing Industry) which the owner or operator includes in the affected source under subpart KK.
(b) Any web coating line that is a product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic press under subpart KK of this part (NESHAP for the Printing and Publishing Industry) which is included in the affected source under subpart KK.
(c) Web coating in lithography, screenprinting, letterpress, and narrow-web flexographic printing processes.
(d) Any web coating line subject to subpart EE of this part (NESHAP for Magnetic Tape Manufacturing Operations).
(e) Any web coating line subject to subpart SSSS of this part (NESHAP for Surface Coating of Metal Coil).
(f) Any web coating line subject to subpart OOOO of this part (NESHAP for the Printing, Coating, and Dyeing of Fabrics and Other Textiles). This includes any web coating line that coats both a paper or other web substrate and a fabric or other textile substrate, except for a fabric substrate used for pressure sensitive tape and abrasive materials.
(g) Any web coating line that is defined as research or laboratory equipment in § 63.3310.
(h) Any web coating line that coats both paper or a web, and another substrate such as fabric, may comply with the subpart of this part that applies to the predominant activity conducted on the affected source. Predominant activity for this subpart is 90 percent of the mass of substrate coated during the compliance period. For example, a web coating line that coats 90 percent or more of a paper substrate, and 10 percent or less of a fabric or other textile substrate, would be subject to this subpart and not subpart OOOO of this part. You may use data for any reasonable time period of at least one year in determining the relative amount of coating activity, as long as they are expected to represent the way the source will continue to operate in the future. You must demonstrate and document the predominant activity annually.
(i) Any web coating line subject to this part that is modified to include printing activities, may continue to demonstrate compliance with this part, in lieu of demonstrating compliance with subpart KK of this part. Any web coating line with product and packaging rotogravure print station(s) and/or a wide-web flexographic print station(s) that is subject to this subpart may elect to continue demonstrating compliance with this subpart in lieu of subpart KK of this part, if the mass of the materials applied to the line's print station(s) in a month ever exceed 5 percent of the total mass of materials applied onto the line during the same period.
(j) If all of the subject web coating lines at your facility utilize non-HAP coatings, you can become exempt from the reporting requirements of this subpart, provided you submit a one-time report as required in § 63.3370(s) to your permitting authority documenting the use of only non-HAP coatings.

(2)
Liquid-liquid material balance.
If you are demonstrating compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320 through liquid-liquid material balance, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a device that indicates the cumulative amount of volatile matter recovered by the solvent recovery device on a monthly basis. The device must be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±2.0 percent by mass.
(e)
Continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS).
If you are using a control device to comply with the emission standards in § 63.3320, you must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraphs (e)(10) and (11) and (f) of this section according to the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (9) of this section. You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraph (c) of this section according to paragraphs (e)(5) through (8) of this section.

(ii) Provided all of the readings recorded in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section clearly demonstrate continuous compliance with the standard that applies to you, then you are not required to determine the hourly average of all recorded readings.
(4) You must determine the block 3-hour average of all recorded readings for each operating period. To calculate the average for each 3-hour averaging period, you must have at least two of three of the hourly averages for that period using only average values that are based on valid data (
i.e.,
not from out-of-control periods).
(5) Except for temperature sensors, you must develop a quality control program that must contain, at a minimum, a written protocol that describes the procedures for each of the operations in § 63.3350(e)(5)(i) through (vi). The owner or operator shall keep these written procedures on record for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this part, to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator. If the performance evaluation plan is revised, the owner or operator shall keep previous (
i.e.,
superseded) versions of the performance evaluation plan on record to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. For temperature sensors, you must follow the requirements in § 63.3350(e)(10).

Data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities shall not be used
for purposes of calculating the emissions concentrations and percent reductions specified in § 63.3370. You must use all the valid data collected during all other periods in assessing compliance of the control device and associated control system. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
(9) Any averaging period for which you do not have valid monitoring data and such data are required constitutes a deviation, and you must notify the Administrator in accordance with § 63.3400(c).
(10)
Oxidizer.
If you are using an oxidizer to comply with the emission standards of this subpart, you must comply with paragraphs (e)(10)(i) through (vi) of this section.

Method 311 (appendix A to this part) test data and a facility's formulation data, and the Method 311 test value is higher, the Method 311 data will govern. Formulation data may be used provided that the information represents all organic HAP present at a level equal to or greater than 0.1 percent for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in section A.6.4 of appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.1200 and equal to or greater than 1.0 percent for other organic HAP compounds in any raw material used.
(4)
As-applied organic HAP mass fraction.
If the as-purchased coating material is applied to the web without any solvent or other material added, then the as-applied organic HAP mass fraction is equal to the as-purchased organic HAP mass fraction. Otherwise, the as-applied organic HAP mass fraction must be calculated using Equation 4 of § 63.3370.
(d)
Volatile organic and coating solids content.
If you determine compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320 by means other than determining the overall organic HAP control efficiency of a control device and you choose to use the volatile organic content as a surrogate for the organic HAP content of coatings, you must determine the as-purchased volatile organic content and coating solids content of each coating material applied by following the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, and the as-applied volatile organic content and coating solids content of each coating material by following the procedures in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(1)
Method 24.
You may determine the volatile organic and coating solids mass fraction of each coating applied using Method 24 (appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60). The Method 24 determination may be performed by the manufacturer of the material and the results provided to you. When using volatile organic compound content as a surrogate for HAP, you may also use ASTM D3960-98, (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) as an alternative to Method 24. If these values cannot be determined using either of these methods, you must submit an alternative technique for determining their values for approval by the Administrator.
(2)
Formulation data.
You may determine the volatile organic content and coating solids content of a coating material based on formulation data and may rely on volatile organic content data provided by the manufacturer of the material. In the event of any inconsistency between the formulation data and the results of Method 24 of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 and the Method 24 results are higher, the results of Method 24 will govern.
(3)
As-applied volatile organic content and coating solids content.
If the as-purchased coating material is applied to the web without any solvent or other material added, then the as-applied volatile organic content is equal to the as-purchased volatile content and the as-applied coating solids content is equal to the as-purchased coating solids content. Otherwise, the as-applied volatile organic content must be calculated using Equation 5 to § 63.3370(c)(4) and the as-applied coating solids content must be calculated using Equation 6 to § 63.3370(d).
(e)
Control device efficiency.
If you are using an add-on control device other than solvent recovery, such as an oxidizer, to comply with the emission standards in § 63.3320, you must conduct a performance test to establish the destruction or removal efficiency of the control device according to the methods and procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. During the performance test, you must establish the operating limits required by § 63.3321 according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(1)
Initial performance test.
An initial performance test to establish the destruction or removal efficiency of the control device used to comply with the emission standards in § 63.3320 must be conducted such that control device inlet and outlet testing is conducted simultaneously, and the data are reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section. You must conduct three test runs as specified in § 63.7(e)(3), and each test run must last at least 1 hour.
(i) Method 1 or 1A of appendix A-1 to 40 CFR part 60 must be used for sample and velocity traverses to determine sampling locations.
(ii) Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, or 2F of appendix A-1 to 40 CFR part 60, or Method 2G of appendix A-2 to 40 CFR part 60 must be used to determine gas volumetric flow rate.
(iii) Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A-2 to 40 CFR part 60 must be used for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight. You may also use as an alternative to Method 3B the manual method for measuring the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide content of exhaust gas in ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 Part 10, (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
(iv) Method 4 of appendix A-3 to 40 CFR part 60 must be used to determine stack gas moisture.
(v) Methods for determining the gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular weight, and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during each test run.
(vi) Method 25 or 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 must be used to determine total gaseous organic matter concentration. Use the same test method for both the inlet and outlet measurements which must be conducted simultaneously. You must submit notice of the intended test method to the Administrator for approval along with notification of the performance test required under § 63.7(b). You must use method 25A if any of the conditions described in paragraphs (e)(1)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section apply to the control device.
(A) The control device is not an oxidizer.
(B) The control device is an oxidizer but an exhaust gas volatile organic matter concentration of 50 ppmv or less is required to comply with the emission standards in § 63.3320; or
(C) The control device is an oxidizer but the volatile organic matter concentration at the inlet to the control system and the required level of control are such that they result in exhaust gas volatile organic matter concentrations of 50 ppmv or less; or
(D) The control device is an oxidizer but because of the high efficiency of the control device the anticipated volatile organic matter concentration at the control device exhaust is 50 ppmv or less, regardless of inlet concentration.
(vii) Except as provided in § 63.7(e)(3), each performance test must consist of three separate runs with each run conducted for at least 1 hour under the conditions that exist when the affected source is operating under normal operating conditions. For the purpose of determining volatile organic compound concentrations and mass flow rates, the average of the results of all the runs will apply.
(viii) Volatile organic matter mass flow rates must be determined for each run specified in paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this section using Equation 1:
ER09JY20.023
Where:
M
f
= Total organic volatile matter mass flow rate, kilograms (kg)/hour (h).

(2)
Process information.
You must record such process information as may be necessary to determine the conditions in existence at the time of the performance test. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown. You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(3)
Operating limits.
If you are using one or more add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance to comply with the emission standards in § 63.3320, you must establish the applicable operating limits required by § 63.3321. These operating limits apply to each add-on emission control device, and you must establish the operating limits during the performance test required by paragraph (e) of this section according to the requirements in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) Thermal oxidizer. If your add-on control device is a thermal oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
(A) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
(B) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the performance test. Maintain the 3-hour average combustion temperature no more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit lower than this average combustion temperature.
(ii) Catalytic oxidizer. If your add-on control device is a catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (e)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) or paragraphs (e)(3)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section.
(A) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.
(B) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed and the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test. Maintain the 3-hour average combustion temperature no more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit lower than this average combustion temperature or maintain the 3-hour average temperature difference across the catalyst bed at no less than 80 percent of this average temperature differential, provided that the minimum temperature is always 50 degrees Fahrenheit above the catalyst's ignition temperature.
(C) As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(D) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed during the performance test. Maintain the 3-hour average combustion temperature no more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit lower than this average combustion temperature.
(D) You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor according to paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section. The plan must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii)(D)(1) through (3) of this section.
(
1
) Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (
i.e.,
conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's recommended procedures,
(
2
) Monthly inspection of the oxidizer system including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems, and
(
3
) Annual internal and monthly external visual inspection of the catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found, you must take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency in accordance with this section.
(4)
Control Destruction Efficiency Curve Development.
If you are using one or more add-on control devices other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance to comply with the emission standards in § 63.3320, you may establish a control destruction efficiency curve for use in estimating emissions that occur during deviations of the 3-hour operating parameters. This curve can be generated using test data or manufacturer's data that specifically documents the level of control at varying temperatures for your control device.
(f)
Capture efficiency.
If you demonstrate compliance by meeting the requirements of § 63.3370(f), (g), (h), (i), (j)(2), (l), (o)(2) or (3), or (q), you must determine capture efficiency using the procedures in paragraph (f)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, as applicable.
(1) You may assume your capture efficiency equals 100 percent if your capture system is a permanent total enclosure (PTE). You must confirm that your capture system is a PTE by demonstrating that it meets the requirements of section 6 of EPA Method 204 of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M, and that all exhaust gases from the enclosure are delivered to a control device.
(2) You may determine capture efficiency according to the protocols for testing with temporary total enclosures that are specified in Methods 204 and 204A through F of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M. You may exclude never-controlled work stations from such capture efficiency determinations.
(3) You may use any capture efficiency protocol and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the Data Quality Objective or the Lower Confidence Limit approach as described in appendix A of subpart KK of this part. You may exclude never-controlled work stations from such capture efficiency determinations.
(g)
Volatile matter retained in the coated web or otherwise not emitted to the atmosphere.
You may choose to take into account the mass of volatile matter retained in the coated web after curing or drying or otherwise not emitted to the atmosphere when determining compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320. If you choose this option, you must develop a site- and product-specific emission factor (EF) and determine the amount of volatile matter retained in the coated web or otherwise not emitted using Equation 3 to § 63.3360(g)(1). The EF must be developed by conducting a performance test using an approved EPA test method, or alternative approved by the Administrator by obtaining the average of a three-run test. You may additionally use manufacturer's emissions test data (as long as it replicates the facility's coating formulation and operating conditions), or a mass-balance type approach using a modified Method 24 (including ASTM D5403-93 for radiation-cureable coatings). The EF should equal the proportion of the mass of volatile organics emitted to the mass of volatile organics in the coating materials evaluated. You may use the EF in your compliance calculations only for periods that the work station(s) was (were) used to make the product, or a similar product, corresponding to that produced during the performance test. You must develop a separate EF for each group of different products that you choose to utilize an EF for calculating emissions by conducting a separate performance test for that group of products. You must conduct a
periodic performance test to re-establish the EF if there is a change in coating formulation, operating conditions, or other change that could reasonably be expected to increase emissions since the time of the last test that was used to establish the EF.
(1) Calculate the mass of volatile organics retained in the coated web or otherwise not emitted for the month from each group of similar products using Equation 3:
ER09JY20.018
Where:
M
vret
= Mass of volatile matter retained in the coated web after curing or drying, or otherwise not emitted to the atmosphere, kg.

EF
i
= Volatile organic matter site- and product-specific emission factor (three-run average determined from performance testing, evaluated as proportion of mass volatile organics emitted to mass of volatile organics in the coatings used during the performance test).
(2) [Reserved]
(h)
Control devices in series.
If you use multiple control devices in series to comply with the emission standards in § 63.3320, the performance test must include, at a minimum, the inlet to the first control device in the series, the outlet of the last control device in the series, and all intermediate streams (
e.g.,
gaseous exhaust to the atmosphere or a liquid stream from a recovery device) that are not subsequently treated by any of the control devices in the series.

The allowable organic HAP limit is then calculated based on coating material applied at greater than or equal to 20 mass percent coating solids complying with 0.2 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids at an existing affected source or 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids at a new affected source, and coating material applied at less than 20 mass percent coating solids complying with 4 mass percent organic HAP at an existing affected source and 1.6 mass-percent organic HAP at a new affected source as follows:
(1) Determine the as-purchased mass of each coating material applied each month.
(2) Determine the as-purchased coating solids content of each coating material applied each month in accordance with § 63.3360(d)(1).
(3) Determine the as-purchased mass fraction of each coating material which was applied at 20 mass percent or greater coating solids content on an as-applied basis.
(4) Determine the total mass of each solvent, diluent, thinner, or reducer added to coating materials which were applied at less than 20 mass percent coating solids content on an as-applied basis each month.
(5) Calculate the monthly allowable organic HAP emissions using Equation 17 for an existing affected source:

Combinations of capture and control.
If you operate more than one capture system, more than one control device, one or more never-controlled work stations, or one or more intermittently-controlled work stations, you must calculate organic HAP emissions according to the procedures in paragraphs (o)(1) through (4) of this section, and use the calculation procedures specified in paragraph (o)(5) of this section to convert the monitoring and other data into units of the selected control option in paragraphs (f) through (i) of this section. Use the procedures specified in paragraph (o)(6) of this section to demonstrate compliance.
(1)
Solvent recovery system using liquid-liquid material balance compliance demonstration.
If you choose to comply by means of a liquid-liquid material balance for each solvent recovery system used to control one or more web coating lines, you must determine the organic HAP emissions for those web coating lines controlled by that solvent recovery system either:
(i) In accordance with paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (iii) and (v) through (vii) of this section, if the web coating lines controlled by that solvent recovery system have only always-controlled work stations; or
(ii) In accordance with paragraphs (j)(1)(ii), (iii), (v), and (vi) and (p) of this section, if the web coating lines controlled by that solvent recovery system have one or more never-controlled or intermittently-controlled work stations.
(2)

To demonstrate compliance through an initial test of capture efficiency, continuous monitoring of a capture system operating parameter, and a CEMS on each solvent recovery system used to control one or more web coating lines, you must:
(i) For each capture system delivering emissions to that solvent recovery system, monitor the operating parameter established in accordance with § 63.3350(f) to ensure capture system efficiency; and
(ii) Determine the organic HAP emissions for those web coating lines served by each capture system delivering emissions to that solvent recovery system either:
(A) In accordance with paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (iii), (v), (vi), and (viii) of this section, if the web coating lines served by that capture and control system have only always-controlled work stations; or
(B) In accordance with paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (iii), (vi), and (p) of this section, if the web coating lines served by that capture and control system have one or more never-controlled or intermittently-controlled work stations.

(i) Monitor the operating parameter in accordance with § 63.3350(e) to ensure control device efficiency; and
(ii) For each capture system delivering emissions to that oxidizer, monitor the operating parameter established in accordance with § 63.3350(f) to ensure capture efficiency; and
(iii) Determine the organic HAP emissions for those web coating lines served by each capture system delivering emissions to that oxidizer either:
(A) In accordance with paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section, if the web coating lines served by that capture and control system have only always-controlled work stations; or

(4)
Uncontrolled coating lines.
If you own or operate one or more uncontrolled web coating lines, you must determine the organic HAP applied on those web coating lines using Equation 10. The organic HAP emitted from an uncontrolled web coating line is equal to the organic HAP applied on that web coating line.
(5) Convert the information obtained under paragraphs (o)(1) through (4) of this section into the units of the selected compliance option using the calculation procedures specified in paragraphs (o)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section.

(ii)
Coating solids applied.
If demonstrating compliance on the basis of organic HAP emission rate based on coating solids applied or emission of less than the calculated allowable organic HAP, the owner or operator must determine the coating solids content of each coating material applied during the month following the procedure in § 63.3360(d).

As an alternative to § 63.3370(b) through (p), you may demonstrate monthly compliance using a mass-balance approach in accordance with this section, except for any month that you elect to meet the emission limitation in § 63.3320(b)(4). The mass-balance approach should be performed as follows:
(1) Separately for each individual/grouping(s) of lines, you must sum the mass of organic HAP emitted during the month and divide by the corresponding total mass of all organic HAP applied on the lines, or total mass of coating materials applied on the lines, or total mass of coating solids applied on the lines, for the same period, in accordance with the emission limitation that you have elected at § 63.3320(b)(1) through (3) for the month's demonstration. You may also choose to use volatile organic content as a surrogate for organic HAP for the compliance demonstration in accordance with § 63.3360(d). You are required to include all emissions and inputs that occur during periods that each line or grouping of lines operates in accordance with the applicability criteria in § 63.3300.
(2) You must include all of the organic HAP emitted by your individual/grouping(s) of lines, as follows.
(i) You must record the mass of organic HAP or volatile organic content utilized at all work stations of all of your individually/grouping(s) of lines. You must additionally record the mass of all coating materials applied at these work stations if you are demonstrating compliance for the month with the emission limitation at § 63.3320(b)(2) (the “coating materials” option). You must additionally record the mass of all coating solids applied at these work stations if you are demonstrating compliance for the month with the emission limitation at § 63.3320(b)(3) (the “coating solids” option).
(ii) You must assume that all of the organic HAP input to all never-controlled work stations is emitted, unless you have determined an emission factor in accordance with § 63.3360(g).
(iii) For all always-controlled work stations, you must assume that all of the organic HAP or volatile organic content is emitted, less the reductions provided by the corresponding capture
system and control device, in accordance with the most recently measured capture and destruction efficiencies, or in accordance with the measured mass of volatile organic compounds (VOC) recovered for the month (
e.g.,
carbon control or condensers). You may account for organic HAP or volatile organic content retained in the coated web or otherwise not emitted if you have determined an emission factor in accordance with § 63.3360(g).
(iv) For all intermittently-controlled work stations, you must assume that all of the organic HAP or volatile organic content is emitted during periods of no control. During periods of control, you must assume that all of the organic HAP or volatile organic content is emitted, less the reductions provided by the corresponding capture system and control device, in accordance with the most recently measured capture and destruction efficiencies, or in accordance with the measured mass of VOC recovered for the month (
e.g.,
carbon control or condensers). You may account for organic HAP or volatile organic content retained in the coated web or otherwise not emitted if you have determined an emission factor in accordance with § 63.3360(g).
(v) You must record the organic HAP or volatile organic content input to all work stations of your individual/grouping(s) of lines and the mass of coating materials and/or solids applied, if applicable, and determine corresponding emissions during all periods of operation, including malfunctions or startups and shutdowns of any web coating line or control device.
(3) You are in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b) if each of your individual/grouping(s) of lines, meets one of the requirements in paragraphs (r)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, as applicable. If operating parameter limit deviations occurred, including periods that the oxidizer control device(s), if any, operated at an average combustion temperature more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit below the temperature established in accordance with § 63.3360(e), or the 3-hour average temperature difference across the catalyst bed at no less than 80 percent of this average temperature differential and the catalytic oxidizer maintained a minimum temperature 50 degrees Fahrenheit above the catalyst's ignition temperature, you are in compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320(b) for the month, if assuming no control of emissions for each 3-hour deviation period (or in accordance with an alternate approved method), one of the requirements in paragraphs (r)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section was met.
(i) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on HAP applied is no more than 0.05 kg organic HAP per kg HAP applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.02 kg organic HAP per kg HAP applied at a new affected source; or
(ii) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on coating solids applied is no more than 0.20 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.08 kg organic HAP per kg coating solids applied at a new affected source; or
(iii) The total mass of organic HAP emitted by the affected source based on material applied is no more than 0.04 kg organic HAP per kg material applied at an existing affected source and no more than 0.016 kg organic HAP per kg material applied at a new affected source.
(s)
Non-HAP coating.
You must demonstrate that all of the coatings applied at all of the web coating lines at the affected source have organic HAP contents below 0.1 percent by mass for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in section A.6.4 of appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.1200, and below 1.0 percent by mass for other organic HAP compounds using the procedures in § 63.3370(s)(1) through (3).
(1) Determine the organic HAP mass fraction of each coating material “as purchased” by following one of the procedures in paragraphs § 63.3360(c)(1) through (3) and determine the organic HAP mass fraction of each coating material “as applied” by following the procedures in paragraph § 63.3360(c)(4).
(2) Submit to your permitting authority a report certifying that all coatings applied at all of the web coating lines at your effected source are non-HAP coatings.
(3) Maintain records of coating formulations used as required in § 63.3410(a)(1)(iii).
(4) Resume reporting requirements if any of the coating formulations are modified to exceed the thresholds in § 63.3370(s) or new coatings which exceed the thresholds in paragraph (s) of this section are used.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.3480
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for metal can surface coating facilities. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations.
§ 63.3481
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the source category to which this subpart applies is surface coating of metal cans and ends (including decorative tins) and metal crowns and closures. It includes the subcategories listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section. Surface coating is the application of coatings to a substrate using, for example, spray guns or dip tanks.
(1)
One- and two-piece draw and iron can body coating.
The one- and two-piece draw and iron can body coating subcategory includes all coating processes involved in the manufacture of can bodies by the draw and iron process. This subcategory includes three distinct coating type segments reflecting the coatings appropriate for cans with different end uses. Those are two-piece beverage can body coatings, two-piece food can body coatings, and one-piece aerosol can body coatings.
(2)
Sheetcoating.
The sheetcoating subcategory includes all of the flat metal sheetcoating operations associated with the manufacture of three-piece cans, decorative tins, crowns, and closures.
(3)
Three-piece can body assembly coating.
The three-piece can body assembly coating subcategory includes all of the coating processes involved in the assembly of three-piece metal can bodies. The subcategory includes five distinct coating type segments reflecting the coatings appropriate for cans with different end uses. Those are inside spray on food cans, aseptic side seam stripes on food cans, nonaseptic side seam stripes on food cans, side seam stripes on general line nonfood cans, and side seam stripes on aerosol nonfood cans.
(4)
End coating.
The end coating subcategory includes the application of end seal compounds and repair spray coatings to metal can ends. This subcategory includes three distinct coating type segments reflecting the end seal compounds and repair sprays appropriate for can ends with different end uses. Those are aseptic end seal compounds, nonaseptic end seal compounds, and repair spray coatings.
(b) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a new, reconstructed, or existing affected source, as defined in § 63.3482, that uses 5,700 liters (1,500 gallons (gal)) per year, or more, of coatings in the source category defined in paragraph (a) of this section and that is a major source, is located at a major source, or is part of a major source of emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit, considering controls, any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (Mg) (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 Mg (25 tons) or more per year.
(c) This subpart does not apply to surface coating that meets the criteria of paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Surface coating conducted at a source that uses only coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials that contain no organic HAP, as determined according to § 63.3521(a).

What are my options for meeting the emission limits?
You must include all coatings and thinners used in all surface coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment when determining whether the organic HAP emission rate is equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490. To make that determination, you must use at least one of the four compliance options listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. You may apply any of the compliance options to an individual coating operation or to multiple coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment as a group. You may use different compliance options for different coating operations or at different times on the same coating operation. However, you may not use different compliance options at the same time on the same coating operation. If you switch between compliance options for any coating operation or group of coating operations, you must document that switch as required by § 63.3512(c), and you must report it in the next semiannual compliance report required in § 63.3511.
(a)
Compliant material option.
Demonstrate that the organic HAP content of each coating used in the coating operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490, and that each thinner used contains no organic HAP. You must meet all the requirements of §§ 63.3520, 63.3521, and 63.3522 to demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using this option.
(b)
Emission rate without add-on controls option.

§ 63.3492
What operating limits must I meet?
(a) For any coating operation(s) on which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option, you are not required to meet any operating limits.
(b) For any controlled coating operation(s) on which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option or the control efficiency/outlet concentration option, except those for which you use a solvent recovery system and conduct a liquid-liquid material balance according to § 63.3541(i), you must meet the operating limits specified in Table 4 to this subpart. Those operating limits apply to the emission capture and control systems for the coating operation(s) used for purposes of complying with this subpart. You must establish the operating limits during the performance tests required in § 63.3540 or § 63.3550 according to the requirements in § 63.3546 or § 63.3556. You must meet the operating limits established during the most recent performance tests required in § 63.3540 or § 63.3550 at all times after they have been established during the performance test.

# Compliance Requirements for the Compliant Material Option
§ 63.3520
By what date must I conduct the initial compliance demonstration?
You must complete the initial compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements in § 63.3521. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3483 and ends on the last day of the 12th month following the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next 12 months. The initial compliance demonstration includes the calculations according to § 63.3521 and supporting documentation showing that, during the initial compliance period, you used no coating with an organic HAP content that exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490 and you used no thinners that contained organic HAP.
§ 63.3521
How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?
You may use the compliant material option for any individual coating operation, for any group of coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment, or for all the coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment. You must use either the emission rate without add-on controls option, the emission rate with add-on controls option, or the control efficiency/outlet concentration option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use that option. To demonstrate initial compliance using the compliant material option, the coating operation or group of coating operations must use no coating with an organic HAP content that exceeds the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490 and must use no thinner that contains organic HAP as determined according to this section. Any coating operation for which you use the compliant material option is not required to meet the operating limits or work practice standards required in §§ 63.3492 and 63.3493, respectively. You must conduct a separate initial compliance demonstration for each one and two-piece draw and iron can body coating, sheetcoating, three-piece can body assembly coating, and end coating affected source. You must meet all the requirements of this section for the coating operation or group of coating operations using this option. Use the procedures in this section on each coating and thinner in the condition it is in when it is received from its manufacturer or supplier and prior to any alteration (
e.g.,
mixing or thinning). Do not include any coatings or thinners used on coating operations for which you use the emission rate without add-on controls option, the emission rate with add-on controls option, or the control efficiency/outlet concentration option. You do not need to redetermine the HAP content of coatings or thinners that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the coating operation(s) for which you use the compliant material option, provided these materials in their condition as received were demonstrated to comply with the compliant material option. All required calculations and compliance demonstrations may be performed with either metric or English units.
(a)
Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each material used.
You must determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each coating and thinner used during the compliance period by using one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1)
Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63).
You may use Method 311 for determining the mass fraction of organic HAP. Use the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when performing a Method 311 test.
(i) Count each organic HAP in Table 8 to this subpart that is measured to be present at 0.1 percent by mass or more and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not listed in Table 8 to this subpart) is measured to be 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to count it. Express the mass fraction of each organic HAP you count as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (
e.g.,
0.3791).
(ii) Calculate the total mass fraction of organic HAP in the test material by adding up the individual organic HAP mass fractions and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (
e.g.,
0.763).
(2)
Method 24 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60).
For coatings, you may use Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP. As an alternative to using Method 24, you may use ASTM D2369-10 (2015), “Test Method for Volatile Content of Coatings” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
(3)
Alternative method.
You may use an alternative test method for determining the mass fraction of organic HAP once the Administrator has approved it. You must follow the procedure in § 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.
(4)
Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material.
You may rely on information other than that generated by the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, such as manufacturer's formulation data, if it represents each organic HAP in Table 8 to this subpart that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not listed in Table 8 to this subpart) is 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to count it. If there is a disagreement between such information and results of a test conducted according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, then the test method results will take precedence unless, after consultation, a regulated source can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.
(5)
Solvent blends.
Solvent blends may be listed as single components for some materials in data provided by manufacturers or suppliers. Solvent blends may contain organic HAP which must be counted toward the total organic HAP mass fraction of the materials. When test data and manufacturer's data for solvent blends are not available, you may use the default values for the mass fraction of organic HAP in those solvent blends listed in Table 6 or 7 to this subpart. If you use the tables, you must use the values in Table 6 to this subpart for all solvent blends that match Table 6 entries, and you may only use Table 7 to this subpart if the solvent blends in the materials you use do not match any of the solvent blends in Table 6 and you only know whether the blend is aliphatic or aromatic. However, if the results of a Method 311 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A) test indicate higher values than those listed on Table 6 or 7 to this subpart, the Method 311 results will take precedence.
(b)
Determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating.
You must determine the volume fraction of coating solids (liters of coating solids per liter of coating) for each coating used during the compliance period by a test or by information provided by the supplier or the manufacturer of the material as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. If test results obtained according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not agree with the information obtained under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the test results will take precedence.
(1)
ASTM Method D2697-03 (2014) or D6093-97 (2016).
You may use ASTM D2697-
03
(2014), “Standard Test Method for Volume Nonvolatile Matter in Clear or Pigmented Coatings,” (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14) or ASTM D6093-97 (2016), “Standard Test Method for Percent Volume Nonvolatile Matter in Clear or Pigmented Coatings Using a Helium Gas Pycnometer” (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14), to determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating. Divide the nonvolatile volume percent obtained with the methods by 100 to calculate volume fraction of coating solids. If these values cannot be determined using these methods, the owner/operator may submit an alternative technique for determining the values for approval by the Administrator.
(2)
Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material.
You may obtain the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating from the supplier or manufacturer.
(c)
Determine the density of each coating.
Determine the density of each coating used during the compliance period from test results using ASTM Method D1475-13 “Standard Test Method for Density of Liquid Coatings, Inks, and Related Products” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) or information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material. If there is disagreement between ASTM Method D1475-13 test results and the supplier's or manufacturer's information, the test results will take precedence.
(d)
Calculate the organic HAP content of each coating.
Calculate the organic HAP content, kg organic HAP per liter coating solids, of each coating used during the compliance period, using Equation 1 of this section.
ER13NO03.000
Where:
H
c
= Organic HAP content of the coating, kg organic HAP per liter coating solids.
D
c
= Density of coating, kg coating per liter coating, determined according to paragraph (c) of this section.
W
c
= mass fraction of organic HAP in the coating, kg organic HAP per kg coating, determined according to paragraph (a) of this section.
V
s
= Volume fraction of coating solids, liter coating solids per liter coating, determined according to paragraph (b) of this section.
(e)
Compliance demonstration.
The organic HAP content for each coating used during the initial compliance period, determined using Equation 1 of this section, must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490 and each thinner used during the initial compliance period must contain no organic HAP, determined according to paragraph (a) of this section. You must keep all records required by §§ 63.3512 and 63.3513. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required in § 63.3510, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the compliant material option and submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because you used no coatings for which the organic HAP content exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490, and you used no thinners that contained organic HAP, determined according to paragraph (a) of this section.
[68 FR 64446, Nov. 13, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 1383, Jan. 6, 2006; 85 FR 10851, Feb. 25, 2020]
§ 63.3522
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?
(a) For each compliance period, to demonstrate continuous compliance, you must use no coating for which the organic HAP content, determined using Equation 1 of § 63.3521, exceeds the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490 and use no thinner that contains organic HAP, determined according to § 63.3521(a). A compliance period consists of 12 months. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 63.3520 is the end of a compliance period consisting of that month and the preceding 11 months.
(b) If you choose to comply with the emission limitations by using the compliant material option, the use of any coating or thinner that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section is a deviation from the emission limitations that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3510(b)(6) and 63.3511(a)(5).
(c) As part of each semiannual compliance report required by § 63.3511, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the compliant material option. If there were no deviations from the emission limitations set forth in § 63.3490, submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission
limitations during the reporting period because you used no coating for which the organic HAP content exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490, and you used no thinner that contained organic HAP, as determined according to § 63.3521(a).
(d) You must maintain records as specified in §§ 63.3512 and 63.3513.

# Compliance Requirements for the Emission Rate Without Add-On Controls Option
§ 63.3530
By what date must I conduct the initial compliance demonstration?
You must complete the initial compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements of § 63.3531. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3483 and ends on the last day of the 12th month following the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next 12 months. You must determine the mass of organic HAP emissions and volume of coating solids used each month and then calculate a 12-month organic HAP emission rate at the end of the initial 12-month compliance period. The initial compliance demonstration includes the calculations according to § 63.3531 and supporting documentation showing that, during the initial compliance period, the organic HAP emission rate was equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490.
§ 63.3531
How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?
You may use the emission rate without add-on controls option for any coating operation, for any group of coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment, or for all of the coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment. You must use either the compliant material option, the emission rate with add-on controls option, or the control efficiency/outlet concentration option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use this option. If you use the alternative overall emission limit for a subcategory according to paragraph (i) of this section to demonstrate compliance, however, you must include all coating operations in all coating type segments in the subcategory to determine compliance with the overall limit. To demonstrate initial compliance using the emission rate without add-on controls option, the coating operation or group of coating operations must meet the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490, but is not required to meet the operating limits or work practice standards in §§ 63.3492 and 63.3493, respectively. You must conduct a separate initial compliance demonstration for each one and two-piece draw and iron can body coating, sheetcoating, three-piece can body assembly coating, and end coating affected source. You must meet all the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490 for the coating operation(s). When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings or thinners used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option, the emission rate with add-on controls option, or the control efficiency/outlet concentration option or coating operations in a different affected source in a different subcategory. Use the procedures in this section on each coating and thinner in the condition it is in when it is received from its manufacturer or supplier and prior to any alteration (
e.g.,
mixing or thinning). You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coatings or thinners that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate without add-on controls option. All required calculations and compliance demonstrations may be performed with either metric or English units.

, must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490. You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.3512 and 63.3513. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.3510, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the emission rate without add-on controls option and submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490, determined according to this section.
(i)
Alternative calculation of overall subcategory emission limit (OSEL).
Alternatively, if your affected source applies coatings in more than one coating type segment within a subcategory, you may calculate an overall HAP emission limit for the subcategory using Equation 4 of this section. If you use this approach, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere to the OSEL specified by Equation 4 of this section during each 12-month compliance period.
ER13NO03.006
Where:
OSEL = Total allowable organic HAP in kg HAP/liter coating solids (pound (lb) HAP/gal solids) that can be emitted to the atmosphere from all coating type segments in the subcategory.

§ 63.3532
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?
(a) To demonstrate continuous compliance, the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period, determined according to § 63.3531(a) through (g), must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490. Alternatively, if you calculate an OSEL for all coating type segments within a subcategory according to § 63.3531(i), the organic HAP emission rate for the subcategory for each compliance period must be less than or equal to the calculated OSEL. You must use the calculated OSEL throughout each compliance period. A compliance period consists of 12 months. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 63.3530 is the end of a compliance period consisting of that month and the preceding 11 months. You must perform the calculations in § 63.3531(a) through (g) on a monthly basis using data from the previous 12 months of operation.
(b) If the organic HAP emission rate for any 12-month compliance period exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490 or the OSEL calculated according to § 63.3531(i), this is a deviation from the emission limitations for that compliance period and must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3510(c)(6) and 63.3511(a)(6).
(c) As part of each semiannual compliance report required by § 63.3511, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the emission rate without add-on controls option. If there were no deviations from the emission limitations, you must submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490 determined according to § 63.3531(a) through (g), or using the OSEL calculated according to § 63.3531(i).
(d) You must maintain records as specified in §§ 63.3512 and 63.3513.

If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next 12 months. You must determine the mass of organic HAP emissions and volume of coating solids used each month and then calculate a 12-month organic HAP emission rate at the end of the initial 12-month compliance period. The initial compliance demonstration includes the results of emission capture system and add-on control device performance tests conducted according to §§ 63.3543, 63.3544, and 63.3545; results of liquid-liquid material balances conducted according to § 63.3541(i); calculations according to § 63.3541 and supporting documentation showing that, during the initial compliance period, the organic HAP emission rate was equal to or less than the emission limit in § 63.3490(a); the operating limits established during the performance tests and the results of the continuous parameter monitoring required by § 63.3547; and documentation of whether you developed and implemented the work practice plan required by § 63.3493.
(4) For the initial compliance demonstration, you do not need to comply with the operating limits for the emission capture system and add-on control device required by § 63.3492 until after you have completed the initial performance tests specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Instead, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the emission capture system, add-on control device, and continuous parameter monitors during the period between the compliance
date and the performance test. You must begin complying with the operating limits established based on the initial performance tests specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for your affected source on the date you complete the performance tests. The requirements in this paragraph (a)(4) do not apply to solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to the requirements in § 63.3541(i).
(b)
Existing affected sources.
For an existing affected source, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) All emission capture systems, add-on control devices, and CPMS must be installed and operating no later than the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3483. Except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.3541(i), you must conduct according to the schedule in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section initial and periodic performance tests of each capture system and add-on control device according to the procedures in §§ 63.3543, 63.3544, and 63.3545 and establish the operating limits required by § 63.3492. For a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.3541(i), you must initiate the first material balance no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.3483.
(i) You must conduct the initial performance test and establish the operating limits required by § 63.3492 no later than 180 days after the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3483.
(ii) If you are not required to complete periodic performance tests as a requirement of renewing your facility's operating permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, you must conduct the first periodic performance test before March 25, 2023, unless you already have conducted a performance test on or after March 25, 2018. Thereafter you must conduct a performance test no later than 5 years following the previous performance test. Operating limits must be confirmed or reestablished during each performance test. If you are required to complete periodic performance tests as a requirement of renewing your facility's operating permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, you must conduct the periodic testing in accordance with the terms and schedule required by your permit conditions.
(2) You must develop and begin implementing the work practice plan required by § 63.3493 no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.3483.
(3) You must complete the initial compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements of § 63.3541. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3483 and ends on the last day of the 12th month following the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next 12 months. You must determine the mass of organic HAP emissions and volume of coating solids used each month and then calculate a 12-month organic HAP emission rate at the end of the initial 12-month compliance period. The initial compliance demonstration includes the results of emission capture system and add-on control device performance tests conducted according to §§ 63.3543, 63.3544, and 63.3545; results of liquid-liquid material balances conducted according to § 63.3541(i); calculations according to § 63.3541 and supporting documentation showing that during the initial compliance period the organic HAP emission rate was equal to or less than the emission limit in § 63.3490(b); the operating limits established during the performance tests and the results of the continuous parameter monitoring required by § 63.3547; and documentation of whether you developed and implemented the work practice plan required by § 63.3493.

§ 63.3541
How do I demonstrate initial compliance?
(a) You may use the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation, for any group of coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment, or for all of the coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment.
You may include both controlled and uncontrolled coating operations in a group for which you use this option. You must use either the compliant material option, the emission rate without add-on controls option, or the control efficiency/outlet concentration option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use the emission rate with add-on controls option. To demonstrate initial compliance, the coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option must meet the applicable emission limitations in § 63.3490. You must conduct a separate initial compliance demonstration for each one and two-piece draw and iron can body coating, sheetcoating, three-piece can body assembly coating, and end coating affected source. You must meet all the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings or thinners used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option, the emission rate without add-on controls option, or the control efficiency/outlet concentration option. You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coatings or thinners that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option. All required calculations and compliance demonstrations may be performed with either metric or English units.
(b)
Compliance with operating limits.
Except as provided in § 63.3540(a)(4) and except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to the requirements of § 63.3541(i), you must establish and demonstrate continuous compliance during the initial compliance period with the operating limits required by § 63.3492 using the procedures specified in §§ 63.3546 and 63.3547.
(c)
Compliance with work practice requirements.
You must develop, implement, and document your implementation of the work practice plan required by § 63.3493 during the initial compliance period, as specified in § 63.3512.
(d)
Compliance with emission limits.
You must follow the procedures in paragraphs (e) through (n) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490.
(e)
Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP, density, volume used, and volume fraction of coating solids.
Follow the procedures specified in § 63.3531(a) through (d) to determine the mass fraction of organic HAP, density, and volume of each coating and thinner used during each month and the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating used during each month.
(f)
Calculate the total mass of organic HAP emissions before add-on controls.
Using Equation 1 of § 63.3531, calculate the total mass of organic HAP emissions before add-on controls from all coatings and thinners used during each month in the coating operation or group of coating operations for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option.
(g)
Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation.
Determine the mass of organic HAP emissions reduced for each controlled coating operation during each month. The emission reduction determination quantifies the total organic HAP emissions that pass through the emission capture system and are destroyed or removed by the add-on control device. Use the procedures in paragraph (h) of this section to calculate the mass of organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances. For each controlled coating operation using a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance, use the procedures in paragraph (j) of this section to calculate the organic HAP emission reduction.
(h)
Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation not using liquid-liquid material balances.
For each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device, other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid
material balances, calculate the organic HAP emission reduction, using Equation 1 of this section. The calculation applies the emission capture system efficiency and add-on control device efficiency to the mass of organic HAP contained in the coatings and thinners that are used in the coating operation served by the emission capture system and add-on control device during each month. For any period of time a deviation specified in § 63.3542(c) or (d) occurs in the controlled coating operation, you must assume zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control device, unless you have other data indicating the actual efficiency of the emission capture system and add-on control device, and the use of these data has been approved by the Administrator. Equation 1 of this section treats the materials used during such a deviation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation.

Perform a liquid-liquid material balance for each month as specified in paragraphs (i)(1) through (6) of this section. Calculate the mass of organic HAP emission reduction by the solvent recovery system as specified in paragraph (i)(7) of this section.
(1) For each solvent recovery system, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications, a device that indicates the cumulative amount of volatile organic matter recovered by the solvent recovery system each month.

You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.3512 and 63.3513. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.3510, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the emission rate with add-on controls option and submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490, and you achieved the operating limits required by § 63.3492 and the work practice standards required by § 63.3493.
(n)
Alternative calculation of overall subcategory emission limit.
Alternatively, if your affected source applies coatings in more than one coating type segment within a subcategory, you may calculate an overall HAP emission limit for the subcategory using Equation 4 of § 63.3531. If you use this approach, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere to the OSEL specified by Equation 4 of § 63.3531 during each 12-month compliance period. You must use the OSEL determined by Equation 4 of § 63.3531 throughout the 12-month compliance period and may not switch between compliance with individual coating type limits and an OSEL. If you follow this approach, you may not include coatings in different subcategories in determining your OSEL. You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.3512 and 63.3513. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.3510, you must identify the subcategory for which you used a calculated OSEL and submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate for the subcategory was less than or equal to the OSEL determined according to this section.
[68 FR 64446, Nov. 13, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 1384, Jan. 6, 2006; 85 FR 10852, Feb. 25, 2020; 86 FR 66041, Nov. 19, 2021]
§ 63.3542
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?
(a) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490, the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period, determined according to the procedures in § 63.3541, must be equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490. Alternatively, if you calculate an OSEL for all coating type segments within a subcategory according to § 63.3531(i), the organic HAP emission rate for the subcategory for each compliance period must be less than or equal to the calculated OSEL. You must use the calculated OSEL throughout each compliance period. A compliance period consists of 12 months. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 63.3540 is the end of a compliance period consisting of that month and the preceding 11 months. You must perform the calculations in § 63.3541 on a
monthly basis using data from the previous 12 months of operation.
(b) If the organic HAP emission rate for any 12-month compliance period exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490, that is a deviation from the emission limitation for that compliance period and must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3510(b)(6) and 63.3511(a)(7).
(c) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each operating limit required by § 63.3492 that applies to you as specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
(1) If an operating parameter is out of the allowed range specified in Table 4 to this subpart, this is a deviation from the operating limit that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3510(b)(6) and 63.3511(a)(7).
(2) If an operating parameter deviates from the operating limit specified in Table 4 to this subpart, then you must assume that the emission capture system and add-on control device were achieving zero efficiency during the time period of the deviation, unless you have other data indicating the actual efficiency of the emission capture system and add-on control device, and the use of these data has been approved by the Administrator. For the purposes of completing the compliance calculations specified in § 63.3541(h), you must treat the materials used during a deviation on a controlled coating operation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation as indicated in Equation 1 of § 63.3541.
(d) You must meet the requirements for bypass lines in § 63.3547(b) for controlled coating operations for which you do not conduct liquid-liquid material balances. If any bypass line is opened and emissions are diverted to the atmosphere when the coating operation is running, this is a deviation that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3510(b)(6) and 63.3511(a)(7). For the purposes of completing the compliance calculations specified in § 63.3541(h), you must treat the materials used during a deviation on a controlled coating operation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation as indicated in Equation 1 of § 63.3541.
(e) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the work practice standards in § 63.3493. If you did not develop a work practice plan or you did not implement the plan or you did not keep the records required by § 63.3512(j)(8), that is a deviation from the work practice standards that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3510(b)(6) and 63.3511(a)(7).
(f) As part of each semiannual compliance report required in § 63.3511, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the emission rate with add-on controls option. If there were no deviations from the emission limits in § 63.3490, the operating limits in § 63.3492, and the work practice standards in § 63.3493, submit a statement that you were in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490, and you achieved the operating limits required by § 63.3492 and the work practice standards required by § 63.3493 during each compliance period.
(g) [Reserved]
(h) Before August 24, 2020, consistent with §§ 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction of the emission capture system, add-on control device, or coating operation that may affect emission capture or control device efficiency are not violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating in accordance with § 63.6(e)(1). The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur during a period you identify as a startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations according to the provisions in § 63.6(e). On and after August 24, 2020, deviations that occur due to malfunction of the emission capture system, add-on control device, or coating operation that may affect emission capture or control device efficiency are required to operate in accordance with § 63.3500(b). The Administrator will determine whether the deviations are violations according to the provisions in § 63.3500(b).
(i) You must maintain records as specified in §§ 63.3512 and 63.3513.

§ 63.3543
What are the general requirements for performance tests?
(a) Before August 24, 2020, you must conduct each performance test required by § 63.3540 according to the requirements in § 63.7(e)(1) and under the conditions in this section unless you obtain a waiver of the performance test according to the provisions in § 63.7(h). On and after August 24, 2020, you must conduct each performance test required by § 63.3540 according to the requirements in this section unless you obtain a waiver of the performance test according to the provisions in § 63.7(h).
(1)
Representative coating operation operating conditions.
You must conduct the performance test under representative operating conditions for the coating operation. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, or nonoperation do not constitute representative conditions for purposes of conducting a performance test. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(2)
Representative emission capture system and add-on control device operating conditions.
You must conduct the performance test when the emission capture system and add-on control device are operating at a representative flow rate and the add-on control device is operating at a representative inlet concentration. You must record information that is necessary to document emission capture system and add-on control device operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation.
(b) You must conduct each performance test of an emission capture system according to the requirements in § 63.3544. You must conduct each performance test of an add-on control device according to the requirements in § 63.3545.
[68 FR 64446, Nov. 13, 2003, as amended at 85 FR 10853, Feb. 25, 2020]
§ 63.3544
How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?
You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine capture efficiency as part of each performance test required by § 63.3540.
(a)
Assuming 100 percent capture efficiency.
You may assume the capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met:
(1) The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a PTE and directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.
(2) All coatings and thinners used in the coating operation are applied within the capture system, and coating solvent flash-off, curing, and drying occurs within the capture system. For example, the criterion is not met if parts enter the open shop environment when being moved between a spray booth and a curing oven.
(b)
Measuring capture efficiency.
If the capture system does not meet both of the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, then you must use one of the three protocols described in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section to measure capture efficiency. The capture efficiency measurements use TVH capture efficiency as a surrogate for organic HAP capture efficiency. For the protocols in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the capture efficiency measurement must consist of three test runs. Each test run must be at least 3 hours duration or the length of a production run, whichever is longer, up to 8 hours. For the purposes of this test, a production run means the time required for a single part to go from the beginning to the end of production, and includes drying or curing time, but excludes surface preparation activities.
(c)
Liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure.
The liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol compares the mass of liquid TVH in materials used in the coating operation to the mass of
TVH emissions not captured by the emission capture system. Use a TTE or a building enclosure and the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section to measure emission capture system efficiency using the liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol.
(1) Either use a building enclosure or construct an enclosure around the coating operation where coatings and thinners are applied and all areas where emissions from these applied coatings and materials subsequently occur, such as flash-off, curing, and drying areas. The areas of the coating operation where capture devices collect emissions for routing to an add-on control device, such as the entrance and exit areas of an oven or spray booth, must also be inside the enclosure. The enclosure must meet the applicable definition of a TTE or building enclosure in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.
(2) Use Method 204A or 204F of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to determine the mass fraction of TVH liquid input from each coating and thinner used in the coating operation during each capture efficiency test run. To make the determination, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the methods.
(3) Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the total mass of TVH liquid input from all the coatings and thinners used in the coating operation during each capture efficiency test run.

Where:
CE = Capture efficiency of the emission capture system vented to the add-on control device, percent.

§ 63.3545
How do I determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency?
You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency as part of the performance tests required by § 63.3540. For each performance test, you must conduct three test runs as specified in § 63.7(e)(3) and each test run must last at least 1 hour.
(a) For all types of add-on control devices, use the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Use Method 1 or 1A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to select sampling sites and velocity traverse points.
(2) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.
(3) Use Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight. You may also use as an alternative to Method 3B the manual method for measuring the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide content of exhaust gas in ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses [Part 10, Instruments and Apparatus]” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
(4) Use Method 4 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to determine stack gas moisture.
(5) Methods for determining gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular weight, and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during each test run.
(b) Measure total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon at the inlet and outlet of the add-on control device simultaneously using either Method 25 or 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section. You must use the same method for both the inlet and outlet measurements.
(1) Use Method 25 of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be more than 50 ppm at the control device outlet.
(2) Use Method 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be 50 ppm or less at the control device outlet.
(3) Use Method 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-control device is not an oxidizer.
(4) You may use Method 18 of appendix A-6 to 40 CFR part 60 to subtract methane emissions from measured total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon.
(5) Alternatively, any other test method or data that have been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, and approved by the Administrator, may be used.
(c) If two or more add-on control devices are used for the same emission stream, then you must measure emissions at the outlet of each device. For example, if one add-on control device is a concentrator with an outlet for the
high-volume dilute stream that has been treated by the concentrator, and a second add-on control device is an oxidizer with an outlet for the low-volume concentrated stream that is treated with the oxidizer, you must measure emissions at the outlet of the oxidizer and the high-volume dilute stream outlet of the concentrator.
(d) For each test run, determine the total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rates for the inlet and the outlet of the add-on control device using Equation 1 of this section. If there is more than one inlet or outlet to the add-on control device, you must calculate the total gaseous organic mass flow rate using Equation 1 of this section for each inlet and each outlet and then total all of the inlet emissions and total all of the outlet emissions.

§ 63.3546
How do I establish the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits during the performance test?
During performance tests required by § 63.3540 and described in §§ 63.3543, 63.3544, and 63.3545, you must establish the operating limits required by § 63.3492 unless you have received approval for alternative monitoring and operating limits under § 63.8(f) as specified in § 63.3492.
(a)
Thermal oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a thermal oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the performance test. That average combustion temperature is the minimum operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.
(b)
Catalytic oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) or paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test. The average temperature difference is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.
(3) As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. During performance tests, you must monitor and record the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed during the performance test. That is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.
(4) You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The plan must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (
i.e,
conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's recommended procedures.
(ii) Monthly inspection of the oxidizer system, including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.
(iii) Annual internal and monthly external visual inspection of the catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found, you must take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency according to § 63.3545.
(c)
Regenerative oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a regenerative oxidizer, establish operating limits according to paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) You must establish all applicable operating limits according to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(2) You must submit a valve inspection plan that documents the steps taken to minimize the amount of leakage during the regenerative process. This plan can include, but is not limited to, routine inspection of key parameters of the valve operating system (
e.g.,
solenoid valve operation, air pressure, hydraulic pressure); visual inspection of the valves during internal inspections; and/or actual testing of the emission stream for leakage.
(d)
Carbon adsorbers.
If your add-on control device is a carbon adsorber, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the total regeneration desorbing gas (
e.g.,
steam or nitrogen) mass flow for each regeneration cycle, and the carbon bed temperature after each carbon bed regeneration and cooling cycle for the regeneration cycle either immediately preceding or immediately following the performance test.
(2) The operating limits for your carbon adsorber are the minimum total desorbing gas mass flow recorded during the regeneration cycle, and the maximum carbon bed temperature recorded after the cooling cycle.
(e)
Condensers.
If your add-on control device is a condenser, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, monitor and record the condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature at least
once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs of the performance test.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature maintained during the performance test. This average condenser outlet gas temperature is the maximum operating limit for your condenser.
(f)
Concentrators.
If your add-on control device includes a concentrator, you must establish operating limits for the concentrator according to paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, monitor and record the inlet temperature to the desorption/reactivation zone of the concentrator at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three runs of the performance test.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature. This is the minimum operating limit for the desorption/reactivation zone inlet temperature.
(3) During each performance test, monitor and record an indicator(s) of performance for the desorption/reactivation fan operation at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three runs of the performance test. The indicator can be speed in revolutions per minute (rpm), power in amps, static pressure, or flow rate.
(4) Establish a suitable range for the parameter(s) selected based on the system design specifications, historical data, and/or data obtained concurrent with an emissions performance test. This is the operation limit range for the desorption/reactivation fan operation.
(5) During each performance test, monitor the rotational speed of the concentrator at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three runs of the performance test.
(6) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average rotational speed. This is the minimum operating limit for the rotational speed of the concentrator. However, the indicator range for the rotational speed may be changed if an engineering evaluation is conducted and a determination made that the change in speed will not affect compliance with the emission limit.
(7) Develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for the concentrator(s) that you elect to monitor according to paragraph (f) of this section. The plan must include, at a minimum, annual sampling and analysis of the absorbent material (
i.e.,
adsorbent activity) following the manufacturer's recommended procedures.
(g)
Emission capture systems.
For each capture device that is not part of a PTE that meets the criteria of § 63.3544(a), establish an operating limit for either the gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure, as specified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section. The operating limit for a PTE is specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
(1) During the capture efficiency determination required by § 63.3540 and described in §§ 63.3543 and 63.3544, you must monitor and record either the gas volumetric flow rate at a location upstream of the control device, or the duct static pressure at a location upstream of the primary fan in each duct of each capture device or upstream of the fan that is common to multiple capture devices at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.
(2) Calculate and record the average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure for the three test runs for each capture device or system of multiple capture devices. The average gas volumetric flow rate is the minimum operating limit for that specific capture device or system of multiple capture devices. The average duct static pressure is the maximum operating limit for that specific capture device or system of multiple capture devices.

§ 63.3551
How do I demonstrate initial compliance?
(a) You may use the control efficiency/outlet concentration option for any coating operation, for any group of coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment, or for all of the coating operations within a subcategory or coating type segment. You must use the compliant material option, the emission rate without add-on controls option, or the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use the control efficiency/outlet concentration option. To demonstrate initial compliance, the coating operation(s) for which you use the control efficiency/outlet concentration option must meet the applicable levels of emission reduction in § 63.3490. You must conduct a separate initial compliance demonstration for each one and two-piece draw and iron can body coating, sheetcoating, three-piece can body assembly coating, and end coating affected source. You must meet all the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings or thinners used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option, the emission rate without add-on controls option, or the emission rate with add-on controls option. You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coatings or thinners that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option.
(b)
Compliance with operating limits.
You must establish and demonstrate continuous compliance during the initial compliance period with the operating limits required by § 63.3492, using the procedures specified in §§ 63.3556 and 63.3557.
(c)
Compliance with work practice requirements.
You must develop, implement, and document your implementation of the work practice plan required by § 63.3493 during the initial compliance period as specified in § 63.3512.
(d)
Compliance demonstration.
To demonstrate initial compliance, the coating operation(s) for which you use the control efficiency/outlet concentration option must meet the applicable levels of emission reduction in § 63.3490. You must keep all records applicable to the control efficiency/outlet concentration option as required by §§ 63.3512 and 63.3513. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.3510, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the control efficiency/outlet concentration option and submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was in compliance
with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because you achieved the operating limits required by § 63.3492 and the work practice standards required by § 63.3493.
§ 63.3552
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?
(a) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations using the control efficiency/outlet concentration option, the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period must be equal to or less than 20 ppmvd or must be reduced by the amounts specified in § 63.3490. A compliance period consists of 12 months. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 63.3550 is the end of a compliance period consisting of that month and the preceding 11 months.
(b) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each operating limit required by § 63.3492 that applies to you, as specified in Table 4 to this subpart. If an operating parameter is out of the allowed range specified in Table 4 to this subpart, this is a deviation from the operating limit that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3510(b)(6) and 63.3511(a)(7).
(c) You must meet the requirements for bypass lines in § 63.3557(b). If any bypass line is opened and emissions are diverted to the atmosphere when the coating operation is running, this is a deviation that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3510(b)(6) and 63.3511(a)(7). For purposes of demonstrating compliance, you must treat the materials used during a deviation on a controlled coating operation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation.
(d) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the work practice standards in § 63.3493. If you did not develop a work practice plan or you did not implement the plan or you did not keep the records required by § 63.3512(j)(8), this is a deviation from the work practice standards that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3510(b)(6) and 63.3511(a)(7).
(e) As part of each semiannual compliance report required in § 63.3511, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the control efficiency/outlet concentration option. If there were no deviations from the operating limits or work practice standards, submit a statement that you were in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period was less than 20 ppmvd or was reduced by the amount specified in § 63.3490, and you achieved the operating limits required by § 63.3492 and the work practice standards required by § 63.3493 during each compliance period.
(f) [Reserved]
(g) Before August 24, 2020, consistent with §§ 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction of the emission capture system, add-on control device, or coating operation that may affect emission capture or control device efficiency are not violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating in accordance with § 63.6(e)(1). The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur during a period you identify as a startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations, according to the provisions in § 63.6(e). On and after August 24, 2020 deviations that occur due to malfunction of the emission capture system, add-on control device, or coating operation that may affect emission capture or control device efficiency are required to operate in accordance with § 63.3500(b). The Administrator will determine whether the deviations are violations according to the provisions in § 63.3500(b).
(h) You must maintain records applicable to the control efficiency/outlet concentration option as specified in §§ 63.3512 and 63.3513.

§ 63.3553
What are the general requirements for performance tests?
(a) Before August 24, 2020, you must conduct each performance test required by § 63.3550 according to the requirements in § 63.7(e)(1) and under the conditions in this section unless you obtain a waiver of the performance test
according to the provisions in § 63.7(h). On and after August 24, 2020, you must conduct each performance test required by § 63.3550 according to the requirements in this section unless you obtain a waiver of the performance test according to the provisions in § 63.7(h).
(1)
Representative coating operating conditions.
You must conduct the performance test under representative operating conditions for the coating operation(s). Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, or nonoperation do not constitute representative conditions for purposes of conducting a performance test. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(2)
Representative emission capture system and add-on control device operating conditions.
You must conduct the performance test when the emission capture system and add-on control device are operating at a representative flow rate, and the add-on control device is operating at a representative inlet concentration. You must record information that is necessary to document emission capture system and add-on control device operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation.
(b) You must conduct each performance test of an emission capture system according to the requirements in § 63.3554. You must conduct each performance test of an add-on control device according to the requirements in § 63.3555.
[68 FR 64446, Nov. 13, 2003, as amended at 85 FR 10855, Feb. 25, 2020]
§ 63.3554
How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?
The capture efficiency of your emission capture system must be 100 percent to use the control efficiency/outlet concentration option. You may assume the capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both of the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met.
(a) The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a PTE and directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.
(b) All coatings and thinners used in the coating operation are applied within the capture system, and coating solvent flash-off, curing, and drying occurs within the capture system. This criterion is not met if parts enter the open shop environment when being moved between a spray booth and a curing oven.
§ 63.3555
How do I determine the outlet THC emissions and add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency?
You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine either the outlet THC emissions or add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency as part of the performance tests required by § 63.3550. You must conduct three test runs as specified in § 63.7(e)(3), and each test run must last at least 1 hour.
(a) For all types of add-on control devices, use the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Use Method 1 or 1A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to select sampling sites and velocity traverse points.
(2) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.
(3) Use Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight. You may also use as an alternative to Method 3B, the manual method for measuring the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide content of exhaust gas in ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses [Part 10, Instruments and Apparatus]” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
(4) Use Method 4 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to determine stack gas moisture.
(5) Methods for determining gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular weight,
and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during each test run.
(b) Measure total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon at the inlet and outlet of the add-on control device simultaneously using either Method 25 or 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. You must use the same method for both the inlet and outlet measurements.
(1) Use Method 25 of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer, and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be more than 50 ppm at the control device outlet.
(2) Use Method 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer, and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be 50 ppm or less at the control device outlet.
(3) Use Method 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is not an oxidizer.
(4) You may use Method 18 of appendix A-6 to 40 CFR part 60 to subtract methane emissions from measured total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon.
(5) Alternatively, any other test method or data that have been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, and approved by the Administrator may be used.
(c) If two or more add-on control devices are used for the same emission stream, then you must measure emissions at the outlet of each device. For example, if one add-on control device is a concentrator with an outlet for the high-volume dilute stream that has been treated by the concentrator and a second add-on control device is an oxidizer with an outlet for the low-volume, concentrated stream that is treated with the oxidizer, you must measure emissions at the outlet of the oxidizer and the high-volume dilute stream outlet of the concentrator.
(d) For each test run, determine the total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rates for the inlet and outlet of the add-on control device using Equation 1 of this section. If there is more than one inlet or outlet to the add-on control device, you must calculate the total gaseous organic mass flow rate using Equation 1 of this section for each inlet and each outlet and then total all of the inlet emissions and total all of the outlet emissions.

§ 63.3556
How do I establish the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits during the performance test?
During the performance tests required by § 63.3550 and described in §§ 63.3553, 63.3554, and 63.3555, you must establish the operating limits required by § 63.3492 according to this section, unless you have received approval for alternative monitoring and operating limits under § 63.8(f) as specified in § 63.3492.
(a)
Thermal oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a thermal oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the performance test. That average combustion temperature is the minimum operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.
(b)
Catalytic oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) or paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test. The average temperature difference is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.
(3) As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. During performance tests, you must monitor and record the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use the data collected during each performance test to calculate and record the average temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed during the performance test. That is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.
(4) You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The plan must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (
i.e.,
conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's recommended procedures.
(ii) Monthly inspection of the oxidizer system, including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.
(iii) Annual internal and monthly external visual inspection of the catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found, you must take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency according to § 63.3555.
(c)
Regenerative oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a regenerative oxidizer, establish operating limits according to paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) You must establish all applicable operating limits according to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(2) You must submit a valve inspection plan that documents the steps taken to minimize the amount of leakage during the regenerative process. This plan can include, but is not limited to, routine inspection of key parameters of the valve operating system (
e.g.,
solenoid valve operation, air pressure, hydraulic pressure), visual inspection of the valves during internal inspections, and/or actual testing of the emission stream for leakage.
(d)
Carbon adsorbers.
If your add-on control device is a carbon adsorber, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) You must monitor and record the total regeneration desorbing gas (
e.g.,
steam or nitrogen) mass flow for each regeneration cycle, and the carbon bed temperature after each carbon bed regeneration and cooling cycle for the regeneration cycle either immediately preceding or immediately following performance tests.
(2) The operating limits for your carbon adsorber are the minimum total desorbing gas mass flow recorded during the regeneration cycle and the maximum carbon bed temperature recorded after the cooling cycle.
(e)
Condensers.
If your add-on control device is a condenser, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, monitor and record the condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature maintained during the performance test. This average condenser outlet gas temperature is the maximum operating limit for your condenser.
(f)
Concentrators.
If your add-on control device includes a concentrator, you must establish operating limits for the concentrator according to paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, monitor and record the inlet temperature to the desorption/reactivation zone of the concentrator at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three runs of the performance test.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature. This is the minimum operating limit for the desorption/reactivation zone inlet temperature.
(3) During performance tests, monitor and record an indicator(s) of performance for the desorption/reactivation fan operation at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three runs of the performance test. The indicator can be speed in rpm, power in amps, static pressure, or flow rate.
(4) Establish a suitable range for the parameter(s) selected based on the system design specifications, historical data, and/or data obtained concurrent with an emissions performance test. This is the operation limit range for the desorption/reactivation fan operation.
(5) During performance tests, monitor the rotational speed of the concentrator at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three runs of a performance test.
(6) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average rotational speed. This is the minimum operating limit for the rotational speed of the concentrator. However, the indicator range for the rotational speed may be changed if an engineering evaluation is conducted and a determination made that the change in speed will not affect compliance with the emission limit.
(7) Develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for the concentrator(s) that you elect to monitor according to paragraph (f) of this section. The plan must include, at a minimum, annual sampling and analysis of the absorbent material (
i.e.,
adsorbent
activity) following the manufacturer's recommended procedures.
(g)
Emission capture systems.
For each capture device that is part of a PTE that meets the criteria of § 63.3554, the operating limit for a PTE is specified in Table 4 to this subpart.

(2) The carbon bed temperature monitor must have a minimum accuracy of ±1.2 degrees Celsius or ±1 percent of the temperature value in degrees Celsius, whichever is larger, and must be capable of recording the temperature within 15 minutes of completing any carbon bed cooling cycle.
(e)
Condensers.
If you are using a condenser, you must monitor the condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature and comply with paragraphs (a) and (e)(1) and (2) of this section.

# Subpart MMMM—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products

# Source:
69 FR 157, Jan. 2, 2004, unless otherwise noted.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.3880
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for miscellaneous metal parts and products surface coating facilities. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations.
§ 63.3881
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) Miscellaneous metal parts and products include, but are not limited to, metal components of the following types of products as well as the products themselves: motor vehicle parts and accessories, bicycles and sporting goods, recreational vehicles, extruded aluminum structural components, railroad cars, heavy duty trucks, medical equipment, lawn and garden equipment, electronic equipment, magnet wire, steel drums, industrial machinery, metal pipes, and numerous other industrial, household, and consumer products. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the source category to which this subpart applies is the surface coating of any miscellaneous metal parts or products, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and it includes the subcategories listed in paragraphs (a)(2) through (6) of this section.
(1) Surface coating is the application of coating to a substrate using, for example, spray guns or dip tanks. When application of coating to a substrate occurs, then surface coating also includes associated activities, such as surface preparation, cleaning, mixing, and storage. However, these activities do not comprise surface coating if they are not directly related to the application of the coating. Coating application with handheld, non-refillable aerosol containers, touch-up markers, marking pens, or the application of paper film or plastic film which may be pre-coated with an adhesive by the manufacturer are not coating operations for the purposes of this subpart.
(2) The general use coating subcategory includes all surface coating operations that are not high performance, magnet wire, rubber-to-metal, or extreme performance fluoropolymer coating operations.
(3) The high performance coating subcategory includes surface coating operations that are performed using coatings that meet the definition of high performance architectural coating or high temperature coating in § 63.3981.
(4) The magnet wire coating subcategory includes surface coating operations that are performed using coatings that meet the definition of magnet wire coatings in § 63.3981.
(5) The rubber-to-metal coatings subcategory includes surface coating operations that are performed using coatings that meet the definition of rubber-to-metal coatings in § 63.3981.
(6) The extreme performance fluoropolymer coatings subcategory includes surface coating operations that
are performed using coatings that meet the definition of extreme performance fluoropolymer coatings in § 63.3981.
(b) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a new, reconstructed, or existing affected source, as defined in § 63.3882, that uses 946 liters (250 gallons (gal)) per year, or more, of coatings that contain hazardous air pollutants (HAP) in the surface coating of miscellaneous metal parts and products defined in paragraph (a) of this section; and that is a major source, is located at a major source, or is part of a major source of emissions of HAP. A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (Mg) (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 Mg (25 tons) or more per year. You do not need to include coatings that meet the definition of non-HAP coating contained in § 63.3981 in determining whether you use 946 liters (250 gal) per year, or more, of coatings in the surface coating of miscellaneous metal parts and products.
(c) This subpart does not apply to surface coating or a coating operation that meets any of the criteria of paragraphs (c)(1) through (17) of this section.
(1) A coating operation conducted at a facility where the facility uses only coatings, thinners and other additives, and cleaning materials that contain no organic HAP, as determined according to § 63.3941(a).
(2) Surface coating operations that occur at research or laboratory facilities, or is part of janitorial, building, and facility maintenance operations, or that occur at hobby shops that are operated for noncommercial purposes.
(3) Coatings used in volumes of less than 189 liters (50 gal) per year, provided that the total volume of coatings exempt under this paragraph does not exceed 946 liters (250 gal) per year at the facility.
(4) The surface coating of metal parts and products performed on-site at installations owned or operated by the Armed Forces of the United States (including the Coast Guard and the National Guard of any such State) or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or the surface coating of military munitions manufactured by or for the Armed Forces of the United States (including the Coast Guard and the National Guard of any such State).
(5) Surface coating where plastic is extruded onto metal wire or cable or metal parts or products to form a coating.
(6) Surface coating of metal components of wood furniture that meet the applicability criteria for wood furniture manufacturing (subpart JJ of this part).
(7) Surface coating of metal components of large appliances that meet the applicability criteria for large appliance surface coating (subpart NNNN of this part).
(8) Surface coating of metal components of metal furniture that meet the applicability criteria for metal furniture surface coating (subpart RRRR of this part).
(9) Surface coating of metal components of wood building products that meet the applicability criteria for wood building products surface coating (subpart QQQQ of this part).
(10) Surface coating of metal components of aerospace vehicles that meet the applicability criteria for aerospace manufacturing and rework (40 CFR part 63, subpart GG).
(11) Surface coating of metal parts intended for use in an aerospace vehicle or component using specialty coatings as defined in appendix A to subpart GG of this part.
(12) Surface coating of metal components of ships that meet the applicability criteria for shipbuilding and ship repair (subpart II of this part).
(13) Surface coating of metal using a web coating process that meets the applicability criteria for paper and other web coating (subpart JJJJ of this part).
(14) Surface coating of metal using a coil coating process that meets the applicability criteria for metal coil coating (subpart SSSS of this part).
(15) Surface coating of boats or metal parts of boats (including, but not limited to, the use of assembly adhesives) where the facility meets the applicability criteria for boat manufacturing
facilities (subpart VVVV of this part), except where the surface coating of the boat is a metal coating operation performed on personal watercraft or parts of personal watercraft. This subpart does apply to metal coating operations performed on personal watercraft and parts of personal watercraft.
(16) Surface coating of assembled on-road vehicles that meet the applicability criteria for the assembled on-road vehicle subcategory in plastic parts and products surface coating (40 CFR part 63, subpart PPPP).
(17) Surface coating of metal components of automobiles and light-duty trucks that meets the applicability criteria in § 63.3082(b) for the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart IIII) at a facility that meets the applicability criteria in § 63.3081(b).
(d) If your facility meets the applicability criteria in § 63.3081(b) of the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart IIII), and you perform surface coating of metal parts or products that meets both the applicability criteria in § 63.3082(c) and the applicability criteria of the Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products (40 CFR part 63, subpart MMMM), then for the surface coating of any or all of your metal parts or products that meets the applicability criteria in § 63.3082(c), you may choose to comply with the requirements of subpart IIII of this part in lieu of complying with the Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products NESHAP. Surface coating operations on metal parts or products (e.g., parts for motorcycles or lawnmowers) not intended for use in automobiles, light-duty trucks, or other motor vehicles as defined in § 63.3176 cannot be made part of your affected source under subpart IIII of this part.
(e) If you own or operate an affected source that meets the applicability criteria of this subpart and at the same facility you also perform surface coating that meets the applicability criteria of any other final surface coating NESHAP in this part you may choose to comply as specified in paragraph (e)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.
(1) You may have each surface coating operation that meets the applicability criteria of a separate NESHAP comply with that NESHAP separately.
(2) You may comply with the emission limitation representing the predominant surface coating activity at your facility, as determined according to paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. However, you may not establish high performance, rubber-to-metal, or extreme performance fluoropolymer coating operations as the predominant activity. You must not consider any surface coating activity that is subject to the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart IIII) in determining the predominant surface coating activity at your facility.
(i) If a surface coating operation accounts for 90 percent or more of the surface coating activity at your facility (that is, the predominant activity), then compliance with the emission limitations of the predominant activity for all surface coating operations constitutes compliance with these and other applicable surface coating NESHAP. In determining predominant activity, you must include coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other surface coating NESHAP and constitute more than 1 percent of total coating activities at your facility. Coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other surface coating NESHAP but comprise less than 1 percent of coating activities need not be included in the determination of predominant activity but must be included in the compliance calculation.
(ii) You must use liters (gal) of solids used as a measure of relative surface coating activity over a representative period of operation. You may estimate the relative volume of coating solids used from parameters other than coating consumption and volume solids content (
e.g.,
design specifications for the parts or products coated and the number of items produced). The determination of predominant activity must accurately reflect current and projected coating operations and must be verifiable through appropriate documentation. The use of parameters
other than coating consumption and volume solids content must be approved by the Administrator. You may use data for any reasonable time period of at least 1 year in determining the relative amount of coating activity, as long as they represent the way the source will continue to operate in the future and are approved by the Administrator. You must determine the predominant activity at your facility and submit the results of that determination with the initial notification required by § 63.3910(b). You must also determine predominant activity annually and include the determination in the next semi-annual compliance report required by § 63.3920(a).
(3) You may comply with a facility-specific emission limit calculated from the relative amount of coating activity that is subject to each emission limit. If you elect to comply using the facility-specific emission limit alternative, then compliance with the facility-specific emission limit and the emission limitations in this subpart for all surface coating operations constitutes compliance with this and other applicable surface coating NESHAP. The procedures for calculating the facility-specific emission limit are specified in § 63.3890. In calculating a facility-specific emission limit, you must include coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other surface coating NESHAP and constitute more than 1 percent of total coating activities at your facility. You must not consider any surface coating activity that is subject to the Surface Coating of Automobiles and Light-Duty Trucks NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart IIII) in determining a facility-specific emission limit for your facility. Coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other surface coating NESHAP but comprise less than 1 percent of total coating activities need not be included in the calculation of the facility-specific emission limit but must be included in the compliance calculations.

# Emission Limitations
§ 63.3890
What emission limits must I meet?
(a) For a new or reconstructed affected source, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere from the affected source to the applicable limit specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, determined according to the requirements in § 63.3941, § 63.3951, or § 63.3961.
(1) For each new general use coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.23 kilograms (kg) (1.9 pound (lb)) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.
(2) For each new high performance coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 3.3 kg (27.5 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.
(3) For each new magnet wire coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.050 kg (0.44 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.
(4) For each new rubber-to-metal coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.81 kg (6.8 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.
(5) For each new extreme performance fluoropolymer coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 1.5 kg (12.4 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.
(b) For an existing affected source, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere from the affected source to the applicable limit specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, determined according to the requirements in § 63.3941, § 63.3951, or § 63.3961.
(1) For each existing general use coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.31 kg (2.6 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.
(2) For each existing high performance coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 3.3 kg (27.5 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.
(3) For each existing magnet wire coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 0.12 kg (1.0 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.
(4) For each existing rubber-to-metal coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 4.5 kg (37.7 lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.
(5) For each existing extreme performance fluoropolymer coating affected source, limit organic HAP emissions to no more than 1.5 kg (12.4 lbs) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used during each 12-month compliance period.
(c) If your facility's surface coating operations meet the applicability criteria of more than one of the subcategory emission limits specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, you may comply separately with each subcategory emission limit or comply using one of the alternatives in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) If the general use or magnet wire surface coating operations subject to only one of the emission limits specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (3), (b)(1), or (3) of this section account for 90 percent or more of the surface coating activity at your facility (
i.e.,
it is the predominant activity at your facility), then compliance with that one emission limitations in this subpart for all surface coating operations constitutes compliance with the other applicable emission limits. You must use liters (gal) of solids used as a measure of relative surface coating activity over a representative period of operation. You may estimate the relative volume of coating solids used from parameters other than coating consumption and volume solids content (
e.g.,
design specifications for the parts or products coated and the number of items produced). The determination of predominant activity must accurately reflect current and projected coating operations and must be verifiable through appropriate documentation. The use of parameters other than coating consumption and volume solids content must be approved by the Administrator. You may use data for any reasonable time period of at least 1 year in determining the relative amount of coating activity, as long as they represent the way the source will continue to operate in the future and are approved by the Administrator. You must determine the predominant activity at your facility and submit the results of that determination with the initial notification required by § 63.3910(b). Additionally, you must determine the facility's predominant activity annually and include the determination in the next semi-annual compliance report required by § 63.3920(a).
(2) You may calculate and comply with a facility-specific emission limit as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. If you elect to comply using the facility-specific emission limit alternative, then compliance with the facility-specific emission limit and the emission limitations in this subpart for all surface coating operations constitutes compliance with this and other applicable surface coating NESHAP. In calculating a facility-specific emission limit, you must include coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of the other subcategories and constitute more than 1 percent of total coating activities. Coating activities that meet the applicability criteria of other surface coating NESHAP but comprise less than 1 percent of coating activities need not be included in the determination of predominant activity but must be included in the compliance calculation.
(i) You are required to calculate the facility-specific emission limit for your facility when you submit the notification of compliance status required in § 63.3910(c), and on a monthly basis afterward using the coating data for the relevant 12-month compliance period.
(ii) Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the facility-specific emission limit for your surface coating operations for each 12-month compliance period.
ER02JA04.002
Where:
Facility-specific emission limit = Facility-specific emission limit for each 12-month compliance period, kg (lb) organic HAP per kg (lb) coating solids used.
Limit
i
= The new source or existing source emission limit applicable to coating operation, i, included in the facility-specific emission limit, converted to kg (lb) organic HAP per kg (lb) coating solids used, if the emission limit is not already in those units. All emission limits included in the facility-specific emission limit must be in the same units.
Solids
i
= The liters (gal) of solids used in coating operation, i, in the 12-month compliance period that is subject to emission limit, i. You may estimate the volume of coating solids used from parameters other than coating consumption and volume solids content (
e.g.,
design specifications for the parts or products coated and the number of items produced). The use of parameters other than coating consumption and volume solids content must be approved by the Administrator.
n = The number of different coating operations included in the facility-specific emission limit.
(iii) If you need to convert an emission limit in another surface coating NESHAP from kg (lb) organic HAP per kg (lb) coating solids used to kg (lb) organic HAP per liter (gal) coating solids used, you must use the default solids density of 1.26 kg solids per liter coating solids (10.5 lb solids per gal solids).
§ 63.3891
What are my options for meeting the emission limits?
You must include all coatings (as defined in § 63.3981), thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials used in the affected source when determining whether the organic HAP emission rate is equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890. To make this determination, you must use at least one of the three compliance options listed in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. You may apply any of the compliance options to an individual coating operation, or to multiple coating operations as a group, or to the entire affected source. You may use different compliance options for different coating operations, or at different times on the same coating operation. You may employ different compliance options when different coatings are applied to the same part, or when the same coating is applied to different parts. However, you may not use different compliance options at the same time on the same coating operation. If you switch between compliance options for any coating operation or group of coating operations, you must document this switch as required by § 63.3930(c), and you must report it in the next semiannual compliance report required in § 63.3920.
(a)
Compliant material option.
Demonstrate that the organic HAP content of each coating used in the coating operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, and that each thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used contains no organic HAP. You must meet all the requirements of §§ 63.3940, 63.3941, and 63.3942 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit using this option.
(b)
Emission rate without add-on controls option.
Demonstrate that, based on the coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation(s), the organic HAP emission rate for the coating operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, calculated as a rolling 12-month emission rate and determined on a monthly basis. You must meet all the requirements of §§ 63.3950, 63.3951, and 63.3952 to demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using this option.
(c)
Emission rate with add-on controls option.
Demonstrate that, based on the coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials used in
the coating operation(s), and the emissions reductions achieved by emission capture systems and add-on controls, the organic HAP emission rate for the coating operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, calculated as a rolling 12-month emission rate and determined on a monthly basis. If you use this compliance option, you must also demonstrate that all emission capture systems and add-on control devices for the coating operation(s) meet the operating limits required in § 63.3892, except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.3961(j), and that you meet the work practice standards required in § 63.3893. You must meet all the requirements of §§ 63.3960 through 63.3968 to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards using this option.
§ 63.3892
What operating limits must I meet?
(a) For any coating operation(s) on which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option, you are not required to meet any operating limits.
(b) For any controlled coating operation(s) on which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option, except those for which you use a solvent recovery system and conduct a liquid-liquid material balance according to § 63.3961(j), you must meet the operating limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart. These operating limits apply to the emission capture and control systems on the coating operation(s) for which you use this option, and you must establish the operating limits during the performance test according to the requirements in § 63.3967. You must meet the operating limits at all times after you establish them.
(c) If you use an add-on control device other than those listed in Table 1 to this subpart, or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under § 63.8(f).
§ 63.3893
What work practice standards must I meet?
(a) For any coating operation(s) on which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option, you are not required to meet any work practice standards.
(b) If you use the emission rate with add-on controls option, you must develop and implement a work practice plan to minimize organic HAP emissions from the storage, mixing, and conveying of coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials used in, and waste materials generated by the controlled coating operation(s) for which you use this option; or you must meet an alternative standard as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The plan must specify practices and procedures to ensure that, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section are implemented.
(1) All organic-HAP-containing coatings, thinners and/or other additives, cleaning materials, and waste materials must be stored in closed containers.
(2) Spills of organic-HAP-containing coatings, thinners and/or other additives, cleaning materials, and waste materials must be minimized.
(3) Organic-HAP-containing coatings, thinners and/or other additives, cleaning materials, and waste materials must be conveyed from one location to another in closed containers or pipes.
(4) Mixing vessels which contain organic-HAP-containing coatings and other materials must be closed except when adding to, removing, or mixing the contents.
(5) Emissions of organic HAP must be minimized during cleaning of storage, mixing, and conveying equipment.
(c) As provided in § 63.6(g), we, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, may choose to grant you permission to use an alternative to the work practice standards in this section.

# Compliance Requirements for the Compliant Material Option
§ 63.3940
By what date must I conduct the initial compliance demonstration?
You must complete the initial compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements in § 63.3941. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3883 and ends on the last day of the 12th month following the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through that month plus the next 12 months. The initial compliance demonstration includes the calculations according to § 63.3941 and supporting documentation showing that during the initial compliance period, you used no coating with an organic HAP content that exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, and that you used no thinners and/or other additives, or cleaning materials that contained organic HAP as determined according to § 63.3941(a).
§ 63.3941
How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?
You may use the compliant material option for any individual coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all the coating operations in the affected source. You must use either the emission rate without add-on controls option or the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use this option. To demonstrate initial compliance using the compliant material option, the coating operation or group of coating operations must use no coating with an organic HAP content that exceeds the applicable emission limits in § 63.3890 and must use no thinner and/or other additive, or cleaning material that contains organic HAP as determined according to this section. Any coating operation for which you use the compliant material option is not required to meet the operating limits or work practice standards required in §§ 63.3892 and 63.3893, respectively. You must conduct a separate initial compliance demonstration for each general use, high performance, magnet wire, rubber-to-metal, and extreme performance fluoropolymer coating operation unless you are demonstrating compliance with a predominant activity or facility-specific emission limit as provided in § 63.3890(c). If you are demonstrating compliance with a predominant activity or facility-specific emission limit as provided in § 63.3890(c), you must demonstrate that all coating operations included in the predominant activity determination or calculation of the facility-specific emission limit comply with that limit. You must meet all the requirements of this section. Use the procedures in this section on each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material in the condition it is in when it is received from its manufacturer or supplier and prior to any alteration. You do not need to redetermine the organic HAP content of coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials that are reclaimed on-site (or reclaimed off-site if you have documentation showing that you received back the exact same materials that were sent off-site) and reused in the coating operation for which you use the compliant material option, provided these materials in their condition as received were demonstrated to comply with the compliant material option.
(a)
Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each material used.
You must determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during the compliance period by using one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1)
Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63).
You may use Method 311 for
determining the mass fraction of organic HAP. Use the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when performing a Method 311 test.
(i) Count each organic HAP in table 5 to this subpart that is measured to be present at 0.1 percent by mass or more and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not listed in table 5 to this subpart) is measured to be 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to count it. Express the mass fraction of each organic HAP you count as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (
e.g.,
0.3791).
(ii) Calculate the total mass fraction of organic HAP in the test material by adding up the individual organic HAP mass fractions and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (
e.g.,
0.763).
(2)
Method 24 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60).
For coatings, you may use Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP. For reactive adhesives in which some of the HAP react to form solids and are not emitted to the atmosphere, you may use the alternative method contained in appendix A to subpart PPPP of this part, rather than Method 24. You may use the volatile fraction that is emitted, as measured by the alternative method in appendix A to subpart PPPP of this part, as a substitute for the mass fraction of organic HAP.
(3)
Alternative method.
You may use an alternative test method for determining the mass fraction of organic HAP once the Administrator has approved it. You must follow the procedure in § 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.
(4)
Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material.
You may rely on information other than that generated by the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, such as manufacturer's formulation data, if it represents each organic HAP in table 5 to this subpart that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not listed in table 5 to this subpart) is 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to count it. For reactive adhesives in which some of the HAP react to form solids and are not emitted to the atmosphere, you may rely on manufacturer's data that expressly states the organic HAP or volatile matter mass fraction emitted. If there is a disagreement between such information and results of a test conducted according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, then the test method results will take precedence unless, after consultation, you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.
(5)
Solvent blends.
Solvent blends may be listed as single components for some materials in data provided by manufacturers or suppliers. Solvent blends may contain organic HAP which must be counted toward the total organic HAP mass fraction of the materials. When test data and manufacturer's data for solvent blends are not available, you may use the default values for the mass fraction of organic HAP in these solvent blends listed in Table 3 or 4 to this subpart. If you use the tables, you must use the values in Table 3 for all solvent blends that match Table 3 entries according to the instructions for Table 3, and you may use Table 4 only if the solvent blends in the materials you use do not match any of the solvent blends in Table 3 and you know only whether the blend is aliphatic or aromatic. However, if the results of a Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63) test indicate higher values than those listed on Table 3 or 4 to this subpart, the Method 311 results will take precedence unless, after consultation, you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.
(b)
Determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating.
You must determine the volume fraction of coating solids (liters (gal) of coating solids per liter (gal) of coating) for each coating used during the compliance period by a test, by information provided by the supplier or the manufacturer of the material, or by calculation, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of
this section. If test results obtained according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not agree with the information obtained under paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section, the test results will take precedence unless, after consultation, you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.
(1)
ASTM Method D2697-03 (Reapproved 2014) or D6093-97 (Reapproved 2016).
You may use ASTM D2697-03 (Reapproved 2014) (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14), or D6093-97 (Reapproved 2016) (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14), to determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating. Divide the nonvolatile volume percent obtained with the methods by 100 to calculate volume fraction of coating solids.
(2)
Alternative method.
You may use an alternative test method for determining the solids content of each coating once the Administrator has approved it. You must follow the procedure in § 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.
(3)
Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material.
You may obtain the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating from the supplier or manufacturer.
(4)
Calculation of volume fraction of coating solids.
You may determine the volume fraction of coating solids using Equation 1 of this section:
ER02JA04.003
Where:
V
s
= Volume fraction of coating solids, liters (gal) coating solids per liter (gal) coating.
m

see
§ 63.14), information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material, or reference sources providing density or specific gravity data for pure materials. If there is disagreement between ASTM D1475-13 test results and other information sources, the test results will take precedence unless, after consultation you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.
(c)
Determine the density of each coating.
Determine the density of each coating used during the compliance period from test results using ASTM D1475-13 (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14), information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material, or specific gravity data for pure chemicals. If there is disagreement between ASTM D1475-13 test results and the supplier's or manufacturer's information, the test results will take precedence unless, after consultation you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct.
(d)
Determine the organic HAP content of each coating.
Calculate the organic HAP content, kg (lb) of organic HAP emitted per liter (gal) coating solids used, of each coating used during the compliance period using Equation 2 of this section:
ER02JA04.004
Where:
H
c
= Organic HAP content of the coating, kg organic HAP emitted per liter (gal) coating solids used.
D
c
= Density of coating, kg coating per liter (gal) coating, determined according to paragraph (c) of this section.

= Mass fraction of organic HAP in the coating, kg organic HAP per kg coating, determined according to paragraph (a) of this section.
V
s
= Volume fraction of coating solids, liter (gal) coating solids per liter (gal) coating, determined according to paragraph (b) of this section.
(e)
Compliance demonstration.
The calculated organic HAP content for each coating used during the initial compliance period must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890; and each thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during the initial compliance period must contain no organic HAP, determined according to paragraph (a) of this section. You must keep all records required by §§ 63.3930 and 63.3931. As
part of the notification of compliance status required in § 63.3910, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the compliant material option and submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because you used no coatings for which the organic HAP content exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, and you used no thinners and/or other additives, or cleaning materials that contained organic HAP, determined according to the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section.
[69 FR 157, Jan. 2, 2004, as amended at 85 FR 41141, July 8, 2020]
§ 63.3942
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?
(a) For each compliance period to demonstrate continuous compliance, you must use no coating for which the organic HAP content (determined using Equation 2 of § 63.3941) exceeds the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, and use no thinner and/or other additive, or cleaning material that contains organic HAP, determined according to § 63.3941(a). A compliance period consists of 12 months. Each month, after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 63.3940, is the end of a compliance period consisting of that month and the preceding 11 months. If you are complying with a facility-specific emission limit under § 63.3890(c), you must also perform the calculation using Equation 1 in § 63.3890(c)(2) on a monthly basis using the data from the previous 12 months of operation.
(b) If you choose to comply with the emission limitations by using the compliant material option, the use of any coating, thinner and/or other additive, or cleaning material that does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section is a deviation from the emission limitations that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3910(c)(6) and 63.3920(a)(5).
(c) As part of each semiannual compliance report required by § 63.3920, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the compliant material option. If there were no deviations from the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because you used no coatings for which the organic HAP content exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, and you used no thinner and/or other additive, or cleaning material that contained organic HAP, determined according to § 63.3941(a).
(d) You must maintain records as specified in §§ 63.3930 and 63.3931.

# Compliance Requirements for the Emission Rate Without Add-On Controls Option
§ 63.3950
By what date must I conduct the initial compliance demonstration?
You must complete the initial compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements of § 63.3951. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3883 and ends on the last day of the 12th month following the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next 12 months. You must determine the mass of organic HAP emissions and volume of coating solids used each month and then calculate an organic HAP emission rate at the end of the initial compliance period. The initial compliance demonstration includes the calculations according to § 63.3951 and supporting documentation showing that during the initial compliance period the organic HAP emission rate was equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890.
§ 63.3951
How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations?
You may use the emission rate without add-on controls option for any individual coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all the coating operations in the affected source. You must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on
controls option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use this option. To demonstrate initial compliance using the emission rate without add-on controls option, the coating operation or group of coating operations must meet the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, but is not required to meet the operating limits or work practice standards in §§ 63.3892 and 63.3893, respectively. You must conduct a separate initial compliance demonstration for each general use, magnet wire, rubber-to-metal, and extreme performance fluoropolymer coating operation unless you are demonstrating compliance with a predominant activity or facility-specific emission limit as provided in § 63.3890(c). If you are demonstrating compliance with a predominant activity or facility-specific emission limit as provided in § 63.3890(c), you must demonstrate that all coating operations included in the predominant activity determination or calculation of the facility-specific emission limit comply with that limit. You must meet all the requirements of this section. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings, thinners and/or other additives, or cleaning materials used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option. You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coatings, thinners and/or other additives, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed on-site (or reclaimed off-site if you have documentation showing that you received back the exact same materials that were sent off-site) and reused in the coating operation for which you use the emission rate without add-on controls option. If you use coatings, thinners and/or other additives, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed on-site, the amount of each used in a month may be reduced by the amount of each that is reclaimed. That is, the amount used may be calculated as the amount consumed to account for materials that are reclaimed.
(a)
Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each material.
Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during each month according to the requirements in § 63.3941(a).
(b)

see
§ 63.14), information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material, or reference sources providing density or specific gravity data for pure materials. If you are including powder coatings in the compliance determination, determine the density of powder coatings, using ASTM D5965-02 (Reapproved 2013) (incorporated by reference,
see
§ 63.14), or information from the supplier. If there is disagreement between ASTM D1475-13 or ASTM D2111-10 (Reapproved 2015) test results and other such information sources, the test results will take precedence unless, after consultation you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the enforcement agency that the formulation data are correct. If you purchase materials or monitor consumption by weight instead of volume, you do not need to determine material density. Instead, you may use the material weight in place of the combined terms for density and volume in Equations 1A, 1B, 1C, and 2 of this section.
(d)
Determine the volume of each material used.
Determine the volume (liters) of each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during each month by measurement or usage records. If you purchase materials or monitor consumption by weight instead of volume, you do not need to determine the volume of each material used. Instead, you may use the material weight in place of the combined terms for density and volume in Equations 1A, 1B, and 1C of this section.

[69 FR 157, Jan. 2, 2004, as amended at 85 FR 41141, July 8, 2020]
§ 63.3952
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?
(a) To demonstrate continuous compliance, the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period, determined according to § 63.3951(a) through (g), must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890. A compliance period consists of 12 months. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 63.3950 is the end of a compliance period consisting of that month and the preceding 11 months. You must perform
the calculations in § 63.3951(a) through (g) on a monthly basis using data from the previous 12 months of operation. If you are complying with a facility-specific emission limit under § 63.3890(c), you must also perform the calculation using Equation 1 in § 63.3890(c)(2) on a monthly basis using the data from the previous 12 months of operation.

# Compliance Requirements for the Emission Rate With Add-On Controls Option
§ 63.3960
By what date must I conduct performance tests and other initial compliance demonstrations?
(a)
New and reconstructed affected sources.
For a new or reconstructed affected source, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) All emission capture systems, add-on control devices, and CPMS must be installed and operating no later than the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3883. Except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.3961(j), you must conduct according to the schedule in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section initial and periodic performance tests of each capture system and add-on control device according to the procedures in §§ 63.3964, 63.3965, and 63.3966 and establish the operating limits required by § 63.3892. For a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.3961(j), you must initiate the first material balance no later than the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3883. For magnet wire coating operations, you may, with approval, conduct a performance test of one representative magnet wire coating machine for each group of identical or very similar magnet wire coating machines.
(i) You must conduct the initial performance test and establish the operating limits required by § 63.3892 no later than 180 days after the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3883.
(ii) You must conduct periodic performance tests and establish the operating limits required by § 63.3892 within 5 years following the previous performance test. You must conduct the first periodic performance test before July 8, 2023, unless you are already required to complete periodic performance tests as a requirement of renewing your facility's operating permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 and have conducted a performance test on or after July 8, 2018. Thereafter you must conduct a performance test no later than 5 years following the previous performance test. Operating limits must be confirmed or reestablished during each performance test. For any control device for which you are using the catalytic oxidizer control option at § 63.3967(b) and following the catalyst maintenance procedures in § 63.3967(b)(4), you are not required to conduct periodic testing control device performance testing as specified by this paragraph.

(2) You must develop and begin implementing the work practice plan required by § 63.3893 no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.3883.
(3) You must complete the initial compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements of § 63.3961. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3883 and ends on the last day of the 12th month following the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next 12 months. You must determine the mass of organic HAP emissions and volume of coatings solids used each month and then calculate an organic HAP emission rate at the end of the initial compliance period. The initial compliance demonstration includes the results of emission capture system and add-on control device performance tests conducted according to §§ 63.3964, 63.3965, and 63.3966; results of liquid-liquid material balances conducted according to § 63.3961(j); calculations according to § 63.3961 and supporting documentation showing that during the initial compliance period the organic HAP emission rate was equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890; the operating limits established during the performance tests and the results of the continuous parameter monitoring required by § 63.3968; and documentation of whether you developed and implemented the work practice plan required by § 63.3893.
(4) For the initial compliance demonstration, you do not need to comply with the operating limits for the emission capture system and add-on control device required by § 63.3892 until after you have completed the initial performance tests specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Instead, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the emission capture system, add-on control device, and continuous parameter monitors during the period between the compliance date and the performance test. You must begin complying with the operating limits established based on the initial performance tests specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for your affected source on the date you complete the performance tests.

§ 63.3961
How do I demonstrate initial compliance?
(a) You may use the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all of the coating operations in the affected source. You may include both controlled and uncontrolled coating operations in a group for which you use this option. You must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use the emission rate with add-on controls option. To demonstrate initial compliance, the coating operation(s) for which you use the
emission rate with add-on controls option must meet the applicable emission limitations in §§ 63.3890, 63.3892, and 63.3893. You must conduct a separate initial compliance demonstration for each general use, magnet wire, rubber-to-metal, and extreme performance fluoropolymer coating operation, unless you are demonstrating compliance with a predominant activity or facility-specific emission limit as provided in § 63.3890(c). If you are demonstrating compliance with a predominant activity or facility-specific emission limit as provided in § 63.4490(c), you must demonstrate that all coating operations included in the predominant activity determination or calculation of the facility-specific emission limit comply with that limit. You must meet all the requirements of this section. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings, thinners and/or other additives, or cleaning materials used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option. You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coatings, thinners and/or other additives, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed onsite (or reclaimed off-site if you have documentation showing that you received back the exact same materials that were sent off-site) and reused in the coatings operation(s) for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option. If you use coatings, thinners and/or other additives, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed on-site, the amount of each used in a month may be reduced by the amount of each that is reclaimed. That is, the amount used may be calculated as the amount consumed to account for materials that are reclaimed.
(b)
Compliance with operating limits.
Except as provided in § 63.3960(a)(4), and except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to the requirements of paragraph (j) of this section, you must establish and demonstrate continuous compliance during the initial compliance period with the operating limits required by § 63.3892, using the procedures specified in §§ 63.3967 and 63.3968.
(c)
Compliance with work practice requirements.
You must develop, implement, and document your implementation of the work practice plan required by § 63.3893 during the initial compliance period, as specified in § 63.3930.
(d)
Compliance with emission limits.
You must follow the procedures in paragraphs (e) through (n) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890 for each affected source in each subcategory.
(e)
Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP, density, volume used, and volume fraction of coating solids.
Follow the procedures specified in § 63.3951(a) through (d) to determine the mass fraction of organic HAP, density, and volume of each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during each month; and the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating used during each month.
(f)
Calculate the total mass of organic HAP emissions before add-on controls.
Using Equation 1 of § 63.3951, calculate the total mass of organic HAP emissions before add-on controls from all coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials used during each month in the coating operation or group of coating operations for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option.
(g)
Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation.
Determine the mass of organic HAP emissions reduced for each controlled coating operation during each month. The emission reduction determination quantifies the total organic HAP emissions that pass through the emission capture system and are destroyed or removed by the add-on control device. Use the procedures in paragraph (h) of this section to calculate the mass of organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances. For each controlled coating operation using a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-
liquid material balance, use the procedures in paragraph (j) of this section to calculate the organic HAP emission reduction.
(h)
Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation not using liquid-liquid material balance.
Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances. The calculation applies the emission capture system efficiency and add-on control device efficiency to the mass of organic HAP contained in the coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials that are used in the coating operation served by the emission capture system and add-on control device during each month. You must assume zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control device for any period of time a deviation specified in § 63.3963(c) or (d) occurs in the controlled coating operation, including a deviation during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, unless you have other data indicating the actual efficiency of the emission capture system and add-on control device and the use of these data is approved by the Administrator. Equation 1 of this section treats the materials used during such a deviation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation.

The organic HAP emission rate for the initial compliance period, calculated using Equation 5 of this section, must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit for each subcategory in § 63.3890 or the predominant activity or facility-specific emission limit allowed in § 63.3890(c). You must keep all records as required by §§ 63.3930 and 63.3931. As part of the notification of compliance status required by § 63.3910, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the emission rate with add-on controls option and submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, and you achieved the operating limits required by § 63.3892 and the work practice standards required by § 63.3893.

§ 63.3963
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations?
(a) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period, determined according to the procedures in § 63.3961, must be equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890. A compliance period consists of 12 months. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 63.3960 is the end of a compliance period consisting of that month and the preceding 11 months. You must perform the calculations in § 63.3961 on a monthly basis using data from the previous 12 months of operation. If you are complying with a facility-specific emission limit under
§ 63.3890(c), you must also perform the calculation using Equation 1 in § 63.3890(c)(2) on a monthly basis using the data from the previous 12 months of operation.
(b) If the organic HAP emission rate for any 12-month compliance period exceeded the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, this is a deviation from the emission limitation for that compliance period that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3910(c)(6) and 63.3920(a)(7).
(c) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each operating limit required by § 63.3892 that applies to you, as specified in Table 1 to this subpart, when the coating line is in operation.
(1) If an operating parameter is out of the allowed range specified in Table 1 to this subpart, this is a deviation from the operating limit that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3910(c)(6) and 63.3920(a)(7).
(2) If an operating parameter deviates from the operating limit specified in Table 1 to this subpart, then you must assume that the emission capture system and add-on control device were achieving zero efficiency during the time period of the deviation, unless you have other data indicating the actual efficiency of the emission capture system and add-on control device and the use of these data is approved by the Administrator.
(d) You must meet the requirements for bypass lines in § 63.3968(b) for controlled coating operations for which you do not conduct liquid-liquid material balances. If any bypass line is opened and emissions are diverted to the atmosphere when the coating operation is running, this is a deviation that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3910(c)(6) and 63.3920(a)(7). For the purposes of completing the compliance calculations specified in §§ 63.3961(h), you must treat the materials used during a deviation on a controlled coating operation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation as indicated in Equation 1 of § 63.3961.
(e) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the work practice standards in § 63.3893. If you did not develop a work practice plan, or you did not implement the plan, or you did not keep the records required by § 63.3930(k)(8), this is a deviation from the work practice standards that must be reported as specified in §§ 63.3910(c)(6) and 63.3920(a)(7).
(f) As part of each semiannual compliance report required in § 63.3920, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the emission rate with add-on controls option. If there were no deviations from the emission limits in § 63.3890, the operating limits in § 63.3892, and the work practice standards in § 63.3893, submit a statement that you were in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.3890, and you achieved the operating limits required by § 63.3892 and the work practice standards required by § 63.3893 during each compliance period.
(g)-(h) [Reserved]
(i) On and after January 5, 2021, deviations that occur due to malfunction of the emission capture system, add-on control device, or coating operation that may affect emission capture or control device efficiency are required to operate in accordance with § 63.3900(b). The Administrator will determine whether the deviations are violations according to the provisions in § 63.3900(b).
(j) You must maintain records as specified in §§ 63.3930 and 63.3931.

§ 63.3964
What are the general requirements for performance tests?
(a) Before January 5, 2021, you must conduct each performance test required by § 63.3960 according to the requirements in § 63.7(e)(1) and under the conditions in this section, unless you obtain a waiver of the performance test according to the provisions in § 63.7(h). On and after January 5, 2021, you must conduct each performance test required by § 63.3960 according to the requirements in this section unless you obtain a waiver of the performance test according to the provisions in § 63.7(h).
(1)
Representative coating operation operating conditions.
You must conduct
the performance test under representative operating conditions for the coating operation. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, or periods of nonoperation do not constitute representative conditions for purposes of conducting a performance test. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(2)
Representative emission capture system and add-on control device operating conditions.
You must conduct the performance test when the emission capture system and add-on control device are operating at a representative flow rate, and the add-on control device is operating at a representative inlet concentration. You must record information that is necessary to document emission capture system and add-on control device operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation.
(b) You must conduct each performance test of an emission capture system according to the requirements in § 63.3965. You must conduct each performance test of an add-on control device according to the requirements in § 63.3966.

§ 63.3965
How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?
You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine capture efficiency as part of each performance test required by § 63.3960.
(a)
Assuming 100 percent capture efficiency.
You may assume the capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met:
(1) The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a PTE and directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.
(2) All coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation are applied within the capture system; coating solvent flash-off, curing, and drying occurs within the capture system; and the removal or evaporation of cleaning materials from the surfaces they are applied to occurs within the capture system. For example, this criterion is not met if parts enter the open shop environment when being moved between a spray booth and a curing oven.
(b)
Measuring capture efficiency.
If the capture system does not meet both of the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, then you must use one of the three protocols described in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section to measure capture efficiency. The capture efficiency measurements use TVH capture efficiency as a surrogate for organic HAP capture efficiency. For the protocols in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the capture efficiency measurement must consist of three test runs. Each test run must be at least 3 hours duration or the length of a production run, whichever is longer, up to 8 hours. For the purposes of this test, a production run means the time required for a single part to go from the beginning to the end of the production, which includes surface preparation activities and drying and curing time.
(c)
Liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure.
The liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol compares the mass of liquid TVH in materials used in the coating operation to the mass of TVH emissions not captured by the emission capture system. Use a temporary total enclosure or a building enclosure and the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section to measure emission capture system efficiency using the liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol.
(1) Either use a building enclosure or construct an enclosure around the coating operation where coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials are applied, and all areas where emissions from these applied coatings and materials subsequently occur, such as flash-off, curing, and drying areas. The areas of the coating
operation where capture devices collect emissions for routing to an add-on control device, such as the entrance and exit areas of an oven or spray booth, must also be inside the enclosure. The enclosure must meet the applicable definition of a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.
(2) Use Method 204A or 204F of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to determine the mass fraction of TVH liquid input from each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used in the coating operation during each capture efficiency test run. To make the determination, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
(3) Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the total mass of TVH liquid input from all the coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation during each capture efficiency test run:
ER02JA04.023
Where:
TVH
used
= Mass of liquid TVH in materials used in the coating operation during the capture efficiency test run, kg.
TVH
i
= Mass fraction of TVH in coating, thinner and/or other additive, or cleaning material, i, that is used in the coating operation during the capture efficiency test run, kg TVH per kg material.
Vol
i
= Total volume of coating, thinner and/or other additive, or cleaning material, i, used in the coating operation during the capture efficiency test run, liters.
D
i
= Density of coating, thinner and/or other additive, or cleaning material, i, kg material per liter material.
n = Number of different coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation during the capture efficiency test run.
(4) Use Method 204D or 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions that are not captured by the emission capture system. They are measured as they exit the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during each capture efficiency test run. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
(i) Use Method 204D of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 if the enclosure is a temporary total enclosure.
(ii) Use Method 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR 51 if the enclosure is a building enclosure. During the capture efficiency measurement, all organic compound emitting operations inside the building enclosure, other than the coating operation for which capture efficiency is being determined, must be shut down, but all fans and blowers must be operating normally.
(5) For each capture efficiency test run, determine the percent capture efficiency of the emission capture system using Equation 2 of this section:
ER02JA04.024
Where:
CE = Capture efficiency of the emission capture system vented to the add-on control device, percent.
TVH
used
= Total mass of TVH liquid input used in the coating operation during the capture efficiency test run, kg.
TVH
uncaptured
= Total mass of TVH that is not captured by the emission capture system and that exits from the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during the capture efficiency test run, kg.
(6) Determine the capture efficiency of the emission capture system as the
average of the capture efficiencies measured in the three test runs.
(d)
Gas-to-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or a building enclosure.
The gas-to-gas protocol compares the mass of TVH emissions captured by the emission capture system to the mass of TVH emissions not captured. Use a temporary total enclosure or a building enclosure and the procedures in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section to measure emission capture system efficiency using the gas-to-gas protocol.
(1) Either use a building enclosure or construct an enclosure around the coating operation where coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials are applied, and all areas where emissions from these applied coatings and materials subsequently occur, such as flash-off, curing, and drying areas. The areas of the coating operation where capture devices collect emissions generated by the coating operation for routing to an add-on control device, such as the entrance and exit areas of an oven or a spray booth, must also be inside the enclosure. The enclosure must meet the applicable definition of a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.
(2) Use Method 204B or 204C of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions captured by the emission capture system during each capture efficiency test run as measured at the inlet to the add-on control device. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
(i) The sampling points for the Method 204B or 204C measurement must be upstream from the add-on control device and must represent total emissions routed from the capture system and entering the add-on control device.
(ii) If multiple emission streams from the capture system enter the add-on control device without a single common duct, then the emissions entering the add-on control device must be simultaneously measured in each duct and the total emissions entering the add-on control device must be determined.
(3) Use Method 204D or 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions that are not captured by the emission capture system; they are measured as they exit the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during each capture efficiency test run. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
(i) Use Method 204D of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 if the enclosure is a temporary total enclosure.
(ii) Use Method 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 if the enclosure is a building enclosure. During the capture efficiency measurement, all organic compound emitting operations inside the building enclosure, other than the coating operation for which capture efficiency is being determined, must be shut down, but all fans and blowers must be operating normally.
(4) For each capture efficiency test run, determine the percent capture efficiency of the emission capture system using Equation 3 of this section:
ER02JA04.025
Where:
CE = Capture efficiency of the emission capture system vented to the add-on control device, percent.
TVH
captured
= Total mass of TVH captured by the emission capture system as measured at the inlet to the add-on control device during the emission capture efficiency test run, kg.
TVH
uncaptured
= Total mass of TVH that is not captured by the emission capture system and that exits from the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during the capture efficiency test run, kg.
(5) Determine the capture efficiency of the emission capture system as the average of the capture efficiencies measured in the three test runs.
(e)
Alternative capture efficiency protocol.
As an alternative to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and subject to the approval of the Administrator, you may determine capture efficiency using any other capture efficiency protocol and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the DQO or LCL approach as described in appendix A to subpart KK of this part.

§ 63.3966
How do I determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency?
You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency as part of the performance test required by § 63.3960. For each performance test, you must conduct three test runs as specified in § 63.7(e)(3) and each test run must last at least 1 hour. If the source is a magnet wire coating machine, you may use the procedures in section 3.0 of appendix A to this subpart as an alternative.
(a) For all types of add-on control devices, use the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Use Method 1 or 1A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to select sampling sites and velocity traverse points.
(2) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.
(3) Use Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight.
(4) Use Method 4 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, to determine stack gas moisture.
(5) Methods for determining gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular weight, and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during each test run.
(b) Measure total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon at the inlet and outlet of the add-on control device simultaneously, using either EPA Method 25 or 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60.
(1) Use EPA Method 25 of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be more than 50 parts per million (ppm) at the control device outlet.
(2) Use EPA Method 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be 50 ppm or less at the control device outlet.
(3) Use EPA Method 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is not an oxidizer.
(4) You may use EPA Method 18 of appendix A-6 to 40 CFR part 60 to subtract methane emissions from measured total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon.
(c) If two or more add-on control devices are used for the same emission stream, then you must measure emissions at the outlet to the atmosphere of each device. For example, if one add-on control device is a concentrator with an outlet to the atmosphere for the high-volume dilute stream that has been treated by the concentrator, and a second add-on control device is an oxidizer with an outlet to the atmosphere for the low-volume concentrated stream that is treated with the oxidizer, you must measure emissions at the outlet of the oxidizer and the high volume dilute stream outlet of the concentrator.
(d) For each test run, determine the total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rates for the inlet and the outlet of the add-on control device, using Equation 1 of this section. If there is more than one inlet or outlet to the add-on control device, you must calculate the total gaseous organic mass flow rate using Equation 1 of this section for each inlet and each outlet and then total all of the inlet emissions and total all of the outlet emissions:
ER02JA04.026
Where:
M
f
= Total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rate, kg per hour (h).
C
c
= Concentration of organic compounds as carbon in the vent gas, as determined by Method 25 or Method 25A, parts per million by volume (ppmv), dry basis.
Q
sd
= Volumetric flow rate of gases entering or exiting the add-on control device, as determined by Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G, dry standard cubic meters/hour (dscm/h).
0.0416 = Conversion factor for molar volume, kg-moles per cubic meter (mol/m
3
) (@ 293 Kelvin (K) and 760 millimeters of mercury (mmHg).
(e) For each test run, determine the add-on control device organic emissions destruction or removal efficiency, using Equation 2 of this section:
ER02JA04.027
Where:
DRE = Organic emissions destruction or removal efficiency of the add-on control device, percent.
M
fi
= Total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rate at the inlet(s) to the add-on control device, using Equation 1 of this section, kg/h.
M
fo
= Total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rate at the outlet(s) of the add-on control device, using Equation 1 of this section, kg/h.
(f) Determine the emission destruction or removal efficiency of the add-on control device as the average of the efficiencies determined in the three test runs and calculated in Equation 2 of this section.

§ 63.3967
How do I establish the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits during the performance test?
During the performance test required by § 63.3960 and described in §§ 63.3964, 63.3965, and 63.3966, you must establish the operating limits required by § 63.3892 according to this section, unless you have received approval for alternative monitoring and operating limits under § 63.8(f) as specified in § 63.3892.
(a)
Thermal oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a thermal oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the performance test. This average combustion temperature is the minimum operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.
(b)
Catalytic oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) or paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section. If the source is a magnet wire coating machine, you may use the procedures in section 3.0 of appendix A to this subpart as an alternative.
(1) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed and the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test. These are the minimum operating limits for your catalytic oxidizer.
(3) You must monitor the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed during the performance test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.
(4) You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The plan must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (
i.e.,
conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's recommended procedures. If problems are found during the catalyst activity test, you must replace the catalyst bed or take other corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations.
(ii) Monthly external inspection of the catalytic oxidizer system, including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.
(iii) Annual internal inspection of the catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found during the annual internal inspection of the catalyst, you must replace the catalyst bed or take other corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations. If the catalyst bed is replaced and is not of like or better kind and quality as the old catalyst then you must conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency according to § 63.3966. If a catalyst bed is replaced and the replacement catalyst is of like or better kind and quality as the old catalyst, then a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency is not required and you may continue to use the previously established operating limits for that catalytic oxidizer.
(c)
Regenerative carbon adsorbers.
If your add-on control device is a regenerative carbon adsorber, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) You must monitor and record the total regeneration desorbing gas (
e.g.,
steam or nitrogen) mass flow for each regeneration cycle, and the carbon bed temperature after each carbon bed regeneration and cooling cycle for the regeneration cycle either immediately preceding or immediately following the performance test.
(2) The operating limits for your regenerative carbon adsorber are the minimum total desorbing gas mass flow recorded during the regeneration cycle and the maximum carbon bed temperature recorded after the cooling cycle.
(d)
Condensers.
If your add-on control device is a condenser, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature maintained during the performance test. This average condenser outlet gas temperature is the maximum operating limit for your condenser.
(e)
Concentrators.
If your add-on control device includes a concentrator, you must establish operating limits for the concentrator according to paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the desorption concentrate stream gas
temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three runs of the performance test.
(2) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature. This is the minimum operating limit for the desorption concentrate gas stream temperature.
(3) During performance tests, you must monitor and record the pressure drop of the dilute stream across the concentrator at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three runs of the performance test.
(4) For each performance test, use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average pressure drop. This is the minimum operating limit for the dilute stream across the concentrator.
(f)
Emission capture systems.
For each capture device that is not part of a PTE that meets the criteria of § 63.3965(a), establish an operating limit for either the gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure, as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. The operating limit for a PTE is specified in Table 1 to this subpart. If the source is a magnet wire coating machine, you may use the procedures in section 2.0 of appendix A to this subpart as an alternative.
(1) During the capture efficiency determination required by § 63.3960 and described in §§ 63.3964 and 63.3965, you must monitor and record either the gas volumetric flow rate or the duct static pressure for each separate capture device in your emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs at a point in the duct between the capture device and the add-on control device inlet.
(2) Calculate and record the average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure for the three test runs for each capture device. This average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure is the minimum operating limit for that specific capture device.

§ 63.3968
What are the requirements for continuous parameter monitoring system installation, operation, and maintenance?
(a)
General.
You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraphs (c), (e), (f), and (g) of this section according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section. You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section according to paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) of this section.
(1) The CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period. You must have a minimum of four equally spaced successive cycles of CPMS operation in 1 hour.
(2) You must determine the average of all recorded readings for each successive 3-hour period of the emission capture system and add-on control device operation.
(3) You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check of the CPMS.
(4) Before January 5, 2021, you must maintain the CPMS at all times and have available necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment. On and after January 5, 2021, you must maintain the CPMS at all times in accordance with § 63.3900(b) and keep necessary parts readily available for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.
(5) Before January 5, 2021, you must operate the CPMS and collect emission capture system and add-on control device parameter data at all times that a controlled coating operation is operating, except during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, if applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments). On and after January 5, 2021, you must operate the CPMS and collect emission capture system and add-on control device parameter data at all times in accordance with § 63.3900(b).
(6) You must not use emission capture system or add-on control device
parameter data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities when calculating data averages. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating the data averages for determining compliance with the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits.
(7) A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the CPMS to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. Before January 5, 2021, any period for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for required calculations is a deviation from the monitoring requirements.

means the portion (expressed as a percentage) of the pollutants from an emission source that is delivered to an add-on control device.
Capture system
means one or more capture devices intended to collect emissions generated by a coating operation in the use of coatings or cleaning materials, both at the point of application and at subsequent points where emissions from the coatings and cleaning materials occur, such as flashoff, drying, or curing. As used in this subpart, multiple capture devices that collect emissions generated by a coating operation are considered a single capture system.
Cleaning material
means a solvent used to remove contaminants and other materials, such as dirt, grease, oil, and dried or wet coating (
e.g.,
depainting or paint stripping), from a substrate before or after coating application or from equipment associated with a coating operation, such as spray booths, spray guns, racks, tanks, and hangers. Thus, it includes any cleaning material used on substrates or equipment or both.
Coating
means a material applied to a substrate for decorative, protective, or functional purposes. Such materials include, but are not limited to, paints, sealants, liquid plastic coatings, caulks, inks, adhesives, and maskants. Decorative, protective, or functional materials that consist only of protective oils for metal, acids, bases, or any combination of these substances, or paper film or plastic film which may be pre-coated with an adhesive by the film manufacturer, are not considered coatings for the purposes of this subpart.

Magnet wire coatings provide high dielectric strength and turn-to-turn conductor insulation. This allows the turns of an electrical device to be placed in close proximity to one another which leads to increased coil effectiveness and electrical efficiency.
Magnet wire coating machine
means equipment which applies and cures magnet wire coatings.
Manufacturer's formulation data
means data on a material (such as a coating) that are supplied by the material manufacturer based on knowledge of the ingredients used to manufacture that material, rather than based on testing of the material with the test methods specified in § 63.3941.

Non-HAP coating
means, for the purposes of this subpart, a coating that contains no more than 0.1 percent by mass of any individual organic HAP that is listed in Table 5 to this subpart and no more than 1.0 percent by mass for any other individual HAP.
Organic HAP content
means the mass of organic HAP emitted per volume of coating solids used for a coating calculated using Equation 2 of § 63.3941. The organic HAP content is determined for the coating in the condition it is in when received from its manufacturer or supplier and does not account for any alteration after receipt. For reactive adhesives in which some of the HAP react to form solids and are not emitted to the atmosphere, organic HAP content is the mass of organic HAP that is emitted, rather than the organic HAP content of the coating as it is received.
Permanent total enclosure (PTE)
means a permanently installed enclosure that meets the criteria of Method 204 of appendix M, 40 CFR part 51, for a PTE and that directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.
Personal watercraft
means a vessel (boat) which uses an inboard motor powering a water jet pump as its primary source of motive power and which is designed to be operated by a person or persons sitting, standing, or kneeling on the vessel, rather than in the conventional manner of sitting or standing inside the vessel.
Protective oil
means an organic material that is applied to metal for the purpose of providing lubrication or protection from corrosion without forming a solid film. This definition of protective oil includes, but is not limited to, lubricating oils, evaporative oils (including those that evaporate completely), and extrusion oils. Protective oils used on miscellaneous metal parts and products include magnet wire lubricants and soft temporary protective coatings that are removed prior to installation or further assembly of a part or component.
Reactive adhesive
means adhesive systems composed, in part, of volatile
monomers that react during the adhesive curing reaction, and, as a result, do not evolve from the film during use. These volatile components instead become integral parts of the adhesive through chemical reaction. At least 70 percent of the liquid components of the system, excluding water, react during the process.
Research or laboratory facility
means a facility whose primary purpose is for research and development of new processes and products, that is conducted under the close supervision of technically trained personnel, and is not engaged in the manufacture of final or intermediate products for commercial purposes, except in a
de minimis
manner.
Responsible official
means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.
Rubber-to-metal coatings
are coatings that contain heat-activated polymer systems in either solvent or water that, when applied to metal substrates, dry to a non-tacky surface and react chemically with the rubber and metal during a vulcanization process.
Startup, initial
means the first time equipment is brought online in a facility.
Surface preparation
means use of a cleaning material on a portion of or all of a substrate. This includes use of a cleaning material to remove dried coating, which is sometimes called depainting.
Temporary total enclosure
means an enclosure constructed for the purpose of measuring the capture efficiency of pollutants emitted from a given source as defined in Method 204 of appendix M, 40 CFR part 51.
Thinner
means an organic solvent that is added to a coating after the coating is received from the supplier.
Total volatile hydrocarbon (TVH)
means the total amount of nonaqueous volatile organic matter determined according to Methods 204 and 204A through 204F of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 and substituting the term TVH each place in the methods where the term VOC is used. The TVH includes both VOC and non-VOC.
Uncontrolled coating operation
means a coating operation from which none of the organic HAP emissions are routed through an emission capture system and add-on control device.
Volatile organic compound (VOC)
means any compound defined as VOC in 40 CFR 51.100(s).
Volume fraction of coating solids
means the ratio of the volume of coating solids (also known as the volume of nonvolatiles) to the volume of a coating in which it is contained; liters (gal) of coating solids per liter (gal) of coating.

# Appendix A to Subpart MMMM of Part 63—Alternative Capture Efficiency and Destruction Efficiency Measurement and Monitoring Procedures for Magnet Wire Coating Operations
1.0 Introduction.
1.1 These alternative procedures for capture efficiency and destruction efficiency measurement and monitoring are intended principally for newer magnet wire coating machines where the control device is internal and integral to the oven so that it is difficult or infeasible to make gas measurements at the inlet to the control device.
1.2 In newer gas fired magnet wire ovens with thermal control (no catalyst), the burner tube serves as the control device (thermal oxidizer) for the process. The combustion of solvents in the burner tube is the principal source of heat for the oven.
1.3 In newer magnet wire ovens with a catalyst there is either a burner tube (gas fired ovens) or a tube filled with electric heating elements (electric heated oven) before the catalyst. A large portion of the solvent is often oxidized before reaching the catalyst. The combustion of solvents in the tube and across the catalyst is the principal source of heat for the oven. The internal catalyst in these ovens cannot be accessed without disassembly of the oven. This disassembly includes removal of the oven insulation. Oven reassembly often requires the installation of new oven insulation.
1.4 Some older magnet wire ovens have external afterburners. A significant portion of the solvent is oxidized within these ovens as well.
1.5 The alternative procedure for destruction efficiency determines the organic carbon content of the volatiles entering the control device based on the quantity of coating used, the carbon content of the volatile portion of the coating and the efficiency of the capture system. The organic carbon content of the control device outlet (oven exhaust for ovens without an external afterburner) is determined using Method 25 or 25A.
1.6 When it is difficult or infeasible to make gas measurements at the inlet to the control device, measuring capture efficiency with a gas-to-gas protocol (see § 63.3965(d)) which relies on direct measurement of the captured gas stream will also be difficult or infeasible. In these situations, capture efficiency measurement is more appropriately done with a procedure which does not rely on direct measurement of the captured gas stream.
1.7 Magnet wire ovens are relatively small compared to many other coating ovens. The exhaust rate from an oven is low and varies as the coating use rate and solvent loading rate change from job to job. The air balance in magnet wire ovens is critical to product quality. Magnet wire ovens must be operated under negative pressure to avoid smoke and odor in the workplace, and the exhaust rate must be sufficient to prevent over heating within the oven.
1.8 The liquid and gas measurements needed to determine capture efficiency and control device efficiency using these alternative procedures may be made simultaneously.
1.9 Magnet wire facilities may have many (
e.g.,
20 to 70 or more) individual coating lines each with its own capture and control system. With approval, representative capture efficiency and control device efficiency testing of one magnet wire coating machine out of a group of identical or very similar magnet wire coating machines may be performed rather than testing every individual magnet wire coating machine. The operating parameters must be established for each tested magnet wire coating machine during each capture efficiency test and each control device efficiency test. The operating parameters established for each tested magnet wire
coating machine also serve as the operating parameters for untested or very similar magnet wire coating machines represented by a tested magnet wire coating machine.
2.0 Capture Efficiency.
2.1 If the capture system is a permanent total enclosure as described in § 63.3965(a), then its capture efficiency may be assumed to be 100 percent.
2.2 If the capture system is not a permanent total enclosure, then capture efficiency must be determined using the liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in § 63.3965(c), or an alternative capture efficiency protocol (see § 63.3965(e)) which does not rely on direct measurement of the captured gas stream.
2.3 As an alternative to establishing and monitoring the capture efficiency operating parameters in § 63.3967(f), the monitoring described in either section 2.4 or 2.5, and the monitoring described in sections 2.6 and 2.7 may be used for magnet wire coating machines.
2.4 Each magnet wire oven must be equipped with an interlock mechanism which will stop or prohibit the application of coating either when any exhaust fan for that oven is not operating or when the oven experiences an over limit temperature condition.
2.5 Each magnet wire oven must be equipped with an alarm which will be activated either when any oven exhaust fan is not operating or when the oven experiences an over limit temperature condition.
2.6 If the interlock in 2.4 or the alarm in 2.5 is monitoring for over limit temperature conditions, then the temperature(s) that will trigger the interlock or the alarm must be included in the start-up, shutdown and malfunction plan and the interlock or alarm must be set to be activated when the oven reaches that temperature.
2.7 Once every 6 months, each magnet wire oven must be checked using a smoke stick or equivalent approach to confirm that the oven is operating at negative pressure compared to the surrounding atmosphere.
3.0 Control Device Efficiency.
3.1 Determine the weight fraction carbon content of the volatile portion of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material used during each test run using either the procedure in section 3.2 or 3.3.
3.2 Following the procedures in Method 204F, distill a sample of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material used during each test run to separate the volatile portion. Determine the weight fraction carbon content of each distillate using ASTM Method D5291-02, “Standard Test Methods for Instrumental Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen in Petroleum Products and Lubricants” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
3.3 Analyze each coating, thinner, additive or cleaning material used during each test run using Method 311. For each volatile compound detected in the gas chromatographic analysis of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material calculate the weight fraction of that whole compound in the coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material. For each volatile compound detected in the gas chromatographic analysis of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material calculate the weight fraction of the carbon in that compound in the coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material. Calculate the weight fraction carbon content of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material as the ratio of the sum of the carbon weight fractions divided by the sum of the whole compound weight fractions.
3.4 Determine the mass fraction of total volatile hydrocarbon (TVH
i
) in each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material, i, used during each test run using Method 24. The mass fraction of total volatile hydrocarbon equals the weight fraction volatile matter (W
v
in Method 24) minus the weight fraction water (W
w
in Method 24), if any, present in the coating. The ASTM Method D6053-00, “Standard Test Method for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Content of Electrical Insulating Varnishes” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), may be used as an alternative to Method 24 for magnet wire enamels. The specimen size for testing magnet wire enamels with ASTM Method D6053-00 must be 2.0 ±0.1 grams.
3.5 Determine the volume (VOL
i
) or mass (MASS
i
) of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material, i, used during each test run.
3.6 Calculate the total volatile hydrocarbon input (TVHC
inlet
) to the control device during each test run, as carbon, using Equation 1:
ER02JA04.028
where:
TVH
i
= Mass fraction of TVH in coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material, i, used in the coating operation during the test run.
VOL
i
= Volume of coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material, i, used in the coating operation during the test run, liters.
D
i
= Density of coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material, i, used in the coating operation during the test run, kg per liter.
CD
i
= Weight fraction carbon content of the distillate from coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material, i, used in the coating operation during the test run, percent.
n = Number of coating, thinner, additive, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation during the test run.
3.7 If the mass, MASS
i
, of each coating, solvent, additive, or cleaning material, i, used during the test run is measured directly then MASS
i
can be substituted for VOL
i
× D
i
in Equation 1 in section 3.6.
3.8 Determine the TVHC output (TVHC
outlet
) from the control device, as carbon, during each test run using the methods in § 63.3966(a) and the procedure for determining M
fo
in § 63.3966(d). TVHC
outlet
equals M
fo
times the length of the test run in hours.
3.9 Determine the control device efficiency (DRE) for each test run using Equation 2:
ER02JA04.029
3.10 The efficiency of the control device is the average of the three individual test run values determined in section 3.9.
3.11 As an alternative to establishing and monitoring the destruction efficiency operating parameters for catalytic oxidizers in § 63.3967(b), the monitoring described in sections 3.12 and 3.13 may be used for magnet wire coating machines equipped with catalytic oxidizers.
3.12 During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature either just before or just after the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature either just before or just after the catalyst bed during the performance test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer and for the catalytic oxidizers in identical or very similar magnet wire coating machines represented by the tested magnet wire coating machine.
3.13 You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s). The plan must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in sections 3.14 and 3.15, and the elements specified in either (a) section 3.16 or (b) sections 3.17 and 3.18.
3.14 You must conduct a monthly external inspection of each catalytic oxidizer system, including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.
3.15 You must conduct an annual internal inspection of each accessible catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found, you must replace the catalyst bed or take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations. This provision does not apply to internal catalysts which cannot be accessed without disassembling the magnet wire oven.
3.16 You must take a sample of each catalyst bed and perform an analysis of the catalyst activity (
i.e.,
conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's recommended procedures. This sampling and analysis must be done within the time period shown in Table 1 below of the most recent of the last catalyst activity test or the last catalyst replacement. For example, if the warranty for the catalyst is 3 years and the catalyst was more recently replaced then the sampling and analysis must be done within the earlier of 26,280 operating hours or 5 calendar years of the last catalyst replacement. If the warranty for the catalyst is 3 years and the catalyst was more recently tested then the sampling and analysis must be done within the earlier of 13,140 operating hours or 3 calendar years of the last catalyst activity test. If problems are found during the catalyst activity test, you must replace the catalyst bed or take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations.
Table 1—Catalyst Monitoring Requirements
If the catalyst was last (more recently) replaced and the warranty period is . . .
Then the time between catalyst replacement and the next catalyst activity test cannot exceed the earlier of . . .
And the catalyst was more recently tested, then the time between catalyst activity tests cannot exceed the earlier of . . .
1 year
8,760 operating hours or 5 calendar years
8,760 operating hours or 3 calendar years.
2 years
15,520 operating hours or 5 calendar years
8,760 operating hours or 3 calendar years.

17,520 operating hours or 3 calendar years.
5 or more years
43,800 operating hours or 5 calendar years
21,900 operating hours or 3 calendar years.
3.17 During the performance test, you must determine the average concentration of organic compounds as carbon in the magnet wire oven exhaust stack gases (C
c
in Equation 1 in § 63.3966(d)) and the destruction efficiency of the catalytic oxidizer, and calculate the operating limit for oven exhaust stack gas concentration as follows. You must identify the highest organic HAP content coating used on this magnet wire coating machine or any identical or very similar magnet wire coating machines to which the same destruction efficiency test results will be applied. Calculate the percent emission reduction necessary to meet the magnet wire coating emission limit when using this coating. Calculate the average concentration of organic compounds as carbon in the magnet wire oven exhaust stack gases that would be equivalent to exactly meeting the magnet wire coating emissions limit when using the highest organic HAP content coating. The maximum operating limit for oven exhaust stack gas concentration equals 90 percent of this calculated concentration.
3.18 For each magnet wire coating machine equipped with a catalytic oxidizer you must perform an annual 10 minute test of the oven exhaust stack gases using EPA Method 25A. This test must be performed under steady state operating conditions similar to those at which the last destruction efficiency test for equipment of that type (either the specific magnet wire coating machine or an identical or very similar magnet wire coating machine) was conducted. If the average exhaust stack gas concentration during the annual test of a magnet wire coating machine equipped with a catalytic oxidizer is greater than the operating limit established in section 3.17 then that is a deviation from the operating limit for that catalytic oxidizer. If problems are found during the annual 10-minute test of the oven exhaust stack gases, you must replace the catalyst bed or take other corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations.
3.19 If a catalyst bed is replaced and the replacement catalyst is not of like or better kind and quality as the old catalyst, then you must conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency according to § 63.3966 and establish new operating limits for that catalytic oxidizer unless destruction efficiency test results and operating limits for an identical or very similar unit (including consideration of the replacement catalyst) are available and approved for use for the catalytic oxidizer with the replacement catalyst.
3.20 If a catalyst bed is replaced and the replacement catalyst is of like or better kind and quality as the old catalyst, then a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency is not required and you may continue to use the previously established operating limits for that catalytic oxidizer.

# Subpart NNNN—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Surface Coating of Large Appliances

# Source:
67 FR 48262, July 23, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.4080
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for large appliance surface coating facilities. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations.
§ 63.4081
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a facility that applies coatings to large appliance parts
or products, and is a major source, is located at a major source, or is part of a major source of emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP), except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (Mg) (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 Mg (25 tons) or more per year. You are not subject to this subpart if your large appliance surface coating facility is located at, or is part of, an area source of HAP emissions. An area source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that is not a major source.
(b) The large appliance surface coating source category includes any facility engaged in the surface coating of a large appliance part or product. Large appliance parts and products include but are not limited to cooking equipment; refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerated cabinets and cases; laundry equipment; dishwashers, trash compactors, and water heaters; and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) units, air-conditioning (except motor vehicle) units, air-conditioning and heating combination units, comfort furnaces, and electric heat pumps. Specifically excluded are heat transfer coils and large commercial and industrial chillers.
(c) The large appliance surface coating activities and equipment to which this subpart applies are listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section:
(1) Surface preparation of large appliance parts and products;
(2) Preparation of a coating for application (e.g., mixing in thinners and other components);
(3) Application of a coating to large appliance parts and products using, for example, spray guns or dip tanks;
(4) Application of porcelain enamel, powder coating, and asphalt interior soundproofing coating;
(5) Flash-off, drying, or curing following the coating application operation;
(6) Cleaning of equipment used in coating operations (e.g., application equipment, hangers, racks);
(7) Storage of coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials;
(8) Conveying of coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials from storage areas to mixing areas or coating application areas, either manually (e.g., in buckets) or by automated means (e.g., transfer through pipes using pumps); and
(9) Handling and conveying of waste materials generated by coating operations.
(d) This subpart does not apply to surface coating that meets any of the criteria of paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) The surface coating of large appliance parts such as metal or plastic handles, hinges, or fasteners that have a wider use beyond large appliances is not subject to this subpart.
(2) The surface coating of large appliances conducted for the purpose of repairing or maintaining large appliances used by a facility and not for commerce is not subject to this subpart unless organic HAP emissions from the surface coating itself are as high as the rates specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(3) The surface coating of heat transfer coils or large commercial and industrial chillers.
(4) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to research or laboratory facilities; janitorial, building, and facility maintenance operations; hobby shops operated for noncommercial purposes or coating applications using hand-held non-refillable aerosol containers.
(5) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to processes involving metal plating or phosphating of a substrate.
(e) If you own or operate an affected source that is subject to this subpart and at the same affected source you also perform surface coating subject to any other subparts in this part, you may choose for the affected source to comply with only one subpart. In order to choose this alternative, the total mass of organic HAP emissions from all surface coating operations in the affected source must be less than or equal to the total mass of organic HAP
emissions that would result if it complied separately with all applicable subparts. You must make this comparison for the initial compliance period and report it in the Notification of Compliance Status as required in § 63.4110(b)(10) and in the Notification of Compliance Status required by the other subparts. If you choose this alternative, your demonstration of compliance with the other subpart constitutes compliance with this subpart.
§ 63.4082
What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
(a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, and existing affected source.
(b) The affected source is the collection of all of the items listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section that are part of the large appliance surface coating facility:
(1) All coating operations as defined in § 63.4181;
(2) All storage containers and mixing vessels in which coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials are stored or mixed;
(3) All manual and automated equipment and containers used for conveying coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials; and
(4) All storage containers and all manual and automated equipment and containers used for conveying waste materials generated by a coating operation.
(c) An affected source is a new affected source if you commenced its construction after July 23, 2002, and the construction is of a completely new large appliance surface coating facility where previously no large appliance surface coating facility had existed.
(d) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria as defined in § 63.2.
(e) An affected source is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.
§ 63.4083
When do I have to comply with this subpart?
The date by which you must comply with this subpart is called the compliance date. The compliance date for each type of affected source is specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. The compliance date begins the initial compliance period during which you conduct the initial compliance demonstration described in §§ 63.4140, 63.4150, and 63.4160.
(a) For a new or reconstructed affected source, the compliance date is the applicable date in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.

(2) If the initial startup of your new or reconstructed affected source occurs after July 23, 2002, the compliance date is the date of initial startup of your affected source.
(b) For an existing affected source, the compliance date is July 25, 2005.
(c) For an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP emissions, the compliance date is specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) For any portion of the source that becomes a new or reconstructed affected source subject to this subpart, the compliance date is the date of initial startup of the affected source, or the date the area source becomes a major source, or July 23, 2002, whichever is latest.
(2) For any portion of the source that becomes an existing affected source subject to this subpart, the compliance date is the date 1 year after the area source becomes a major source or July 25, 2005, whichever is later.
(d) You must meet the notification requirements in § 63.4110 according to the dates specified in that section and in subpart A of this part. Some of the notifications must be submitted before the compliance dates described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

# Emission Limitations
§ 63.4090
What emission limits must I meet?
(a) For an existing affected source, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere to no more than 0.13 kilogram per liter (kg/liter) (1.1 pound per gallon (lb/gal)) of coating solids used during each compliance period.
(b) For a new or reconstructed affected source, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere to no
more than 0.022 kg/liter (0.18 lb/gal) of coating solids used during each compliance period.
§ 63.4091
What are my options for meeting the emission limits?
You must include all coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used in the affected source when determining whether the organic HAP emission rate is equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090. To make this determination, you must use at least one of the three compliance options listed in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. You may apply any of the compliance options to an individual coating operation or to multiple coating operations as a group or to the entire affected source. You may use different compliance options for different coating operations or at different times on the same coating operation. However, you may not use different compliance options at the same time on the same coating operation. If you switch between compliance options for any coating operation or group of coating operations, you must document this switch as required by § 63.4130(c), and you must report it in the next semiannual compliance report required in § 63.4120.
(a)
Compliant material option.
Demonstrate that the organic HAP content of each coating used in the coating operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090, and that each thinner and each cleaning material used contains no organic HAP. You must meet all the requirements of §§ 63.4140, 63.4141, and 63.4142 to demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using this option.
(b)
Emission rate without add-on controls option.
Demonstrate that, based on data on the coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation(s), the organic HAP emission rate for the coating operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090. You must meet all the requirements of §§ 63.4150, 63.4151, and 63.4152 to demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using this option.
(c)
Emission rate with add-on controls option.
Demonstrate that, based on data on the coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation(s) and the emission reductions achieved by emission capture and add-on controls, the organic HAP emission rate for the coating operation(s) is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090. If you use this compliance option, you must also demonstrate that all emission capture systems and add-on control devices for the coating operation(s) meet the operating limits required in § 63.4092, except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4161(h), and that you meet the work practice standards required in § 63.4093. You must meet all the requirements of §§ 63.4160 through 63.4168 to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards using this option.
§ 63.4092
What operating limits must I meet?
(a) For any coating operation(s) on which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option, you are not required to meet any operating limits.
(b) For any controlled coating operation(s) on which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option, except those for which you use a solvent recovery system and conduct a liquid-liquid material balance according to § 63.4161(h), you must meet the operating limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart. These operating limits apply to the emission capture and control systems on the coating operation(s) for which you use this option, and you must establish the operating limits during the performance test according to the requirements in § 63.4167. You must meet the operating limits at all times after you establish them.
(c) If you use an add-on control device other than those listed in Table 1 to this subpart or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under § 63.8(f).
§ 63.4093
What work practice standards must I meet?
(a) For any coating operation(s) on which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option, you are not required to meet any work practice standards.
(b) If you use the emission rate with add-on controls option, you must develop and implement a work practice plan to minimize organic HAP emissions from the storage, mixing, and conveying of coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used in, and waste materials generated by, the coating operation(s) for which you use this option; or you must meet an alternative standard as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The plan must specify practices and procedures to ensure that, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section are implemented.
(1) All organic-HAP-containing coatings, thinners, cleaning materials, and waste materials must be stored in closed containers.
(2) Spills of organic-HAP-containing coatings, thinners, cleaning materials, and waste materials must be minimized.
(3) Organic-HAP-containing coatings, thinners, cleaning materials, and waste materials must be conveyed from one location to another in closed containers or pipes.
(4) Mixing vessels which contain organic-HAP-containing coatings and other materials must be closed except when adding to, removing, or mixing the contents.
(5) Emissions of organic HAP must be minimized during cleaning of storage, mixing, and conveying equipment.
(c) As provided in § 63.6(g), we, the EPA, may choose to grant you permission to use an alternative to the work practice standards in this section.

# General Compliance Requirements
§ 63.4100
What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
(a) You must be in compliance with the emission limitations in this subpart as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) Any coating operation(s) for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option, as specified in § 63.4091(a) and (b), must be in compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090 at all times.
(2) Any coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option, as specified in § 63.4091(c), must be in compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090 and work practice standards in § 63.4093 at all times. Each controlled coating operation must be in compliance with the operating limits for emission capture systems and add-on control devices required by § 63.4092 at all times, except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4161(h).
(b) Before September 12, 2019, you must always operate and maintain your affected source, including all air pollution control and monitoring equipment you use for purposes of complying with this subpart, according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(1)(i). On and after September 12, 2019, at all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the affected source.
(c) If your affected source uses an emission capture system and add-on control device, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the emission capture system, add-on control device, and continuous parameter monitors during the period
between the compliance date specified for your affected source in § 63.4083 and the date when the initial emission capture system and add-on control device performance tests have been completed as specified in § 63.4160. This requirement does not apply to a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance according to § 63.4161(h) in lieu of conducting performance tests.
(d) Before September 12, 2019, if your affected source uses an emission capture system and add-on control device, you must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(3). The plan must address the startup, shutdown, and corrective actions in the event of a malfunction of the emission capture system or the add-on control device. The plan must also address any coating operation equipment that may cause increased emissions or that would affect capture efficiency if the process equipment malfunctions, such as conveyors that move parts among enclosures. A startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is not required on and after September 12, 2019.

§ 63.4120
What reports must I submit?
You must submit semiannual compliance reports for each affected source according to the requirements of this section. The semiannual compliance reporting requirements of this section may be satisfied by reports required under other parts of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
(a) Unless the Administrator has approved a different schedule for submission of reports under § 63.10(a), you must prepare and submit each semiannual compliance report according to the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) The first semiannual compliance report must cover the first semiannual reporting period which begins the day after the end of the initial compliance period described in § 63.4140, § 63.4150, or § 63.4160 that applies to your affected source and ends on June 30 or December 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the initial compliance period.
(2) Each subsequent semiannual compliance report must cover the subsequent semiannual reporting period from January 1 through June 30 or the semiannual reporting period from July 1 through December 31.
(3) Each semiannual compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the semiannual reporting period.
(4) For each affected source that is subject to permitting regulations pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, and if the permitting authority has established dates for submitting semiannual reports pursuant to 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), you may submit the first and subsequent semiannual compliance reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established instead of the date specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(5) Each affected source that has obtained a title V operating permit pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 must report all deviations as defined in this subpart in the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). If an affected source submits a semiannual compliance report pursuant to this section along with, or as part of, the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the semiannual compliance report includes all required information concerning deviations from any emission limitation in this subpart, its submission shall be deemed to satisfy any obligation to report the same deviations in the semiannual monitoring report. However, submission of a semiannual compliance report shall not otherwise affect any obligation the affected source may have to report deviations from permit requirements to the permitting authority.
(b) The semiannual compliance report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section and the information specified in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section that is applicable to your affected source.

(c) If there were no deviations from the emission limitations in §§ 63.4090, 63.4092, and 63.4093 that apply to you, the semiannual compliance report must include a statement that there were no deviations from the emission limitations during the reporting period.
(d) If you use the compliant material option and there was a deviation from the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090, the semiannual compliance report must contain the information in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.
(1) Before September 12, 2019, the information in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) Identification of each coating used that deviated from the emission limit, each thinner and cleaning material used that contained organic HAP, and the dates and time periods each was used.
(ii) The determination of the organic HAP content, according to § 63.4141(d), for each coating identified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. You do not need to submit background data supporting this calculation, for example, information provided by coating suppliers or manufacturers or test reports.
(iii) The determination of mass fraction of organic HAP for each thinner and cleaning material identified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. You do not need to submit background data supporting this calculation, for example, information provided by material suppliers or manufacturers or test reports.
(iv) A statement of the cause of each deviation.
(2) On and after September 12, 2019, if there was a deviation from the applicable emission limit in § 63.4090, the semiannual compliance report must contain the information in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i) Identification of each coating used that deviated from the emission limit, each thinner and cleaning material used that contained organic HAP, and the date, time, and duration each was used.
(ii) The determination of the organic HAP content, according to § 63.4141(d), for each coating identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
