A succession of sharp, short signals by whistle or horn from vessels patrolling the area under the direction of the U.S. Coast Guard Patrol Commander shall serve as a signal to stop. Vessels so signaled shall stop and shall comply with the orders of the Patrol Commander. Failure to do so may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both.
(c) The Patrol Commander may establish vessel size and speed limitations and operating conditions.
(d) The Patrol Commander may restrict vessel operation within the regatta area to vessels having particular operating characteristics.
(e) The Patrol Commander may terminate the marine event or the operation of any vessel at any time it is deemed necessary for the protection of life and property.

# Subpart A—General
§ 101.100
Purpose.
(a) The purpose of this subchapter is:
(1) To implement portions of the maritime security regime required by the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, as codified in 46 U.S.C. Chapter 701;
(2) To align, where appropriate, the requirements of domestic maritime security regulations with the international maritime security standards in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS Chapter XI-2) and the International Code for the Security of Ships and of Port Facilities, parts A and B, adopted on 12 December 2002; and
(3) To ensure security arrangements are as compatible as possible for vessels trading internationally.
(b) For those maritime elements of the national transportation system where international standards do not directly apply, the requirements in this
subchapter emphasize cooperation and coordination with local port community stakeholders, and are based on existing domestic standards, as well as established industry security practices.
(c) The assessments and plans required by this subchapter are intended for use in implementing security measures at various MARSEC Levels. The specific security measures and their implementation are planning criteria based on a set of assumptions made during the development of the security assessment and plan. These assumptions may not exist during an actual transportation security incident.

The purpose of this subpart is to implement Presidential Proclamation 7757, and Secretary of Homeland Security Order 2004-001. All powers and authorities granted to officers of the Coast Guard by this subpart may be delegated to other officers and agents of the Coast Guard unless otherwise prohibited by law.
§ 107.210
Applicability.
(a) This subpart applies to:
(1) Vessels of the United States less than 100 meters (328 feet) in length (and all associated auxiliary vessels) and the owners, agents, masters, officers, persons in charge, and members of the crew of such vessels, that depart U.S. territorial waters and thereafter enter Cuban territorial waters, regardless of whether such entry is made after an intervening entry into, passage through, or departure from any other foreign territory or territorial waters;
(2) Vessels of the United States less than 100 meters (328 feet) in length (and all associated auxiliary vessels) and the owners, agents, masters, officers, persons in charge, and members of the crew of such vessels that are located at or get underway from a berth, pier, mooring, or anchorage in U.S. territorial waters, or depart U.S. territorial waters with the intent to enter Cuban territorial waters; and
(3) Any person who knowingly fails to comply with this subpart or order given under this subpart, or knowingly obstructs or interferes with the exercise of any power conferred by this subpart.

(c) No person or vessel to which this subpart applies may obstruct or interfere with the exercise of any power conferred by this subpart.
(d) Coast Guard commissioned, warrant and petty officers may go or remain on board a vessel subject to this subpart, may place guards on the subject vessel, may remove all persons not specifically authorized by the Coast Guard to go or remain on board the subject vessel, and may take full or partial possession or control of any such vessel or part thereof, or person on board. Such actions to be taken are in the discretion of the Coast Guard Area or District Commander, or their designees, as deemed necessary to ensure compliance with this subpart and any order given pursuant thereto.
(e) Where there is a reasonable, articulable basis to believe a vessel to which this subpart applies intends to enter Cuban territorial waters, any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, or petty officer may require the owners, agents, masters, officers, or persons in charge, or any member of the crew of any such vessel to provide verbal assurance that the vessel will not enter Cuban territorial waters as a condition for a vessel to get underway from a berth, pier, mooring, or anchorage in U.S. territorial waters, or to depart from U.S. territorial waters. A Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, or petty officer may require the owners, agents, masters, officers, or persons in charge of the vessel to identify all persons on board the vessel and provide verbal assurances that all persons on board have received actual notice of these regulations. The failure of an owner, agent, master, officer, or person in charge, or any member of the crew of any vessel (including all auxiliary vessels) to which this subpart applies to provide requested verbal assurances shall not be used as the sole basis for seizing the vessel for forfeiture under this subpart.
(f) The provisions of this subpart are in addition to any powers conferred by law upon Coast Guard commissioned, warrant, or petty officers, and not in limitation of any powers conferred by law or regulation upon such officers, or any other officers of the United States.

§ 109.01
Purpose.
The purpose of the rules and regulations in this subchapter is to implement certain laws and set forth the requirements for anchorage areas.
[CGFR 67-46, 32 FR 17727, Dec. 12, 1967, as amended by CGD 79-096, 44 FR 51585, Sept. 4, 1979; USCG-1998-3799, 63 FR 35526, June 30, 1998]
§ 109.05
Anchorage grounds.
(a) Section 7 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 4, 1915 (33 U.S.C. 471), authorizes the establishment of anchorage grounds for vessels in navigable waters of the United States whenever it is apparent that these are required by the maritime or commercial interests of the United States for safe navigation. The statute also authorizes the adoption of suitable rules and regulations regarding the establishment of anchorage grounds, which are enforced by the Coast Guard. The authority conferred by this statute was transferred to and vested in the Secretary of Homeland Security by section 902(j) of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-241, 120 Stat. 516), and delegated to the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard in Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170.1. The Commandant redelegated the authority to establish anchorage grounds to each Coast Guard District Commander as provided in 33 CFR 1.05-1(e)(1)(i).
(b) District Commanders will, whenever matters relating to the anchorage of vessels are under consideration, ascertain the view of the District and Division Engineer, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, and the proper representatives of other departments likely to be interested, including the Commandant of the Naval District concerned and the medical officer in charge of the quarantine station at localities where quarantine anchorages are involved, in order that they may arrange for suitable representation at such hearings. The views of the medical officer in charge of the quarantine station relating to the proposed location and boundaries of the quarantine anchorage will be accepted insofar as practicable and consistent with the establishment of other anchorage areas. (An Act of Congress approved July 1, 1944, as amended (42 U.S.C. 267), authorizes the Surgeon General, with the approval of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to designate the boundaries of the quarantine grounds and quarantine anchorages for vessels which are reserved for use at each United States quarantine station.) A notice of public hearing concerning changes to the Anchorage Regulations will be issued by the District Commander and will be mailed to all known interested parties. After providing an opportunity for public participation, the District Commander will, if circumstances so warrant, issue changes to the Anchorage Regulations, or in appropriate cases forward recommendations for such changes to the Commandant.
(c) As soon as publication has been noted in the
Federal Register,
the District Commander will publish changes to the Anchorage Regulations in the Local Notice to Mariners.

§ 109.07
Anchorages under Ports and Waterways Safety Act.
The provisions of section 4 (a) and (b) of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act as delegated to the Commandant of the
U.S. Coast Guard in Pub. L. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135, authorize the Commandant to specify times of movement within ports and harbors, restrict vessel operations in hazardous areas and under hazardous conditions, and direct the anchoring of vessels. The sections listed in § 110.1a of this subchapter are regulated under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act.
[CGD 3-81-1A, 47 FR 4063, Jan. 28, 1982, as amended by USCG-2003-14505, 68 FR 9535, Feb. 28, 2003]
§ 109.10
Special anchorage areas.
An Act of Congress of April 22, 1940, provides for the designation of special anchorage areas wherein vessels not more than sixty-five feet in length, when at anchor, will not be required to carry or exhibit anchorage lights. Such designation is to be made after investigation, by rule, regulation, or order, the procedure for which will be similar to that followed for anchorage grounds under section 7 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 4, 1915, as referred to in § 109.05. The areas so designated should be well removed from the fairways and located where general navigation will not endanger or be endangered by unlighted vessels. The authority to designate special anchorage areas was transferred to and vested in the Secretary of Homeland Security by section 902(j) of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-241, 120 Stat 516), and delegated to the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard in Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170.1. The Commandant redelegated the authority to establish anchorage grounds to each Coast Guard District Commander as provided in 33 CFR 1.05-1(e)(1)(i).
[USCG-2007-27887, 72 FR 45902, Aug. 16, 2007]
§ 109.15
Enforcement proceedings.

General regulations.
(1) These anchorages are designated for general purposes, but are intended primarily for use by commercial vessels of 300 gross tons and greater and all tank vessels including tank barges. Except in emergencies, commercial vessels of 300 gross tons and greater and all tank vessels, including tank barges, anchoring in the Captain of the Port Long Island Sound Zone inside the line of demarcation shall anchor in the anchorage grounds described above.
(2) Prior to anchoring in the anchorage area, all vessels shall notify the Coast Guard Captain of the Port via VHF-FM Channel 16.
(3) In anchorages where lightering and bunkering operations are authorized, the Captain of the Port must be notified at least four hours in advance of a vessel conducting lightering or bunkering operations, as required by 156.118 of this title. In addition, all lightering and bunkering operations must be done in accordance with 156.120 of this title.
(4) Within an anchorage, navigation is prohibited within 500 yards of an anchored vessel that is conducting bunkering or lightering operations. In accordance with the “Regulated Navigation Area: Long Island Sound Marine Inspection and Captain of the Port Zone,” 33 CFR 165.153(d)(7), navigation also is prohibited within 100 yards of a vessel engaged in commercial service.
(5) Any vessel conducting lightering or bunkering operations shall display by day a red flag at its mast head or at least 10 feet above the upper deck if the vessel has no mast, and by night the flag must be illuminated by spotlight. These signals shall be in addition to day signals, lights, and whistle signals required by rules 30 (33 U.S.C. 2030) and 35 (33 U.S.C. 2035) of the Inland Navigation Rules when at anchor in a general anchorage area.
(6) Except as otherwise provided, a vessel may not occupy an anchorage for more than 30 days, unless the vessel obtains written permission from the Captain of the Port.
(7) If a request is made for the long-term lay up of a vessel, the Captain of the Port may establish special conditions with which the vessel must comply in order for such a request to be approved.
(8) The Captain of the Port may prescribe specific conditions for vessels anchoring within the anchorage grounds described in this section, pursuant to 33 CFR 109.05. These conditions may include, but are not limited to: The number and location of anchors; scope of chain; readiness of the engineering plant and equipment; use of tugs; and requirements for maintaining communication guards on selected radio frequencies.
(9) No vessel in such condition that it is likely to sink or otherwise become a menace or obstruction to navigation or anchorage of other vessels shall occupy
an anchorage, except in cases where unforeseen circumstances create conditions of imminent peril to personnel, and then only for such period as may be authorized by the Captain of the Port.
(10) All vessels anchored within the designated anchorage grounds shall comply with the regulations found in 33 CFR 164.19 and shall maintain a continuous bridge watch by a licensed deck officer proficient in English, monitoring VHF-FM Channel 16. This individual shall confirm that the ship's crew performs frequent checks of the vessel's position to ensure the vessel is not dragging anchor. A second VHF-FM radio monitoring Channel 13 is strongly recommended.
(11) Anchors shall be placed well within the anchorage grounds so that no portion of the hull or rigging will at any time extend outside of the anchorage area.
(12) The Coast Guard Captain of the Port may close the anchorage area and direct vessels to depart the anchorage during periods of adverse weather or at other times as deemed necessary in the interest of port safety and security.
(13) Any vessel anchored in these grounds must be capable of getting underway if ordered by the Captain of the Port and must be able to do so within two (2) hours of notification by the Captain of the Port. If a vessel will not be able to get underway within two (2) hours of notification, permission must be requested from the Captain of the Port to remain in the anchorage. No vessel shall anchor in a “dead ship” status (propulsion or control unavailable for normal operations) without prior approval of the Captain of the Port.
(14) Fixed moorings, piles or stakes are prohibited.

(11) Whenever the maritime or commercial interests of the United States so require, the Captain of the Port is hereby empowered to shift the position of any vessel anchored within the anchorage areas, of any vessel anchored outside the anchorage areas, of any vessel which is so moored or anchored as to impede or obstruct vessel movements in any channel or obstruct or interfere with range lights and of any vessel which, lying at the exterior end of a pier or alongside an open bulkhead, obstructs or endangers the passage of vessels in transit by, or to or from, adjacent wharf property or impedes the movements of vessels entering or leaving adjacent slips.
(12) A vessel upon being notified to move into the anchorage limits or to shift its position on anchorage grounds, shall get under way at once or signal for a tug, and shall change position as directed, with reasonable promptness.
(13) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving any vessel or the owner or person in charge of any vessel from the penalties of law for obstructing navigation or for obstructing or interfering with range lights, or for not complying with the navigation laws in regard to lights, fog signals, or for otherwise violating law.
(14) Any vessel prohibited by these rules from anchoring in a specific anchorage because of the vessel's length or draft may anchor in the anchorage with permission from the Captain of the Port.

General regulations.
(1) Except in cases of great emergency, no vessel shall be anchored in Delaware Bay and River between Ship John Light and The Pennsylvania Railroad Company bridge at Delair, New Jersey, outside of the anchorage areas established in this section, or within a cable or pipe line area shown on a Government chart, or be moored, anchored, or tied up to any pier, wharf, or other vessel in such manner as to obstruct or endanger the passage of any vessel. When an emergent condition exists due to congestion in the prescribed anchorage areas in the Delaware River, the Captain of the Port may authorize the anchorage of vessels in locations other than the prescribed areas. Vessels so anchored must not be anchored within the channel limits. Any vessel anchored outside of the prescribed anchorage limits must move to a prescribed anchorage area when space becomes available.
(2) No vessel shall occupy any prescribed anchorage for a longer period than 48 hours without a permit from the Captain of the Port. Vessels expecting to be at anchor for more than 48 hours shall obtain a permit from the Captain of the Port for that purpose.
No vessel in such condition that it is likely to sink or otherwise become a menace or obstruction to navigation or anchorage of other vessels shall occupy an anchorage except in an emergency, and then only for such period as may be permitted by the Captain of the Port.
(3) Whenever, in the opinion of the Captain of the Port such action may be necessary, he may require any or all vessels in any designated anchorage area to moor with two or more anchors.
(4) [Reserved]
(5) Anchors shall be placed well within the anchorage areas, so that no portion of the hull or rigging will at any time extend outside of the anchorage area.
(6) Light-draft barges using the anchorages shall be anchored away from the deeper portions of the anchorages, so as not to interfere with the anchoring of deep-draft vessels. Any barges towed in tandem to an anchorage area shall be bunched together when anchoring.
(7) Upon approval of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, the Captain of the Port may permit wrecking plant or other vessels legally engaged in recovering sunken property, or in laying or repairing pipe lines or cables, or plant engaged in dredging operations, to anchor in channels. Such permission is not necessary for plant engaged upon works of river and harbor improvement under the supervision of the District Engineer, but the District Engineer will notify the Captain of the Port in advance of all such proposed work.
(8) [Reserved]
(9) A vessel upon being notified to shift its position shall get under way at once or signal for a tug and shall change position as directed with reasonable promptness.
(10) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving any vessel or the owner or person in charge of any vessel from the penalties of law for obstructing navigation or for obstructing or interfering with range lights, or for not complying with the laws relating to lights and fog signals or other navigation laws and regulations.
(11) Annually from September 1 until December 31, additional requirements and restrictions in this paragraph for the use of anchorages defined in paragraphs (a)(7), (a)(8), and (a)(10) of this section apply.

(2) Vessels using the anchorages opposite the eastern waterfront of Charleston shall place their anchors as near as possible in the center of the anchorage. Vessels not using a designated commercial anchorage shall not place their anchors within the main ship channels, nor shall be so anchored as to swing within 400 feet of any wharf or pier on the eastern waterfront of Charleston. Vessels may be so anchored as to swing into the main ship channels only if they are so placed with reference to the customary winds, tides, and currents of the harbor, as to swing only during slack water, and that during this period there shall remain in the waters adjacent to the channel an area of sufficient depth as to permit the safe passage of loaded vessels.
(3) No vessel may anchor within the designated anchorages for more than 72 hours without the prior approval of the Captain of the Port.
(4) No vessel may anchor unless it maintains a bridge watch, guards and answers Channel 16 FM, and maintains an accurate position plot.
(5) If any anchored vessel is so close to another that a collision is probable, each vessel must communicate with the other vessel and the Captain of the Port on Channel 16 FM and shall act to eliminate the close proximity situation.
(6) No vessel may anchor unless it maintains the capability to get underway within 4 hours.
(7) No vessel may anchor in a “dead ship” status (propulsion or control unavailable for normal operations) without the prior approval of the Captain of the Port.
(8) Dragging of anchors in or across main ship channels and cable areas is prohibited.
(9) Vessels which, through force of great emergency, are anchored contrary to the foregoing regulations in
this section shall be shifted to new berths in accordance with such regulations at the earliest opportunity.
(10) A vessel, upon notification from the Captain of the Port to shift its position in anchorage grounds must get underway at once or signal for a tug, and must change position as directed with reasonable promptness.
(11) No vessel may conduct lightering operations in an anchorage without permission from the Captain of the Port.
(12) When the use of an anchorage is required by naval vessels, the vessels anchored therein shall move when the Captain of the Port directs them.
(13) Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving the owner or person in charge of any vessel from the penalties of law for obstructing navigation, or for obstructing or interfering with range lights, or for not complying with the navigation laws in regard to lights, fog signals, etc.

(i) Unless otherwise directed by the Captain of the Port Los Angeles-Long Beach, the pilot stations for the Port of Long Beach and the Port of Los Angeles will assign the use of commercial anchorages within their jurisdictions (Long Beach and Los Angeles Harbors respectively). All anchorages outside (seaward) of the federal
breakwater will be assigned by the Los Angeles-Long Beach Vessel Traffic Information Service (VTIS). The master, pilot, or person in charge of a vessel must notify the appropriate pilot station (for anchorages inside the federal breakwater) or the VTIS (for anchorages outside the federal breakwater) of their intention to anchor, upon anchoring, and at least fifteen minutes prior to departing an anchorage. All anchorage assignments will be made as described in this part unless modified by the Captain of the Port.
(ii) Radio communications for port entities governing anchorages are as follows: Los Angeles-Long Beach Vessel Traffic Information Service, call sign “LA-Long Beach Traffic,” Channel 14 VHF-FM; Los Angeles Port Pilots, Channel 73 VHF-FM; Long Beach Port Pilots, Channel 74 VHF-FM.
(iii) The exact boundary separating the Port of Long Beach from the Port of Los Angeles is published in local Port Tariffs. For purposes of this rule, Long Beach waters are those east, and Los Angeles waters are those west, of the following locations:

The radio watch must be on CH-13 VHF-FM when anchored inside the federal breakwater, and on CH-14 VHF-FM or on CH-16 VHF-FM when anchored outside the federal breakwater, except for unmanned barges; vessels which have less than 100 gallons of oil or fuel onboard regardless of how the fuel is carried; and other vessels receiving advance approval from the Captain of the Port.
(ii) When sustained wind speeds exceed 40 knots, all anchored commercial vessels greater than 1600 gross tons shall ensure their propulsion plant is placed in immediate standby and a second anchor is made ready to let go. Vessels unable to comply with this requirement must immediately notify the Captain of the Port. In such case, the Captain of the Port may require the vessel to have one or more tugs standing by to render immediate assistance.
(4)
Prohibitions.
Within Los Angeles Harbor, Long Beach Harbor, and the Los Angeles-Long Beach Precautionary Area, except for emergency reasons, or with the prior approval of the Captain of the Port, vessels are prohibited from anchoring outside of designated anchorage areas. In the event a vessel anchors outside a designated anchorage area for emergency reasons, the master, pilot, or person in charge of the vessel shall:
(i) Position the vessel so as to minimize the danger to other vessels and facilities;
(ii) Immediately notify the Captain of the Port by the most expeditious means of the vessel's location and the reason(s) for the emergency anchoring; and
(iii) Move the vessel as soon as the emergency condition prompting anchoring outside a designated area abates, or as soon as ordered to move by the Captain of the Port, whichever occurs sooner.
(5)
Exemption from rules.
The Captain of the Port may, upon request, or whenever he/she deems appropriate, authorize a deviation from any rule in this section.
