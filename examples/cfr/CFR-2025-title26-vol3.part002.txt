(iii) Third, PRS compares each partner's allocable business interest income to such partner's allocable business interest expense. No partner has allocable business interest income. Consequently, each partner's allocable business interest income deficit is equal to such partner's allocable business interest expense. Thus, A's allocable business interest income deficit is $0, B's allocable business interest income deficit is $25, and C's allocable business interest income deficit is $25. The total allocable business interest income deficit is $50 ($0 + $25 + $25). No partner has allocable business interest income excess because no partner has allocable business interest income in excess of its allocable business interest expense. Thus, the total allocable business interest income excess is $0.

(iv) Fourth, PRS determines each partner's final allocable business interest income excess. Because no partner had any allocable business interest income excess, each partner has final allocable business interest income excess of $0.
(v) Fifth, PRS determines each partner's remaining business interest expense. Because no partner has any allocable business interest income excess, each partner's remaining business interest expense equals its allocable business interest income deficit. Thus, A's remaining business interest expense is
$0, B's remaining business interest expense is $25, and C's remaining business interest expense is $25.

(vi) Sixth, PRS determines each partner's final allocable ATI. Because C's allocable ATI is comprised of $100 of items of deduction and loss and $0 of income and gain, C has negative allocable ATI of $100. C is the only partner with negative allocable ATI. Thus, the total negative allocable ATI amount is $100. Any partner with a negative allocable ATI, or an allocable ATI of $0, has a positive allocable ATI of $0. Therefore, C has a positive allocable ATI of $0. Because A's allocable ATI is comprised of $100 of items of income and gain and $0 of deduction and loss, A has positive allocable ATI of $100. Because B's allocable ATI is comprised of $100 of items of income and gain and $0 of deduction and loss, B has positive allocable ATI of $100. Thus, the total positive allocable ATI is $200 ($100 + $100 + $0). PRS determines A's final allocable ATI by reducing, but not below $0, A's positive allocable ATI ($100) by the product of total negative allocable ATI ($100) and the ratio of A's positive allocable ATI to the total positive allocable ATI ($100/$200). Therefore, A's positive allocable ATI is reduced by $50 ($100 × 50 percent). As a result, A's final allocable ATI is $50. PRS determines B's final allocable ATI by reducing, but not below $0, B's positive allocable ATI ($100) by the product of total negative allocable ATI ($100) and the ratio of B's positive allocable ATI to the total positive allocable ATI ($100/$200). Therefore, B's positive allocable ATI is reduced by $50 ($100 × 50 percent). As a result, B's final allocable ATI is $50. Because C has a positive allocable ATI of $0, C's final allocable ATI is $0.

(vii) Seventh, PRS compares each partner's ATI capacity (ATIC) amount to such partner's remaining business interest expense. A's ATIC amount is $15 ($50 × 30 percent), B's ATIC amount is $15 ($50 × 30 percent), and C's ATIC amount is $0 ($0 × 30 percent). Because A's ATIC amount exceeds its remaining business interest expense by $15 ($15−$0), A has an ATIC excess of $15. B and C do not have any ATIC excess. Thus, the total ATIC excess is $15 ($15
+ $0 + $0). A does not have any ATIC deficit. Because B's remaining business interest expense exceeds its ATIC amount by $10 ($25−$15), B has an ATIC deficit of $10. Because C's remaining business interest expense exceeds its ATIC amount by $25 ($25−$0), C has an ATIC deficit of $25. Thus, the total ATIC deficit is $35 ($0 + $10 + $25).

(viii)(A) Eighth, PRS must perform the calculations and make the necessary adjustments described under paragraph (f)(2)(viii) of this section if, and only if, PRS has—
(
1
) An excess business interest expense greater than $0 under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section;
(
2
) A total negative allocable ATI greater than $0 under paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section; and
(
3
) A total ATIC excess greater than $0 under paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section. Because PRS satisfies each of these three requirements, PRS must perform the calculations and make the necessary adjustments described under paragraphs (f)(2)(viii)(B) and (C) or (D) of this section.
(B) PRS must determine each partner's priority amount and usable priority amount. Only partners with an ATIC deficit under paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section can have a priority amount greater than $0. Thus, only partners B and C can have a priority amount greater than $0. PRS determines a partner's priority amount as 30 percent of the amount by which such partner's allocable positive ATI exceeds its final allocable ATI. Therefore, A's priority amount is $0, B's priority amount is $15 (($100−$50) × 30 percent), and C's priority amount is $0 (($0−$0) × 30 percent). Thus, the total priority amount is $15 ($0 + $15 + $0). Next, PRS must determine each partner's usable priority amount. Each partner's usable priority amount is the lesser of such partner's priority amount or ATIC deficit. Thus, A has a usable priority amount of $0, B has a usable priority amount of $10, and C has a usable priority amount of $0. As a result, the total usable priority amount is $10 ($0 + $10 + $0). Because the total ATIC excess under paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section ($15) is greater than the total usable priority amount ($10), PRS must perform the adjustments described in paragraph (f)(2)(viii)(C) of this section.

(C) For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(ix) of this section, each partner's final ATIC excess is $0. For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section, the following terms have the following meanings. Each partner's ATIC deficit is such partner's ATIC deficit as determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section reduced by such partner's usable priority amount. Thus, A's ATIC deficit is $0 ($0−$0), B's ATIC deficit is $0 ($10−$10), and C's ATIC deficit is $25 ($25−$0). The total ATIC deficit is the total ATIC deficit determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(vii) ($35) reduced by the total usable priority amount ($10). Thus, the total ATIC deficit is $25 ($35−$10). The total ATIC excess is the total ATIC excess determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section ($15) reduced by the total usable priority amount ($10). Thus, the total ATIC excess is $5 ($15−$5).

(x) Tenth, PRS determines each partner's final ATIC deficit amount. Because C has an ATIC deficit, PRS must determine C's final ATIC deficit amount. C's final ATIC deficit amount is C's ATIC deficit ($25), reduced, but not below $0, by the product of the total ATIC excess ($5) and the ratio of C's ATIC deficit to the total ATIC deficit ($25/$25). Therefore, C has $20 of final ATIC deficit ($25−($5 × 100 percent)).

(xi) Eleventh, PRS allocates deductible business interest expense and section 163(j) excess items to the partners. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, PRS has $20 of excess business interest expense. PRS allocates the excess business interest expense dollar for dollar to the partners with final ATIC deficits. Thus, PRS allocates its excess business interest expense $20 to
C. A partner's allocable business interest expense is deductible business interest expense to the extent it exceeds such partner's share of excess business interest expense. Therefore, A has deductible business interest expense of $0 ($0−$0), B has deductible business interest expense of $25 ($25−$0), and C has deductible business interest expense of $5 ($25−$20).

Example 20: Facts.
A, B, C, and D own all of the interests in partnership PRS. In Year 1, PRS has $200 of ATI, $0 of business interest income, and $140 of business interest expense. PRS's ATI consists of $600 of gross income and $400 of gross deductions. PRS allocates its items comprising ATI $100 to A, $100 to B, $400 to C, and ($400) to D. PRS allocates its business interest expense $0 to A, $40 to B, $60 to C, and $40 to D.
(i) First, PRS determines its limitation pursuant to § 1.163(j)-2. PRS's section 163(j) limit is 30 percent of its ATI plus its business interest income, or $60 ($200 × 30 percent). Thus, PRS has $60 of deductible business interest expense and $80 of excess business interest expense.
(ii) Second, PRS determines each partner's allocable share of section 163(j) items used in its own section 163(j) calculation.

(iii) Third, PRS compares each partner's allocable business interest income to such partner's allocable business interest expense. No partner has allocable business interest income. Consequently, each partner's allocable business interest income deficit is equal to such partner's allocable business interest expense. Thus, A's allocable business interest income deficit is $0, B's allocable business interest income deficit is $40, C's allocable business interest income deficit is $60, and D's allocable business interest income deficit is $40. The total allocable business interest income deficit is $140 ($0 + $40 + $60 + $40). No partner has allocable business interest income excess because no partner has allocable business interest income in excess of its allocable business interest expense. Thus, the total allocable business interest income excess is $0.

(iv) Fourth, PRS determines each partner's final allocable business interest income excess. Because no partner has any allocable business interest income excess, each partner has final allocable business interest income excess of $0.
(v) Fifth, PRS determines each partner's remaining business interest expense. Because no partner has any allocable business interest income excess, each partner's remaining business interest expense equals its allocable business interest income deficit. Thus, A's remaining business interest expense is $0, B's remaining business interest expense is $40, C's remaining business interest expense is $60, and D's remaining business interest expense is $40.

(vi) Sixth, PRS determines each partner's final allocable ATI. Because D's allocable ATI is comprised of $400 of items of deduction and loss and $0 of income and gain, D has negative allocable ATI of $400. D is the only partner with negative allocable ATI. Thus, the total negative allocable ATI amount is $400. Any partner with a negative allocable ATI, or an allocable ATI of $0, has a positive allocable ATI of $0. Therefore, D has a positive allocable ATI of $0. PRS determines A's final allocable ATI by reducing, but not below $0, A's positive allocable ATI ($100) by the product of total negative allocable ATI ($400) and the ratio of A's positive allocable ATI to the total positive allocable ATI ($100/$600). Therefore, A's positive allocable ATI is reduced by $66.67 ($400 × 16.67 percent). As a result, A's final allocable ATI is $33.33. PRS determines B's final allocable ATI by reducing, but not below $0, B's positive allocable ATI ($100) by the product of total negative allocable ATI ($400) and the ratio of B's positive allocable ATI to the total positive allocable ATI ($100/$600). Therefore, B's positive allocable ATI is reduced by $66.67 ($400 × 16.67 percent). As a result, B's final allocable ATI is $33.33. PRS determines C's final allocable ATI by reducing, but not below $0, C's positive allocable ATI ($400) by the product of total negative allocable ATI ($400) and the ratio of C's positive allocable ATI to the total positive allocable ATI ($400/$600). Therefore, C's positive allocable ATI is reduced by $266.67 ($400 × 66.67 percent). As a result, C's final allocable ATI is $133.33. Because D has a positive allocable ATI of $0, D's final allocable ATI is $0.

(vii) Seventh, PRS compares each partner's ATI capacity (ATIC) amount to such partner's remaining business interest expense. A's ATIC amount is $10 ($33.33 × 30 percent), B's ATIC amount is $10 ($33.33 × 30 percent), C's ATIC amount is $40 ($133.33 × 30 percent), and D's ATIC amount is $0 ($0 × 30 percent). Because A's ATIC amount exceeds its remaining business interest expense by $10 ($10−$0), A has an ATIC excess of $10. B, C, and D do not have any ATIC excess. Thus, the total ATIC excess is $10 ($10 + $0 + $0 + $0). A does not have any ATIC deficit. Because B's remaining business interest expense exceeds its ATIC amount by $30 ($40−$10), B has an ATIC deficit of $30. Because C's remaining business interest expense exceeds its ATIC amount by $20 ($60−$40), C has an ATIC deficit of $20. Because D's remaining business interest expense exceeds its ATIC amount by $40 ($40−$0), D has an ATIC deficit of $40. Thus, the total ATIC deficit is $90 ($0 + $30 + $20 + $40).

(viii)(A) Eighth, PRS must perform the calculations and make the necessary adjustments described under paragraph (f)(2)(viii) of this section if, and only if, PRS has (1) an excess business interest expense greater than $0 under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, (2) a total negative allocable ATI greater than $0 under paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section, and (3) a total ATIC excess amount greater than $0 under paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section. Because PRS satisfies each of these three requirements, PRS must perform the calculations and make the necessary adjustments described under paragraphs (f)(2)(viii)(B) and (C) or paragraph (f)(2)(viii)(D) of this section.
(B) PRS must determine each partner's priority amount and usable priority amount. Only partners with an ATIC deficit under paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section can have a priority amount greater than $0. Thus, only partners B, C, and D can have a priority amount greater than $0. PRS determines a partner's priority amount as 30 percent of the amount by which such partner's allocable positive ATI exceeds its final allocable ATI. Therefore, B's priority amount is $20 (($100−$33.33) × 30 percent), C's priority amount is $80 (($400−$133.33) × 30 percent), and D's priority amount is $0 (($0−$0) × 30 percent). Thus, the total priority amount is $100 ($0 + $20 + $80 + $0). Next, PRS must determine each partner's usable priority amount. Each partner's usable priority amount is the lesser of such partner's priority amount or ATIC deficit. Thus, A has a usable priority amount of $0, B has a usable priority amount of $20, C has a usable priority amount of $20, and D has a usable priority amount of $0. As a result, the total usable priority amount is $40 ($0 + $20 + $20 + $0). Because the total usable priority amount ($40) is greater than the total ATIC excess under paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this
section ($10), PRS must perform the adjustments described in paragraph (f)(2)(viii)(D) of this section.

(D)(
1
) Because B and C are the only partners with priority amounts greater than $0, B and C are priority partners, while A and D are non-priority partners. For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(ix) of this section, each partner's final ATIC excess amount is $0. For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section, each non-priority partner's final ATIC deficit amount is such partner's ATIC deficit determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section. Therefore, A has a final ATIC deficit of $0 and D has a final ATIC deficit of $40. Additionally, for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section, PRS must determine each priority partner's step eight excess share. A priority partner's step eight excess share is the product of the total ATIC excess and the ratio of the partner's priority amount to the total priority amount. Thus, B's step eight excess share is $2 ($10 × ($20/$100)) and C's step eight excess share is $8 ($10 × ($80/$100)). To the extent a priority partner's step eight excess share exceeds its ATIC deficit, the excess will be the partner's ATIC excess for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section. Thus, B and C each have an ATIC excess of $0, resulting in a total ATIC excess is $0. To the extent a priority partner's ATIC deficit exceeds its step eight excess share, the excess will be the partner's ATIC deficit for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section. Because B's ATIC deficit ($30) exceeds its step eight excess share ($2), B's ATIC deficit for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section is $28 ($30−$2). Because C's ATIC deficit ($20) exceeds its step eight excess share ($8), C's ATIC deficit for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section is $12 ($20−$8). Thus, the total ATIC deficit is $40 ($28 + $12).

(ix) Ninth, PRS determines each partner's final ATIC excess amount. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(viii)(D) of this section, each priority and non-priority partner's final ATIC excess amount is $0.
(x) Tenth, PRS determines each partner's final ATIC deficit amount. Because B has an ATIC deficit, PRS must determine B's final ATIC deficit amount. B's final ATIC deficit amount is B's ATIC deficit ($28), reduced, but not below $0, by the product of the total ATIC excess ($0) and the ratio of B's ATIC deficit to the total ATIC deficit ($28/$40). Therefore, B has $28 of final ATIC deficit ($28−($0 × 70 percent)). Because C has an ATIC deficit, PRS must determine C's final ATIC deficit amount. C's final ATIC deficit amount is C's ATIC deficit ($12), reduced, but not below $0, by the product of the total ATIC excess ($0) and the ratio of C's ATIC deficit to the total ATIC deficit ($12/$40). Therefore, C has $12 of final ATIC deficit ($12−($0 × 30 percent)). Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(viii)(D) of this section, D's final ATIC deficit amount is $40.

(xi) Eleventh, PRS allocates deductible business interest expense and section 163(j) excess items to the partners. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, PRS has $80 of excess business interest expense. PRS allocates the excess business interest expense dollar for dollar to the partners with final ATIC deficits. Thus, PRS allocates its excess business interest expense $28 to B, $12 to C, and $40 to D. A partner's allocable business interest expense is deductible business interest expense to the extent it exceeds such partner's share of excess business interest expense. Therefore, A has deductible
business interest expense of $0 ($0−$0), B has deductible business interest expense of $12 ($40−$28), C has deductible business interest expense of $48 ($60−$12), and D has deductible business interest expense of $0 ($40−$40).

Example 21: Facts.
A, B, C, and D own all of the interests in partnership PRS. In Year 1, PRS has $200 of ATI, $0 of business interest income, and $150 of business interest expense. PRS's ATI consists of $500 of gross income and $300 of gross deductions. PRS allocates its items comprising ATI $50 to A, $50 to B, $400 to C, and ($300) to D. PRS allocates its business interest expense $0 to A, $50 to B, $50 to C, and $50 to D.
(i) First, PRS determines its limitation pursuant to § 1.163(j)-2. PRS's section 163(j) limit is 30 percent of its ATI plus its business interest income, or $60 ($200 × 30 percent). Thus, PRS has $60 of deductible business interest expense, and $90 of excess business interest expense.
(ii) Second, PRS determines each partner's allocable share of section 163(j) items used in its own section 163(j) calculation.

(iii) Third, PRS compares each partner's allocable business interest income to such partner's allocable business interest expense. No partner has allocable business interest income. Consequently, each partner's allocable business interest income deficit is equal to such partner's allocable business interest expense. Thus, A's allocable business interest income deficit is $0, B's allocable business interest income deficit is $50, C's allocable business interest income deficit is $50, and D's allocable business interest income deficit is $50. The total allocable business interest income deficit is $150 ($0 + $50 + $50 + $50). No partner has allocable business interest income excess because no partner has allocable business interest income in excess of its allocable business interest expense. Thus, the total allocable business interest income excess is $0.

(iv) Fourth, PRS determines each partner's final allocable business interest income excess. Because no partner
has any allocable business interest income excess, each partner has final allocable business interest income excess of $0.
(v) Fifth, PRS determines each partner's remaining business interest expense. Because no partner has any allocable business interest income excess, each partner's remaining business interest expense equals its allocable business interest income deficit. Thus, A's remaining business interest expense is $0, B's remaining business interest expense is $50, C's remaining business interest expense is $50, and D's remaining business interest expense is $50.

(vi) Sixth, PRS determines each partner's final allocable ATI. Because D's allocable ATI is comprised of $300 of items of deduction and loss and $0 of income and gain, D has negative allocable ATI of $300. D is the only partner with negative allocable ATI. Thus, the total negative allocable ATI amount is $300. Any partner with a negative allocable ATI, or an allocable ATI of $0, has a positive allocable ATI of $0. Therefore, D has a positive allocable ATI of $0. PRS determines A's final allocable ATI by reducing, but not below $0, A's positive allocable ATI ($50) by the product of total negative allocable ATI ($300) and the ratio of A's positive allocable ATI to the total positive allocable ATI ($50/$500). Therefore, A's positive allocable ATI is reduced by $30 ($300 × 10 percent). As a result, A's final allocable ATI is $20. PRS determines B's final allocable ATI by reducing, but not below $0, B's positive allocable ATI ($50) by the product of total negative allocable ATI ($300) and the ratio of B's positive allocable ATI to the total positive allocable ATI ($50/$500). Therefore, B's positive allocable ATI is reduced by $30 ($300 × 10 percent). As a result, B's final allocable ATI is $20. PRS determines C's final allocable ATI by reducing, but not below $0, C's positive allocable ATI ($400) by the product of total negative allocable ATI ($300) and the ratio of C's positive allocable ATI to the total positive allocable ATI ($400/$500). Therefore, C's positive allocable ATI is reduced by $240 ($300 × 80 percent). As a result, C's final allocable ATI is $160. Because D has a positive allocable ATI of $0, D's final allocable ATI is $0.

(vii) Seventh, PRS compares each partner's ATI capacity (ATIC) amount to such partner's remaining business interest expense. A's ATIC amount is $6 ($20 × 30 percent), B's ATIC amount is $6 ($20 × 30 percent), C's ATIC amount is $48 ($160 × 30 percent), and D's ATIC amount is $0 ($0 × 30 percent). Because A's ATIC amount exceeds its remaining business interest expense by $6 ($6−$0), A has an ATIC excess of $6. B, C, and D do not have any ATIC excess. Thus, the total ATIC excess amount is $6 ($6 + $0 + $0 + $0). A does not have any ATIC deficit. Because B's remaining business interest expense exceeds its ATIC amount by $44 ($50−$6), B has an ATIC deficit of $44. Because C's remaining business interest expense exceeds its ATIC amount by $2 ($50−$48), C has an ATIC deficit of $2. Because D's remaining business interest expense exceeds its ATIC amount by $50 ($50−$0), D has an ATIC deficit of $50. Thus, the total ATIC deficit is $96 ($0 + $44 + $2 + $50).

(viii)(A) Eighth, PRS must perform the calculations and make the necessary adjustments described under paragraph (f)(2)(viii) of this section if, and only if, PRS has—
(
1
) An excess business interest expense greater than $0 under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section;
(
2
) A total negative allocable ATI greater than $0 under paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section; and
(
3
) A total ATIC excess amount greater than $0 under paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section. Because PRS satisfies each of these three requirements, PRS must perform the calculations and make the necessary adjustments described under paragraph (f)(2)(viii) of this section.
(B) PRS must determine each partner's priority amount and usable priority amount. Only partners with an ATIC deficit under paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section of this section can have a priority amount greater than $0. Thus, only partners B, C, and D can have a priority amount greater than $0. PRS determines a partner's priority amount as 30 percent of the amount by which such partner's allocable positive ATI exceeds its final allocable ATI. Therefore, B's priority amount is $9 (($50−$20) × 30 percent), C's priority amount is $72 (($400−$160) × 30 percent), and D's priority amount is $0 (($0−$0) × 30 percent). Thus, the total priority amount is $81 ($0 + $9 + $72 + $0). Next, PRS must determine each partner's usable priority amount. Each partner's usable priority amount is the lesser of such partner's priority amount or ATIC deficit. Thus, B has a usable priority amount of $9, C has a usable priority amount of $2, and D has a usable priority amount of $0. As a result, the total usable priority amount is $11 ($0 + $9 + $2 + $0). Because the total usable priority amount ($11) is greater than the total ATIC excess ($6) under paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section, PRS
must perform the adjustments described in paragraph (f)(2)(viii)(D) of this section.

(C) In light of the fact that the total usable priority amount is greater than the total ATIC excess under paragraph (f)(2)(viii)(B) of this section, paragraph (f)(2)(viii)(C) of this section does not apply.
(D)(
1
) Because B and C are the only partners with priority amounts greater than $0, B and C are priority partners, while A and D are non-priority partners. For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(ix) of this section, each partner's final ATIC excess amount is $0. For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section, each non-priority partner's final ATIC deficit amount is such partner's ATIC deficit determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of this section. Therefore, A has a final ATIC deficit of $0 and D has a final ATIC deficit of $50. Additionally, for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section, PRS must determine each priority partner's step eight excess share. A priority partner's step eight excess share is the product of the total ATIC excess and the ratio of the partner's priority amount to the total priority amount. Thus, B's step eight excess share is $0.67 ($6 × ($9/$81)) and C's step eight excess share is $5.33 ($6 × ($72/$81)). To the extent a priority partner's step eight excess share exceeds its ATIC deficit, the excess will be the partner's ATIC excess for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section. B's step eight excess share does not exceed its ATIC deficit. Because C's step eight excess share ($5.33) exceeds its ATIC deficit ($2), C's ATIC excess for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section is $3.33 ($5.33−$2). Thus, the total ATIC excess for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section is $3.33 ($0 + $3.33). To the extent a priority partner's ATIC deficit exceeds its step eight excess share, the excess will be the partner's ATIC deficit for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section. Because B's ATIC deficit ($44) exceeds its step eight excess share ($0.67), B's ATIC deficit for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section is $43.33 ($44−$0.67). C's ATIC deficit does not exceed its step eight excess share. Thus, the total ATIC deficit for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(x) of this section is $43.33 ($43.33 + $0).

(ix) Ninth, PRS determines each partner's final ATIC excess amount. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(viii)(D) of this section, each priority and non-priority partner's final ATIC excess amount is $0.
(x) Tenth, PRS determines each partner's final ATIC deficit amount. Because B has an ATIC deficit, PRS must determine B's final ATIC deficit amount. B's final ATIC deficit amount is B's ATIC deficit ($43.33), reduced, but not below $0, by the product of the total ATIC excess ($3.33) and the ratio of B's ATIC deficit to the total ATIC deficit ($43.33/$43.33). Therefore, B has $40 of final ATIC deficit ($43.33−($3.33 × 100 percent)). Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(viii)(D) of this section, D's final ATIC deficit amount is $40.

(xi) Eleventh, PRS allocates deductible business interest expense and section 163(j) excess items to the partners. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, PRS has $90 of excess business interest expense. PRS allocates the excess business interest expense dollar for dollar to the partners with final ATIC deficits. Thus, PRS allocates its excess business interest expense $40 to B and $50 to D. A partner's allocable business interest expense is deductible business interest expense to the extent it exceeds such partner's share of excess business interest expense. Therefore, A has deductible business interest expense of $0 ($0−$0), B has deductible business interest expense of $10 ($50−$40), C has deductible business interest expense of $50 ($50−$0), and D has deductible business interest expense of $0 ($50−$50).

Example 22
—(i)
Facts.
A and B are equal shareholders in X, a subchapter S corporation. In Year 1, X has $100 of ATI and $40 of business interest expense. A has $100 of ATI and $20 of business interest expense from its sole proprietorship. B has $0 of ATI and $20 of business interest expense from its sole proprietorship.
(ii)
S corporation-level.
In Year 1, X's section 163(j) limit is 30 percent of its ATI, or $30 ($100 × 30 percent). Thus, X has $30 of deductible business interest expense and $10 of disallowed business interest expense. Such $30 of deductible business interest expense is includable in X's nonseparately stated income or loss, and is not subject to further limitation under section 163(j). X carries forward the $10 of disallowed business interest expense to Year 2 as a disallowed business interest expense carryforward under § 1.163(j)-2(c). X may not currently deduct all $40 of its business interest expense in Year 1. X only reduces its accumulated adjustments account in Year 1 by the $30 of deductible business interest expense in Year 1 under § 1.163(j)-6(l)(7).
(iii)
Shareholder allocations.
A and B are each allocated $35 of nonseparately stated taxable income ($50 items of income or gain, less $15 of deductible business interest expense) from X. A and B do not reduce their basis in X by the $10 of disallowed business interest expense.
(iv)
Shareholder-level computations.
A, in computing its limit under section 163(j), has $100 of ATI and $20 of business interest expense from its sole proprietorship. A's section 163(j) limit is $30 ($100 × 30 percent). Thus, A's $20 of business interest expense is deductible business interest expense. B, in computing its limit under section 163(j), has $20 of business interest expense from its sole proprietorship. B's section 163(j) limit is $0 ($0 × 30 percent). Thus, B's $20 of business interest expense is not allowed as a deduction and is treated as business interest expense paid or accrued by B in Year 2.
(23)
Example 23
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 22
in paragraph (o)(22)(i) of this section. In Year 2, X has $233.33 of ATI, $0 of business interest income, and $30 of business interest expense. A has $100 of ATI and $20 of business interest expense from its sole proprietorship. B has $0 of ATI and $20 of business interest expense from its sole proprietorship.
(ii)
S corporation-level.
In Year 2, X's section 163(j) limit is 30 percent of its ATI plus its business interest income, or $70 ($233.33 × 30 percent). Because X's section 163(j) limit exceeds X's $40 of business interest expense ($30 from Year 2, plus the $10 disallowed business interest expense carryforwards from Year 1), X may deduct all $40 of business interest expense in Year 2. Such $40 of deductible business interest expense is includable in X's nonseparately stated income or loss, and is not subject to further limitation under section 163(j). Pursuant to § 1.163(j)-6(l)(7), X must reduce its accumulated adjustments account by $40. Additionally, X has $100 of excess taxable income under § 1.163(j)-1(b)(17).
(iii)
Shareholder allocations.
A and B are each allocated $96.67 of nonseparately stated taxable income ($116.67 items of income or gain, less $20 of deductible business interest expense) from X. Additionally, A and B are each allocated $50 of excess taxable income under § 1.163(j)-6(l)(4). As a result, A and B each increase their ATI by $50.
(iv)
Shareholder-level computations.
A, in computing its limit under section 163(j), has $150 of ATI ($100 from its sole proprietorship, plus $50 excess taxable income) and $20 of business interest expense (from its sole proprietorship). A's section 163(j) limit is $45 ($150 × 30 percent). Thus, A's $20 of business interest expense is deductible business interest
expense. B, in computing its limit under section 163(j), has $50 of ATI ($0 from its sole proprietorship, plus $50 excess taxable income) and $40 of business interest expense ($20 from its sole proprietorship, plus $20 disallowed business interest expense from its sole proprietorship in Year 1). B's section 163(j) limit is $15 ($50 × 30 percent). Thus, $15 of B's business interest expense is deductible business interest expense. The $25 of B's business interest expense not allowed as a deduction ($40 business interest expense, less $15 section 163(j) limit) is treated as business interest expense paid or accrued by B in Year 3.
(24)
Example 24
—(i)
Facts.
On January 1, 2020, L and M form LM, a publicly traded partnership (as defined in § 1.7704-1), and agree that each will be allocated a 50 percent share of all LM items. The partnership agreement provides that LM will make allocations under section 704(c) using the remedial allocation method under § 1.704-3(d). L contributes depreciable property with an adjusted tax basis of $4,000 and a fair market value of $10,000. The property is depreciated using the straight-line method with a 10-year recovery period and has 4 years remaining on its recovery period. M contributes $10,000 in cash, which LM uses to purchase land. Except for the depreciation deductions, LM's expenses equal its income in each year of the 10 years commencing with the year LM is formed. LM has a valid section 754 election in effect.
(ii)
Section 163(j) remedial items and partner basis items.
LM sells the asset contributed by L in a fully taxable transaction at a time when the adjusted basis of the property is $4,000. Under § 1.163(j)-6(e)(2)(ii), solely for purposes of § 1.163(j)-6, the tax gain of $6,000 is allocated equally between L and M ($3,000 each). To avoid shifting built-in gain to the non-contributing partner (M) in a manner consistent with the rule in section 704(c), a remedial deduction of $3,000 is allocated to M (leaving M with no net tax gain), and remedial income of $3,000 is allocated to L (leaving L with total tax gain of $6,000).
(25)
Example 25
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 24
in paragraph (o)(24) of this section except the property contributed by L had an adjusted tax basis of zero. For each of the 10 years following the contribution, there would be $500 of section 704(c) remedial income allocated to L and $500 of remedial deductions allocated to M with respect to the contributed asset. A buyer of M's units would step into M's shoes with respect to the $500 of annual remedial deductions. A buyer of L's units would step into L's shoes with respect to the $500 of annual remedial income and would have an annual section 743(b) deduction of $1,000 (net $500 of deductions).
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to § 1.163(j)-6(d)(2)(ii), solely for purposes of § 1.163(j)-6, a buyer of L's units immediately after formation of LM would offset its $500 annual section 704(c) remedial income allocation with $500 of annual section 743(b) adjustment (leaving the buyer with net $500 of section 743(b) deduction). As a result, such buyer would be in the same position as a buyer of M's units. Each buyer would have net deductions of $500 per year, which would not affect ATI before 2022.

Example 26
—(i)
Facts.
X and Y are partners in partnership PRS. In Year 1, PRS had $200 of excess business interest expense. Pursuant to § 1.163(j)-6(f)(2), PRS allocated $100 of such excess business interest expense to each of its partners. In Year 2, X lends $10,000 to PRS and receives $1,000 of interest income for the taxable year (self-charged lending transaction). X is not in the trade or business of lending money. The $1,000 of interest expense resulting from this loan is allocable to PRS's trade or business assets. As a result, such $1,000 of interest expense is business interest expense of PRS. X and Y are each allocated $500 of such business interest expense as their distributive share of PRS's business interest expense for the taxable year. Additionally, in Year 2, PRS has $3,000 of ATI. PRS allocates the items comprising its $3,000 of ATI $0 to X and $3,000 to Y.
(ii)
Partnership-level.
In Year 2, PRS's section 163(j) limit is 30 percent of its ATI plus its business interest income, or $900 ($3,000 × 30 percent). Thus, PRS has $900 of deductible business interest expense, $100 of excess business interest
expense, $0 of excess taxable income, and $0 of excess business interest income. Pursuant to § 1.163(j)-6(f)(2), $400 of X's allocation of business interest expense is treated as deductible business interest expense, $100 of X's allocation of business interest expense is treated as excess business interest expense, and $500 of Y's allocation of business interest expense is treated as deductible business interest expense.
(iii)
Lending partner.
Pursuant to § 1.163(j)-6(n), X treats $100 of its $1,000 of interest income as excess business interest income allocated from PRS in Year 2. Because X is deemed to have been allocated $100 of excess business interest income from PRS, and excess business interest expense from a partnership is treated as paid or accrued by a partner to the extent excess business interest income is allocated from such partnership to a partner, X treats its $100 allocation of excess business interest expense from PRS in Year 2 as business interest expense paid or accrued in Year 2. X, in computing its limit under section 163(j), has $100 of business interest income ($100 deemed allocation of excess business interest income from PRS in Year 2) and $100 of business interest expense ($100 allocation of excess business interest expense treated as paid or accrued in Year 2). Thus, X's $100 of business interest expense is deductible business interest expense. At the end of Year 2, X has $100 of excess business interest expense from PRS ($100 from Year 1). X treats $900 of its $1,000 of interest income as investment income for purposes of section 163(d).
(27)-(33) [Reserved]

Example 34
—(i)
Facts.
X and Y are equal partners in partnership PRS. Further, X and Y share the profits of PRS equally. In 2019, PRS had ATI of $100. Additionally, in 2019, PRS had $100 of section 704(b) income which was allocated $50 to X and $50 to Y (PRS did not have any section 704(c) income in 2019). In 2020, PRS's only items of income, gain, loss or deduction was $1 of trade or business income, which it allocated to X pursuant to section 704(c).
(ii)
Partnership-level.
In 2020, PRS makes the election described in § 1.163(j)-6(d)(5) to use its 2019 ATI in 2020. As a result, PRS has $100 of ATI in 2020. PRS does not have any business interest expense. Therefore, PRS has $100 of excess taxable income in 2020.
(iii)
Partner-level allocations.
PRS allocates its $100 of excess taxable income to X and Y pursuant to § 1.163(j)-6(f)(2). To determine each partner's share of the $100 of excess taxable income, PRS must determine each partner's allocable ATI (as defined in § 1.163(j)-6(f)(2)(ii)). Because PRS made the election described in § 1.163(j)-6(d)(5), PRS must determine the allocable ATI of each of its partners pursuant to paragraph (d)(5). Specifically, PRS determines each partner's share of allocable ATI based on PRS's 2019 section 704 income, gain, loss, and deduction. PRS had $100 of section 704(b) income in 2019 which was allocated $50 to X and $50 to Y. Therefore, in 2020, X and Y are both allocated $50 of excess taxable income (50% × $100).
(35)
Example 35
—(i)
Facts.
X, a partner in partnership PRS, was allocated $20 of excess business interest expense from PRS in 2018 and $10 of excess business interest expense from PRS in 2019. In 2020, PRS allocated $16 of excess taxable income to X.
(ii)
Analysis.
X treats 50 percent of its $10 of excess business interest expense allocated from PRS in 2019 as § 1.163(j)-6(g)(4) business interest expense. Thus, $5 of § 1.163(j)-6(g)(4) business interest expense is treated as paid or accrued by X in 2020 and is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation at X's level. Because X was allocated $16 of excess taxable income from PRS in 2020, X treats $16 of its $25 of excess business interest expense as business interest expense paid or accrued pursuant to § 1.163(j)-6(g)(2). X, in computing its limit under section 163(j) in 2020, has $16 of ATI (as a result of its allocation of $16 of excess taxable income from PRS), $0 of business interest income, and $16 of business interest expense ($16 of excess business interest expense treated as paid or accrued in 2020). Pursuant to § 1.163(j)-2(b)(2)(i), X's section 163(j) limit in 2020 is $8 ($16 × 50 percent). Thus, X has $8 of business interest expense that is deductible under section 163(j). The $8 of X's business interest expense not allowed as a deduction ($16 business interest expense subject to section 163(j), less $8 section 163(j) limit) is treated as business interest
expense paid or accrued by X in 2021. At the end of 2020, X has $9 of excess business interest expense from PRS ($20 from 2018, plus $10 from 2019, less $5 treated as paid or accrued pursuant to § 1.163(j)-6(g)(4), less $16 treated as paid or accrued pursuant to § 1.163(j)-6(g)(2)).
(36)
Example 36
—(i)
Facts.
X is a partner in partnership PRS. At the beginning of 2018, X's outside basis in PRS was $100. X was allocated $20 of excess business interest expense from PRS in 2018 and $10 of excess business interest expense from PRS in 2019. X sold its PRS interest in 2019 for $70.
(ii)
Analysis.
X treats 50 percent of its $10 of excess business interest expense allocated from PRS in 2019 as § 1.163(j)-6(g)(4) business interest expense. Thus, $5 of § 1.163(j)-6(g)(4) business interest expense is treated as paid or accrued by X in 2020 and is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation at X's level. Pursuant to paragraph (h)(3) of this section, immediately before the disposition, X increases the basis of its PRS interest from $70 to $95 (add back of $20 of EBIE from 2018 and $5 of remaining EBIE from 2019). Thus, X has a $25 section 741 loss recognized on the sale ($70−$95).

Paragraph (l) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of this section.
(b)
General rule regarding the application of section 163(j) to relevant foreign corporations.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, section 163(j) and the section 163(j) regulations apply to determine the deductibility of a relevant foreign corporation's business interest expense for purposes of computing its taxable income for U.S. income tax purposes (if any) in the same manner as those provisions apply to determine the deductibility of a domestic C corporation's business interest expense for purposes of computing its taxable income. See also § 1.952-2. If a relevant foreign corporation is a direct or indirect partner in a partnership, see § 1.163(j)-6 (concerning the application of section 163(j) to partnerships).
(c)
Application of section 163(j) to CFC group members of a CFC group
—(1)
Scope.
This paragraph (c) provides rules for applying section 163(j) to a CFC group and a CFC group member. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides rules for computing a single section 163(j) limitation for a specified period of a CFC group. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides rules for allocating a CFC group's section 163(j) limitation to CFC group members for specified taxable years. Paragraph (c)(4) of this section provides currency translation rules. Paragraph (c)(5) of this section provides special rules for specified periods beginning in 2019 or 2020.
(2)
Calculation of section 163(j) limitation for a CFC group for a specified period
—(i)
In general.
A single section 163(j) limitation is computed for a specified period of a CFC group. For purposes of applying section 163(j) and the section 163(j) regulations, the current-year business interest expense, disallowed business interest expense carryforwards, business interest income, floor plan financing interest expense, and ATI of a CFC group for a specified period equal the sums of each CFC group member's respective amounts for its specified taxable year with respect to the specified period. A CFC group member's current-year business interest expense, business interest income, floor plan financing interest expense, and ATI for a specified taxable year are generally determined on a separate-company basis. For purposes of determining the ATI of a CFC group, § 1.163(j)-1(b)(1)(vii) (providing that ATI cannot be less than zero) applies with respect to the ATI of the CFC group but not the ATI of any CFC group member.
(ii)
Certain transactions between CFC group members disregarded.
Any transaction between CFC group members of a CFC group that is entered into with a principal purpose of affecting a CFC group or a CFC group member's section 163(j) limitation by increasing or decreasing a CFC group or a CFC group member's ATI or business interest income for a specified taxable year is disregarded for purposes of applying section 163(j) and the section 163(j) regulations.
(3)
Deduction of business interest expense
—(i)
CFC group business interest expense
—(A)
In general.
The extent to which a CFC group member's current-year business interest expense and disallowed business interest expense carryforwards for a specified taxable year that ends with or within a specified period may be deducted under section 163(j) is determined under the rules and principles of § 1.163(j)-5(a)(2) and (b)(3)(ii), subject to the modifications described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
(B)
Modifications to relevant terms.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the rules and principles of § 1.163(j)-5(b)(3)(ii) are applied by—
(
1
) Replacing “§ 1.163(j)-4(d)(2)” in § 1.163(j)-5(a)(2)(ii) with “§ 1.163(j)-7(c)(2)(i)”;
(
2
) Replacing the term “allocable share of the consolidated group's remaining section 163(j) limitation” with “allocable share of the CFC group's remaining section 163(j) limitation”;
(
3
) Replacing the terms “consolidated group” and “group” with “CFC group”;
(
4
) Replacing the term “consolidated group's remaining section 163(j) limitation” with “CFC group's remaining section 163(j) limitation”;
(
5
) Replacing the term “consolidated return year” with “specified period”;
(
6
) Replacing the term “current year” or “current-year” with “current specified period” or “specified taxable year with respect to the current specified period,” as the context requires;
(
7
) Replacing the term “member” with “CFC group member”; and
(
8
) Replacing the term “taxable year” with “specified taxable year with respect to a specified period.”
(ii)
Carryforwards treated as attributable to the same taxable year.
For purposes of applying the principles of § 1.163(j)-5(b)(3)(ii), as required under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, CFC group members' disallowed business interest expense carryforwards that arose in specified taxable years with respect to the same specified period are treated as disallowed business interest expense carryforwards from taxable years ending on the same date and are deducted on a pro rata basis, under the principles of § 1.163(j)-5(b)(3)(ii)(C)(
3
), pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
(iii)
Multiple specified taxable years of a CFC group member with respect to a specified period.
If a CFC group member has more than one specified taxable year (each year, an
applicable specified taxable year
) with respect to a single specified period of a CFC group, then all the applicable specified taxable years are taken into account for purposes of applying the principles of § 1.163(j)-5(b)(3)(ii), as required under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, with respect to the specified period. The portion of the section 163(j) limitation allocable to disallowed business interest expense carryforwards of the CFC group member that arose in taxable years before the first applicable specified taxable year is prorated among the applicable specified taxable years in proportion to the number of days in each applicable specified taxable year.
(iv)
Limitation on pre-group disallowed business interest expense carryforward
—(A)
General rule
—(
1
)
CFC group member pre-group disallowed business interest expense carryforward.
This paragraph (c)(3)(iv) applies to pre-group disallowed business interest expense carryforwards of a CFC group member. The amount of the pre-group disallowed business interest expense carryforwards described in the preceding sentence that may be included in any CFC group member's business interest expense deduction for any specified taxable year under this paragraph (c)(3) may not exceed the aggregate section 163(j) limitation for all specified periods of the CFC group, determined by reference only to the CFC group member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss, and reduced (including below zero) by the CFC group member's business interest expense (including disallowed business interest expense carryforwards) taken into account as a deduction by the CFC group member in all specified taxable years in which the CFC group member has continuously been a CFC group member of the CFC group (
cumulative section 163(j) pre-group carryforward limitation
).
(
2
)
Subgrouping.
In the case of a pre-group disallowed business interest expense carryforward, a pre-group subgroup is composed of the CFC group member with the pre-group disallowed business interest expense carryforward (the
loss member
) and each other CFC group member of the loss member's CFC group (the
current group
) that was a member of the CFC group in which the pre-group disallowed business interest expense carryforward arose and joined the specified group of the current group at the same time as the loss member. A CFC group member that is a member of a pre-group subgroup remains a member of the pre-group subgroup until its first taxable year during which it ceases to be a member of the same specified group as the loss member. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the rules and principles of § 1.163(j)-5(d)(1)(B) apply to a pre-group subgroup as if the pre-group subgroup were a SRLY subgroup.
(
3
)
Transition rule.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(A)(
2
) of this section, a CFC group includes a group of applicable CFCs for which a CFC group election was made under guidance
under section 163(j) published on December 28, 2018. Therefore, if the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(A)(
2
) of this section are satisfied, a group of applicable CFCs described in the preceding sentence may be treated as a pre-group subgroup.
(B)
Deduction of pre-group disallowed business interest expense carryforwards.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section, pre-group disallowed business interest expense carryforwards are available for deduction by a CFC group member in its specified taxable year only to the extent the CFC group has remaining section 163(j) limitation for the specified period after the deduction of current-year business interest expense and disallowed business interest expense carryforwards from earlier taxable years that are permitted to be deducted in specified taxable years of CFC group members with respect to the specified period. See paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section and § 1.163(j)-5(b)(3)(ii)(A). Pre-group disallowed business interest expense carryforwards are deducted on a pro rata basis (under the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section and § 1.163(j)-5(b)(3)(ii)(C)(
4
)) with other disallowed business interest expense carryforwards from taxable years ending on the same date.
(4)
Currency translation.
For purposes of applying this paragraph (c), items of a CFC group member are translated into a single currency for the CFC group and back to the functional currency of the CFC group member using the average exchange rate for the CFC group member's specified taxable year. The single currency for the CFC group may be the U.S. dollar or the functional currency of a plurality of the CFC group members.
(5)
Special rule for specified periods beginning in 2019 or 2020
—(i)
50 percent ATI limitation applies to a specified period of a CFC group.
In the case of a CFC group, § 1.163(j)-2(b)(2) (including the election under § 1.163(j)-2(b)(2)(ii)) applies to a specified period of the CFC group beginning in 2019 or 2020, rather than to a specified taxable year of a CFC group member. An election under § 1.163(j)-2(b)(2)(ii) for a specified period of a CFC group is not effective unless made by each designated U.S. person. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(5)(i), the election is made in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2020-22, 2020-18 I.R.B. 745. For purposes of applying § 1.964-1(c), the election is treated as if made for each CFC group member.
(ii)
Election to use 2019 ATI applies to a specified period of a CFC group
—(A)
In general.
In the case of a CFC group, for purposes of applying paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an election under § 1.163(j)-2(b)(3)(i) is made for a specified period of a CFC group beginning in 2020 and applies to the specified taxable years of each CFC group member with respect to such specified period, taking into account the application of paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section. The election under § 1.163(j)-2(b)(3)(i) does not apply to any specified taxable year of a CFC group member other than those described in the preceding sentence. An election under § 1.163(j)-2(b)(3)(i) for a specified period of a CFC group is not effective unless made by each designated U.S. person. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A), the election is made in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2020-22, 2020-18 I.R.B. 745. For purposes of applying § 1.964-1(c), the election is treated as if made for each CFC group member.
(B)
Specified taxable years that do not begin in 2020.
If a specified taxable year of a CFC group member with respect to the specified period described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section begins in 2019, then, for purposes of applying paragraph (c)(2) of this section, § 1.163(j)-2(b)(3) is applied to such specified taxable year by substituting “2018” for “2019” and “2019” for “2020.” If a specified taxable year of a CFC group member with respect to the specified period described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section begins in 2021, then, for purposes of applying paragraph (c)(2) of this section, § 1.163(j)-2(b)(3) is applied to such specified taxable year by substituting “2020” for “2019” and “2021” for “2020.”
(d)
Determination of a specified group and specified group members
—(1)
Scope.
This paragraph (d) provides rules for determining a specified group and specified group members. Paragraph (d)(2)
of this section provides rules for determining a specified group. Paragraph (d)(3) of this section provides rules for determining specified group members.
(2)
Rules for determining a specified group
—(i)
Definition of a specified group.
Subject to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the term
specified group
means one or more applicable CFCs or chains of applicable CFCs connected through stock ownership with a specified group parent (which is included in the specified group only if it is an applicable CFC), but only if—
(A) The specified group parent owns directly or indirectly stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2)(B) in at least one applicable CFC; and
(B) Stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2)(B) in each of the applicable CFCs (except the specified group parent) is owned directly or indirectly by one or more of the other applicable CFCs or the specified group parent.
(ii)
Indirect ownership.
For purposes of applying paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, stock is owned indirectly only if it is owned under section 318(a)(2)(A) through a partnership or under section 318(a)(2)(A) or (B) through an estate or trust not described in section 7701(a)(30).
(iii)
Specified group parent.
The term
specified group parent
means a qualified U.S. person or an applicable CFC.
(iv)
Qualified U.S. person.
The term
qualified U.S. person
means a United States person described in section 7701(a)(30)(A) or (C). For purposes of this paragraph (d), members of a consolidated group that file (or that are required to file) a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return are treated as a single qualified U.S person and individuals described in section 7701(a)(30)(A) whose filing status is married filing jointly are treated as a single qualified U.S. person.
(v)
Stock.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the term
stock
has the same meaning as “stock” in section 1504 (without regard to § 1.1504-4, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section) and all shares of stock within a single class are considered to have the same value. Thus, control premiums and minority and blockage discounts within a single class are not taken into account.
(vi)
Options treated as exercised.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), options that are reasonably certain to be exercised, as determined under § 1.1504-4(g), are treated as exercised. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(vi), options include call options, warrants, convertible obligations, put options, and any other instrument treated as an option under § 1.1504-4(d), determined by replacing the term “a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 1504 and this section” with “a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 163(j).”
(vii)
When a specified group ceases to exist.
The principles of § 1.1502-75(d)(1), (d)(2)(i) and (ii), and (d)(3)(i) through (iv) apply for purposes of determining when a specified group ceases to exist. Solely for purposes of applying these principles, references to the common parent are treated as references to the specified group parent and each applicable CFC that is treated as a specified group member for a taxable year with respect to a specified period is treated as affiliated with the specified group parent from the beginning to the end of the specified period, without regard to the beginning or end of its taxable year.
(3)
Rules for determining a specified group member.
If two or more applicable CFCs are included in a specified group on the last day of a taxable year of each applicable CFC that ends with or within a specified period, then each applicable CFC is a
specified group member
with respect to the specified period for its entire taxable year ending with or within the specified period. If only one applicable CFC is included in a specified group on the last day of its taxable year that ends with or within the specified period, it is not a specified group member. If an applicable CFC has multiple taxable years that end with or within a specified period, this paragraph (d)(3) is applied separately to each taxable year to determine if the applicable CFC is a specified group member for such taxable year.
(e)
Rules and procedures for treating a specified group as a CFC group
—(1)
Scope.
This paragraph (e) provides rules and procedures for treating a specified
group member as a CFC group member and for determining a CFC group for purposes of applying section 163(j) and the section 163(j) regulations.
(2)
CFC group and CFC group member
—(i)
CFC group.
The term
CFC group
means, with respect to a specified period, all CFC group members for their specified taxable years.
(ii)
CFC group member.
The term
CFC group member
means, with respect to a specified taxable year and a specified period, a specified group member of a specified group for which a CFC group election is in effect. However, notwithstanding the prior sentence, a specified group member is not treated as a CFC group member for a taxable year of the specified group member beginning before January 1, 2018.
(3)
Duration of a CFC group.
A CFC group continues until the CFC group election is revoked, or there is no longer a specified period with respect to the specified group. A failure to provide the information described in paragraph (e)(6) of this section does not terminate a CFC group election.
(4)
Joining or leaving a CFC group.
If an applicable CFC becomes a specified group member for a specified taxable year with respect to a specified period of a specified group for which a CFC group election is in effect, the CFC group election applies to the applicable CFC and the applicable CFC becomes a CFC group member. If an applicable CFC ceases to be a specified group member for a specified taxable year with respect to a specified period of a specified group for which a CFC group election is in effect, the CFC group election terminates solely with respect to the applicable CFC.
(5)
Manner of making or revoking a CFC group election
—(i)
In general.
An election is made or revoked under this paragraph (e)(5) (
CFC group election
) with respect to a specified period of a specified group. A CFC group election remains in effect for each specified period of the specified group until revoked. A CFC group election that is in effect with respect to a specified period of a specified group applies to each specified group member for its specified taxable year that ends with or within the specified period. The making or revoking of a CFC group election is not effective unless made or revoked by each designated U.S. person.
(ii)
Revocation by election.
A CFC group election cannot be revoked with respect to any specified period beginning before 60 months following the last day of the specified period for which the election was made. Once a CFC group election has been revoked, a new CFC group election cannot be made with respect to any specified period beginning before 60 months following the last day of the specified period for which the election was revoked.
(iii)
Timing.
A CFC group election must be made or revoked with respect to a specified period of a specified group no later than the due date (taking into account extensions, if any) of the original Federal income tax return for the taxable year of each designated U.S. person in which or with which the specified period ends.
(iv)
Election statement.
To make or revoke a CFC group election for a specified period of a specified group, each designated U.S. person must attach a statement to its relevant Federal income tax or information return in accordance with publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance. The statement must include the name and taxpayer identification number of all designated U.S. persons, a statement that the CFC group election is being made or revoked, as applicable, the specified period for which the CFC group election is being made or revoked, and the name of each CFC group member and its specified taxable year with respect to the specified period. The statement must be filed in the manner prescribed in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance.
(v)
Effect of prior CFC group election.
A CFC group election is made solely pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (e)(5), without regard to whether a CFC group election described in guidance under section 163(j) published on December 28, 2018, was in effect.
(6)
Annual information reporting.
Each designated U.S. person must attach a statement to its relevant Federal income tax or information return for each taxable year in which a CFC group election is in effect that contains
information concerning the computation of the CFC group's section 163(j) limitation and the application of paragraph (c)(3) of this section to the CFC group in accordance with publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance.
(f)
Treatment of a CFC group member that has ECI
—(1)
In general.
If a CFC group member has ECI in its specified taxable year, then for purposes of section 163(j) and the section 163(j) regulations—
(i) The items, disallowed business interest expense carryforwards, and other attributes of the CFC group member that are ECI are treated as items, disallowed business interest expense carryforwards, and attributes of a separate applicable CFC (such deemed corporation, an
ECI deemed corporation
) that has the same taxable year and shareholders as the applicable CFC; and
(ii) The ECI deemed corporation is not treated as a specified group member for the specified taxable year.
(2) [Reserved]
(g)
Rules concerning the computation of adjusted taxable income of a relevant foreign corporation
—(1)
Tentative taxable income.
For purposes of computing the tentative taxable income of a relevant foreign corporation for a taxable year, the relevant foreign corporation's gross income and allowable deductions are determined under the principles of § 1.952-2 or under the rules of section 882 for determining income that is, or deductions that are allocable to, effectively connected income, as applicable.
(2)
Treatment of certain dividends.
For purposes of computing the ATI of a relevant foreign corporation for a taxable year, any dividend included in gross income that is received from a related person, within the meaning of section 954(d)(3), with respect to the distributee is subtracted from tentative taxable income.
(3)
Treatment of certain foreign income taxes.
For purposes of computing the ATI of a relevant foreign corporation for a taxable year, no deduction is taken into account for any foreign income tax (as defined in § 1.960-1(b), but substituting the phrase “relevant foreign corporation” for the phrase “controlled foreign corporation”).
(4)
Anti-abuse rule
—(i)
In general.
If a specified group member of a specified group or an applicable partnership (
specified lender
) includes an amount (
payment amount
) in income and such amount is attributable to business interest expense incurred by another specified group member or an applicable partnership of the specified group (
specified borrower
) during its taxable year, then the ATI of the specified borrower for the taxable year is increased by the ATI adjustment amount if—
(A) The business interest expense is incurred with a principal purpose of reducing the Federal income tax liability of any United States shareholder of a specified group member (including over other taxable years);
(B) Absent the application of this paragraph (g)(4), the effect of the specified borrower treating all or part of the payment amount as disallowed business interest expense would be to reduce the Federal income tax liability of any United States shareholder of a specified group member; and
(C) Either no CFC group election is in effect with respect to the specified group or the specified borrower is an applicable partnership.
(ii)
ATI adjustment amount
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), the term
ATI adjustment amount
means, with respect to a specified borrower and a taxable year, the product of 3
1/3
and the lesser of the payment amount or the disallowed business interest expense, computed without regard to this paragraph (g)(4).
(B)
Special rule for taxable years or specified periods beginning in 2019 or 2020.
For any taxable year of an applicable CFC or specified taxable year of a CFC group member with respect to a specified period for which the section 163(j) limitation is determined based, in part, on 50 percent of ATI, in accordance with § 1.163(j)-2(b)(2), paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is applied by substituting “2” for “3
1/3
.”
(iii)
Applicable partnership.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), the term
applicable partnership
means, with respect to a specified group, a partnership in which at least 80 percent of the interests in profits or capital is owned, directly or indirectly through one or more other partnerships, by specified
group members of the specified group. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4)(iii), a partner's interest in the profits of a partnership is determined in accordance with the rules and principles of § 1.706-1(b)(4)(ii) and a partner's interest in the capital of a partnership is determined in accordance with the rules and principles of § 1.706-1(b)(4)(iii).
(h)
Election to apply safe-harbor
—(1)
In general.
If an election to apply this paragraph (h)(1) (
safe-harbor election
) is in effect with respect to a taxable year of a stand-alone applicable CFC or a specified taxable year of a CFC group member, as applicable, then, for such year, no portion of the applicable CFC's business interest expense is disallowed under the section 163(j) limitation. This paragraph (h) does not apply to excess business interest expense, as described in § 1.163(j)-6(f)(2), until the taxable year in which it is treated as paid or accrued by an applicable CFC under § 1.163(j)-6(g)(2)(i). Furthermore, excess business interest expense is not taken into account for purposes of determining whether the safe-harbor election is available for a stand-alone applicable CFC or a CFC group until the taxable year in which it is treated as paid or accrued by an applicable CFC under § 1.163(j)-6(g)(2)(i).
(2)
Eligibility for safe-harbor election
—(i)
Stand-alone applicable CFC.
The safe-harbor election may be made for the taxable year of a stand-alone applicable CFC only if, for the taxable year, the business interest expense of the applicable CFC is less than or equal to either—
(A) The business interest income of the applicable CFC; or
(B) 30 percent of the lesser of the eligible amount or the qualified tentative taxable income of the applicable CFC.
(ii)
CFC group.
The safe-harbor election may be made for the specified period of a CFC group only if, for the specified period, no CFC group member has any pre-group disallowed business interest expense carryforward and the business interest expense of the CFC group for the specified period is less than or equal to either—
(A) The business interest income of the CFC group; or
(B) 30 percent of the lesser of the eligible amount or the qualified tentative taxable income of the CFC group.
(iii)
Currency translation.
For purposes of applying this paragraph (h), BII, BIE, and qualified tentative taxable income of a stand-alone applicable CFC or a CFC group must be determined using the U.S. dollar. If BII, BIE, or any items of income, gain, deduction, or loss that are taken into account in computing qualified tentative taxable income are maintained in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, then those items must be translated into the U.S. dollar using the average exchange rate for the taxable year or the specified taxable year, as applicable.
(3)
Eligible amount
—(i)
Stand-alone applicable CFC.
The
eligible amount
of a stand-alone applicable CFC for a taxable year is the sum of the amounts a domestic corporation would include in gross income under sections 951(a)(1)(A) and 951A(a), reduced by any deductions that would be allowed under section 245A (by reason of section 964(e)(4)) or section 250(a)(1)(B)(i), determined as if the domestic corporation has a taxable year that ends on the last date of the taxable year of the stand-alone applicable CFC, it wholly owns the stand-alone applicable CFC throughout the CFC's taxable year, it does not own any assets other than stock in the stand-alone applicable CFC, and it has no other items of income, gain, deduction, or loss.
(ii)
CFC group.
The
eligible amount
of a CFC group for a specified period is the sum of the amounts a domestic corporation would include in gross income under sections 951(a)(1)(A) and 951A(a), reduced by any deductions that would be allowed under section 245A (by reason of section 964(e)(4)) or section 250(a)(1)(B)(i), determined as if the domestic corporation has a taxable year that is the specified period, it wholly owns each CFC group member throughout the CFC group member's specified taxable year, it does not own any assets other than stock in the CFC group members, and it has no other items of income, gain, deduction, or loss.
(iii)
Additional rules for determining an eligible amount.
For purposes of paragraphs (h)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section,
the amounts that would be included in gross income of a United States shareholder under sections 951(a)(1)(A) and 951A(a), and any corresponding deductions that would be allowed under section 245A (by reason of section 964(e)(4)) or section 250(a)(1)(B)(i), are determined by taking into account any elections that are made with respect to the applicable CFC(s), including under § 1.954-1(d)(5) (relating to the subpart F high-tax exception) and § 1.951A-2(c)(7)(viii) (relating to the GILTI high-tax exclusion). These amounts are also determined without regard to any section 163(j) limitation on business interest expense and without regard to any disallowed business interest expense carryovers. In addition, those amounts are determined by only taking in account items of the applicable CFC(s) that are properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business under § 1.163(j)-10.
(4)
Qualified tentative taxable income.
The term
qualified tentative taxable income
means, with respect to a taxable year of a stand-alone applicable CFC, the applicable CFC's tentative taxable income, and with respect to a specified period of a CFC group, the sum of each CFC group member's tentative taxable income for the specified taxable year; provided that for purposes of this paragraph (h)(4), tentative taxable income is determined by taking into account only items properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business under § 1.163(j)-10.
(5)
Manner of making a safe-harbor election
—(i)
In general.
A safe-harbor election is an annual election made under this paragraph (h)(5) with respect to a taxable year of a stand-alone applicable CFC or with respect to a specified period of a CFC group. A safe-harbor election that is made with respect to a specified period of a CFC group is effective with respect to each CFC group member for its specified taxable year. A safe-harbor election is only effective if made by each designated U.S. person with respect to a stand-alone applicable CFC or a CFC group. A safe-harbor election is made with respect to a taxable year of a stand-alone applicable CFC, or a specified period of a CFC group, no later than the due date (taking into account extensions, if any) of the original Federal income tax return for the taxable year of each designated U.S. person, respectively, in which or with which the taxable year of the stand-alone applicable CFC ends or the specified period of the CFC group ends.
(ii)
Election statement.
To make a safe-harbor election, each designated U.S. person must attach to its relevant Federal income tax return or information return a statement that includes the name and taxpayer identification number of all designated U.S. persons, a statement that a safe-harbor election is being made pursuant to § 1.163(j)-7(h) and a calculation that substantiates that the requirements for making the election are satisfied, and the taxable year of the stand-alone applicable CFC or the specified period of the CFC group, as applicable, for which the safe-harbor election is being made in accordance with publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance. In the case of a CFC group, the statement must also include the name of each CFC group member and its specified taxable year that ends with or within the specified period for which the safe-harbor election is being made. The statement must be filed in the manner prescribed in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance.
(6)
Special rule for taxable years or specified periods beginning in 2019 or 2020.
In the case of a stand-alone applicable CFC, for any taxable year beginning in 2019 or 2020, paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section is applied by substituting “50 percent” for “30 percent.” In the case of a CFC group, for any specified period beginning in 2019 or 2020, paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is applied by substituting “50 percent” for “30 percent.”

(1)
Example 1. Specified taxable years included in specified period of a specified group
—(i)
Facts.
As of June 30, Year 1, USP, a domestic corporation, owns 60 percent of the common stock of FP, which owns all of the stock of FC1, FC2, and FC3. The remaining 40 percent of the common stock of FP is owned by an unrelated foreign corporation. FP has a single class of stock. FP acquired the stock of FC3 from an unrelated person on March 22, Year 1. The acquisition did not result in a change in FC3's taxable year or a close of its taxable year. USP's interest in FP and FP's interest in FC1 and FC2 has been the same for several years. USP has a taxable year ending June 30, Year 1, which is not a short taxable year. Each of FP, FC1, FC2, and FC3 are applicable CFCs. Pursuant to section 898(c)(2), FP and FC1 have taxable years ending May 31, Year 1. Pursuant to section 898(c)(1), FC2 and FC3 have taxable years ending June 30, Year 1.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Determining a specified group and specified period of the specified group.
Pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, FP, FC1, FC2, and FC3 are members of a specified group, and FP is the specified group parent. Because the specified group parent, FP, is an applicable CFC, the specified period of the specified group is the period ending on June 30, Year 1, which is the last day of FP's required year described in section 898(c)(1), without regard to section 898(c)(2), and beginning on July 1, Year 0, which is the first day following the last day of the specified group's immediately preceding specified period (June 30, Year 0). See paragraph (k)(29)(i)(B) of this section.
(B)
Determining the specified taxable years with respect to the specified period.
Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, because each of FP and FC1 are included in the specified group on the last day of their taxable years ending May 31, Year 1, and such taxable years end with or within the specified period ending June 30, Year 1, FP and FC1 are specified group members with respect to the specified period ending June 30, Year 1, for their entire taxable years ending May 31, Year 1, and those taxable years are specified taxable years. Similarly, because each of FC2 and FC3 are included in the specified group on the last day of their taxable years ending June 30, Year 1, and such taxable years end with or within the specified period ending June 30, Year 1, FC2 and FC3 are specified group members with respect to the specified period ending June 30, Year 1, for their entire taxable years ending June 30, Year 1, and those taxable years are specified taxable years. The fact that FC3 was acquired on March 22, Year 1,
does not prevent FC3 from being a specified group member with respect to the specified period for the portion of its specified taxable year before March 22, Year 1.
(2)
Example 2. CFC groups
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section except that, in addition, a CFC group election is in place with respect to the specified period ending June 30, Year 1.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because a CFC group election is in place for the specified period ending June 30, Year 1, pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, each specified group member is a CFC group member with respect to its specified taxable year ending with or within the specified period. Accordingly, FP, FC1, FC2, and FC3 are CFC group members with respect to the specified period ending June 30, Year 1, for their specified taxable years ending May 31, Year 1, and June 30, Year 1, respectively. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the CFC group for the specified period ending June 30, Year 1, consists of FP, FC1, FC2, and FC3 for their specified taxable years ending May 31, Year 1, and June 30, Year 1, respectively. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a single section 163(j) limitation is computed for the specified period ending June 30, Year 1. That section 163(j) calculation will include FP and FC1's specified taxable years ending May 31, Year 1, and FC2 and FC3's specified taxable years ending June 30, Year 1.
(3)
Example 3. Application of anti-abuse rule
—(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC1 and CFC2. Thus, USP is the specified group parent of a specified group, the specified group members of which are CFC1 and CFC2. USP has a calendar year taxable year. All specified group members also have a calendar year taxable year and a functional currency of the U.S. dollar. CFC1 is organized in, and a tax resident of, a jurisdiction that imposes no tax on certain types of income, including interest income. With respect to Year 1, USP expects to pay no residual U.S. tax on its income inclusion under section 951A(a) (GILTI inclusion amount) and expects to have unused foreign tax credits in the category described in section 904(d)(1)(A). A CFC group election is not in effect for Year 1. With a principal purpose of reducing USP's Federal income tax liability in subsequent taxable years, on January 1, Year 1, CFC1 loans $100x to CFC2. On December 31, Year 1, CFC2 pays interest of $10x to CFC1 and repays the principal of $100x. Absent the application of paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, all $10x of CFC2's interest expense would be disallowed business interest expense and, therefore, CFC2 would have $10x of disallowed business interest expense carryforward to Year 2. In Year 2, CFC2 disposes of one of its businesses at a substantial gain that gives rise to tested income (within the meaning of section 951A(c)(2)(A) and § 1.951A-2(b)(1)). As a result of the gain being included in the ATI of CFC2, absent the application of paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, CFC2 would be allowed to deduct the entire $10x of disallowed business interest expense carryforward and therefore reduce the amount of its tested income. Also, USP would pay residual U.S. tax on its GILTI inclusion amount in Year 2, without regard to the application of paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
The $10x of business interest expense paid in Year 1 is a payment amount described in paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section because it is between specified group members, CFC1 and CFC2. Furthermore, the requirements of paragraphs (g)(4)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section are satisfied because the $10x of business interest expense is incurred with a principal purpose of reducing USP's Federal income tax liability; absent the application of paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, the effect of CFC2 treating the $10x of business interest expense as disallowed business interest expense in Year 1 would be to reduce USP's Federal income tax liability in Year 2; and no CFC group election is in effect with respect to the specified group in Year 1. Because the requirements of paragraphs (g)(4)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section are satisfied, CFC2's ATI for Year 1 is increased by the ATI adjustment amount, or $33.33x, which is the amount equal to 3
1/3
multiplied by $10x (the lesser of the payment amount of $10x and the disallowed business interest expense of $10x). As a result, the
$10x of business interest expense is not disallowed business interest expense of CFC2 in Year 1, and therefore does not give rise to a disallowed business interest expense carryforward to Year 2.

[T.D. 9905, 85 FR 56760, Sept. 14, 2020, as amended by T.D. 9943, 86 FR 5532, Jan. 19, 2021]
§ 1.163(j)-8
[Reserved]
§ 1.163(j)-9
Elections for excepted trades or businesses; safe harbor for certain REITs.
(a)
Overview.
The limitation in section 163(j) applies to business interest, which is defined under section 163(j)(5) as interest properly allocable to a trade or business. The term trade or business does not include any electing real property trade or business or any electing farming business. See section 163(j)(7). This section provides the rules
and procedures for taxpayers to follow in making an election under section 163(j)(7)(B) for a trade or business to be an electing real property trade or business and an election under section 163(j)(7)(C) for a trade or business to be an electing farming business.
(b)
Availability of election
—(1)
In general.
An election under section 163(j)(7)(B) for a real property trade or business to be an electing real property trade or business is available to any trade or business that is described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(14)(i), (ii), or (iii), and an election under section 163(j)(7)(C) for a farming business to be an electing farming business is available to any trade or business that is described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(13)(i), (ii), or (iii).
(2)
Special rules
—(i)
Exempt small businesses.
An election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is available regardless of whether the real property trade or business or farming business making the election also meets the requirements of the small business exemption in section 163(j)(3) and § 1.163(j)-2(d). See paragraph (c)(2) of this section for the effect of the election relating to depreciation.
(ii)
Section 162 trade or business not required for electing real property trade or business.
An election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to be an electing real property trade or business is available regardless of whether the trade or business with respect to which the election is made is a trade or business under section 162. For example, a taxpayer engaged in activities described in section 469(c)(7)(C) and § 1.469-9(b)(2), as required in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(14)(i), may make an election for a trade or business to be an electing real property trade or business, regardless of whether its activities rise to the level of a section 162 trade or business.
(c)
Scope and effect of election
—(1)
In general.
An election under this section is made with respect to each eligible trade or business of the taxpayer and applies only to such trade or business for which the election is made. An election under this section applies to the taxable year in which the election is made and to all subsequent taxable years. See paragraph (e) of this section for terminations of elections.
(2)
Irrevocability.
An election under this section is irrevocable.
(3)
Depreciation.
Taxpayers making an election under this section are required to use the alternative depreciation system for certain types of property under section 163(j)(11) and cannot claim the additional first-year depreciation deduction under section 168(k) for those types of property.
(d)
Time and manner of making election
—(1)
In general.
Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, a taxpayer makes an election under this section by attaching an election statement to the taxpayer's timely filed original Federal income tax return, including extensions. A taxpayer may make elections for multiple trades or businesses on a single election statement.
(2)
Election statement contents.
The election statement should be titled “Section 1.163(j)-9 Election” and must contain the following information for each trade or business:
(i) The taxpayer's name;
(ii) The taxpayer's address;
(iii) The taxpayer's social security number (SSN) or employer identification number (EIN);
(iv) A description of the taxpayer's electing trade or business sufficient to demonstrate qualification for an election under this section, including the principal business activity code; and
(v) A statement that the taxpayer is making an election under section 163(j)(7)(B) or (C), as applicable.
(3)
Consolidated group's trade or business.
For a consolidated group's trade or business, the election under this section is made by the agent for the group, as defined in § 1.1502-77, on behalf of itself and members of the consolidated group. Only the name and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the agent for the group, as defined in § 1.1502-77, must be provided on the election statement.
(4)
Partnership's trade or business.
An election for a partnership must be made on the partnership's return for a trade or business that the partnership conducts. An election by a partnership does not apply to a trade or business conducted by a partner outside the partnership.
(e)
Termination of election
—(1)
In general.
An election under this section
automatically terminates if a taxpayer ceases to engage in the electing trade or business. A taxpayer is considered to cease to engage in an electing trade or business if the taxpayer sells or transfers substantially all of the assets of the electing trade or business to an acquirer that is not a related party in a taxable asset transfer. A taxpayer is also considered to cease to engage in an electing trade or business if the taxpayer terminates its existence for Federal income tax purposes or ceases operation of the electing trade or business, except to the extent that such termination or cessation results in the sale or transfer of substantially all of the assets of the electing trade or business to an acquirer that is a related party, or in a transaction that is not a taxable asset transfer.
(2)
Taxable asset transfer defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term
taxable asset transfer
means a transfer in which the acquirer's basis or adjusted basis in the assets is not determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the transferor's basis in the assets.
(3)
Related party defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term
related party
means any person who bears a relationship to the taxpayer which is described in section 267(b) or 707(b)(1).
(4)
Anti-abuse rule.
If, within 60 months of a sale or transfer of assets described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the taxpayer or a related party reacquires substantially all of the assets that were used in the taxpayer's prior electing trade or business, or substantially similar assets, and resumes conducting such prior electing trade or business, the taxpayer's previously terminated election under this section is reinstated and is effective on the date the prior electing trade or business is reacquired.
(f)
Additional guidance.
The rules and procedures regarding the time and manner of making an election under this section and the election statement contents in paragraph (d) of this section may be modified through other guidance (see §§ 601.601(d) and 601.602 of this chapter). Additional situations in which an election may terminate under paragraph (e) of this section may be provided through guidance published in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d) of this chapter).
(g)
Examples.
The examples in this paragraph (g) illustrate the application of this section. Unless otherwise indicated, X and Y are domestic C corporations; D and E are U.S. resident individuals not subject to any foreign income tax; and the exemption for certain small businesses in § 1.163(j)-2(d) does not apply.
(1)
Example 1: Scope of election
—(i)
Facts.
For the taxable year ending December 31, 2021, D, a sole proprietor, owned and operated a dairy farm and an orchard as separate farming businesses described in section 263A(e)(4). D filed an original Federal income tax return for the 2021 taxable year on August 1, 2022, and included with the return an election statement meeting the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The election statement identified D's dairy farm business as an electing trade or business under this section. On March 1, 2023, D sold some but not all or substantially all of the assets from D's dairy farm business to D's neighbor, E, who is unrelated to D. After the sale, D continued to operate the dairy farm trade or business.
(ii)
Analysis.
D's election under this section was properly made and is effective for the 2021 taxable year and subsequent years. D's dairy farm business is an excepted trade or business because D made the election with D's timely filed Federal income tax return. D's orchard business is a non-excepted trade or business, because D did not make an election for the orchard business to be an excepted trade or business. The sale of some but not all or substantially all of the assets from D's dairy farm business does not affect D's election under this section.
(2)
Example 2: Availability of election
—(i)
Facts.
E, an individual, operates a dairy business that is a farming business under section 263A and also owns real property that is not part of E's dairy business that E leases to an unrelated party through a triple net lease. E's average gross receipts, excluding inherently personal amounts, for the three years prior to 2021 are approximately $25 million, but E is unsure of the exact amount.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, E may make an election under this section for the dairy business to be an electing farming business, even though E is unsure whether the small business exemption of § 1.163(j)-2(d) applies. Additionally, under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, assuming the requirements of section 163(j)(7)(C) and this section are otherwise satisfied, E may make an election under this section for its triple net lease property to be an electing real property trade or business, even though E may not be engaged in a trade or business under section 162 with respect to the real property.
(3)
Example 3: Cessation of entire trade or business
—(i)
Facts.
X has a real property trade or business for which X made an election under this section by attaching an election statement to A's 2021 Federal income tax return. On March 1, 2022, X sold all of the assets used in its real property trade or business to Y, an unrelated party, and ceased to engage in the electing trade or business. On June 1, 2027, X started a new real property trade or business that was substantially similar to X's prior electing trade or business.
(ii)
Analysis.
X's election under this section terminated on March 1, 2022, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. X may choose whether to make an election under this section for X's new real property trade or business that A started in 2027.
(4)
Example 4: Anti-abuse rule
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, except that X re-started its previous real property trade or business on February 1, 2023, when X reacquired substantially all of the assets that X had sold on March 1, 2022.
(ii)
Analysis.
X's election under this section terminated on March, 1, 2022, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. On February 1, 2023, X's election was reinstated under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. X's new real property trade or business is treated as a resumption of X's prior electing trade or business and is therefore treated as an electing real property trade or business.
(5)
Example 5: Trade or business continuing after acquisition
—(i)
Facts.
X has a farming business for which X made an election under this section by attaching an election statement to X's timely filed 2021 Federal income tax return. Y, unrelated to X, also has a farming business, but Y has not made an election under this section. On July 1, 2022, X transferred all of its assets to Y in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(D). After the transfer, Y continues to operate the farming trade or business acquired from X.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, Y is subject to X's election under this section for the trade or business that uses X's assets because the sale or transfer was not in a taxable transaction. Y cannot revoke X's election, but X's election has no effect on Y's existing farming business for which Y has not made an election under this section.
(6)
Example 6: Trade or business merged after acquisition
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5
in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section, except that Y uses the assets acquired from X in a trade or business that is neither a farming business (as defined in section 263A(e)(4) or § 1.263A-4(a)(4)) nor a trade or business of a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative (as defined in section 199A(g)(4)).
(ii)
Analysis.
Y is not subject to X's election for Y's farming business because the farming trade or business ceased to exist after the acquisition.
(h)
Safe harbor for REITs
—(1)
In general.
If a REIT holds real property, as defined in § 1.856-10, interests in one or more partnerships directly or indirectly holding real property (through interests in other partnerships or shares in other REITs), as defined in § 1.856-10, or shares in one or more other REITs directly or indirectly holding real property (through interests in partnerships or shares in other REITs), as defined in § 1.856-10, the REIT is eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to be an electing real property trade or business for purposes of sections 163(j)(7)(B) and 168(g)(1)(F) for all or part of its assets. The portion of the REIT's assets eligible for this election is determined under paragraph (h)(2) or (3) of this section.
(2)
REITs that do not significantly invest in real property financing assets.
If a REIT makes the election under paragraph (h)(1) of this section and the value of the REIT's real property financing assets, as defined in paragraphs (h)(5) and (6) of this section, at the close of the taxable year is 10 percent or less of the value of the REIT's total assets at the close of the taxable year, as determined under section 856(c)(4)(A), then all of the REIT's assets are treated as assets of an excepted trade or business.
(3)
REITs that significantly invest in real property financing assets.
If a REIT makes the election under paragraph (h)(1) of this section and the value of the REIT's real property financing assets, as defined in paragraphs (h)(5) and (6) of this section, at the close of the taxable year is more than 10 percent of the value of the REIT's total assets at the close of the taxable year, as determined under section 856(c)(4)(A), then for the allocation of interest expense, interest income, and other items of expense and gross income to excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses, the REIT must apply the rules set forth in § 1.163(j)-10 as modified by paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
(4)
REIT real property assets, interests in partnerships, and shares in other REITs
—(i)
Real property assets.
Assets held by a REIT described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section that meet the definition of real property under § 1.856-10 are treated as assets of an excepted trade or business.
(ii)
Partnership interests.
If a REIT described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section holds an interest in a partnership, in applying the partnership look-through rule described in § 1.163(j)-10(c)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
), the REIT treats assets of the partnership that meet the definition of real property under § 1.856-10 as assets of an excepted trade or business. This application of the definition of real property under § 1.856-10 does not affect the characterization of the partnership's assets at the partnership level or for any non-REIT partner. However, no portion of the adjusted basis of the REIT's interest in the partnership is allocated to a non-excepted trade or business if the partnership makes an election under paragraph (h)(7) of this section and if all of the partnership's assets are treated as assets of an excepted trade or business under paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(iii)
Shares in other REITs
—(A)
In general.
If a REIT (shareholder REIT) described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section holds an interest in another REIT, then for purposes of applying the allocation rules in § 1.163(j)-10, the partnership look-through rule described in § 1.163(j)-10(c)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
), as modified by paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section, applies to the assets of the other REIT (as if the other REIT were a partnership) in determining the portion of shareholder REIT's adjusted basis in the shares of the other REIT that is allocable to an excepted or non-excepted trade or business of shareholder REIT. However, no portion of the adjusted basis of shareholder REIT's shares in the other REIT is allocated to a non-excepted trade or business if all of the other REIT's assets are treated as assets of an excepted trade or business under paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(B)
Information necessary.
If shareholder REIT does not receive, either directly from the other REIT or indirectly through the analysis of an applicable financial statement (within the meaning of section 451(b)(3)) of the other REIT, the information necessary to determine whether and to what extent the assets of the other REIT are investments in real property financing assets, then shareholder REIT's shares in the other REIT are treated as assets of a non-excepted trade or business under § 1.163(j)-10(c).
(iv)
Tiered entities.
In applying § 1.163(j)-10(c)(5)(ii)(E), the rules in paragraphs (h)(4)(ii) and (h)(4)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section apply to any partnerships and other REITs within the tier.
(5)
Value of shares in other REITs
—(i)
In general.
If a REIT (shareholder REIT) holds shares in another REIT, then solely for purposes of applying the value tests under paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section, the value of shareholder REIT's real property financing assets includes the portion of the value of shareholder REIT's shares in the other REIT that is attributable to the
other REIT's investments in real property financing assets. However, no portion of the value of shareholder REIT's shares in the other REIT is included in the value of shareholder REIT's real property financing assets if all of the other REIT's assets are treated as assets of an excepted trade or business under paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(ii)
Information necessary.
If shareholder REIT does not receive, either directly from the other REIT or indirectly through the analysis of an applicable financial statement (within the meaning of section 451(b)(3)) of the other REIT, the information necessary to determine whether and to what extent the assets of the other REIT are investments in real property financing assets, then shareholder REIT's shares in the other REIT are treated as real property financing assets for purposes of paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section.
(iii)
Tiered REITs.
The rules in paragraphs (h)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section apply successively to the extent that the other REIT, and any other REIT in the tier, holds shares in another REIT.
(6)
Real property financing assets.
For purposes of this paragraph (h),
real property financing assets
include interests, including participation interests, in the following: Mortgages, deeds of trust, and installment land contracts; mortgage pass-through certificates guaranteed by Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), or Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC); REMIC regular interests; other interests in investment trusts classified as trusts under § 301.7701-4(c) of this chapter that represent undivided beneficial ownership in a pool of obligations principally secured by interests in real property and related assets that would be permitted investments if the investment trust were a REMIC; obligations secured by manufactured housing treated as single family residences under section 25(e)(10), without regard to the treatment of the obligations or the properties under state law; and debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs.
(7)
Application of safe harbor for partnerships controlled by REITs.
A partnership is eligible to make the election under paragraph (h)(1) of this section if one or more REITs own directly or indirectly at least 50 percent of the partnership's capital and profits, the partnership meets the requirements of section 856(c)(2), (3), and (4) as if the partnership were a REIT, and the partnership satisfies the requirements described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section as if the partnership were a REIT. The portion of the partnership's assets eligible for this election is determined under paragraph (h)(2) or (3) of this section, treating the partnership as if it were a REIT.
(8)
REITs or partnerships controlled by REITs that do not apply the safe harbor.
A REIT or a partnership that is eligible but chooses not to apply the safe harbor provisions of paragraph (h)(1) or (7) of this section, respectively, may still elect, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for one or more of its trades or businesses to be an electing real property trade or business, provided that such trade or business is otherwise eligible to elect under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A REIT or partnership that makes the election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section without utilizing the safe harbor provisions of paragraph (h) of this section may not rely on any portion of paragraphs (h)(1) through (7) of this section.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Special anti-abuse rule for certain real property trades or businesses
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, a trade or business (lessor) does not constitute a trade or business eligible for an election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to be an electing real property trade or business if at least 80 percent, determined by fair market rental value, of the real property used in the business is leased to a trade or business (lessee) under common control with the lessor, regardless of whether the arrangement is pursuant to a written lease or pursuant to a service contract or another agreement that is not denominated as a lease. For purposes of this paragraph (j), fair market rental value is the amount of rent that a prospective lessee that is unrelated to the
lessor would be willing to pay for a rental interest in real property, taking into account the geographic location, size, and type of the real property. For purposes of this paragraph (j), two trades or businesses are under common control if 50 percent of the direct and indirect ownership of both businesses are held by related parties within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b).
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
De minimis exception.
The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this section does not apply, and the lessor is eligible to make an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the lessor leases, regardless of whether the arrangement is pursuant to a written lease or pursuant to a service contract or another agreement that is not denominated as a lease, at least 90 percent of the lessor's real property, determined by fair market rental value, to one or more of the following:
(A) A party not under common control with the lessor or lessee;
(B) A party under common control with the lessor or lessee that has made an election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for a trade or business to be an electing real property trade or business or electing farming business, but only to the extent that the real property is used as part of its electing real property trade or business or electing farming business; or
(C) A party under common control with the lessor or lessee that is an excepted regulated utility trade or business, but only to the extent that the real property is used as part of its excepted regulated utility trade or business.
(ii)
Look-through exception.
If the de minimis exception in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section does not apply because less than 90 percent of the lessor's real property is leased to parties described in paragraphs (j)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (C), the lessor is eligible to make the election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the extent that the lessor leases the real property to parties described in paragraph (j)(2)(A), (B), or (C), and to the extent that the lessee subleases (or lessees ultimately sublease) the real property to:
(A) A party not under common control with the lessor or lessee;
(B) A party under common control with the lessor or lessee that has made an election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for a trade or business to be an electing real property trade or business or electing farming business to the extent that the real property is used as part of its electing real property trade or business or electing farming business; or
(C) A party under common control with the lessor or lessee that is an excepted regulated utility trade or business to the extent that the real property is used as part of its excepted regulated utility trade or business.
(iii)
Inapplicability of exceptions to consolidated groups.
The exceptions in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section do not apply when the lessor and lessee are members of the same consolidated group.
(iv)
Exception for certain REITs.
The special anti-abuse rule in paragraph (j)(1) of this section does not apply to REITs or to partnerships making an election under paragraph (h)(7) of this section that lease qualified lodging facilities, as defined in section 856(d)(9)(D), and qualified health care properties, as defined in section 856(e)(6)(D).

Allocations.
See § 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(D) for rules related to the allocation of the basis of assets used in lessor trades or businesses described in paragraphs (j)(1) and (j)(2)(i) of this section.
(4)
Examples.
The examples in this paragraph (j)(4) illustrate the application of paragraphs (j)(1), (2), and (3) of this section. Unless otherwise indicated, the parties are all domestic entities and are not members of a single consolidated group within the meaning of § 1.1502-1(h).
(i)
Example
1: Related party lease of hotel
—(A)
Facts.
X and Y are under common control, as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. X owns one piece of real property, a hotel, that X leases to Y. Y operates the hotel and provides hotel rooms and associated amenities to third party guests of the hotel. The form of the arrangement with third party hotel guests is a license to use rooms in the hotel and associated amenities. Y is a real property trade or business that has made an
election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(B)
Analysis.
Because X leases at least 80 percent of X's real property to a party under common control, X is subject to the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. However, under the de minimis exception under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, 100 percent of the fair market rental value of the building is leased to a party under common control that has made an election to be an electing real property trade or business. Accordingly, X is eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for its entire trade or business.
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
in paragraph (j)(4)(i)(A) of this section, except that Y has not made an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and is not otherwise using the real property in an excepted trade or business.
(B)
Analysis.
Because X leases at least 80 percent of X's real property, determined by fair market rental value, to Y, a party under common control, X is subject to the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. X is not eligible for the de minimis exception under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section because X does not lease at least 90 percent of its real property to a party under common control, as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, such as Y, and Y is not using the property in an otherwise excepted trade or business. However, X is eligible for the look-through exception under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section because X leases 100 percent of its real property to Y, a party that is under common control, and Y subleases 100 percent of the real property to parties that are not under common control with X or Y. The fact that the license provided to hotel guests is not denominated as a lease does not prevent these licenses from being treated as a lease for purposes of paragraph (j) of this section. Accordingly, under the look-through exception under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, X is eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with regard to its entire trade or business.
(iii)
Example
3: Sublease to related party and unrelated third party
—(A)
Facts.
X owns one piece of real property that X leases to Y, a party under common control, as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. Y does not operate an excepted trade or business. Y subleases 80 percent of the real property, determined by the fair market rental value, to a party under common control with Y that does not operate an excepted trade or business and 20 percent of the real property, determined by the fair market rental value, to an unrelated third party.
(B)
Analysis.
Because X leases at least 80 percent of X's real property, determined by fair market rental value, to a party under common control, X is subject to the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. X is not eligible for the de minimis exception in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section because X is not leasing at least 90 percent of the real property, determined by fair market rental value, to a party under common control that operates an excepted trade or business and/or unrelated parties. Under the look-through exception under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, X is eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the 20 percent of the fair market rental value of the real property subleased to an unrelated party because X is treated as directly leasing this portion to an unrelated party. X is not eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the 80 percent of the building subleased to a party under common control because X is still treated as directly leasing this portion to a related party. Under § 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(D), X must allocate 80 percent of the basis in the real property as a non-excepted trade or business and 20 percent of the basis in the real property as an excepted trade or business.
(iv)
Example 4: Multiple subleases
—(A)
Facts.
X owns a building that X leases to Y, a party under common control as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. Y does not operate an excepted trade or business. Y subleases 80 percent of the building, determined by fair market rental value, to Z, a party under common control with both X and Y. Y subleases the remaining 20 percent of the building, determined by fair
market rental value, to unrelated parties. Z subleases 50 percent of its leasehold interest, determined by fair market rental value, to parties unrelated to X, Y and Z, and uses the remaining leasehold interest in its retail business. Z does not operate an excepted trade or business.
(B)
Analysis.
Because X leases at least 80 percent of X's real property, determined by fair market rental value, to a party under common control, X is subject to the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. X is not eligible for the de minimis exception in paragraph (j)(2)(i) because X is not leasing at least 90 percent of the building, determined by fair market rental value, to a party under common control that operates an excepted trade or business and/or unrelated parties. Under the look-through exception under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, X is eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the 60 percent of the building that is subleased to unrelated parties, determined by adding 40 percent (50 percent of the 80 percent leasehold interest) from Z's sublease to an unrelated party and 20 percent from Y's sublease to unrelated parties (40 + 20). X is not eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the 40 percent of the building subleased to Z, because Z is a related party that does not operate an excepted trade or business.
(v)
Example 5: Lessee's Trade or Business
—(A)
Facts.
X owns a building that X leases to W, a party under common control as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. W operates the building as a widget manufacturing plant and does not sublease any portion of the building.
(B)
Analysis.
X is not eligible to make the election described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section because X leases the entire building to a party under common control. X is not eligible for the de minimis exception in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section because X is not leasing at least 90 percent of the real property to a party under common control that operates an excepted trade or business and/or unrelated parties. W's trade or business cannot be an electing real property trade or business. X is not eligible for the look-through exception under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section because W is not subleasing any part of the building.
(k)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning on or after November 13, 2020. However, taxpayers and their related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), may choose to apply the rules of this section to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, so long as the taxpayers and their related parties consistently apply the rules of the section 163(j) regulations, and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.381(c)(20)-1, 1.382-1, 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, 1.383-0, 1.383-1, 1.469-9, 1.469-11, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-36, 1.1502-79, 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, and 1.383-1), and 1.1504-4, to that taxable year.
[T.D. 9905, 85 FR 56760, Sept. 14, 2020]
§ 1.163(j)-10
Allocation of interest expense, interest income, and other items of expense and gross income to an excepted trade or business.
(a)
Overview
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Purposes.
Except as provided in § 1.163(j)-6(m) or § 1.163(j)-9(h), this section provides the exclusive rules for allocating tax items that are properly allocable to a trade or business between excepted trades or businesses and non-excepted trades or businesses for purposes of section 163(j). The amount of a taxpayer's interest expense that is properly allocable to excepted trades or businesses is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation. The amount of a taxpayer's other items of income, gain, deduction, or loss, including interest income, that is properly allocable to excepted trades or businesses is excluded from the calculation of the taxpayer's section 163(j) limitation. See section 163(j)(6) and (j)(8)(A)(i); see also § 1.163(j)-1(b)(1)(i)(H), (b)(1)(ii)(F), and (b)(3). The general method of allocation set forth in paragraph (c) of this section is based on the approach that money is fungible and that interest expense is attributable to all activities and property, regardless of any specific purpose for incurring an obligation on which interest is paid. In no event may the
amount of interest expense allocated under this section exceed the amount of interest paid or accrued, or treated as paid or accrued, by the taxpayer within the taxable year.
(ii)
Application of section.
The amount of a taxpayer's tax items properly allocable to a trade or business, other than interest expense and interest income, that is properly allocable to excepted trades or businesses for purposes of section 163(j) is determined as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The amount of a taxpayer's interest expense and interest income that is properly allocable to excepted trades or businesses for purposes of section 163(j) generally is determined as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section. For purposes of this section, a taxpayer's activities are not treated as a separate trade or business to the extent those activities involve the provision of real property, goods, or services to a trade or business of the taxpayer (or, if the taxpayer is a member of a consolidated group, the consolidated group). For example, if a taxpayer engaged in a manufacturing trade or business has in-house legal personnel that provide legal services solely with respect to the taxpayer's manufacturing business, the taxpayer is not treated as also engaged in the trade or business of providing legal services. Similarly, if the taxpayer described in the previous sentence constructs or acquires real property solely for use by the taxpayer's manufacturing business, the taxpayer is not treated as also engaged in a real property trade or business.
(2)
Coordination with other rules
—(i)
In general.
The rules of this section apply after a taxpayer has determined whether any interest expense or interest income paid, received, or accrued is properly allocable to a trade or business. Similarly, the rules of this section apply to other tax items after a taxpayer has determined whether those items are properly allocable to a trade or business. For instance, a taxpayer must apply § 1.163-8T, if applicable, to determine which items of interest expense are investment interest under section 163(d) before applying the rules in paragraph (c) of this section to allocate interest expense between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses. After determining whether its tax items are properly allocable to a trade or business, a taxpayer that is engaged in both excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses must apply the rules of this section to determine the amount of interest expense that is business interest expense subject to the section 163(j) limitation and to determine which items are included or excluded in computing its section 163(j) limitation.
(ii)
Treatment of investment interest, investment income, investment expenses, and certain other tax items of a partnership with a C corporation or tax-exempt corporation as a partner.
For rules governing the treatment of investment interest, investment income, investment expenses, and certain other separately stated tax items of a partnership with a C corporation or tax-exempt corporation as a partner, see §§ 1.163(j)-4(b)(3) and 1.163(j)-6(k).
(3)
Application of allocation rules to foreign corporations and foreign partnerships.
The rules of this section apply to foreign corporations and foreign partnerships.
(4)
Application of allocation rules to members of a consolidated group
—(i)
In general.
As provided in § 1.163(j)-4(d), the computations required by section 163(j) and the regulations in this part under section 163(j) of the Code generally are made for a consolidated group on a consolidated basis. In this regard, for purposes of applying the allocation rules of this section, all members of a consolidated group are treated as one corporation. Therefore, the rules of this section apply to the activities conducted by the group as if those activities were conducted by a single corporation. For example, the group (rather than a particular member) is treated as engaged in excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses. In the case of intercompany obligations, within the meaning of § 1.1502-13(g)(2)(ii), for purposes of allocating asset basis between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses, the obligation of the member borrower is not considered an asset of the creditor member. Similarly, intercompany transactions, within the
meaning of § 1.1502-13(b)(1)(i), are disregarded for purposes of this section, as are the resulting offsetting items, and property is allocated to a trade or business based on the activities of the group as if the members of the group were divisions of a single corporation. Further, stock of a group member that is owned by another member of the same group is not treated as an asset for purposes of this section, and the transfer of any amount of member stock to a non-member is treated by the group as a transfer of the member's assets proportionate to the amount of member stock transferred. Additionally, stock of a corporation that is not a group member is treated as owned by the group.
(ii)
Application of excepted business percentage to members of a consolidated group.
After a consolidated group has determined the percentage of the group's interest expense allocable to excepted trades or businesses for the taxable year (and thus not subject to the section 163(j) limitation), this exempt percentage is applied to the interest paid or accrued by each member during the taxable year to any lender that is not a group member. Therefore, except to the extent paragraph (d) of this section (providing rules for certain qualified nonrecourse indebtedness) applies, an identical percentage of the interest paid or accrued by each member of the group to any lender that is not a group member is treated as allocable to excepted trades or businesses, regardless of whether any particular member actually engaged in an excepted trade or business.
(iii)
Basis in assets transferred in an intercompany transaction.
For purposes of allocating interest expense and interest income under paragraph (c) of this section, the basis of property does not include any gain or loss realized with respect to the property by another member in an intercompany transaction, as defined in § 1.1502-13(b), whether or not the gain or loss is deferred.
(5)
Tax-exempt organizations.
For tax-exempt organizations, section 512 and the regulations in this part under section 512 of the Code determine the rules for allocating all income and expenses among multiple trades or businesses.
(6)
Application of allocation rules to disallowed disqualified interest.
A taxpayer may apply the allocation rules of this section to disallowed disqualified interest by either:
(i) Applying the allocation rules of this section to all of the taxpayer's disallowed disqualified interest in the taxable year(s) in which the disallowed disqualified interest was paid or accrued (the historical approach); or
(ii) Treating all of the taxpayer's disallowed disqualified interest as if it were paid or accrued in the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 (the effective date approach).
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (a).
(i)
Example 1: Items properly allocable to a trade or business
—(A)
Facts.
Individual T operates Business X, a non-excepted trade or business, as a sole proprietor. In Year 1, T pays or accrues $40x of interest expense and receives $100x of gross income with respect to Business X that is not eligible for a section 199A deduction. T borrows money to buy a car for personal use, and T pays or accrues $20x of interest expense with respect to the car loan. T also invests in corporate bonds, and, in Year 1, T receives $50x of interest income on those bonds.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, T must determine which items of income and expense, including items of interest income and interest expense, are properly allocable to a trade or business. T's $100x of gross income and T's $40x of interest expense with respect to Business X are properly allocable to a trade or business. However, the interest expense on T's car loan is personal interest within the meaning of section 163(h)(2) rather than interest properly allocable to a trade or business. Similarly, T's interest income from corporate bonds is not properly allocable to a trade or business because it is interest from investment activity. See section 163(d)(4)(B).
(ii)
Example 2: Intercompany transaction
—(A)
Facts.
S is a member of a consolidated group of which P is the common parent. P conducts an electing
real property trade or business (Business X), and S conducts a non-excepted trade or business (Business Y). P leases Building V (which P owns) to S for use in Business Y.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, a consolidated group is treated as a single corporation for purposes of applying the allocation rules of this section, and the consolidated group (rather than a particular member of the group) is treated as engaged in excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses. Thus, intercompany transactions are disregarded for purposes of this section. As a result, the lease of Building V by P to S is disregarded. Moreover, because Building V is used in Business Y, basis in this asset is allocated to Business Y rather than Business X for purposes of these allocation rules, regardless of which member (P or S) owns the building.
(iii)
Example 3: Intercompany sale of natural gas
—(A)
Facts.
S is a member of a consolidated group of which P is the common parent. S drills for natural gas and is not an excepted regulated utility trade or business. S sells most of its natural gas production to P, which produces electricity at its natural gas-fired power plants, and S sells the rest of its natural gas production to third parties at market rates. P is an excepted regulated utility trade or business to the extent that it is engaged in a trade or business described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i).
(B)
Analysis.
Intercompany transactions are disregarded for purposes of this section. As a result, the intercompany sales of natural gas by S to P are disregarded. Moreover, the assets of S and P are allocated between the excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses of the P group based on the assets used in each trade or business. Assets of S may be allocated to the P group's excepted trade or business to the extent those assets are used in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of electrical energy. Likewise, assets of P may be allocated to the P group's non-excepted trade or business to the extent those assets are used in the trade or business of natural gas production.
(iv)
Example 4: Disallowed disqualified interest
—(A)
Facts.
S is a member of a consolidated group of which P is the common parent. P and S are the only members of an affiliated group under old section 163(j)(6)(C). S operates a farm equipment leasing business (Business X) that is not an excepted trade or business. P is engaged in an electing farming business (Business Y). Entering its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, the P group has disallowed disqualified interest of $120x, all of which the P group paid or accrued in earlier taxable years in which it only operated Business X. The P group also incurs $100x of interest expense during its 2018 taxable year, of which $25x (25 percent of $100x) is business interest expense properly allocable to Business X and $75x (75 percent of $100x) is properly allocable to Business Y under paragraph (c) of this section.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the P group may allocate disallowed disqualified interest to Business X and Business Y by either applying the allocation rules of this section in the taxable years in which the disallowed disqualified interest was paid or accrued (the historical approach) or by treating such interest as though it were paid or accrued in the P group's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 (the effective date approach). Accordingly, if the P group chooses to rely on the historical approach, it allocates all $120x of disallowed disqualified interest to Business X (a non-excepted trade or business), and all $120x of disallowed disqualified interest is subject to the section 163(j) limitation. If, instead, the P group chooses to rely on the effective date approach, it allocates its $120x of disallowed disqualified interest in the same proportion as its $100x of business interest expense that was paid or accrued in its 2018 taxable year. Of the $120x of disallowed disqualified interest, $30x (25 percent of $120x) is allocated to Business X and $90x (75 percent of $120x) is allocated to Business Y. The $90x of disallowed disqualified interest that is properly allocable to Business Y (an excepted trade or business) is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation.
(b)
Allocation of tax items other than interest expense and interest income
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.163(j)-6(m) or § 1.163(j)-9(h), for purposes of calculating ATI, tax items other than interest expense and interest income are allocated to a particular trade or business in the manner described in this paragraph (b). It is not necessary to allocate items under this paragraph (b) for purposes of calculating ATI if all of the taxpayer's items subject to allocation under this paragraph (b) are allocable to excepted trades or businesses, or if all of those items are allocable to non-excepted trades or businesses.
(2)
Gross income other than dividends and interest income.
A taxpayer's gross income other than dividends and interest income is allocated to the trade or business that generated the gross income.
(3)
Dividends
—(i)
Look-through rule.
If a taxpayer receives a dividend, within the meaning of section 316, that is not investment income, within the meaning of section 163(d), and if the taxpayer satisfies the minimum ownership threshold in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, then, solely for purposes of allocating amounts received as a dividend during the taxable year to excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses under this paragraph (b), the dividend income is treated as allocable to excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses based upon the relative amounts of the payor corporation's adjusted basis in the assets used in its trades or businesses, determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. If at least 90 percent of the payor corporation's adjusted basis in its assets during the taxable year, determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, is allocable to either excepted trades or businesses or to non-excepted trades or businesses, all of the taxpayer's dividend income from the payor corporation for the taxable year is treated as allocable to either excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses, respectively.
(ii)
Inapplicability of the look-through rule.
If a taxpayer receives a dividend that is not investment income, within the meaning of section 163(d), and if the taxpayer does not satisfy the minimum ownership threshold in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, then the taxpayer must treat the dividend as allocable to a non-excepted trade or business.
(4)
Gain or loss from the disposition of non-consolidated C corporation stock, partnership interests, or S corporation stock
—(i)
Non-consolidated C corporations.
(A) If a taxpayer recognizes gain or loss upon the disposition of stock in a non-consolidated C corporation that is not property held for investment, within the meaning of section 163(d)(5), and if the taxpayer looks through to the assets of the C corporation under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section for the taxable year, then the taxpayer must allocate gain or loss from the disposition of stock to excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses based upon the relative amounts of the C corporation's adjusted basis in the assets used in its trades or businesses, determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. If at least 90 percent of the C corporation's adjusted basis in its assets during the taxable year, determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, is allocable to either excepted trades or businesses or to non-excepted trades or businesses, all of the taxpayer's gain or loss from the disposition is treated as allocable to either excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses, respectively.
(B) If a taxpayer recognizes gain or loss upon the disposition of stock in a non-consolidated C corporation that is not property held for investment, within the meaning of section 163(d)(5), and if the taxpayer does not look through to the assets of the C corporation under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section for the taxable year, then the taxpayer must treat the gain or loss from the disposition of stock as allocable to a non-excepted trade or business.
(C) For rules governing the transfer of stock of a member of a consolidated group, see paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.
(ii)
Partnerships and S corporations.
(A) If a taxpayer recognizes gain or loss upon the disposition of interests in a partnership or stock in an S corporation that owns—
(
1
) Non-excepted assets and excepted assets;
(
2
) Investment assets; or
(
3
) Both;
(B) The taxpayer determines a proportionate share of the amount properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business in accordance with the allocation rules set forth in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) or (c)(5)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section, as appropriate, and includes such proportionate share of gain or loss in the taxpayer's ATI. However, if at least 90 percent of the partnership's or S corporation's adjusted basis in its assets during the taxable year, determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, is allocable to either excepted trades or businesses or to non-excepted trades or businesses, all of the taxpayer's gain or loss from the disposition is treated as allocable to either excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses, respectively. This rule also applies to tiered passthrough entities by looking through each passthrough entity tier (for example, an S corporation that is the partner of the highest-tier partnership would look through each lower-tier partnership), subject to paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section. With respect to a partner that is a C corporation or tax-exempt corporation, a partnership's investment assets are taken into account and treated as non-excepted trade or business assets. For purposes of this paragraph, a passthrough entity means a partnership, S corporation, or any other entity (domestic or foreign) that is not a corporation if all items of income and deduction of the entity are included in the income of its owners or beneficiaries.
(5)
Expenses, losses, and other deductions
—(i)
Expenses, losses, and other deductions that are definitely related to a trade or business.
Expenses (other than interest expense), losses, and other deductions (collectively,
deductions
for purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)) that are definitely related to a trade or business are allocable to the trade or business to which they relate. A deduction is considered definitely related to a trade or business if the item giving rise to the deduction is incurred as a result of, or incident to, an activity of the trade or business or in connection with property used in the trade or business (see § 1.861-8(b)(2)). If a deduction is definitely related to one or more excepted trades or businesses and one or more non-excepted trades or businesses, the deduction is apportioned between the excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses based upon the relative amounts of the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the assets used in those trades or businesses, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii)
Other deductions.
Deductions that are not described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section are ratably apportioned based on the gross income of each trade or business.
(6)
Treatment of investment items and certain other items of a partnership with a C corporation partner.
Any investment income, investment expense, or other item that a partnership receives, pays, or accrues and that is treated as properly allocable to a trade or business of a C corporation partner under § 1.163(j)-4(b)(3)(i) is treated as properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business of the C corporation partner, except that any item with respect to property or activities for which an election has been made by the partnership under § 1.163(j)-9(b) is treated as properly allocable to an excepted trade or business. See, for example, an election for activities described in § 1.163(j)-9(b)(2)(ii) or an election under § 1.163(j)-9(h).
(7)
Examples: Allocation of income and expense.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (b):
(i)
Example 1: Allocation of income and expense between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses
—(A)
Facts.
T conducts an electing real property trade or business (Business Y), which is an excepted trade or business. T also operates a lumber yard (Business Z), which is a non-excepted trade or business. In Year 1, T receives $100x of gross rental income from real property leasing activities. T also pays or accrues $60x of expenses in connection with its real property leasing activities and $20x of legal services performed on behalf of both Business Y and Business Z. T receives $60x of gross income from lumber yard customers and pays or accrues $50x of expenses related to the lumber yard business. For purposes of expense allocations under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, T has $240x
of adjusted basis in its Business Y assets and $80x of adjusted basis in its Business Z assets.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for Year 1, $100x of rental income is allocated to Business Y, and $60x of income from lumber yard customers is allocated to Business Z. Under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, $60x of expenses paid or accrued in connection with real property leasing activities are allocated to Business Y, and $50x of expenses related to the lumber yard are allocated to Business Z. The $20x of remaining expenses for legal services performed on behalf of both Business Y and Business Z are allocated according to the relative amounts of T's basis in the assets used in each business. The total amount of T's basis in the assets used in Businesses Y and Z is $320x, of which 75 percent ($240x/$320x) is used in Business Y and 25 percent ($80x/$320x) is used in Business Z. Accordingly, $15x of the expenses for legal services are allocated to Business Y and $5x are allocated to Business Z.

Example 2: Allocation of partnership items from investment activity
—(A)
Facts.
U, a domestic C corporation, directly conducts an electing real property trade or business. U also has an interest in PRS, a partnership that holds real property for investment. PRS's investment in real property is not a trade or business under section 162 or a real property trade or business under section 469. During the taxable year, PRS sells some of its real property to third parties and allocates $80x of income to U from these sales. In addition, PRS incurs deductible expenses related to its investment in real property and allocates $9x of these deductible expenses to U.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, any investment income or investment expense that a partnership receives, pays, or accrues and that is treated as properly allocable to a trade or business of a C corporation partner is treated as properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business of the C corporation partner. Because PRS generates its income and expense from investment activity that is not a trade or business under section 162 or a real property trade or business under section 469, U's allocation of $80x of income and $9x of deductible expense from PRS is treated as properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business.
(c)
Allocating interest expense and interest income that is properly allocable to a trade or business
—(1)
General rule
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, § 1.163(j)-6(m), or § 1.163(j)-9(h), the amount of a taxpayer's interest expense and interest income that is properly allocable to a trade or business is allocated to the taxpayer's excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses for purposes of section 163(j) based upon the relative amounts of the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the assets, as determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, used in its excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses. The taxpayer must determine the adjusted basis in its assets as of the close of each determination date, as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, in the taxable year and average those amounts to determine the relative amounts of asset basis for its excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses for that year. It is not necessary to allocate interest expense or interest income under this paragraph (c) for purposes of determining a taxpayer's business interest expense and business interest income if all of the taxpayer's interest income and expense is allocable to excepted trades or businesses (in which case the taxpayer is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation) or if all of the taxpayer's interest income and expense is allocable to non-excepted trades or businesses.
(ii)
De minimis exception.
If at least 90 percent of the taxpayer's basis in its assets for the taxable year is allocable to either excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses pursuant to this paragraph (c), then all of the taxpayer's interest expense and interest income for that year that is properly allocable to a trade or business is treated as allocable to either excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses, respectively.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:
(i)
Facts.
T is a calendar-year C corporation engaged in an electing real property trade or business, the business of selling wine, and the business of selling hand-carved wooden furniture. In Year 1, T has $100x of interest expense that is deductible except for the potential application of section 163(j). Based upon determinations made on the determination dates in Year 1, T's average adjusted basis in the assets used in the electing real property trade or business (an excepted trade or business) in Year 1 is $800x, and T's total average adjusted basis in the assets used in the other two businesses (which are non-excepted trades or businesses) in Year 1 is $200x.
(ii)
Analysis.
$80x (($800x/($800x + $200x)) × $100x) of T's interest expense for Year 1 is allocable to T's electing real property trade or business and is not business interest expense subject to the section 163(j) limitation. The remaining $20x of T's interest expense is business interest expense for Year 1 that is subject to the section 163(j) limitation.
(3)
Asset used in more than one trade or business
—(i)
General rule.
If an asset is used in more than one trade or business during a determination period, as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the asset is allocated to each trade or business using the permissible methodology under this paragraph (c)(3) that most reasonably reflects the use of the asset in each trade or business during that determination period. An allocation methodology most reasonably reflects the use of the asset in each trade or business if it most properly reflects the proportionate benefit derived from the use of the asset in each trade or business. A taxpayer is not required to use the same allocation methodology for each type of asset used in a trade a business. Instead, a taxpayer may use different allocation methodologies for different types of assets used in a trade or business. If none of the permissible methodologies set forth in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section reasonably reflects the use of the asset in each trade or business, the taxpayer's basis in the asset is not taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c).
(ii)
Permissible methodologies for allocating asset basis between or among two or more trades or businesses.
Subject to the special rules in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (c)(5) of this section, a taxpayer's basis in an asset used in two or more trades or businesses during a determination period may be allocated to those trades or businesses based upon—
(A) The relative amounts of gross income that an asset generates, has generated, or may reasonably be expected to generate, within the meaning of § 1.861-9T(g)(3), with respect to the trades or businesses;
(B) If the asset is land or an inherently permanent structure, the relative amounts of physical space used by the trades or businesses; or
(C) If the trades or businesses generate the same unit of output, the relative amounts of output of those trades or businesses (for example, if an asset is used in two trades or businesses, one of which is an excepted regulated utility trade or business, and the other of which is a non-excepted regulated utility trade or business, the taxpayer may allocate basis in the asset based upon the relative amounts of kilowatt-hours generated by each trade or business).

Special rules
—(A)
Consistent allocation methodologies
—(

)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section, a taxpayer must maintain the same allocation methodology for a period of at least five taxable years.
(
2
)
Consent to change allocation methodology.
If a taxpayer has used the same allocation methodology for at least five taxable years, the taxpayers may change its method of allocation under paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section without the consent of the Commissioner. If a taxpayer has used the same allocation methodology for less than five taxable years, and if the taxpayer determines that a different allocation methodology properly reflects the proportionate benefit derived from the use of assets in its trades or businesses, the taxpayer may change its method of allocation under paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section only with the consent of the Commissioner. To obtain consent, a taxpayer
must submit a request for a letter ruling under the applicable administrative procedures, and consent will be granted only in extraordinary circumstances.
(B)
De minimis exception.
If at least 90 percent of the taxpayer's basis in an asset would be allocated to either excepted trades or businesses or non-excepted trades or businesses during a determination period pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3), the taxpayer's entire basis in the asset for the determination period must be allocated to either excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses, respectively. This rule applies before the application of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(C)
Allocations of excepted regulated utility trades or businesses
—(
1
)
In general.
Except as provided in the de minimis rule in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C)(
3
) of this section, a taxpayer is engaged in an excepted regulated utility trade or business only to the extent that the taxpayer is engaged in an excepted regulated utility trade or business described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i)(A), (B), or (C), and any remaining utility trade or business is a non-excepted trade or business. Thus, for example, electricity sold by a utility trade or business at rates not established or approved by an entity described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i)(A)(
2
) and not subject to an election under § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(iii) must be treated as electricity sold by a non-excepted regulated utility trade or business. The taxpayer must allocate under this paragraph (c) the basis of assets used in the utility trade or business between its excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses.
(

)
Permissible method for allocating asset basis for utility trades or businesses.
In the case of a utility trade or business described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section, and except as provided in the de minimis rule in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C)(
3
) of this section, the method described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section is the only permissible method under this paragraph (c)(3) for allocating the taxpayer's basis in assets used in both the excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses of selling or furnishing the items described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i)(A)(
1
).
(

)
De minimis rule for excepted utility trades or businesses.
If a taxpayer is engaged in a utility trade or business described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section, and if at least 90 percent of the items described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i)(A)(
1
) are furnished or sold by trades or businesses described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i)(A), (B) or (C), the taxpayer's entire trade or business is an excepted regulated utility trade or business, and paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section does not apply. This rule applies before the application of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.
(
4
)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C):
(
i
)
Facts.
X, a C corporation, is engaged in the trade or business of generating electrical energy. During each determination period in the taxable year, 80 percent of the megawatt-hours generated in the electricity generation trade or business is sold at rates negotiated with the purchaser, and with respect to which X filed a schedule of rates with a public utility commission. The public utility commission has the authority to take action on the filed schedule of rates, but if no action is taken, the rules governing the public utility commission explicitly state that the public utility commission is deemed to have approved the rates. The public utility has taken no action with respect to the negotiated rate. The remaining 20 percent of the megawatt-hours is sold on the wholesale market at rates not established or subject to approval by a regulator described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i)(A)(
2
). X has not made an election under § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(iii). None of the assets used in X's utility generation trade or business are used in any other trade or business.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
For purposes of section 163(j), under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section, 80 percent of X's electricity generation business is an excepted regulated utility trade or business, because the rate for the sale of the electricity was subject to approval by a regulator described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i)(A)(
2
). The remaining 20 percent of X's business is a non-excepted utility trade or business. Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section, X must allocate 80 percent of the basis of
the assets used in its utility business to excepted trades or business and the remaining 20 percent of the basis in the assets to non-excepted trades or businesses.
(D)
Special allocation rule for real property trades or businesses subject to special anti-abuse rule
—(
1
)
In general.
In the case of a trade or business that leases real property subject to an arrangement described in § 1.163(j)-9(j)(1), including trades or businesses to which the look-through exception in § 1.163(j)-9(j)(2)(ii) applies, the taxpayer must allocate under this paragraph (c)(3) the basis of property used in both the excepted and non-excepted portions of its trade or business, as determined under § 1.163(j)-9(j)(3).
(
2
)
Allocation methodology for real property.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(D), a taxpayer must allocate the basis of real property leased under an arrangement described in § 1.163(j)-9(j)(1) or (j)(2)(i) between the excepted and non-excepted portions of the real property trade or business based on the relative fair market rental value of the real property that is attributable to the excepted and non-excepted portions of the trade or business, respectively.
(
3
)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(D):
(
i
)
Facts.
X and Y are domestic C corporations under common control within the meaning of section 267(b), but neither X nor Y are members of a consolidated group. The small business exemption in § 1.163(j)-2(d) does not apply to X or Y. X owns an office building and leases the entire building to Y. Y subleases 80 percent of the office building, measured by fair market rental value, to a related party. Y subleases the remaining 20 percent of the building to unrelated third parties. X also owns depreciable scaffolding equipment, which it uses to clean all of the building's windows as part of its leasing arrangement with Y.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Under § 1.163(j)-9(j)(2)(ii), X is eligible to make an election for 20 percent of its business of leasing the office building to be an electing real property trade or business. Assuming X makes such an election, X must allocate the basis of assets used in both the excepted and non-excepted portions of its leasing trade or business under this paragraph (c). Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(D)(
2
) of this section, X must allocate the basis of the office building based on the relative fair market value attributable to the excepted and non-excepted portions of its leasing business. Therefore, X must allocate 20 percent of the basis of the building to the excepted portion of its leasing business, and it must allocate the remaining 80 percent of the building to the non-excepted portion of its leasing business. Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(D)(
2
) of this section, X may use one of the allocation methods described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to allocate the basis of its scaffolding equipment between the excepted and non-excepted portions of its leasing trade or business.
(4)
Disallowed business interest expense carryforwards; floor plan financing interest expense.
Disallowed business interest expense carryforwards (which were treated as allocable to a non-excepted trade or business in a prior taxable year) are not re-allocated between non-excepted and excepted trades or businesses in a succeeding taxable year. Instead, the carryforwards continue to be treated as allocable to a non-excepted trade or business. Floor plan financing interest expense also is not subject to allocation between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses (see § 1.163(j)-1(b)(19)) and is always treated as allocable to non-excepted trades or businesses.
(5)
Additional rules relating to basis
—(i)
Calculation of adjusted basis
—(A)
Non-depreciable property other than land.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(E) of this section, for purposes of this section, the adjusted basis of an asset other than land with respect to which no deduction is allowable under section 167, former section 168, or section 197, as applicable, is the adjusted basis of the asset for determining gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of that asset as provided in § 1.1011-1. Self-created intangible assets are not taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c).
(B)
Depreciable property other than inherently permanent structures.
For purposes of this section, the adjusted basis
of any tangible asset with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 167, other than inherently permanent structures, is determined by using the alternative depreciation system under section 168(g) before any application of the additional first-year depreciation deduction (for example, under section 168(k) or (m)), and the adjusted basis of any tangible asset with respect to which a deduction is allowable under former section 168, other than inherently permanent structures, is determined by using the taxpayer's method of computing depreciation for the asset under former section 168. The depreciation deduction with respect to the property described in this paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) is allocated ratably to each day during the period in the taxable year to which the depreciation relates. A change to the alternative depreciation system should be determined in a manner similar to that in § 1.168(i)-4(d)(4) or (d)(5)(ii)(B), as applicable.
(C)
Special rule for land and inherently permanent structures.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(E) of this section, for purposes of this section, the adjusted basis of any asset that is land, including nondepreciable improvements to land, or an inherently permanent structure is its unadjusted basis.
(D)
Depreciable or amortizable intangible property and depreciable income forecast method property.
For purposes of this section, the adjusted basis of any intangible asset with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 167 or 197, as applicable, is determined in accordance with section 167 or 197, as applicable, and the adjusted basis of any asset described in section 167(g)(6) for which a deduction is allowable under section 167 is determined in accordance with section 167(g). The adjusted basis of any intangible asset under this paragraph (c)(5)(i)(D) is determined before any application of the additional first-year depreciation deduction. The depreciation or amortization deduction with respect to the property described in this paragraph (c)(5)(i)(D) is allocated ratably to each day during the period in the taxable year to which the depreciation or amortization relates.
(E)
Assets not yet used in a trade or business.
Assets that have been acquired or that are under development but that are not yet used in a trade or business are not taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c). For example, construction works in progress (such as buildings, airplanes, or ships) are not taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c). Similarly, land acquired by a taxpayer for construction of a building by the taxpayer to be used in a trade or business is not taken into account for purposes of under this paragraph (c) until the building is placed in service. This rule does not apply to interests in a partnership or stock in a corporation.
(F)
Trusts established to fund specific liabilities.
Trusts required to fund specific liabilities (for example, pension trusts, and nuclear decommissioning funds (including, but not limited to, those funds for which an election is made under section 468A)) are not taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c).
(G)
Inherently permanent structure.
For purposes of this section, the term
inherently permanent structure
has the meaning provided in § 1.856-10(d)(2).
(ii)

)
Calculation of asset basis.
For purposes of this section, a partner's interest in a partnership is treated as an asset of the partner. For these purposes, the partner's adjusted basis in a partnership interest is reduced, but not below zero, by the partner's share of partnership liabilities, as determined under section 752, and is further reduced as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
)(
iii
) of this section. If a partner elects or is required to apply the rules in this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) to look through to a partnership's basis in the partnership's assets, the partner's basis in the partnership interest is adjusted to the extent of the partner's share of any adjustments to the basis of the partnership's assets required pursuant to the rules in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section.

Allocation of asset basis
—(

)
In general.
For purposes of determining the extent to which a partner's adjusted basis in its partnership interest is allocable to an excepted or non-excepted
trade or business, the partner may look through to such partner's share of the partnership's basis in the partnership's assets, taking into account any adjustments under sections 734(b) and 743(b), and adjusted to the extent required under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, such partner's share of partnership assets is determined using a reasonable method taking into account special allocations under section 704(b). Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(7) of this section, if a partner's direct and indirect interest in a partnership is greater than or equal to 80 percent of the partnership's capital or profits, the partner must apply the rules in this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
) to look through to the partnership's basis in the partnership's assets. If a partner elects or is required to apply the rules in this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
) to look through to a partnership's basis in the partnership's assets, the partner allocates the basis of its partnership interest between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses based on the ratio in which the partner's share of the partnership's adjusted tax basis in its trade or business assets is allocated between excepted and non-excepted trade or business assets.

De minimis rule.
If, after applying paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A)(

)(
iii
) of this section, at least 90 percent of a partner's share of a partnership's basis in its assets (including adjustments under sections 734(b) and 743(b)) is allocable to either excepted trades or businesses or non-excepted trades or businesses, without regard to assets not properly allocable to a trade or business, the partner's entire basis in its partnership interest is treated as allocable to either excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses, respectively. For purposes of the preceding sentence, such partner's share of partnership assets is determined using a reasonable method taking into account special allocations under section 704(b).
(
iii
)
Partnership assets not properly allocable to a trade or business.
For purposes of applying paragraphs (c)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
)(
i
) and (
ii
) of this section to a partner that is a C corporation or tax-exempt corporation, such partner's share of a partnership's assets that are not properly allocable to a trade or business is treated as properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business of such partner. However, if the partnership made an election under § 1.163(j)-9(b) or § 1.163(j)-9(h) with respect to an asset or activity, the assets (or assets related to such activities) are treated as properly allocable to an excepted trade or business of such partner. See, for example, an election under § 1.163(j)-9(h) for an asset or an election under § 1.163(j)-9(b) with respect to activities described in § 1.163(j)-9(b)(2)(ii). For a partner other than a C corporation or tax-exempt corporation, a partnership's assets that are not properly allocable to a trade or business are treated as neither excepted nor non-excepted trade or business assets; instead, such partner's adjusted basis in its partnership interest is decreased by that partner's share of the excess of the partnership's basis in those assets over the partnership's debt that is traced to such assets in accordance with § 1.163-8T, and it is increased by that partner's share of the excess of the partnership's debt that is traced to such assets in accordance with § 1.163-8T over the partnership's basis in those assets. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the partnership's asset basis in property not allocable to a trade or business is adjusted pursuant to the rules in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
)(
iii
), such partner's share of a partnership's assets is determined under a reasonable method taking into account special allocations under section 704(b).

2
)(
i
) of this section or is precluded by paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section from applying such partnership look-through rule, the partner generally will treat its basis in the partnership interest as either an asset held for investment or a non-excepted trade or business asset as determined under section 163(d). If a partner that is
a C corporation or a tax-exempt corporation chooses not to look through to the partnership's basis in the partnership's assets under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A)(

Allocation of asset basis.
If a shareholder satisfies the minimum ownership threshold in paragraph (c)(7) of this section for stock in a domestic non-consolidated C corporation, and if dividends paid on such stock would not be included in the shareholder's investment income under section 163(d)(4)(B), then, for purposes of determining the extent to which the shareholder's basis in the stock is allocable to an excepted or non-excepted trade or business, the shareholder must look through to the corporation's basis in the corporation's assets, adjusted to the extent required under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section. If a shareholder does not satisfy the minimum ownership threshold in paragraph (c)(7) of this section for stock in a domestic non-consolidated C corporation, but the shareholder's direct and indirect interest in such corporation is greater than or equal to 80 percent by value, and if dividends paid on such stock would not be included in the shareholder's investment income under section 163(d)(4)(B), then, for purposes of determining the extent to which the shareholder's basis in the stock is allocable to an excepted or non-excepted trade or business, the shareholder may look through to the corporation's basis in the corporation's assets, adjusted to the extent required under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, indirect stock ownership is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of section 318(a).

De minimis rule.
If at least 90 percent of the domestic non-consolidated C corporation's basis in the corporation's assets is allocable to either excepted trades or businesses or non-excepted trades or businesses, the shareholder's entire interest in the corporation's stock is treated as allocable to either excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses, respectively.

i
) of this section, the shareholder generally will treat its entire basis in the corporation's stock as an asset held for investment. If a shareholder that is a C corporation or a tax-exempt corporation is ineligible to look through or chooses not to look through to a corporation's basis in its assets under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B)(

If a shareholder applies the
asset basis look-through approach, it must do so for all domestic non-consolidated C corporations for which the shareholder is eligible to use this approach, and it must report its use of this approach on the information statement described in paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section. The shareholder also must continue to use the asset basis look-through approach in all future taxable years in which the shareholder is eligible to use this approach.

Calculation of asset basis.
For purposes of this section, a shareholder's share of stock in an S corporation is treated as an asset of the shareholder. Additionally, for these purposes, the shareholder's adjusted basis in a share of S corporation stock is adjusted to take into account the modifications in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section with respect to the assets of the S corporation (for example, a shareholder's adjusted basis in its S corporation stock is increased by the shareholder's share of depreciation with respect to an inherently permanent structure owned by the S corporation).

Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(7) of this section, if a shareholder's direct and indirect interest in an S corporation is greater than or equal to 80 percent of the S corporation's stock by vote and value, the shareholder must apply the rules in this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B)(

) to look through to the S corporation's basis in the S corporation's assets. For these purposes, indirect stock ownership is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of section 318(a).
(
iii
)
De minimis rule.
If at least 90 percent of a shareholder's share of an S corporation's basis in its assets is allocable to either excepted trades or businesses or non-excepted trades or businesses, the shareholder's entire basis in its S corporation stock is treated as allocable to either excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses, respectively.
(
iv
)
Inapplicability of S corporation look-through rule.
If a shareholder chooses not to look through to the S corporation's basis in the S corporation's assets under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B)(
3
)(
ii
) of this section or is precluded by paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section from applying such S corporation look-through rule, the shareholder will treat its basis in the S corporation stock as either an asset held for investment or a non-excepted trade or business asset as determined under section 163(d).
(C)
Stock in relevant foreign corporations
—(
1
)
In general.
The rules applicable to domestic non-consolidated C corporations in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section also apply to relevant foreign corporations (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(33)).
(
2
)
Special rule for CFC utilities.
Solely for purposes of applying the rules in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, a utility trade or business conducted by an applicable CFC is treated as an excepted regulated utility trade or business, but only to the extent that the applicable CFC sells or furnishes the items described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i)(A)(
1
) pursuant to rates established or approved by an entity described in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i)(A)(
2
), a foreign government, a public service or public utility commission or other similar body of any foreign government, or the governing or ratemaking body of a foreign electric cooperative. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(C)(
2
), the term
foreign government
means any foreign government, any political subdivision of a foreign government, or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of any one of the foregoing within the meaning of § 1.1471-6(b).
(D)
Limitations on application of look-through rules
—(
1
)
Inapplicability of look-through rule to partnerships or non-consolidated C corporations to which the small business exemption applies.
A taxpayer may not apply the look-through rules in paragraphs (b)(3) and
(c)(5)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) of this section to a partnership, S corporation, or non-consolidated C corporation that is eligible for the small business exemption under section 163(j)(3) and § 1.163(j)-2(d)(1), unless the partnership, S corporation, or non-consolidated C corporation elects under § 1.163(j)-9 for a trade or business to be an electing real property trade or business or an electing farming business.
(E)
Tiered entities.
If a taxpayer applies the look-through rules of this paragraph (c)(5)(ii), the taxpayer must do so for all lower-tier entities with respect to which the taxpayer satisfies, directly or indirectly, the minimum ownership threshold in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, subject to the limitation in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section, beginning with the lowest-tier entity.
(
2
)
Limitation on application of look-through rule to C corporations.
Except as provided in § 1.163(j)-9(h)(4)(iii) and (iv) (for a REIT or a partnership making the election under § 1.163(j)-9(h)(1) or (7), respectively), for purposes of applying the look-through rules in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section to a non-consolidated C corporation (upper-tier entity), that upper-tier entity may not apply these look-through rules to a lower-tier non-consolidated C corporation if a principal purpose for borrowing funds at the upper-tier entity level or adding an upper-tier or lower-tier entity to the ownership structure is increasing the amount of the taxpayer's basis allocable to excepted trades or businesses. For example, P wholly and directly owns S1 (the upper-tier entity), which wholly and directly owns S2. Each of S1 and S2 is a non-consolidated C corporation to which the small business exemption does not apply, and S2 is engaged in an excepted trade or business. With a principal purpose of increasing the amount of basis allocable to its excepted trades or businesses, P has S1 (rather than S2) borrow funds from a third party. S1 may not look through the stock of S2 (and may not apply the asset basis look-through rule described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B)(
2
)(
iv
) of this section) for purposes of P's allocation of its basis in its S1 stock between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses; instead, S1 must treat its stock in S2 as an asset used in a non-excepted trade or business for that purpose. However, S1 may look through the stock of S2 for purposes of S1's allocation of its basis in its S2 stock between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses.
(iii)
Cash and cash equivalents and customer receivables.
Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this paragraph (c)(5)(iii), a taxpayer's basis in its cash and cash equivalents and customer receivables is not taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c). This rule also applies to a lower-tier entity if a taxpayer looks through to the assets of that entity under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5)(iii), the term
cash and cash equivalents
includes cash, foreign currency, commercial paper, any interest in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) and regulated as a money market fund under 17 CFR 270.2a-7 (Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act), any obligation of a government, and any derivative that is substantially secured by an obligation of a government, or any similar asset. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5)(iii), a
derivative
is a derivative described in section 59A(h)(4)(A), without regard to section 59A(h)(4)(C). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5)(iii), the term
government
means the United States or any agency or instrumentality of the United States; a State, a territory, a possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision thereof within the meaning of section 103 and § 1.103-1; or any foreign government, any political subdivision of a foreign government, or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of any one of the foregoing within the meaning of § 1.1471-6(b). This paragraph (c)(5)(iii) does not apply to an entity that qualifies as a financial services entity as described in § 1.904-4(e)(3).
(iv)
Deemed asset sale.
Solely for purposes of determining the amount of basis allocable to excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses under this section, an election under section 336, 338, or 754, as applicable, is deemed to
have been made for any acquisition of corporate stock or partnership interests with respect to which the taxpayer demonstrates, in the information statement required by paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B) of this section, that the acquisition qualified for such an election and that, immediately before the acquisition, the acquired entity had a regulatory liability for deferred taxes recorded on its books with respect to property predominantly used in an excepted regulated utility trade or business. Any additional basis taken into account under this rule is reduced ratably over a 15-year period beginning with the month of the acquisition and is not subject to the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (c)(8) of this section.
(v)
Other adjustments.
The Commissioner may make appropriate adjustments to prevent a taxpayer from intentionally and artificially increasing its basis in assets attributable to an excepted trade or business.
(6)
Determination dates; determination periods; reporting requirements
—(i)
Determination dates and determination periods
—(A)
Quarterly determination periods.
For purposes of this section, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(6)(i)(B) of this section, the term
determination date
means the last day of each quarter of the taxpayer's taxable year (and the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year, if the taxpayer has a short taxable year), and the term
determination period
means the period beginning the day after one determination date and ending on the next determination date.
(B)
Annual determination periods.
If a taxpayer satisfies the requirements of the last sentence of this paragraph (c)(6)(i)(B), the taxpayer may allocate asset basis for a taxable year based on the average of adjusted asset basis at the beginning of the year and the end of the year (annual determination method). For these purposes, the term
determination date
means the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year, and the term
determination period
has the same meaning as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A) of this section. A taxpayer may use the annual determination method for a taxable year only if the taxpayer demonstrates that its total adjusted basis (as determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section) at the end of the year in its assets used in its excepted trades or businesses, as a percentage of the taxpayer's total adjusted basis at the end of such year in all of its assets used in a trade or business, does not differ by more than 20 percent from such percentage at the beginning of the year.
(ii)
Application of look-through rules.
If a taxpayer that applies the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section has a different taxable year than the partnership or non-consolidated C corporation to which the taxpayer is applying those rules, then, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6), the taxpayer must use the most recent asset basis figures from the partnership or non-consolidated C corporation. For example, assume that PS1 is a partnership with a May 31 taxable year, and that C (a calendar-year C corporation that is ineligible to use the annual determination method for the taxable year) is a partner in PS1. PS1's determination dates are February 28, May 31, August 31, and November 30. In turn, C's determination dates are March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. If C looks through to PS1's basis in its assets under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, then, for purposes of determining the amount of C's asset basis that is attributable to its excepted and non-excepted businesses on March 31, C must use PS1's asset basis calculations for February 28.
(iii)
Reporting requirements
—(A)
Books and records.
A taxpayer must maintain books of account and other records and data as necessary to substantiate the taxpayer's use of an asset in an excepted trade or business and to substantiate any adjustments to asset basis for purposes of applying this paragraph (c). One indication that a particular asset is used in a particular trade or business is if the taxpayer maintains separate books and records for all of its excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses and can show the asset in the books and records of a particular excepted or non-excepted trade or business. For rules governing record retention, see § 1.6001-1.
(B)
Information statement.
Except as otherwise provided in publications,
forms, instructions, or other guidance, each taxpayer that is making an allocation under this paragraph (c), including any taxpayer that satisfies the de minimis rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, must prepare a statement titled “Section 163(j) Asset Basis Calculations” containing the information described in paragraphs (c)(6)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
7
) of this section and must attach the statement to its timely filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year:
(
1
) The taxpayer's adjusted basis in the assets used in its excepted and non-excepted businesses, determined as set forth in this section, including detailed information for the different groups of assets identified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (ii) and (d) of this section;
(
2
) The determination dates on which asset basis was measured during the taxable year;
(
3
) The names and taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) of all entities for which basis information is being provided, including partnerships and corporations if the taxpayer that owns an interest in a partnership or corporation looks through to the partnership's or corporation's basis in the partnership's or corporation's assets under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section. If the taxpayer is a member of a consolidated group, the name and TIN of the agent for the group, as defined in § 1.1502-77, must be provided, but the taxpayer need not provide the names and TINs of all other consolidated group members;
(
4
) Asset basis information for corporations or partnerships if the taxpayer looks through to the corporation's or partnership's basis in the corporation's or partnership's assets under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section;
(
5
) A summary of the method or methods used to determine asset basis in property used in both excepted and non-excepted businesses, as well as information regarding any deemed sale under paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section;
(
6
) Whether the taxpayer used the historical approach or the effective date approach for all of its disallowed disqualified interest; and
(
7
) If the taxpayer changed its methodology for allocating asset basis between or among two or more trades or businesses under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a statement that the taxpayer has changed the allocation methodology and a description of the new methodology or, if the taxpayer is required to request consent for the allocation methodology change under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section, a statement that the request has been or will be filed and a description of the methodology change.
(iv)
Failure to file statement.
If a taxpayer fails to file the statement described in paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section or files a statement that does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section, the Commissioner may treat the taxpayer as if all of its interest expense is properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business, unless the taxpayer shows that there was reasonable cause for failing to comply with, and the taxpayer acted in good faith with respect to, the requirements of paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section, taking into account all pertinent facts and circumstances.
(7)
Ownership threshold for look-through rules
—(i)
Corporations
—(A)
Asset basis.
For purposes of this section, a shareholder must look through to the assets of a domestic non-consolidated C corporation or a relevant foreign corporation under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section if the shareholder's direct and indirect interest in the corporation satisfies the ownership requirements of section 1504(a)(2). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A), indirect stock ownership is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of section 318(a). A shareholder may look through to the assets of an S corporation under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section for purposes of allocating the shareholder's basis in its stock in the S corporation between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses regardless of the shareholder's direct and indirect interest in the S corporation.
(B)
Dividends.
A shareholder must look through to the activities of a domestic non-consolidated C corporation or a relevant foreign corporation under paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the
shareholder's direct interest in the corporation satisfies the ownership requirements of section 1504(a)(2). A shareholder may look through to the activities of a domestic non-consolidated C corporation or an applicable CFC under paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the shareholder's direct interest in the corporation is greater than or equal to 80 percent by value. A shareholder may look through to the activities of an S corporation under paragraph (b)(3) of this section regardless of the shareholder's direct interest in the S corporation.
(ii)
Partnerships.
A partner may look through to the assets of a partnership under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section for purposes of allocating the partner's basis in its partnership interest between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses regardless of the partner's direct and indirect interest in the partnership.
(iii)
Inapplicability of look-through rule.
For circumstances in which a taxpayer that satisfies the ownership threshold in this paragraph (c)(7) may not apply the look-through rules in paragraphs (b)(3) and (c)(5)(ii) of this section, see paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section.
(8)
Anti-abuse rule.
If a principal purpose for the acquisition, disposition, or change in use of an asset was to artificially shift the amount of basis allocable to excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses on a determination date, the additional basis or change in use will not be taken into account for purposes of this section. For example, if an asset is used in a non-excepted trade or business for most of the taxable year, and if the taxpayer begins using the asset in an excepted trade or business towards the end of the year with a principal purpose of shifting the amount of basis in the asset that is allocable to the excepted trade or business, the change in use is disregarded for purposes of this section. A purpose may be a principal purpose even though it is outweighed by other purposes (taken together or separately). In determining whether a taxpayer has a principal purpose described in this paragraph (c)(8), factors to be considered include, for example, the following: The business purpose for the acquisition, disposition, or change in use; the length of time the asset was used in a trade or business; whether the asset was acquired from a related person; and whether the taxpayer's aggregate basis in its assets increased or decreased temporarily on or around a determination date. A principal purpose is presumed to be present in any case in which the acquisition, disposition, or change in use lacks a substantial business purpose and increases the taxpayer's basis in assets used in its excepted trades or businesses by more than 10 percent during the taxable year.
(d)
Direct allocations
—(1)
In general.
It is not necessary to allocate interest expense under this paragraph (d) if all of the taxpayer's interest expense is allocable to excepted trades or businesses or if all of the taxpayer's interest expense is allocable to non-excepted trades or businesses.
(2)
Qualified nonrecourse indebtedness.
For purposes of this section, a taxpayer with qualified nonrecourse indebtedness must directly allocate interest expense from the indebtedness to the taxpayer's assets in the manner and to the extent provided in § 1.861-10T(b). For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the term
qualified nonrecourse indebtedness
has the meaning provided in § 1.861-10T(b), except that the term
cash flow from the property
(within the meaning of § 1.861-10T(b)(3)(i)) includes revenue derived from the sale or lease of inventory or similar property with respect to an excepted regulated utility trade or business or a non-excepted regulated utility trade or business.
(3)
Assets used in more than one trade or business.
If an asset is used in more than one trade or business, the taxpayer must apply the rules in paragraph (c)(3) of this section to determine the extent to which interest that is directly allocated under this paragraph (d) is allocable to excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses.
(4)
Adjustments to basis of assets to account for direct allocations.
In determining the amount of a taxpayer's basis in the assets used in its excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, adjustments must be made to reflect direct allocations under this
paragraph (d). These adjustments consist of reductions in the taxpayer's basis in its assets for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section to reflect assets to which interest expense is directly allocated under this paragraph (d). The amount of the taxpayer's basis in these assets must be reduced, but not below zero, by the amount of qualified nonrecourse indebtedness secured by these assets. These adjustments must be made before the taxpayer averages the adjusted basis in its assets as determined on each determination date during the taxable year.
(5)
Example: Direct allocation of interest expense
—(i)
Facts.
T conducts an electing real property trade or business (Business X) and operates a retail store that is a non-excepted trade or business (Business Y). In Year 1, T issues Note A to a third party in exchange for $1,000x for the purpose of acquiring Building B. Note A is qualified nonrecourse indebtedness (within the meaning of § 1.861-10T(b)) secured by Building B. T then uses those funds to acquire Building B for $1,200x, and T uses Building B in Business X. During Year 1, T pays $500x of interest, of which $100x is interest payments on Note A. For Year 1, T's basis in its assets used in Business X (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section) is $3,600x (excluding cash and cash equivalents), and T's basis in its assets used in Business Y (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section) is $800x (excluding cash and cash equivalents). Each of Business X and Business Y also has $100x of cash and cash equivalents.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because Note A is qualified nonrecourse indebtedness that is secured by Building B, in allocating interest expense between Businesses X and Y, T first must directly allocate the $100x of interest expense it paid with respect to Note A to Business X in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Thereafter, T must allocate the remaining $400x of interest expense between Businesses X and Y under paragraph (c) of this section. After excluding $1,000x of T's basis in Building B to reflect the amount of Note A (see paragraph (d)(4) of this section), and without regard to T's $200x of cash and cash equivalents (see paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section), T's basis in its assets used in Businesses X and Y is $2,600x and $800x (76.5 percent and 23.5 percent), respectively. Thus, $306x of the remaining $400x of interest expense would be allocated to Business X, and $94x would be allocated to Business Y.
(e)
Examples.
The examples in this paragraph (e) illustrate the principles of this section. For purposes of these examples, no taxpayer is eligible for the small business exemption under section 163(j)(3) and § 1.163(j)-2(d), no taxpayer has floor plan financing interest expense, and no taxpayer has qualified nonrecourse indebtedness within the meaning of § 1.861-10T(b).
(1)
Example 1: Interest allocation within a consolidated group
—(i)
Facts.
S is a member of a consolidated group of which P is the common parent. P conducts an electing real property trade or business (Business X), and S conducts a non-excepted trade or business (Business Y). In Year 1, P pays or accrues (without regard to section 163(j)) $35x of interest expense and receives $10x of interest income, and S pays or accrues (without regard to section 163(j)) $115x of interest expense and receives $5x of interest income (for a total of $150x of interest expense and $15x of interest income). For purposes of this example, assume that, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, $30x of the P group's interest expense and $3x of the P group's interest income is allocable to Business X, and the remaining $120x of interest expense and $12x of interest income is allocable to Business Y.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 20 percent of the P group's Year 1 interest expense ($30x/$150x) and interest income ($3x/$15x) is allocable to an excepted trade or business. Thus, $7x ($35x × 20 percent) of P's interest expense and $2x ($10x × 20 percent) of P's interest income is allocable to an excepted trade or business. The remaining $28x of P's interest expense is business interest expense subject to the section 163(j) limitation, and the remaining $8x of P's interest income is business interest income that increases the group's section 163(j) limitation. In turn, $23x ($115x × 20 percent) of S's interest expense and $1x ($5x × 20 percent) of S's interest income is allocable to an
excepted trade or business. The remaining $92x of S's interest expense is business interest expense subject to the section 163(j) limitation, and the remaining $4x of S's interest income is business interest income that increases the group's section 163(j) limitation.
(2)
Example 2: Interest allocation within a consolidated group with assets used in more than one trade or business
—(i)
Facts.
S is a member of a consolidated group of which P is the common parent. P conducts an electing real property trade or business (Business X), and S conducts a non-excepted trade or business (Business Y). In Year 1, P pays or accrues (without regard to section 163(j)) $50x of interest expense, and S pays or accrues $100x of interest expense (without regard to section 163(j)). P leases 40 percent of space in Building V (which P owns) to S for use in Business Y, and P leases the remaining 60 percent of space in Building V to third parties. For purposes of allocating interest expense under paragraph (c) of this section, the P group's basis in its assets (excluding Building V) used in Businesses X and Y is $180x and $620x, respectively. The P group's basis in Building V for purposes of allocating interest expense under paragraph (c) of this section is $200x.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the P group's basis in Building V ($200x) is allocated to excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses in accordance with the use of space by Business Y (40 percent) and Business X (the remainder, or 60 percent). Accordingly, $120x of the basis in Building V is allocated to excepted trades or businesses (60 percent × $200x), and $80x is allocated to non-excepted trades or businesses (40 percent × $200x). After allocating the basis in Building V, the P group's total basis in the assets used in excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses is $300x and $700x, respectively. Under paragraphs (a)(4) and (c) of this section, 30 percent ($300x/$1,000x) of the P group's Year 1 interest expense is properly allocable to an excepted trade or business. Thus, $15x ($50x × 30 percent) of P's interest expense is properly allocable to an excepted trade or business, and the remaining $35x of P's interest expense is business interest expense subject to the section 163(j) limitation. In turn, $30x ($100x × 30 percent) of S's interest expense is properly allocable to an excepted trade or business, and the remaining $70x of S's interest expense is business interest expense subject to the section 163(j) limitation.
(3)
Example 3: Application of look-through rules
—(i)
Facts.
(A) Each of Corp A, Corp B, Corp C, and Corp D is a domestic calendar-year corporation that is not a member of a consolidated group. Corp A owns 100 percent of the stock of Corp C; the basis of Corp A's stock in Corp C is $500x. Corp C owns 10 percent of the interests in PS1 (a domestic partnership), and Corp B owns the remaining 90 percent. Corp C's basis in its PS1 interests is $25x; Corp B's basis in its PS1 interests is $225x. PS1 owns 100 percent of the stock of Corp D; the basis of PS1's stock in Corp D is $1,000x. Corp A and Corp B are owned by unrelated, non-overlapping shareholders.
(B) In 2021, Corp C was engaged solely in a non-excepted trade or business. That same year, PS1's only activity was holding Corp D stock. In turn, Corp D was engaged in both an electing farming business and a non-excepted trade or business. Under the allocation rules in paragraph (c) of this section, 50 percent of Corp D's asset basis in 2021 was allocable to the electing farming business, and the remaining 50 percent was allocable to the non-excepted trade or business.
(C) Corp A and Corp B each paid or accrued (without regard to section 163(j)) $150x of interest expense allocable to a trade or business. Corp A's trade or business was an excepted trade or business, and Corp B's trade or business was a non-excepted trade or business. Corp A's basis in the assets used in its trade or business was $100x, and Corp B's basis in the assets used in its trade or business was $112.5x.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) As provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(E) of this section, if a taxpayer applies the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, the taxpayer must begin with the lowest-tier entity to which it is eligible to apply the look-through rules. Corp A directly owns 100 percent of the stock of Corp C; thus, Corp A satisfies the 80 percent minimum ownership
threshold with respect to Corp C. Corp A also owns 10 percent of the interests in PS1. There is no minimum ownership threshold for partnerships; thus, Corp A may apply the look-through rules to PS1. However, Corp A does not directly or indirectly own at least 80 percent of the stock of Corp D; thus, Corp A cannot look through its indirect interest in Corp D. In turn, Corp B directly owns 90 percent of the interests in PS1, and Corp B indirectly owns at least 80 percent of the stock of Corp D. Thus, Corp B must apply the look-through rules to PS1 and Corp D.
(B) From Corp A's perspective, PS1 is not engaged in a trade or business for purposes of section 163(j); instead, PS1 is merely holding its Corp D stock as an investment. Under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section, if a partnership is not engaged in a trade or business, then its C corporation partner must treat its entire basis in the partnership interest as allocable to a non-excepted trade or business. Thus, for purposes of Corp A's application of the look-through rules, Corp C's entire basis in its PS1 interest ($25x) is allocable to a non-excepted trade or business. Corp C's basis in its other assets also is allocable to a non-excepted trade or business (the only trade or business in which Corp C is engaged). Thus, under paragraph (c) of this section, Corp A's $500x basis in its Corp C stock is allocable entirely to a non-excepted trade or business. Corp A's $100x basis in its other business assets is allocable to an excepted trade or business. Thus,
5/6
(or $125x) of Corp A's $150x of interest expense is properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business and is business interest expense subject to the section 163(j) limitation, and the remaining $25x of Corp A's $150x of interest expense is allocable to an excepted trade or business and is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation.
(C) From Corp B's perspective, PS1 must look through its stock in Corp D to determine the extent to which PS1's basis in the stock is allocable to an excepted or non-excepted trade or business. Half of Corp D's basis in its assets is allocable to an excepted trade or business, and the other half is allocable to a non-excepted trade or business. Thus, from Corp B's perspective, $500x of PS1's basis in its Corp D stock (PS1's only asset) is allocable to an excepted trade or business, and the other half is allocable to a non-excepted trade or business. Corp B's basis in its PS1 interests is $225x. Applying the look-through rules to Corp B's PS1 interests, $112.5x of Corp B's basis in its PS1 interests is allocable to an excepted trade or business, and $112.5x of Corp B's basis in its PS1 interests is allocable to a non-excepted trade or business. Since Corp B's basis in the assets used in its non-excepted trade or business also was $112.5x, two-thirds of Corp B's interest expense ($100x) is properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business and is business interest expense subject to the section 163(j) limitation, and one-third of Corp B's interest expense ($50x) is allocable to an excepted trade or business and is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation.

Example 4: Excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses in a consolidated group
—(i)
Facts.
P is the common parent of a consolidated group of which A and B are the only other members. A conducts an electing real property trade or business (Business X), and B conducts a non-excepted trade or business (Business Y). In Year 1, A pays or accrues (without regard to section 163(j)) $50x of interest expense and earns $70x of gross income in the conduct of Business X, and B pays or accrues (without regard to section 163(j)) $100x of interest expense and earns $150x of gross income in the conduct of Business Y. B owns Building V, which it uses in Business Y. For purposes of allocating the P group's Year 1 business interest expense between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses under paragraph (c) of this section, the P group's basis in its assets (other than Building V) used in Businesses X and Y is $180x and $620x, respectively, and the P group's basis in Building V is $200x. At the end of Year 1, B sells Building V to a third party and realizes a gain of $60x in addition to the $150x of gross income B earned that year from the conduct of Business Y.
(ii)
Analysis.
(A) Under paragraphs (a)(4) and (c) of this section, the P group's basis in its assets used in its
trades or businesses is allocated between the P group's excepted trade or business (Business X) and its non-excepted trade or business (Business Y) as though these trades or businesses were conducted by a single corporation. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the P group's basis in its assets used in Businesses X and Y is $180x and $820x, respectively. Accordingly, 18 percent ($180x/$1,000x) of the P group's total interest expense ($150x) is properly allocable to an excepted trade or business ($27x), and the remaining 82 percent of the P group's total interest expense is business interest expense properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business ($123x).
(B) To determine the P group's section 163(j) limitation, paragraph (a) of this section requires that certain items of income and deduction be allocated to the excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses of the P group as though these trades or businesses were conducted by a single corporation. In Year 1, the P group's excepted trade or business (Business X) has gross income of $70x, and the P group's non-excepted trade or business (Business Y) has gross income of $150x. Because Building V was used exclusively in Business Y, the $60x of gain from the sale of Building V in Year 1 is attributed to Business Y under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The P group's section 163(j) limitation is $63x (30 percent × $210x), which allows the P group to deduct $63x of its $123x of business interest expense allocated to the P group's non-excepted trades or businesses. The group's $27x of interest expense that is allocable to excepted trades or businesses may be deducted without limitation under section 163(j).
(iii)
Intercompany transaction.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4
in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, except that A owns Building V and leases it to B in Year 1 for $20x for use in Business Y, and A sells Building V to a third party for a $60 gain at the end of Year 1. Under paragraphs (a)(4) and (c) of this section, all members of the P group are treated as a single corporation. As a result, the P group's basis in its assets used in its trades or businesses is allocated between the P group's excepted trade or business (Business X) and its non-excepted trade or business (Business Y) as though these trades or businesses were conducted by a single corporation. A lease between two divisions of a single corporation would produce no rental income or expense. Thus, the $20x of rent paid by B to A does not affect the P group's ATI. Moreover, under paragraph (c) of this section, Building V is an asset used in the P group's non-excepted trade or business (Business Y). Accordingly, although A owns Building V, the basis in Building V is added to the P group's basis in assets used in Business Y for purposes of allocating interest expense under paragraph (c) of this section. In the same vein, when A sells Building V to a third party at a gain of $60x, the gain is included in the P group's ATI because Building V was used in a non-excepted trade or business of the P group (Business Y) prior to its sale.
(5)
Example 5: Captive activities
—(i)
Facts.
S and T are members of a consolidated group of which P is the common parent. P conducts an electing real property trade or business (Business X), S conducts a non-excepted trade or business (Business Y), and T provides transportation services to Businesses X and Y but does not have any customers outside of the P group. For Year 1, T provides transportation services using a single bus with a basis of $120x.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, activities conducted by a consolidated group are treated as though those activities were conducted by a single corporation. Because the activities of T are limited to providing intercompany transportation services, T does not conduct a trade or business for purposes of section 163(j). Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, business interest expense is allocated to excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses based on the relative basis of the assets used in those businesses. The basis in T's only asset, a bus, is therefore allocated between Business X and Business Y according to the use of T's bus by these businesses. Business X uses one-third of T's services, and Business Y uses two-thirds of T's services. Thus, $40x of the basis of T's bus is allocated to Business X, and $80x of the
basis of T's bus is allocated to Business Y.
(6)
Example 6: Constructive ownership
—(i)
Facts.
P, S, T, and U are domestic C corporations that are not members of a consolidated group. P directly owns 80 percent of the stock of each of S and T as measured by total voting power and value; an unrelated third party, X, owns the remaining 20 percent. In turn, S and T directly own 15 percent and 80 percent, respectively, of the stock of U as measured by total voting power and value; P directly owns the remaining 5 percent. P conducts both excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses. S and T conduct only non-excepted trades or businesses, and U conducts both excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A) of this section, a shareholder must look through to the assets of a domestic non-consolidated C corporation for purposes of allocating the shareholder's basis in its stock in the corporation between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses if the shareholder's direct and indirect interest in the corporation satisfies the ownership requirements of section 1504(a)(2). For purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A) of this section, a shareholder's stock ownership is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of section 318(a). P directly owns 80 percent of each of S and T as measured by total voting power and value; thus, P must look through to the assets of S and T when allocating the basis in its stock of S and T. P directly owns 5 percent of the stock of U as measured by total voting power and value, and P constructively owns the other 95 percent; thus, P also must look through to U's assets when allocating the basis in its U stock. S directly owns 15 percent of the stock of U, and S constructively owns only 5 percent through P; thus, S cannot look through to U's assets when allocating the basis in its U stock. T directly owns 80 percent of the stock of U, and T constructively owns an additional 5 percent; thus, T must look through to U's assets when allocating the basis in its U stock.
(iii)
Dividend.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section, except that U distributes a $160x dividend pro rata to its shareholders. Thus, P receives $8x (5 percent of $160x) of the U dividend, S receives $24x (15 percent of $160x), and T receives $128x (80 percent of $160x). Under paragraph (c)(7)(i)(B) of this section, if a shareholder's direct interest in a corporation satisfies the ownership requirements of section 1504(a)(2), the shareholder must look through to the activities of a domestic non-consolidated C corporation in determining whether dividend income is from an excepted or non-excepted trade or business. The constructive ownership rules do not apply in allocating dividends under paragraph (c)(7)(i)(B) of this section. P directly owns 5 percent of the stock of U as measured by vote and value, and S directly owns 15 percent of the stock of U as measured by vote and value; thus, neither P nor S is required to apply the look-through rules in allocating its dividend income from U, and all such income is allocable to non-excepted trades or businesses. T directly owns 80 percent of the stock of U as measured by vote and value; thus, T must allocate its U dividend in accordance with the activities of U's excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses.
(7)
Example 7: Dispositions with a principal purpose of shifting basis
—(i)
Facts.
U and V are members of a consolidated group of which P is the common parent. U conducts an electing farming business (Business F), and V conducts a farm equipment leasing business (Business L) that is a non-excepted trade or business. After the end of a farming season, the P group, with a principal purpose of shifting basis from Business L to Business F, has V sell to U all off-lease farming equipment that previously was leased out as part of Business L. Immediately before the start of the next season, U sells the farming equipment back to V for use in Business L.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(8) of this section, in the case of a disposition of assets undertaken with a principal purpose of artificially shifting the amount of basis allocable to excepted or non-excepted trades or businesses on a determination date, the additional basis or change in use will not be taken
into account. Because V's sale of farming equipment to U for storage in Business F's facilities is undertaken with a principal purpose of shifting basis from Business L to Business F, the additional basis Business F receives from these transactions will not be taken into account for purposes of this section. Instead, the basis of the farming equipment will be allocated as though the farming equipment continued to be used in Business L.
(f)
Applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
This section applies to taxable years beginning on or after November 13, 2020. However, taxpayers and their related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), may choose to apply the rules of this section to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, so long as the taxpayers and their related parties consistently apply the rules of the section 163(j) regulations, and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.381(c)(20)-1, 1.382-1, 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, 1.383-0, 1.383-1, 1.469-9, 1.469-11, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-36, 1.1502-79, 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, and 1.383-1), and 1.1504-4, to that taxable year. Accordingly, for purposes of § 1.163(j)-10(c)(5), taxpayers make any change to the alternative depreciation system as of November 13, 2020, or if relying on the provisions of § 1.163(j)-10 in regulation project REG-106089-18 (83 FR 67490), as of December 28, 2018.
(2)
Paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D)(2).
The rules contained in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D)(
2
) of this section apply for taxable years beginning on or after March 22, 2021. However, taxpayers may choose to apply the rules in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D)(
2
) of this section to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before March 22, 2021, provided that those taxpayers and their related parties consistently apply all of the rules in the section 163(j) regulations as contained in T.D. 9905 (§§ 1.163(j)-0 through 1.163(j)-11, effective November 13, 2020) as modified by T.D. 9943 (effective January 13, 2021), and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.381(c)(20)-1, 1.382-1, 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, 1.383-0, 1.383-1, 1.469-9, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-79, 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, and 1.383-1), and 1.1504-4 contained in T.D. 9905 as modified by T.D. 9943, to that taxable year and each subsequent taxable year.
[T.D. 9905, 85 FR 56760, Sept. 14, 2020, as amended at T.D. 9943, 86 FR 5539, Jan. 19, 2021]
§ 1.163(j)-11
Transition rules.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides transition rules regarding the section 163(j) limitation. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules regarding the application of the section 163(j) limitation to a corporation that joins a consolidated group during a taxable year of the group beginning before January 1, 2018 and is subject to the section 163(j) limitation at the time of its change in status. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules regarding the treatment of carryforwards of disallowed disqualified interest.
(b)
Application of section 163(j) limitation if a corporation joins a consolidated group during a taxable year of the group beginning before January 1, 2018
—(1)
In general.
If a corporation (S) joins a consolidated group during a taxable year of the group beginning before January 1, 2018, and if S is subject to the section 163(j) limitation at the time of its change in status, then section 163(j) will apply to S's short taxable year that ends on the day of S's change in status, but section 163(j) will not apply to S's short taxable year that begins the next day (when S is a member of the acquiring consolidated group). Any business interest expense paid or accrued (without regard to section 163(j)) by S in its short taxable year ending on the day of S's change in status for which a deduction is disallowed under section 163(j) will be carried forward to the acquiring group's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017. Those disallowed business interest expense carryforwards may be subject to limitation under other provisions of these regulations (see, for example, § 1.163(j)-5(c), (d), (e), and (f)).
(2)
Example.
Acquiring Group is a consolidated group with a fiscal year end of November 30; Target is a stand-
alone calendar-year C corporation. On May 31, 2018, Acquiring Group acquires Target in a transaction that is not an ownership change for purposes of section 382. Acquiring Group is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation during its taxable year beginning December 1, 2017. As a result of the acquisition, Target has a short taxable year beginning January 1, 2018 and ending May 31, 2018. Target is subject to the section 163(j) limitation during this short taxable year. However, Target (as a member of Acquiring Group) is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation during Acquiring Group's taxable year ending November 30, 2018. Any disallowed business interest expense carryforwards from Target's taxable year ending May 31, 2018, will not be available for use in Acquiring Group's taxable year ending November 30, 2018. However, that disallowed business interest expense is carried forward to Acquiring Group's taxable year beginning December 1, 2018, and can be deducted by the group, subject to the separate return limitation year (SRLY) limitation. See § 1.163(j)-5(d).
(c)
Treatment of disallowed disqualified interest
—(1)
In general.
Disallowed disqualified interest is carried forward to the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017. Disallowed disqualified interest is subject to disallowance as a disallowed business interest expense carryforward under section 163(j) and § 1.163(j)-2 to the extent the interest is properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business under § 1.163(j)-10. Disallowed disqualified interest that is properly allocable to an excepted trade or business is not subject to the section 163(j) limitation. See § 1.163(j)-10(a)(6) for rules governing the allocation of disallowed disqualified interest between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses.
(2)
Earnings and profits.
A taxpayer may not reduce its earnings and profits in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, to reflect any disallowed disqualified interest carryforwards to the extent the payment or accrual of the disallowed disqualified interest reduced the earnings and profits of the taxpayer in a prior taxable year.
(3)
Disallowed disqualified interest of members of an affiliated group
—(i)
Scope.
This paragraph (c)(3)(i) applies to corporations that were treated as a single taxpayer under old section 163(j)(6)(C) and that had disallowed disqualified interest.
(ii)
Allocation of disallowed disqualified interest to members of the affiliated group
—(A)
In general.
Each member of the affiliated group is allocated its allocable share of the affiliated group's disallowed disqualified interest as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(
1
)
Allocable share of the affiliated group's disallowed disqualified interest.
The term
allocable share of the affiliated group's disallowed disqualified interest
means, with respect to any member of an affiliated group for the member's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, the product of the total amount of the disallowed disqualified interest of all members of the affiliated group under old section 163(j)(6)(C) and the member's disallowed disqualified interest ratio.
(
2
)
Disallowed disqualified interest ratio.
The term
disallowed disqualified interest ratio
means, with respect to any member of an affiliated group for the member's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, the ratio of the exempt related person interest expense of the member for the last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, to the sum of the amounts of exempt related person interest expense for all members of the affiliated group.
(
3
)
Exempt related person interest expense.
The term
exempt related person interest expense
means interest expense that is, or is treated as, paid or accrued by a domestic C corporation, or by a foreign corporation with income, gain, or loss that is effectively connected, or treated as effectively connected, with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, to—
(
i
) Any person related to the taxpayer, within the meaning of sections 267(b) or 707(b)(1), applying the constructive ownership and attribution rules of section 267(c), if no U.S. tax is imposed with respect to the interest
under subtitle A of the Code, determined without regard to net operating losses or net operating loss carryovers, and taking into account any applicable treaty obligation of the United States. For this purpose, interest that is subject to a reduced rate of tax under any treaty obligation of the United States applicable to the recipient is treated as, in part, subject to the statutory tax rate under sections 871 or 881 and, in part, not subject to tax, based on the proportion that the rate of tax under the treaty bears to the statutory tax rate. Thus, for purposes of section 163(j), if the statutory tax rate is 30 percent, and pursuant to a treaty U.S. tax is instead limited to a rate of 10 percent, two-thirds of the interest is considered interest not subject to U.S. tax under subtitle A of the Code;
(
ii
) A person that is not related to the taxpayer, within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1), applying the constructive ownership and attribution rules of section 267(c), with respect to indebtedness on which there is a disqualified guarantee, within the meaning of paragraph (6)(D) of old section 163(j), of such indebtedness, and no gross basis U.S. tax is imposed with respect to the interest. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B)(
3
)(
ii
), a
gross basis U.S. tax
means any tax imposed by this subtitle A of the Code that is determined by reference to the gross amount of any item of income without any reduction for any deduction allowed by subtitle A of the Code. Interest that is subject to a gross basis U.S. tax that is eligible for a reduced rate of tax under any treaty obligation of the United States applicable to the recipient is treated as, in part, subject to the statutory tax rate under section 871 or 881 and, in part, not subject to a gross basis U.S. tax, based on the proportion that the rate of tax under the treaty bears to the statutory tax rate. Thus, for purposes of section 163(j), if the statutory tax rate is 30 percent, and pursuant to a treaty U.S. tax is instead limited to a rate of 10 percent, two-thirds of the interest is considered interest not subject to a gross basis U.S. tax under subtitle A of the Code; or
(
iii
) A REIT, directly or indirectly, to the extent that the domestic C corporation, or a foreign corporation with income, gain, or loss that is effectively connected, or treated as effectively connected, with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, is a taxable REIT subsidiary, as defined in section 856(l), with respect to the REIT.
(iii)
Treatment of carryforwards.
The amount of disallowed disqualified interest allocated to a taxpayer pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section is treated in the same manner as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(4)
Application of section 382
—(i)
Ownership change occurring before
November 13, 2020—(A)
Pre-change loss.
For purposes of section 382(d)(3), unless the rules of § 1.382-2(a)(7) apply, disallowed disqualified interest is not a pre-change loss under § 1.382-2(a) subject to a section 382 limitation with regard to an ownership change on a change date occurring before November 13, 2020. But see section 382(h)(6)(B) (regarding built-in deduction items).
(B)
Loss corporation.
For purposes of section 382(k)(1), unless the rules of § 1.382-2(a)(7) apply, disallowed disqualified interest is not a carryforward of disallowed interest described in section 381(c)(20) with regard to an ownership change on a change date occurring before November 13, 2020. But see section 382(h)(6) (regarding built-in deductions).
(ii)
Ownership change occurring on or after
November 13, 2020—(A)
Pre-change loss.
For rules governing the treatment of disallowed disqualified interest as a pre-change loss for purposes of section 382 with regard to an ownership change on a change date occurring on or after November 13, 2020, see §§ 1.382-2(a)(2) and 1.382-6(c)(3).
(B)
Loss corporation.
For rules governing when disallowed disqualified interest causes a corporation to be a loss corporation with regard to an ownership change occurring on or after November 13, 2020, see § 1.382-2(a)(1)(i)(A).
(5)
Treatment of excess limitation from taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018.
No amount of excess limitation under old section 163(j)(2)(B) may be carried forward to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
(6)
Example: Members of an affiliated group
—(i)
Facts.
A, B, and C are calendar-year domestic C corporations that are members of an affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504(a)) that was treated as a single taxpayer under old section 163(j)(6)(C) and the proposed regulations in this part under old section 163(j) (see formerly proposed § 1.163(j)-5). For the taxable year ending December 31, 2017, the separately determined amounts of exempt related person interest expense of A, B, and C were $0, $600x, and $150x, respectively (for a total of $750x). The affiliated group has $200x of disallowed disqualified interest in that year.
(ii)
Analysis.
The affiliated group's disallowed disqualified interest expense for the 2017 taxable year ($200x) is allocated among A, B, and C based on the ratio of each member's exempt related person interest expense to the group's exempt related person interest expense. Because A has no exempt related person interest expense, no disallowed disqualified interest is allocated to A. Disallowed disqualified interest of $160x is allocated to B (($600x/$750x) × $200x), and disallowed disqualified interest of $40x is allocated to C (($150x/$750x) × $200x). Thus, B and C have $160x and $40x, respectively, of disallowed disqualified interest that is carried forward to the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017. No excess limitation that was allocated to A, B, or C under old section 163(j) will carry forward to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017.
(iii)
Carryforward of disallowed disqualified interest to 2018 taxable year.
The facts are the same as in the
Example
in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, except that, for the taxable year ending December 31, 2018, A, B, and C are members of a consolidated group that has a section 163(j) limitation of $140x, current-year business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(9)) of $80x, and no excepted trade or business. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, disallowed disqualified interest is carried to the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and is subject to disallowance under section 163(j) and § 1.163(j)-2. Under § 1.163(j)-5(b)(3)(ii)(D)(
1
), a consolidated group that has section 163(j) limitation remaining for the current year after deducting all current-year business interest expense deducts each member's disallowed disqualified interest carryforwards from prior taxable years, starting with the earliest taxable year, on a pro rata basis (subject to certain limitations). In accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the rule in § 1.163(j)-5(b)(3)(ii)(D)(
1
) applies to disallowed disqualified interest carried forward to the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017. Accordingly, after deducting $80x of current-year business interest expense in 2018, the group may deduct $60x of its $200x disallowed disqualified interest carryforwards. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, B has $160x of disallowed disqualified interest carryforwards, and C has $40x of disallowed disqualified interest carryforwards. Thus, $48x (($160x/$200x) × $60x) of B's disallowed disqualified interest carryforwards, and $12x (($40x/$200x) × $60x) of C's disallowed disqualified interest carryforwards, are deducted by the consolidated group in the 2018 taxable year.
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning on or after November 13, 2020. However, taxpayers and their related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), may choose to apply the rules of this section to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, so long as the taxpayers and their related parties consistently apply the rules of the section 163(j) regulations, and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.381(c)(20)-1, 1.382-1, 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, 1.383-0, 1.383-1, 1.469-9, 1.469-11, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-36, 1.1502-79, 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, and 1.383-1), and 1.1504-4, to that taxable year.

§ 1.164-1
Deduction for taxes.
(a)
In general.
Only the following taxes shall be allowed as a deduction under this section for the taxable year within which paid or accrued, according to the method of accounting used in computing taxable income:
(1) State and local, and foreign, real property taxes.
(2) State and local personal property taxes.
(3) State and local, and foreign, income, war profits, and excess profits taxes.
(4) State and local general sales taxes.
(5) State and local taxes on the sale of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other motor fuels.
In addition, there shall be allowed as a deduction under this section State and local and foreign taxes not described in subparagraphs (1) through (5) of this paragraph which are paid or accrued within the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business or an activity described in section 212 (relating to expenses for production of income). For example, dealers or investors in securities and dealers or investors in real estate may deduct State stock transfer and real estate transfer taxes, respectively, under section 164, to the extent they are expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business or an activity for the production of income. In general, taxes are deductible only by the person upon whom they are imposed. However, see § 1.164-5 in the case of certain taxes paid by the consumer. Also, in the case of a qualified State individual income tax (as defined in section 6362 and the regulations thereunder) which is determined by reference to a percentage of the Federal income tax (pursuant to section 6362 (c)), an accrual method taxpayer shall use the cash receipts and disbursements method to compute the amount of his deduction therefor. Thus, the deduction under section 164 is in the amount actually paid with respect to the qualified tax, rather than the amount accrued with respect thereto, during the taxable year even though the taxpayer uses the accrual method of accounting for other purposes. In addition, see paragraph (f)(1) of § 301.6361-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) with respect to rules relating to allocation and reallocation of amounts collected on account of the Federal income tax and qualified taxes.
(b)
Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964.
For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, except as otherwise provided in §§ 1.164-2 through 1.164-8, inclusive, taxes imposed by the United States, any State, territory, possession of the United States, or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or by any foreign country, are deductible from gross income for the taxable year in which paid or accrued, according to the method of accounting used in computing taxable income. For this purpose, postage is not a tax and automobile license or registration fees are ordinarily taxes.

§ 1.164-2
Deduction denied in case of certain taxes.
This section and § 1.275 describe certain taxes for which no deduction is allowed. In the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, the denial is provided for by section 164(b) (prior to being amended by section 207 of the Revenue Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 40)). In the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, the denial is governed by sections 164 and 275. No deduction is allowed for the following taxes:
(a)
Federal income taxes.
Federal income taxes, including the taxes imposed by section 3101, relating to the tax on employees under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (chapter 21 of the Code); sections 3201 and 3211, relating to the taxes on railroad employees and railroad employee representatives; section 3402, relating to the tax
withheld at source on wages; and by corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws.
(b)
Federal war profits and excess profits taxes.
Federal war profits and excess profits taxes including those imposed by title II of the Revenue Act of 1917 (39 Stat. 1000), title III of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1088), title III of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 271), section 216 of the National Industrial Recovery Act (48 Stat. 208), section 702 of the Revenue Act of 1934 (48 Stat. 770), Subchapter D, Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and Subchapter E, Chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
(c)
Estate and gift taxes.
Estate, inheritance, legacy, succession, and gift taxes.
(d)
Foreign income taxes.
Except as provided in § 1.901-1(c)(2) and (3), foreign income taxes, as defined in § 1.901-2(a), paid or accrued (as the case may be, depending on the taxpayer's method of accounting for such taxes) in a taxable year, if the taxpayer chooses to take to any extent the benefits of section 901, relating to the credit for taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States, for taxes that are paid or accrued (according to the taxpayer's method of accounting for such taxes) in such taxable year.
(e)
Real property taxes.
Taxes on real property, to the extent that section 164(d) and § 1.164-6 require such taxes to be treated as imposed on another taxpayer.
(f)
Federal duties and excise taxes.
Federal import or tariff duties, business, license, privilege, excise, and stamp taxes (not described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), or (h) of this section, or § 1.164-4) paid or accrued within the taxable year. The fact that any such tax is not deductible as a tax under section 164 does not prevent (1) its deduction under section 162 or section 212, provided it represents an ordinary and necessary expense paid or incurred during the taxable year by a corporation or an individual in the conduct of any trade or business or, in the case of an individual for the production or collection of income, for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income, or in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax, or (2) its being taken into account during the taxable year by a corporation or an individual as a part of the cost of acquiring or producing property in the trade or business or, in the case of an individual, as a part of the cost of property held for the production of income with respect to which it relates.
(g)
Taxes for local benefits.
Except as provided in § 1.164-4, taxes assessed against local benefits of a kind tending to increase the value of the property assessed.
(h)
Excise tax on real estate investment trusts.
The excise tax imposed on certain real estate investment trusts by section 4981.
(i)
Applicability dates.
Paragraph (d) of this section applies to foreign taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021.
[T.D. 6780, 29 FR 18145, Dec. 22, 1964, as amended by T.D. 7767, 46 FR 11263, Feb. 6, 1981; T.D. 9959, 87 FR 317, Jan. 4, 2022]
§ 1.164-3
Definitions and special rules.
For purposes of section 164 and § 1.164-1 to § 1.164-8, inclusive—
(a)
State or local taxes.
A State or local tax includes only a tax imposed by a State, a possession of the United States, or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or by the District of Columbia.
(b)
Real property taxes.
The term “real property taxes” means taxes imposed on interests in real property and levied for the general public welfare, but it does not include taxes assessed against local benefits. See § 1.164-4.
(c)
Personal property taxes.
The term “personal property tax” means an ad valorem tax which is imposed on an annual basis in respect of personal property. To qualify as a personal property tax, a tax must meet the following three tests:
(1) The tax must be ad valorem—that is, substantially in proportion to the value of the personal property. A tax which is based on criteria other than value does not qualify as ad valorem. For example, a motor vehicle tax based on weight, model year, and horsepower, or any of these characteristics is not an ad valorem tax. However, a tax which is partly based on value and partly based on other criteria may
qualify in part. For example, in the case of a motor vehicle tax of 1 percent of value plus 40 cents per hundredweight, the part of the tax equal to 1 percent of value qualifies as an ad valorem tax and the balance does not qualify.
(2) The tax must be imposed on an annual basis, even if collected more frequently or less frequently.
(3) The tax must be imposed in respect of personal property. A tax may be considered to be imposed in respect of personal property even if in form it is imposed on the exercise of a privilege. Thus, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, State and local taxes on the registration or licensing of highway motor vehicles are not deductible as personal property taxes unless and to the extent that the tests prescribed in this subparagraph are met. For example, an annual ad valorem tax qualifies as a personal property tax although it is denominated a registration fee imposed for the privilege of registering motor vehicles or of using them on the highways.
(d)
Foreign taxes.
The term “foreign tax” includes only a tax imposed by the authority of a foreign country. A tax-imposed by a political subdivision of a foreign country is considered to be imposed by the authority of that foreign country.
(e)
Sales tax.
(1) The term “sales tax” means a tax imposed upon persons engaged in selling tangible personal property, or upon the consumers of such property, including persons selling gasoline or other motor vehicle fuels at wholesale or retail, which is a stated sum per unit of property sold or which is measured by the gross sales price or the gross receipts from the sale. The term also includes a tax imposed upon persons engaged in furnishing services which is measured by the gross receipts for furnishing such services.
(2) In general, the term “consumer” means the ultimate user or purchaser; it does not include a purchaser such as a retailer, who acquires the property for resale.
(f)
General sales tax.
A “general sales tax” is a sales tax which is imposed at one rate in respect of the sale at retail of a broad range of classes of items. No foreign sales tax is deductible under section 164(a) and paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.164-1. To qualify as a general sales tax, a tax must meet the following two tests:
(1) The tax must be a tax in respect of sales at retail. This may include a tax imposed on persons engaged in selling property at retail or furnishing services at retail, for example, if the tax is measured by gross sales price or by gross receipts from sales or services. Rentals qualify as sales at retail if so treated under applicable State sales tax laws.
(2) The tax must be general—that is, it must be imposed at one rate in respect of the retail sales of a broad range of classes of items. A sales tax is considered to be general although imposed on sales of various classes of items at more than one rate provided that one rate applies to the retail sales of a broad range of classes of items. The term “items” includes both commodities and services.
(g)
Special rules relating to general sales taxes.
(1) A sales tax which is general is usually imposed at one rate in respect of the retail sales of all tangible personal property (with exceptions and additions). However, a sales tax which is selective—that is, a tax which applies at one rate with respect to retail sales of specified classes of items also qualifies as general if the specified classes represent a broad range of classes of items. A selective sales tax which does not apply at one rate to the retail sales of a broad range of classes of items is not general. For example, a tax which applies only to sales of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, admissions, luxury items, and a few other items is not general. Similarly, a tax imposed solely on services is not general. However, a selective sales tax may be deemed to be part of the general sales tax and hence may be deductible, even if imposed by a separate title, etc., of the State or local law, if imposed at the same rate as the general rate of tax (as defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) which qualifies a tax in the taxing jurisdiction as a general sales tax. For example, if a State has a 5 percent general sales tax and a separate selective sales
tax of 5 percent on transient accommodations, the tax on transient accommodations is deductible.
(2) A tax is imposed at one rate only if it is imposed at that rate on generally the same base for all items subject to tax. For example, a sales tax imposed at a 3 percent rate on 100 percent of the sales price of some classes of items and at a 3 percent rate on 50 percent of the sales price of other classes of items would not be imposed at one rate with respect to all such classes. However, a tax is considered to be imposed at one rate although it allows dollar exemptions, if the exemptions are designed to exclude all sales under a certain dollar amount. For example, a tax may be imposed at one rate although it applies to all sales of tangible personal property but applies only to sales amounting to more than 10 cents.
(3) The fact that a sales tax exempts food, clothing, medical supplies, and motor vehicles, or any of them, shall not be taken into account in determining whether the tax applies to a broad range of classes of items. The fact that a sales tax applies to food, clothing, medical supplies, and motor vehicles, or any of them, at a rate which is lower than the general rate of tax (as defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) is not taken into account in determining whether the tax is imposed at one rate on the retail sales of a broad range of classes of items. For purposes of this section, the term “food” means food for human consumption off the premises where sold, and the term “medical supplies” includes drugs, medicines, and medical devices.
(4) Except in the case of a lower rate of tax applicable in respect of food, clothing, medical supplies, and motor vehicles, or any of them, no deduction is allowed for a general sales tax in respect of any item if the tax is imposed on such item at a rate other than the general rate of tax. The general rate of tax is the one rate which qualifies a tax in a taxing jurisdiction as a general sales tax because the tax is imposed at such one rate on a broad range of classes of items. There can be only one general rate of tax in any one taxing jurisdiction. However, a general sales tax imposed at a lower rate or rates on food, clothing, motor vehicles, and medical supplies, or any of them, may nonetheless be deductible with respect to such items. For example, a sales tax which is imposed at 1 percent with respect to food, imposed at 3 percent with respect to a broad range of classes of tangible personal property, and imposed at 4 percent with respect to transient accommodations would qualify as a general sales tax. Taxes paid at the 1 percent and the 3 percent rates are deductible, but tax paid at the 4 percent rate is not deductible. The fact that a sales tax provides for the adjustment of the general rate of tax to reflect the sales tax rate in another taxing jurisdiction shall not be taken into account in determining whether the tax is imposed at one rate on the retail sales of a broad range of classes of items. Moreover, a general sales tax imposed at a lower rate with respect to an item in order to reflect the tax rate in another jurisdiction is also deductible at such lower rate. For example, State E imposes a general sales tax whose general rate is 3 percent. The State E sales tax law provides that in areas bordering on States with general sales taxes, selective sales taxes, or special excise taxes, the rate applied in the adjoining State will be used if such rate is under 3 percent. State F imposes a 2 percent sales tax. The 2 percent sales tax paid by residents of State E in areas bordering on State F is deductible.
(h)
Compensating use taxes.
A compensating use tax in respect of any item is treated as a general sales tax. The term “compensating use tax” means, in respect of any item, a tax which is imposed on the use, storage, or consumption of such item and which is complementary to a general sales tax which is deductible with respect to sales of similar items.
(i)
Special rules relating to compensating use taxes.
(1) In general, a use tax on an item is complementary to a general sales tax on similar items if the use tax is imposed on an item which was not subject to such general sales tax but which would have been subject to such general sales tax if the sale of the item had taken place within the jurisdiction imposing the use tax. For example, a tax imposed by State A on the
use of a motor vehicle purchased in State B is complementary to the general sales tax of State A on similar items, if the latter tax applies to motor vehicles sold in State A.
(2) Since a compensating use tax is treated as a general sales tax, it is subject to the rule of subparagraph (C) of section 164(b)(2) and paragraph (g)(4) of this section that no deduction is allowed for a general sales tax imposed in respect of an item at a rate other than the general rate of tax (except in the case of lower rates on the sale of food, clothing, medical supplies, and motor vehicles). The fact that a compensating use tax in respect of any item provides for an adjustment in the rate of the compensating use tax or the amount of such tax to be paid on account of a sales tax on such item imposed by another taxing jurisdiction is not taken into account in determining whether the compensating use tax is imposed in respect of the item at a rate other than the general rate of tax. For example, a compensating use tax imposed by State C on the use of an item purchased in State D is considered to be imposed at the general rate of tax even though the tax imposed by State C allows a credit for any sales tax paid on such item in State D, or the rate of such compensating use tax is adjusted to reflect the rate of sales tax imposed by State D.
(j)
Safe harbor for payments made by individuals in exchange for State or local tax credits
—(1)
In general.
An individual who itemizes deductions and who makes a payment to or for the use of an entity described in section 170(c) in consideration for a State or local tax credit may treat as a payment of State or local tax for purposes of section 164 the portion of such payment for which a charitable contribution deduction under section 170 is disallowed under § 1.170A-1(h)(3). This treatment as payment of a State or local tax is allowed in the taxable year in which the payment is made to the extent that the resulting credit is applied, consistent with applicable State or local law, to offset the individual's State or local tax liability for such taxable year or the preceding taxable year.
(2)
Credits carried forward.
To the extent that a State or local tax credit described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section is not applied to offset the individual's applicable State or local tax liability for the taxable year of the payment or the preceding taxable year, any excess State or local tax credit permitted to be carried forward may be treated as a payment of State or local tax under section 164(a) in the taxable year or years for which the carryover credit is applied in accordance with State or local law.
(3)
Limitation on individual deductions.
Nothing in this paragraph (j) may be construed as permitting a taxpayer who applies this safe harbor to avoid the limitation of section 164(b)(6) for any amount paid as a tax or treated under this paragraph (j) as a payment of tax.
(4)
No safe harbor for transfers of property.
The safe harbor provided in this paragraph (j) applies only to a payment of cash or cash equivalent.
(5)
Coordination with other deductions.
An individual who deducts a payment under section 164 may not also deduct the same payment under any other Code section.
(6)
Examples.
In the following examples, the taxpayer is an individual who itemizes deductions for Federal income tax purposes.
(i)
Example 1.
In year 1, Taxpayer
A
makes a payment of $500 to an entity described in section 170(c). In return for the payment,
A
receives a dollar-for-dollar State income tax credit. Prior to application of the credit,
A'
s State income tax liability for year 1 was more than $500.
A
applies the $500 credit to
A'
s year 1 State income tax liability. Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section,
A
treats the $500 payment as a payment of State income tax in year 1. To determine
A'
s deduction amount,
A
must apply the provisions of section 164 applicable to payments of State and local taxes, including the limitation in section 164(b)(6). See paragraph (j)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Example 2.
In year 1, Taxpayer
B
makes a payment of $7,000 to an entity described in section 170(c). In return for the payment,
B
receives a dollar-for-dollar State income tax credit, which under State law may be carried forward for three taxable years. Prior to
application of the credit,
B'
s State income tax liability for year 1 was $5,000;
B
applies $5,000 of the $7,000 credit to
B'
s year 1 State income tax liability. Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section,
B
treats $5,000 of the $7,000 payment as a payment of State income tax in year 1. Prior to application of the remaining credit,
B'
s State income tax liability for year 2 exceeds $2,000.
B
applies the excess credit of $2,000 to
B'
s year 2 State income tax liability. For year 2, under paragraph (j)(2) of this section,
B
treats the $2,000 as a payment of State income tax under section 164. To determine
B'
s deduction amounts in years 1 and 2,
B
must apply the provisions of section 164 applicable to payments of State and local taxes, including the limitation under section 164(b)(6). See paragraph (j)(3) of this section.
(iii)
Example 3.
In year 1, Taxpayer
C
makes a payment of $7,000 to an entity described in section 170(c). In return for the payment,
C
receives a local real property tax credit equal to 25 percent of the amount of this payment ($1,750). Prior to application of the credit,
C'
s local real property tax liability in year 1 was more than $1,750.
C
applies the $1,750 credit to
C'
s year 1 local real property tax liability. Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, for year 1,
C
treats $1,750 of the $7,000 payment as a payment of local real property tax for purposes of section 164. To determine
C'
s deduction amount,
C
must apply the provisions of section 164 applicable to payments of State and local taxes, including the limitation under section 164(b)(6). See paragraph (j)(3) of this section.
(7)
Applicability date.
This paragraph (j) applies to payments made to section 170(c) entities on or after June 11, 2019. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply this paragraph (j) to payments made to section 170(c) entities after August 27, 2018.
[T.D. 6780, 29 FR 18146, Dec. 22, 1964, as amended by T.D. 9907, 85 FR 48473, Aug. 11, 2020]
§ 1.164-4
Taxes for local benefits.
(a) So-called taxes for local benefits referred to in paragraph (g) of § 1.164-2, more properly assessments, paid for local benefits such as street, sidewalk, and other like improvements, imposed because of and measured by some benefit inuring directly to the property against which the assessment is levied are not deductible as taxes. A tax is considered assessed against local benefits when the property subject to the tax is limited to property benefited. Special assessments are not deductible, even though an incidental benefit may inure to the public welfare. The real property taxes deductible are those levied for the general public welfare by the proper taxing authorities at a like rate against all property in the territory over which such authorities have jurisdiction. Assessments under the statutes of California relating to irrigation, and of Iowa relating to drainage, and under certain statutes of Tennessee relating to levees, are limited to property benefited, and if the assessments are so limited, the amounts paid thereunder are not deductible as taxes. For treatment of assessments for local benefits as adjustments to the basis of property, see section 1016(a)(1) and the regulations thereunder.
(b)(1) Insofar as assessments against local benefits are made for the purpose of maintenance or repair or for the purpose of meeting interest charges with respect to such benefits, they are deductible. In such cases, the burden is on the taxpayer to show the allocation of the amounts assessed to the different purposes. If the allocation cannot be made, none of the amount so paid is deductible.
(2) Taxes levied by a special taxing district which was in existence on December 31, 1963, for the purpose of retiring indebtedness existing on such date, are deductible, to the extent levied for such purpose, if (i) the district covers the whole of at least one county, (ii) if at least 1,000 persons are subject to the taxes levied by the district, and (iii) if the district levies its assessments annually at a uniform rate on the same assessed value of real property, including improvements, as is used for purposes of the real property tax generally.
[T.D. 6780, 29 FR 18147, Dec. 22, 1964]
§ 1.164-5
Certain retail sales taxes and gasoline taxes.
For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, any amount representing a State or local sales tax paid by a consumer of services or tangible personal property is deductible by such consumer as a tax, provided it is separately stated and not paid in connection with his trade or business. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, only the amount of any separately stated State and local general sales tax (as defined in paragraph (g) of § 1.164-3) and tax on the sale of gasoline, diesel fuel or other motor fuel paid by the consumer (other than in connection with his trade or business) is deductible by the consumer as tax. The fact that, under the law imposing it, the incidence of such State or local tax does not fall on the consumer is immaterial. The requirement that the amount of tax must be separately stated will be deemed complied with where it clearly appears that at the time of sale to the consumer, the tax was added to the sales price and collected or charged as a separate item. It is not necessary, for the purpose of this section, that the consumer be furnished with a sales slip, bill, invoice, or other statement on which the tax is separately stated. For example, where the law imposing the State or local tax for which the taxpayer seeks a deduction contains a prohibition against the seller absorbing the tax, or a provision requiring a posted notice stating that the tax will be added to the quoted price, or a requirement that the tax be separately shown in advertisements or separately stated on all bills and invoices, it is presumed that the amount of the State or local tax was separately stated at the time paid by the consumer; except that such presumption shall have no application to a tax on the sale of gasoline, diesel fuel or other motor fuel imposed upon a wholesaler unless such provisions of law apply with respect to both the sale at wholesale and the sale at retail.
[T.D. 6780, 29 FR 18147, Dec. 22, 1964]
§ 1.164-6
Apportionment of taxes on real property between seller and purchaser.
(a)
Scope.
Except as provided otherwise in section 164(f) and § 1.164-8, when real property is sold, section 164(d)(1) governs the deduction by the seller and the purchaser of current real property taxes. Section 164(d)(1) performs two functions: (1) It provides a method by which a portion of the taxes for the real property tax year in which the property is sold may be deducted by the seller and a portion by the purchaser; and (2) it limits the deduction of the seller and the purchaser to the portion of the taxes corresponding to the part of the real property tax year during which each was the owner of the property. These functions are accomplished by treating a portion of the taxes for the real property tax year in which the property is sold as imposed on the seller and a portion as imposed on the purchaser. To the extent that the taxes are treated as imposed on the seller and the purchaser, each shall be allowed a deduction, under section 164(a), in the taxable year such tax is paid or accrued, or treated as paid or accrued under section 164(d)(2) (A) or (D) and this section. No deduction is allowed for taxes on real property to the extent that they are imposed on another taxpayer, or are treated as imposed on another taxpayer under section 164(d). For the election to accrue real property taxes ratably see section 461(c) and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Application of rule of apportionment.
(1)(i) For purposes of the deduction provided by section 164(a), if real property is sold during any real property tax year, the portion of the real property tax properly allocable to that part of the real property tax year which ends on the day before the date of the sale shall be treated as a tax imposed on the seller, and the portion of such tax properly allocable to that part of such real property tax year which begins on the date of the sale shall be treated as a tax imposed on the purchased. For definition of “real property tax year” see paragraph (c) of this section. This rule shall apply whether or
not the seller and the purchaser apportion such tax. The rule of apportionment contained in section 164(d)(1) applies even though the same real property is sold more than once during the real property tax year. (See paragraph (d)(5) of this section for rule requiring inclusion in gross income of excess deductions.)
(ii) Where the real property tax becomes a personal liability or a lien before the beginning of the real property tax year to which it relates and the real property is sold subsequent to the time the tax becomes a personal liability or a lien but prior to the beginning of the related real property tax year—
(
a
) The seller may not deduct any amount for real property taxes for the related real property tax year, and
(
b
) To the extent that he holds the property for such real property tax year, the purchaser may deduct the amount of such taxes for the taxable year they are paid (or amounts representing such taxes are paid to the seller, mortgagee, trustee or other person having an interest in the property as security) or accrued by him according to his method of accounting.
(iii) Similarly, where the real property tax becomes a personal liability or a lien after the end of the real property tax year to which it relates and the real property is sold prior to the time the tax becomes a personal liability or a lien but after the end of the related real property tax year—
(
a
) The purchaser may not deduct any amount for real property taxes for the related real property tax year, and
(
b
) To the extent that he holds the property for such real property tax year, the seller may deduct the amount of such taxes for the taxable year they are paid (or amounts representing such taxes are paid to the purchaser, mortgagee, trustee, or other person having an interest in the property as security) or accrued by him according to his method of accounting.
(iv) Where the real property is sold (or purchased) during the related real property tax year the real property taxes for such year are apportioned between the parties to such sale and may be deducted by such parties in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) Section 164(d) does not apply to delinquent real property taxes for any real property tax year prior to the real property tax year in which the property is sold.
(3) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The real property tax year in County R is April 1 to March 31. A, the owner on April 1, 1954, of real property located in County R sells the real property to B on June 30, 1954. B owns the real property from June 30, 1954, through March 31, 1955. The real property tax for the real property tax year April 1, 1954-March 31, 1955 is $365. For purposes of section 164(a), $90 (90/365 × $365, April 1, 1954-June 29, 1954) of the real property tax is treated as imposed on A, the seller, and $275 (275/365 × $365, June 30, 1954-March 31, 1955) of such real property tax is treated as imposed on B, the purchaser.

# Example 2.
In County S the real property tax year is the calendar year. The real property tax becomes a lien on June 1 and is payable on July 1 of the current real property tax year, but there is no personal liability for such tax. On April 30, 1955, C, the owner of real property in County S on January 1, 1955, sells the real property to D. On July 1, 1955, D pays the 1955 real property tax. On August 31, 1955, D sells the same real property to E. C, D, and E use the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. Under the provisions of section 164(d)(1), 119/365 (January 1-April 29, 1955) of the real property tax payable on July 1, 1955, for the 1955 real property tax year is treated as imposed on C, and, under the provisions of section 164(d)(2)(A), such portion is treated as having been paid by him on the date of sale. Under the provisions of section 164(d)(1), 123/365 (April 30-August 30, 1955) of the real property tax paid July 1, 1955, for the 1955 real property tax year is treated as imposed on D and may be deducted by him. Under the provisions of section 164(d)(1), 123/365 (August 31-December 31, 1955) of the real property tax due and paid on July 1, 1955, for the 1955 real property tax year is treated as imposed on E and, under the provisions of section 164(d)(2)(A) such portion is treated as having been paid by him on the date of sale.

# Example 3.
In State X the real property tax year is the calendar year. The real property tax becomes a lien on November 1 of the preceding calendar year. On November 15, 1955, F sells real property in State X to G. G owns the real property through December 31, 1956. Under section 164(d)(1), the real property tax (which became a lien on November 1, 1954) for the 1955 real property tax year is apportioned between F and G. No part of the real property tax for the 1956 real property tax year may be deducted by F. The entire real
property tax for the 1956 real property tax year may be deducted by G when paid or accrued, depending upon the method of accounting used by him. See subparagraph (6) of paragraph (d) and section 461(c) and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Real property tax year.
As used in section 164(d), the term “real property tax year” refers to the period which, under the law imposing the tax, is regarded as the period to which the tax imposed relates. Where the State and one or more local governmental units each imposes a tax on real property, the real property tax year for each tax must be determined for purposes of applying the rule of apportionment of section 164(d)(1) to each tax. The time when the tax rate is determined, the time when the assessment is made, the time when the tax becomes a lien, or the time when the tax becomes due or delinquent does not necessarily determine the real property tax year. The real property tax year may or may not correspond to the fiscal year of the governmental unit imposing the tax. In each case the State or local law determines what constitutes the real property tax year. Although the seller and the purchaser may or may not make an allocation of real property taxes, the meaning of “real property tax year” in section 164(d) and the application of section 164(d) do not depend upon what real property taxes were allocated nor the method of allocation used by the parties.
(d)
Special rules
—(1)
Seller using cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting.
Under the provisions of section 164(d), if the seller by reason of his method of accounting may not deduct any amount for taxes unless paid, and—
(i) The purchaser (under the law imposing the real property tax) is liable for the real property tax for the real property tax year, or
(ii) The seller (under the law imposing the real property tax) is liable for the real property tax for the real property tax year and the tax is not payable until after the date of sale, then the portion of the tax treated under section 164(d)(1) as imposed upon the seller (whether or not actually paid by him in the taxable year in which the sale occurs) shall be considered as having been paid by him in such taxable year. Such portion may be deducted by him for the taxable year in which the sale occurs, or, if at a later time, for the taxable year (which would be proper under the taxpayer's method of accounting) in which the tax is actually paid, or an amount representing such tax is paid to the purchaser, mortgagee, trustee, or other person having an interest in the property as security.
(2)
Purchasers using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting.
Under the provisions of section 164(d), if the purchaser by reason of his method of accounting may not deduct any amount for taxes unless paid and the seller (under the law imposing the real property tax) is liable for the real property tax for the real property tax year, the portion of the tax treated under section 164(d)(1) as imposed upon the purchaser (whether or not actually paid by him in the taxable year in which the sale occurs) shall be considered as having been paid by him in such taxable year. Such portion may be deducted by him for the taxable year in which the sale occurs, or, if at a later time, for the taxable year (which would be proper under the taxpayer's method of accounting) in which the tax is actually paid, or an amount representing such tax is paid to the seller, mortgagee, trustee, or other person having an interest in the property as security.
(3)
Persons considered liable for tax.
Where the tax is not a liability of any person, the person who holds the property at the time the tax becomes a lien on the property shall be considered liable for the tax. As to a particular sale, in determining:
(i) Whether the other party to the sale is liable for the tax or,
(ii) The person who holds the property at the time the tax becomes a lien on the property (where the tax is not a liability of any person),
prior or subsequent sales of the property during the real property tax year shall be disregarded.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph may be illustrated as follows:

# Example 1.
In County X the real property tax year is the calendar year. The real property tax is a personal liability of the owner of the real property on June 30 of the current
real property tax year, but is not payable until February 28 of the following real property tax year. A, the owner of real property in County X on January 1, 1955, uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. On May 30, 1955, A sells the real property to B, who also uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. B retains ownership of the real property for the balance of the 1955 calendar year. Under the provisions of section 164(d)(1), 149/365 (January 1-May 29, 1955) of the real property tax payable on February 28, 1956, for the 1955 real property tax year is treated as imposed on A, the seller, and under the provisions of section 164(d)(2)(A) such portion is treated as having been paid by him on the date of sale and may be deducted by him for his taxable year in which the sale occurs (whether or not such portion is actually paid by him in that year) or for his taxable year in which the tax is actually paid or an amount representing such tax is paid. Under the provisions of section 164(d)(1), 216/365 (May 30-December 31, 1955) of the real property tax payable on February 28, 1956, for the 1955 real property tax year is treated as imposed on B, the purchaser, and may be deducted by him for his taxable year in which the tax is actually paid, or an amount representing such tax is paid.

# Example 2.
In County Y, the real property tax year is the calendar year. The real property tax becomes a lien on January 1, 1955, and is payable on April 30, 1955. There is no personal liability for the real property tax imposed by County Y. On April 30, 1955, C, the owner of real property in County Y on January 1, 1955, pays the real property tax for the 1955 real property tax year. On May 1, 1955, C sells the real property to D. On September 1, 1955, D sells the real property to E. C, D, and E use the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. Under the provisions of section 164(d)(1), 120/365 (January 1-April 30, 1955) of the real property tax is treated as imposed upon C and may be deducted by him for his taxable year in which the tax is actually paid. Under section 164(d)(1), 123/365 (May 1-August 31, 1955) of the real property tax is treated as imposed upon D and, under the provisions of section 164(d)(2)(A), is treated as having been paid by him on May 1, 1955, and may be deducted by D for his taxable year in which the sale from C to him occurs (whether or not such portion is actually paid by him in that year), or for his taxable year in which an amount representing such tax is paid. Since, according to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the prior sale by C to D is disregarded, under the provisions of section 164(d)(1), 122/365 (September 1-December 31, 1955) of the real property tax is treated as imposed on E and, under the provisions of section 164(d)(2)(A), is treated as having been paid by him on September 1, 1955, and may be deducted by E for his taxable year in which the sale from D to him occurs (whether or not such portion is actually paid by him in that year), or for his taxable year in which an amount representing such tax is paid.

# Example 3.
In County X the real property tax year is the calendar year and the real property taxes are assessed and become a lien on June 30 of the current real property tax year, but are not payable until September 1 of that year. There is no personal liability for the real property tax imposed by County X. A, the owner on January 1, 1955, of real property in County X, uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. On July 15, 1955, A sells the real property to B. Under the provisions of section 164(d)(1), 195/365 (January 1-July 14, 1955) of the real property tax payable on September 1, 1955, for the 1955 real property tax year is treated as imposed on A, and may be deducted by him for his taxable year in which the sale occurs (whether or not such portion is actually paid by him in that year) or for his taxable year in which the tax is actually paid or an amount representing such tax is paid. Under the provisions of section 164(d)(1), 170/365 (July 15-December 31, 1955) of the real property tax is treated as imposed on B and may be deducted by him for his taxable year in which the sale occurs (whether or not such portion is actually paid by him in that year), or for his taxable year in which the tax is actually paid or an amount representing such tax is paid.
(5)
Treatment of excess deduction.
If, for a taxable year prior to the taxable year of sale of real property, a taxpayer has deducted an amount for real property tax in excess of the portion of such real property tax treated as imposed on him under the provisions of section 164(d), the excess of the amount deducted over the portion treated as imposed on him shall be included in his gross income for the taxable year of the sale, subject to the provisions of section 111, relating to the recovery of bad debts, prior taxes, and delinquency amounts. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated as follows:

# Example 1.
In Borough Y the real property tax is due and payable on November 30 for the succeeding calendar year, which is also the real property tax year. On November 30, 1954, taxpayer A, who reports his income on a calendar year under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, pays the real property tax on real property owned by him in Borough Y for the 1955 real property tax year. On June 30, 1955, A sells the
real property. Under the provisions of section 164(d), only 180/365 (January 1-June 29, 1955) of the real property tax for the 1955 real property tax year is treated as imposed on A, and the excess of the amount of real property tax for 1955 deducted by A, on his 1954 income tax return, over the 180/365 portion of such tax treated as imposed on him under section 164(d), must be included in gross income in A's 1955 income tax return, subject to the provisions of section 111.

# Example 2.
In County Z the real property tax year is the calendar year. The real property tax becomes a personal liability of the owner of real property on January 1 of the current real property tax year, and is payable on July 1 of the current real property tax year. On May 1, 1955, A, the owner of real property in County Z on January 1, 1955, sells the real property to B. On November 1, 1955, B sells the same real property to C. B uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and reports his income on the basis of a fiscal year ending July 31. B, on July 1, 1955, pays the entire real property tax for the real property tax year ending December 31, 1955. Under the provisions of section 164(d), only 184/365 (May 1-October 31, 1955) of the real property tax for the 1955 real property tax year is treated as imposed on B, and the excess of the amount of real property tax for 1955 deducted by B on his income tax return for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1955, over the 184/365 portion of such tax treated as imposed on him under section 164(d), must be included in gross income in B's income tax return for his fiscal year ending July 31, 1956, subject to the provisions of section 111.
(6)
Persons using an accrual method of accounting.
Where real property is sold and the seller or the purchaser computes his taxable income (for the taxable year during which the sale occurs) on an accrual method of accounting then, if the seller or the purchaser has not made the election provided in section 461(c) (relating to the accrual of real property taxes), the portion of any real property tax which is treated as imposed on him and which may not be deducted by him for any taxable year by reason of his method of accounting shall be treated as having accrued on the date of sale. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated as follows:

# Example.
In County X the real property tax becomes a lien on property and is assessed on November 30 for the current calendar year, which is also the real property tax year. There is no personal liability for the real property tax imposed by County X. A owns, on January 1, 1955, real property in County X. A uses an accrual method of accounting and has not made any election under section 461(c) to accrue ratably real property taxes. A sells real property on June 30, 1955. By reason of A's method of accounting, he could not deduct any part of the real property tax for 1955 on the real property since he sold the real property prior to November 30, 1955, the accrual date. Under section 164(d)(1), 180/365 (January 1-June 29, 1955) of the real property tax for the 1955 real property tax year is treated as imposed on A, and under section 164(d)(2)(D) that portion is treated as having accrued on June 30, 1955, and may be deducted by A for his taxable year in which such date falls. B, the purchaser from A, who uses an accrual method of accounting, has likewise not made an election under section 461(c) to accrue real property taxes ratably. Under section 164(d)(1), 185/365 of the real property taxes may be accrued by B on November 30, 1955, and deducted for his taxable year in which such date falls.

Cross references.
For determination of amount realized on a sale of real property, see section 1001(b) and the regulations thereunder. For determination of basis of real property acquired by purchase, see section 1012 and the regulations thereunder.
(8)
Effective dates.
Section 164(d) applies to taxable years ending after December 31, 1953, but only in the case of sales made after December 31, 1953. However, section 164(d) does not apply to any real property tax to the extent that such tax was allowable as a deduction under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 to the seller for any taxable year which ended before January 1, 1954.
§ 1.164-7
Taxes of shareholder paid by corporation.
Banks and other corporations paying taxes assessed against their shareholders on account of their ownership of the shares of stock issued by such corporations without reimbursement from such shareholders may deduct the amount of taxes so paid. In such cases no deduction shall be allowed to the shareholders for such taxes. The amount so paid should not be included in the gross income of the shareholder.
§ 1.164-8
Payments for municipal services in atomic energy communities.
(a)
General.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, amounts
paid or accrued by any owner of real property within any community (as defined in section 21b of the Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 (42 U.S.C. 2304)) to compensate the Atomic Energy Commission for municipal-type services (or any agent or contractor authorized by the Atomic Energy Commission to charge for such services) shall be treated as State real property taxes paid or accrued for purposes of section 164. Such amounts shall be deductible as taxes to the extent provided in section 164, §§ 1.164-1 through 1.164-7, and this section. See paragraph (b) of this section for definition of the term “Atomic Energy Commission”; paragraph (c) of this section for the definition of the term “municipal-type services”; and paragraph (d) of this section for the definition of the term “owner”.
(b)
Atomic Energy Commission.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term “Atomic Energy Commission” shall mean—
(1) The Atomic Energy Commission, and
(2) Any other agency of the United States Government to which the duties and responsibilities of providing municipal-type services are delegated under the authority of section 101 of the Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 (42 U.S.C. 2313).
(c)
Municipal-type services.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term “municipal-type services” includes services usually rendered by a municipality and usually paid for by taxes. Examples of municipal-type services are police protection, fire protection, public recreational facilities, public libraries, public schools, public health, public welfare, and the maintenance of roads and streets. The term shall include sewage and refuse disposal which are maintained out of revenues derived from a general charge for municipal-type services; however, the term shall not include sewage and refuse disposal if a separate charge for such services is made. Charges assessed against local benefits of a kind tending to increase the value of the property assessed are not charges for municipal-type services. See section 164(c)(1) and § 1.164-4.
(d)
Owner.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term “owner” includes a person who holds the real property under a leasehold of 40 or more years from the Atomic Energy Commission (or any agency of the United States Government to which the duties and responsibilities of leasing real property are delegated under section 101 of the Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955), and a person who has entered into a contract to purchase under section 61 of the Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 (42 U.S.C. 2361). An assignee (either immediate or more remote) of a lessee referred to in the preceding sentence will also qualify as an owner for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.
(e)
Nonapplication of section 164(d).
Section 164(d) and § 1.164-6, relating to apportionment of taxes on real property between seller and purchaser, do not apply to a sale by the United States or any of its agencies of real property to which section 164(f) and this section apply. Thus, amounts paid or accrued which qualify under paragraph (a) of this section will continue to be deductible as taxes to the extent provided in this section, even in the taxable year in which the owner actually purchases the real property from the United States or any of its agencies. However, the provisions of section 164(d) and § 1.164-6 shall apply to a sale of real property to which section 164(f) and this section apply, if the seller is other than the United States or any of its agencies.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6789, 29 FR 18147, Dec. 22, 1964]
§ 1.165-1
Losses.
(a)
Allowance of deduction.
Section 165(a) provides that, in computing taxable income under section 63, any loss actually sustained during the taxable year and not made good by insurance or some other form of compensation shall be allowed as a deduction subject to any provision of the internal revenue laws which prohibits or limits the amount of the deduction. This deduction for losses sustained shall be taken in accordance with section 165 and the regulations thereunder. For the disallowance of deductions for worthless securities issued by a political party, see § 1.271-1.
(b)
Nature of loss allowable.
To be allowable as a deduction under section 165(a), a loss must be evidenced by closed and completed transactions, fixed by identifiable events, and, except as otherwise provided in section 165(h) and § 1.165-11, relating to disaster losses, actually sustained during the taxable year. Only a bona fide loss is allowable. Substance and not mere form shall govern in determining a deductible loss.
(c)
Amount deductible.
(1) The amount of loss allowable as a deduction under section 165(a) shall not exceed the amount prescribed by § 1.1011-1 as the adjusted basis for determining the loss from the sale or other disposition of the property involved. In the case of each such deduction claimed, therefore, the basis of the property must be properly adjusted as prescribed by § 1.1011-1 for such items as expenditures, receipts, or losses, properly chargeable to capital account, and for such items as depreciation, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion, in order to determine the amount of loss allowable as a deduction. To determine the allowable loss in the case of property acquired before March 1, 1913, see also paragraph (b) of § 1.1053-1.
(2) The amount of loss recognized upon the sale or exchange of property shall be determined for purposes of section 165(a) in accordance with § 1.1002-1.
(3) A loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a) but only to the extent allowed in section 1211 (relating to limitation on capital losses) and section 1212 (relating to capital loss carrybacks and carryovers), and in the regulations under those sections.
(4) In determining the amount of loss actually sustained for purposes of section 165(a), proper adjustment shall be made for any salvage value and for any insurance or other compensation received.
(d)
Year of deduction.
(1) A loss shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a) only for the taxable year in which the loss is sustained. For this purpose, a loss shall be treated as sustained during the taxable year in which the loss occurs as evidenced by closed and completed transactions and as fixed by identifiable events occurring in such taxable year. For provisions relating to situations where a loss attributable to a disaster will be treated as sustained in the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster actually occurred, see section 165(h) and § 1.165-11.
(2)(i) If a casualty or other event occurs which may result in a loss and, in the year of such casualty or event, there exists a claim for reimbursement with respect to which there is a reasonable prospect of recovery, no portion of the loss with respect to which reimbursement may be received is sustained, for purposes of section 165, until it can be ascertained with reasonable certainty whether or not such reimbursement will be received. Whether a reasonable prospect of recovery exists with respect to a claim for reimbursement of a loss is a question of fact to be determined upon an examination of all facts and circumstances. Whether or not such reimbursement will be received may be ascertained with reasonable certainty, for example, by a settlement of the claim, by an adjudication of the claim, or by an abandonment of the claim. When a taxpayer claims that the taxable year in which a loss is sustained is fixed by his abandonment of the claim for reimbursement, he must be able to produce objective evidence of his having abandoned the claim, such as the execution of a release.
(ii) If in the year of the casualty or other event a portion of the loss is not covered by a claim for reimbursement with respect to which there is a reasonable prospect of recovery, then such portion of the loss is sustained during the taxable year in which the casualty or other event occurs. For example, if property having an adjusted basis of $10,000 is completely destroyed by fire in 1961, and if the taxpayer's only claim for reimbursement consists of an insurance claim for $8,000 which is settled in 1962, the taxpayer sustains a loss of $2,000 in 1961. However, if the taxpayer's automobile is completely destroyed in 1961 as a result of the negligence of another person and there exists a reasonable prospect of recovery on a claim for the full value of the automobile against such person, the taxpayer does not sustain any loss
until the taxable year in which the claim is adjudicated or otherwise settled. If the automobile had an adjusted basis of $5,000 and the taxpayer secures a judgment of $4,000 in 1962, $1,000 is deductible for the taxable year 1962. If in 1963 it becomes reasonably certain that only $3,500 can ever be collected on such judgment, $500 is deductible for the taxable year 1963.
(iii) If the taxpayer deducted a loss in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and in a subsequent taxable year receives reimbursement for such loss, he does not recompute the tax for the taxable year in which the deduction was taken but includes the amount of such reimbursement in his gross income for the taxable year in which received, subject to the provisions of section 111, relating to recovery of amounts previously deducted.
(3) Any loss arising from theft shall be treated as sustained during the taxable year in which the taxpayer discovers the loss (see § 1.165-8, relating to theft losses). However, if in the year of discovery there exists a claim for reimbursement with respect to which there is a reasonable prospect of recovery, no portion of the loss with respect to which reimbursement may be received is sustained, for purposes of section 165, until the taxable year in which it can be ascertained with reasonable certainty whether or not such reimbursement will be received.
(4) The rules of this paragraph are applicable with respect to a casualty or other event which may result in a loss and which occurs after January 16, 1960. If the casualty or other event occurs on or before such date, a taxpayer may treat any loss resulting therefrom in accordance with the rules then applicable, or, if he so desires, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph; but no provision of this paragraph shall be construed to permit a deduction of the same loss or any part thereof in more than one taxable year or to extend the period of limitations within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed under section 6511.
(e)
Limitation on losses of individuals.
In the case of an individual, the deduction for losses granted by section 165(a) shall, subject to the provisions of section 165(c) and paragraph (a) of this section, be limited to:
(1) Losses incurred in a trade or business;
(2) Losses incurred in any transaction entered into for profit, though not connected with a trade or business; and
(3) Losses of property not connected with a trade or business and not incurred in any transaction entered into for profit, if such losses arise from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other causalty, or from theft, and if the loss involved has not been allowed for estate tax purposes in the estate tax return.

§ 1.165-2
Obsolescence of nondepreciable property.
(a)
Allowance of deduction.
A loss incurred in a business or in a transaction entered into for profit and arising from the sudden termination of the usefulness in such business or transaction of any nondepreciable property, in a case where such business or transaction is discontinued or where such property is permanently discarded from use therein, shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a) for the taxable year in which the loss is actually sustained. For this purpose, the taxable year in which the loss is sustained is not necessarily the taxable year in which the overt act of abandonment, or the loss of title to the property, occurs.
(b)
Exceptions.
This section does not apply to losses sustained upon the sale or exchange of property, losses sustained upon the obsolescence or worthlessness of depreciable property, casualty losses, or losses reflected in inventories required to be taken under section 471. The limitations contained in sections 1211 and 1212 upon losses
from the sale or exchange of capital assets do not apply to losses allowable under this section.
(c)
Cross references.

§ 1.165-3
Demolition of buildings.
(a)
Intent to demolish formed at time of purchase.
(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the following rule shall apply when, in the course of a trade or business or in a transaction entered into for profit, real property is purchased with the intention of demolishing either immediately or subsequently the buildings situated thereon: No deduction shall be allowed under section 165(a) on account of the demolition of the old buildings even though any demolition originally planned is subsequently deferred or abandoned. The entire basis of the property so purchased shall, notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.167(a)-5, be allocated to the land only. Such basis shall be increased by the net cost of demolition or decreased by the net proceeds from demolition.
(2)(i) If the property is purchased with the intention of demolishing the buildings and the buildings are used in a trade or business or held for the production of income before their demolition, a portion of the basis of the property may be allocated to such buildings and depreciated over the period during which they are so used or held. The fact that the taxpayer intends to demolish the buildings shall be taken into account in making the apportionment of basis between the land and buildings under § 1.167(a)-5. In any event, the portion of the purchase price which may be allocated to the buildings shall not exceed the present value of the right to receive rentals from the buildings over the period of their intended use. The present value of such right shall be determined at the time that the buildings are first used in the trade or business or first held for the production of income. If the taxpayer does not rent the buildings, but uses them in his own trade or business or in the production of his income, the present value of such right shall be determined by reference to the rentals which could be realized during such period of intended use. The fact that the taxpayer intends to rent or use the buildings for a limited period before their demolition shall also be taken into account in computing the useful life in accordance with paragraph (b) of § 1.167(a)-1.
(ii) Any portion of the purchase price which is allocated to the buildings in accordance with this subparagraph shall not be included in the basis of the land computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and any portion of the basis of the buildings which has not been recovered through depreciation or otherwise at the time of the demolition
of the buildings is allowable as a deduction under section 165.
(iii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In January 1958, A purchased land and a building for $60,000 with the intention of demolishing the building. In the following April, A concludes that he will be unable to commence the construction of a proposed new building for a period of more than 3 years. Accordingly, on June 1, 1958, he leased the building for a period of 3 years at an annual rental of $1,200. A intends to demolish the building upon expiration of the lease. A may allocate a portion of the $60,000 basis of the property to the building to be depreciated over the 3-year period. That portion is equal to the present value of the right to receive $3,600 (3 times $1,200). Assuming that the present value of that right determined as of June 1, 1958, is $2,850, A may allocate that amount to the building and, if A files his return on the basis of a taxable year ending May 31, 1959, A may take a depreciation deduction with respect to such building of $950 for such taxable year. The basis of the land to A as determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is reduced by $2,850. If on June 1, 1960, A ceases to rent the building and demolishes it, the balance of the undepreciated portion allocated to the buildings, $950, may be deducted from gross income under section 165.
(3) The basis of any building acquired in replacement of the old buildings shall not include any part of the basis of the property originally purchased even though such part was, at the time of purchase, allocated to the buildings to be demolished for purposes of determining allowable depreciation for the period before demolition.
(b)
Intent to demolish formed subsequent to the time of acquisition.
(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the loss incurred in a trade or business or in a transaction entered into for profit and arising from a demolition of old buildings shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a) if the demolition occurs as a result of a plan formed subsequent to the acquisition of the buildings demolished. The amount of the loss shall be the adjusted basis of the buildings demolished increased by the net cost of demolition or decreased by the net proceeds from demolition. See paragraph (c) of § 1.165-1 relating to amount deductible under section 165. The basis of any building acquired in replacement of the old buildings shall not include any part of the basis of the property demolished.
(2) If a lessor or lessee of real property demolishes the buildings situated thereon pursuant to a lease or an agreement which resulted in a lease, under which either the lessor was required or the lessee was required or permitted to demolish such buildings, no deduction shall be allowed to the lessor under section 165(a) on account of the demolition of the old buildings. However, the adjusted basis of the demolished buildings, increased by the net cost of demolition or decreased by the net proceeds from demolition, shall be considered as a part of the cost of the lease to be amortized over the remaining term thereof.
(c)
Evidence of intention.
(1) Whether real property has been purchased with the intention of demolishing the buildings thereon or whether the demolition of the buildings occurs as a result of a plan formed subsequent to their acquisition is a question of fact, and the answer depends upon an examination of all the surrounding facts and circumstances. The answer to the question does not depend solely upon the statements of the taxpayer at the time he acquired the property or demolished the buildings, but such statements, if made, are relevant and will be considered. Certain other relevant facts and circumstances that exist in some cases and the inferences that might reasonably be drawn from them are described in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. The question as to the taxpayer's intention is not answered by any inference that is drawn from any one fact or circumstance but can be answered only by a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.
(2) An intention at the time of acquisition to demolish may be suggested by:
(i) A short delay between the date of acquisition and the date of demolition;
(ii) Evidence of prohibitive remodeling costs determined at the time of acquisition;
(iii) Existence of municipal regulations at the time of acquisition which
would prohibit the continued use of the buildings for profit purposes;
(iv) Unsuitability of the buildings for the taxpayer's trade or business at the time of acquisition; or
(v) Inability at the time of acquisition to realize a reasonable income from the buildings.
(3) The fact that the demolition occurred pursuant to a plan formed subsequent to the acquisition of the property may be suggested by:
(i) Substantial improvement of the buildings immediately after their acquisition;
(ii) Prolonged use of the buildings for business purposes after their acquisition;
(iii) Suitability of the buildings for investment purposes at the time of acquisition;
(iv) Substantial change in economic or business conditions after the date of acquisition;
(v) Loss of useful value occurring after the date of acquisition;
(vi) Substantial damage to the buildings occurring after their acquisition;
(vii) Discovery of latent structural defects in the buildings after their acquisition;
(viii) Decline in the taxpayer's business after the date of acquisition;
(ix) Condemnation of the property by municipal authorities after the date of acquisition; or
(x) Inability after acquisition to obtain building material necessary for the improvement of the property.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 74474, 41 FR 55710, Dec. 22, 1976]
§ 1.165-4
Decline in value of stock.
(a)
Deduction disallowed.
No deduction shall be allowed under section 165(a) solely on account of a decline in the value of stock owned by the taxpayer when the decline is due to a fluctuation in the market price of the stock or to other similar cause. A mere shrinkage in the value of stock owned by the taxpayer, even though extensive, does not give rise to a deduction under section 165(a) if the stock has any recognizable value on the date claimed as the date of loss. No loss for a decline in the value of stock owned by the taxpayer shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a) except insofar as the loss is recognized under § 1.1002-1 upon the sale or exchange of the stock and except as otherwise provided in § 1.165-5 with respect to stock which becomes worthless during the taxable year.
(b)
Stock owned by banks.
(1) In the regulation of banks and certain other corporations, Federal and State authorities may require that stock owned by such organizations be charged off as worthless or written down to a nominal value. If, in any such case, this requirement is premised upon the worthlessness of the stock, the charging off or writing down will be considered prima facie evidence of worthlessness for purposes of section 165(a); but, if the charging off or writing down is due to a fluctuation in the market price of the stock or if no reasonable attempt to determine the worthlessness of the stock has been made, then no deduction shall be allowed under section 165(a) for the amount so charged off or written down.
(2) This paragraph shall not be construed, however, to permit a deduction under section 165(a) unless the stock owned by the bank or other corporation actually becomes worthless in the taxable year. Such a taxpayer owning stock which becomes worthless during the taxable year is not precluded from deducting the loss under section 165(a) merely because, in obedience to the specific orders or general policy of such supervisory authorities, the value of the stock is written down to a nominal amount instead of being charged off completely.
(c)
Application to inventories.
This section does not apply to a decline in the value of corporate stock reflected in inventories required to be taken by a dealer in securities under section 471. See § 1.471-5.
(d)
Definition.
As used in this section, the term “stock” means a share of stock in a corporation or a right to subscribe for, or to receive, a share of stock in a corporation.
§ 1.165-5
Worthless securities.
(a)
Definition of security.
As used in section 165(g) and this section, the term “security” means:
(1) A share of stock in a corporation;
(2) A right to subscribe for, or to receive, a share of stock in a corporation; or
(3) A bond, debenture, note, or certificate, or other evidence of indebtedness to pay a fixed or determinable sum of money, which has been issued with interest coupons or in registered form by a domestic or foreign corporation or by any government or political subdivision thereof.
(b)
Ordinary loss.
If any security which is not a capital asset becomes wholly worthless during the taxable year, the loss resulting therefrom may be deducted under section 165(a) as an ordinary loss.
(c)
Capital loss.
If any security which is a capital asset becomes wholly worthless at any time during the taxable year, the loss resulting therefrom may be deducted under section 165(a) but only as though it were a loss from a sale or exchange, on the last day of the taxable year, of a capital asset. See section 165(g)(1). The amount so allowed as a deduction shall be subject to the limitations upon capital losses described in paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.165-1.
(d)
Loss on worthless securities of an affiliated corporation
—(1)
Deductible as an ordinary loss.
If a taxpayer which is a domestic corporation owns any security of a domestic or foreign corporation which is affiliated with the taxpayer within the meaning of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and such security becomes wholly worthless during the taxable year, the loss resulting therefrom may be deducted under section 165(a) as an ordinary loss in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The fact that the security is in fact a capital asset of the taxpayer is immaterial for this purpose, since section 165(g)(3) provides that such security shall be treated as though it were not a capital asset for the purposes of section 165(g)(1). A debt which becomes wholly worthless during the taxable year shall be as an ordinary loss in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph, to the extent that such debt is a security within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(2)
Affiliated corporation defined.
For purposes of this paragraph, a corporation shall be treated as affiliated with the taxpayer owning the security if—
(i)(
a
) In the case of a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1970, the taxpayer owns directly—
(
1
) Stock possessing at least 80 percent of the voting power of all classes of such corporation's stock, and
(
2
) At least 80 percent of each class of such corporation's nonvoting stock excluding for purposes of this subdivision (i)(
a
) nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends (see section 1504(a)), or
(
b
) In the case of a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, the taxpayer owns directly at least 95 percent of each class of the stock of such corporation;
(ii) None of the stock of such corporation was acquired by the taxpayer solely for the purpose of converting a capital loss sustained by reason of the worthlessness of any such stock into an ordinary loss under section 165(g)(3), and
(iii) More than 90 percent of the aggregate of the gross receipts of such corporation for all the taxable years during which it has been in existence has been from sources other than royalties, rents (except rents derived from rental of properties to employees of such corporation in the ordinary course of its operating business), dividends, interest (except interest received on the deferred purchase price of operating assets sold), annuities, and gains from sales or exchanges of stocks and securities. For this purpose, the term “gross receipts” means total receipts determined without any deduction for cost of goods sold, and gross receipts from sales or exchanges of stocks and securities shall be taken into account only to the extent of gains from such sales or exchanges.
(e)
Bonds issued by an insolvent corporation.
A bond of an insolvent corporation secured only by a mortgage from which nothing is realized for the bondholders on foreclosure shall be regarded as having become worthless not later than the year of the foreclosure sale, and no deduction in respect of the loss shall be allowed under section 165(a) in computing a bondholder's taxable income for a subsequent year. See also paragraph (d) of § 1.165-1.
(f)
Decline in market value.
A taxpayer possessing a security to which this section relates shall not be allowed any deduction under section 165(a) on account of mere market fluctuation in the value of such security. See also § 1.165-4.
(g)
Application to inventories.
This section does not apply to any loss upon the worthlessness of any security reflected in inventories required to be taken by a dealer in securities under section 471. See § 1.471-5.
(h)
Special rules for banks.
For special rules applicable under this section to worthless securities of a bank, including securities issued by an affiliated bank, see § 1.582-1.
(i)
Abandonment of securities
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 165 and this section, a security that becomes wholly worthless includes a security described in paragraph (a) of this section that is abandoned and otherwise satisfies the requirements for a deductible loss under section 165. If the abandoned security is a capital asset and is not described in section 165(g)(3) and paragraph (d) of this section (concerning worthless securities of certain affiliated corporations), the resulting loss is treated as a loss from the sale or exchange, on the last day of the taxable year, of a capital asset. See section 165(g)(1) and paragraph (c) of this section. To abandon a security, a taxpayer must permanently surrender and relinquish all rights in the security and receive no consideration in exchange for the security. For purposes of this section, all the facts and circumstances determine whether the transaction is properly characterized as an abandonment or other type of transaction, such as an actual sale or exchange, contribution to capital, dividend, or gift.
(2)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (i) applies to any abandonment of stock or other securities after March 12, 2008.
(j)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) X Corporation, a domestic manufacturing corporation which makes its return on the basis of the calendar year, owns 100 percent of each class of the stock of Y Corporation; and, in addition, 19 percent of the common stock (the only class of stock) of Z Corporation, which it acquired in 1948. Y Corporation, a domestic manufacturing corporation which makes its return on the basis of the calendar year, owns 81 percent of the common stock of Z Corporation, which it acquired in 1946. It is established that the stock of Z Corporation, which has from its inception derived all of its gross receipts from manufacturing operations, became worthless during 1971.
(ii) Since the stock of Z Corporation which is owned by X Corporation is a capital asset and since X Corporation does not directly own at least 80 percent of the stock of Z Corporation, any loss sustained by X Corporation upon the worthlessness of such stock shall be deducted under section 165(g)(1) and paragraph (c) of this section as a loss from a sale or exchange on December 31, 1971, of a capital asset. The loss so sustained by X Corporation shall be considered a long-term capital loss under the provisions of section 1222(4), since the stock was held by that corporation for more than 6 months.
(iii) Since Z Corporation is considered to be affiliated with Y Corporation under the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, any loss sustained by Y Corporation upon the worthlessness of the stock of Z Corporation shall be deducted in 1971 under section 165(g)(3) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section as an ordinary loss.

# Example 2.
(i) On January 1, 1971, X Corporation, a domestic manufacturing corporation which makes its return on the basis of the calendar year, owns 60 percent of each class of the stock of Y Corporation, a foreign corporation, which it acquired in 1950. Y Corporation has, from the date of its incorporation, derived all of its gross receipts from manufacturing operations. It is established that the stock of Y Corporation became worthless on June 30, 1971. On August 1, 1971, X Corporation acquires the balance of the stock of Y Corporation for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of section 165(g)(3) with respect to the loss it has sustained on the worthlessness of the stock of Y Corporation.
(ii) Since the stock of Y Corporation which is owned by X Corporation is a capital asset and since Y Corporation is not to be treated as affiliated with X Corporation under the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, notwithstanding the fact that, at the close of 1971, X Corporation owns 100 percent of each class of stock of Y Corporation, any loss sustained by X Corporation upon the worthlessness of such stock shall be deducted under the provisions of section 165(g)(1) and paragraph (c) of this section as a loss from a sale or exchange on December 31, 1971, of a capital asset.

# Example 3.
(i) X Corporation, a domestic manufacturing corporation which makes its return on the basis of the calendar year, owns 80 percent of each class of the stock of Y Corporation, which from its inception has
derived all of its gross receipts from manufacturing operations. As one of its capital assets, X Corporation owns $100,000 in registered bonds issued by Y Corporation payable at maturity on December 31, 1974. It is established that these bonds became worthless during 1971.
(ii) Since Y Corporation is considered to be affiliated with X Corporation under the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, any loss sustained by X Corporation upon the worthlessness of these bonds may be deducted in 1971 under section 165(g)(3) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section as an ordinary loss. The loss may not be deducted under section 166 as a bad debt. See section 166(e).
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7224, 37 FR 25928, Dec. 6, 1972; T.D. 9386, 73 FR 13124, Mar. 12, 2008]
§ 1.165-6
Farming losses.
(a)
Allowance of losses.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any loss incurred in the operation of a farm as a trade or business shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a) or as a net operating loss deduction in accordance with the provisions of section 172. See § 1.172-1.
(2) If the taxpayer owns and operates a farm for profit in addition to being engaged in another trade or business, but sustains a loss from the operation of the farming business, then the amount of loss sustained in the operation of the farm may be deducted from gross income, if any, from all other sources.
(3) Loss incurred in the operation of a farm for recreation or pleasure shall not be allowed as a deduction from gross income. See § 1.162-12.
(b)
Loss from shrinkage.
If, in the course of the business of farming, farm products are held for a favorable market, no deduction shall be allowed under section 165(a) in respect of such products merely because of shrinkage in weight, decline in value, or deterioration in storage.
(c)
Loss of prospective crop.
The total loss by frost, storm, flood, or fire of a prospective crop being grown in the business of farming shall not be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a).
(d)
Loss of livestock
—(1)
Raised stock.
A taxpayer engaged in the business of raising and selling livestock, such as cattle, sheep, or horses, may not deduct as a loss under section 165(a) the value of animals that perish from among those which were raised on the farm.
(2)
Purchased stock.
The loss sustained upon the death by disease, exposure, or injury of any livestock purchased and used in the trade or business of farming shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a). See, also, paragraph (e) of this section.
(e)
Loss due to compliance with orders of governmental authority.
The loss sustained upon the destruction by order of the United States, a State, or any other governmental authority, of any livestock, or other property, purchased and used in the trade or business of farming shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a).
(f)
Amount deductible
—(1)
Expenses of operation.
The cost of any feed, pasture, or care which is allowed under section 162 as an expense of operating a farm for profit shall not be included as a part of the cost of livestock for purposes of determining the amount of loss deductible under section 165(a) and this section. For the deduction of farming expenses, see § 1.162-12.
(2)
Losses reflected in inventories.
If inventories are taken into account in determining the income from the trade or business of farming, no deduction shall be allowed under this section for losses sustained during the taxable year upon livestock or other products, whether purchased for resale or produced on the farm, to the extent such losses are reflected in the inventory on hand at the close of the taxable year. Nothing in this section shall be construed to disallow the deduction of any loss reflected in the inventories of the taxpayer. For provisions relating to inventories of farmers, see section 471 and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Other limitations.
For other provisions relating to the amount deductible under this section, see paragraph (c) of § 1.165-1, relating to the amount deductible under section 165(a); § 1.165-7, relating to casualty losses; and § 1.1231-1, relating to gains and losses from the sale or exchange of certain property used in the trade or business.
(g)
Other provisions applicable to farmers.
For other provisions relating to
farmers, see § 1.61-4, relating to gross income of farmers; paragraph (b) of § 1.167(a)-6, relating to depreciation in the case of farmers; and § 1.175-1, relating to soil and water conservation expenditures.
§ 1.165-7
Casualty losses.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Allowance of deduction.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (c) of this section, any loss arising from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty is allowable as a deduction under section 165(a) for the taxable year in which the loss is sustained. However, see § 1.165-6, relating to farming losses, and § 1.165-11, relating to an election by a taxpayer to deduct disaster losses in the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster occurred. The manner of determining the amount of a casualty loss allowable as a deduction in computing taxable income under section 63 is the same whether the loss has been incurred in a trade or business or in any transaction entered into for profit, or whether it has been a loss of property not connected with a trade or business and not incurred in any transaction entered into for profit. The amount of a casualty loss shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. For other rules relating to the treatment of deductible casualty losses, see § 1.1231-1, relating to the involuntary conversion of property.
(2)
Method of valuation.
(i) In determining the amount of loss deductible under this section, the fair market value of the property immediately before and immediately after the casualty shall generally be ascertained by competent appraisal. This appraisal must recognize the effects of any general market decline affecting undamaged as well as damaged property which may occur simultaneously with the casualty, in order that any deduction under this section shall be limited to the actual loss resulting from damage to the property.
(ii) The cost of repairs to the property damaged is acceptable as evidence of the loss of value if the taxpayer shows that (
a
) the repairs are necessary to restore the property to its condition immediately before the casualty, (
b
) the amount spent for such repairs is not excessive, (
c
) the repairs do not care for more than the damage suffered, and (
d
) the value of the property after the repairs does not as a result of the repairs exceed the value of the property immediately before the casualty.
(3)
Damage to automobiles.
An automobile owned by the taxpayer, whether used for business purposes or maintained for recreation or pleasure, may be the subject of a casualty loss, including those losses specifically referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. In addition, a casualty loss occurs when an automobile owned by the taxpayer is damaged and when:
(i) The damage results from the faulty driving of the taxpayer or other person operating the automobile but is not due to the willful act or willful negligence of the taxpayer or of one acting in his behalf or
(ii) The damage results from the faulty driving of the operator of the vehicle with which the automobile of the taxpayer collides.
(4)
Application to inventories.
This section does not apply to a casualty loss reflected in the inventories of the taxpayer. For provisions relating to inventories, see section 471 and the regulations thereunder.
(5)
Property converted from personal use.
In the case of property which originally was not used in the trade or business or for income-producing purposes and which is thereafter converted to either of such uses, the fair market value of the property on the date of conversion, if less than the adjusted basis of the property at such time, shall be used, after making proper adjustments in respect of basis, as the basis for determining the amount of loss under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. See paragraph (b) of § 1.165-9, and § 1.167(g)-1.
(6)
Theft losses.
A loss which arises from theft is not considered a casualty loss for purposes of this section. See § 1.165-8, relating to theft losses.
(b)
Amount deductible
—(1)
General rule.
In the case of any casualty loss whether or not incurred in a trade or business or in any transaction entered into for profit, the amount of loss to be
taken into account for purposes of section 165(a) shall be the lesser of either—
(i) The amount which is equal to the fair market value of the property immediately before the casualty reduced by the fair market value of the property immediately after the casualty; or
(ii) The amount of the adjusted basis prescribed in § 1.1011-1 for determining the loss from the sale or other disposition of the property involved.
However, if property used in a trade or business or held for the production of income is totally destroyed by casualty, and if the fair market value of such property immediately before the casualty is less than the adjusted basis of such property, the amount of the adjusted basis of such property shall be treated as the amount of the loss for purposes of section 165(a).
(2)
Aggregation of property for computing loss.
(i) A loss incurred in a trade or business or in any transaction entered into for profit shall be determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph by reference to the single, identifiable property damaged or destroyed. Thus, for example, in determining the fair market value of the property before and after the casualty in a case where damage by casualty has occurred to a building and ornamental or fruit trees used in a trade or business, the decrease in value shall be measured by taking the building and trees into account separately, and not together as an integral part of the realty, and separate losses shall be determined for such building and trees.
(ii) In determining a casualty loss involving real property and improvements thereon not used in a trade or business or in any transaction entered into for profit, the improvements (such as buildings and ornamental trees and shrubbery) to the property damaged or destroyed shall be considered an integral part of the property, for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and no separate basis need be apportioned to such improvements.
(3)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1956 B purchases for $3,600 an automobile which he uses for nonbusiness purposes. In 1959 the automobile is damaged in an accidental collision with another automobile. The fair market value of B's automobile is $2,000 immediately before the collision and $1,500 immediately after the collision. B receives insurance proceeds of $300 to cover the loss. The amount of the deduction allowable under section 165(a) for the taxable year 1959 is $200, computed as follows:
Value of automobile immediately before casualty
$2,000
Less: Value of automobile immediately after casualty
1,500
Value of property actually destroyed
500
Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a): Lesser amount of property actually destroyed ($500) or adjusted basis of property ($3,600)
500
Less: Insurance received
300
Deduction allowable
200

# Example 2.
In 1958 A purchases land containing an office building for the lump sum of $90,000. The purchase price is allocated between the land ($18,000) and the building ($72,000) for purposes of determining basis. After the purchase A planted trees and ornamental shrubs on the grounds surrounding the building. In 1961 the land, building, trees, and shrubs are damaged by hurricane. At the time of the casualty the adjusted basis of the land is $18,000 and the adjusted basis of the building is $66,000. At that time the trees and shrubs have an adjusted basis of $1,200. The fair market value of the land and building immediately before the casualty is $18,000 and $70,000, respectively, and immediately after the casualty is $18,000 and $52,000, respectively. The fair market value of the trees and shrubs immediately before the casualty is $2,000 and immediately after the casualty is $400. In 1961 insurance of $5,000 is received to cover the loss to the building. A has no other gains or losses in 1961 subject to section 1231 and § 1.1231-1. The amount of the deduction allowable under section 165(a) with respect to the building for the taxable year 1961 is $13,000, computed as follows:
Value of property immediately before casualty
$70,000
Less: Value of property immediately after casualty
52,000
Value of property actually destroyed
18,000
Less: Insurance received
5,000
Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a): Lesser amount of property actually destroyed ($18,000) or adjusted basis of property ($66,000)
18,000
Less: Insurance received
5,000
Deduction allowable
13,000
The amount of the deduction allowable under section 165(a) with respect to the trees and shrubs for the taxable year 1961 is $1,200, computed as follows:
Value of property immediately before casualty
$2,000
Less: Value of property immediately after casualty
$400
Value of property actually destroyed
1,600
Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a): Lesser amount of property actually destroyed ($1,600) or adjusted basis of property ($1,200)
1,200

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that A purchases land containing a house instead of an office building. The house is used as his private residence. Since the property is used for personal purposes, no allocation of the purchase price is necessary for the land and house. Likewise, no individual determination of the fair market values of the land, house, trees, and shrubs is necessary. The amount of the deduction allowable under section 165(a) with respect to the land, house, trees, and shrubs for the taxable year 1961 is $14,600, computed as follows:
Value of property immediately before casualty
$90,000
Less: Value of property immediately after casualty
70,400
Value of property actually destroyed
19,600
Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a): Lesser amount of property actually destroyed ($19,600) or adjusted basis of property ($91,200)
19,600
Less: Insurance received
5,000
Deduction allowable
14,600
(4)
Limitation on certain losses sustained by individuals after December 31, 1963.
(i) Pursuant to section 165(c)(3), the deduction allowable under section 165(a) in respect of a loss sustained—
(
a
) After December 31, 1963, in a taxable year ending after such date,
(
b
) In respect of property not used in a trade or business or for income producing purposes, and
(
c
) From a single casualty
shall be limited to that portion of the loss which is in excess of $100. The nondeductibility of the first $100 of loss applies to a loss sustained after December 31, 1963, without regard to when the casualty occurred. Thus, if property not used in a trade or business or for income producing purposes is damaged or destroyed by a casualty which occurred prior to January 1, 1964, and loss resulting therefrom is sustained after December 31, 1963, the $100 limitation applies.
(ii) The $100 limitation applies separately in respect of each casualty and applies to the entire loss sustained from each casualty. Thus, if as a result of a particular casualty occurring in 1964, a taxpayer sustains in 1964 a loss of $40 and in 1965 a loss of $250, no deduction is allowable for the loss sustained in 1964 and the loss sustained in 1965 must be reduced by $60 ($100−$40). The determination of whether damage to, or destruction of, property resulted from a single casualty or from two or more separate casualties will be made upon the basis of the particular facts of each case. However, events which are closely related in origin generally give rise to a single casualty. For example, if a storm damages a taxpayer's residence and his automobile parked in his driveway, any loss sustained results from a single casualty. Similarly, if a hurricane causes high waves, all wind and flood damage to a taxpayer's property caused by the hurricane and the waves results from a single casualty.
(iii) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the $100 limitation applies separately to each individual taxpayer who sustains a loss even though the property damaged or destroyed is owned by two or more individuals. Thus, if a house occupied by two sisters and jointly owned by them is damaged or destroyed, the $100 limitation applies separately to each sister in respect of any loss sustained by her. However, for purposes of applying the $100 limitation, a husband and wife who file a joint return for the first taxable year in which the loss is allowable as a deduction are treated as one individual taxpayer. Accordingly, if property jointly owned by a husband and wife, or property separately owned by the husband or by the wife, is damaged or destroyed by a single casualty in 1964, and a loss is sustained in that year by either or both the husband or wife, only one $100 limitation applies if a joint return is filed for 1964. If, however, the husband and wife file separate returns for 1964, the $100 limitation applies separately in respect of any loss sustained by the husband and in respect of any loss sustained by the wife. Where losses from a single casualty are sustained in two or more separate tax years, the husband and wife shall, for purposes of applying the $100 limitation to such losses, be treated as one individual for all such years if they file a joint return for the first year in which a loss is sustained from the casualty; they shall be treated as separate individuals for all such years if they
file separate returns for the first such year. If a joint return is filed in the first loss year but separate returns are filed in a subsequent year, any unused portion of the $100 limitation shall be allocated equally between the husband and wife in the latter year.
(iv) If a loss is sustained in respect of property used partially for business and partially for nonbusiness purposes, the $100 limitation applies only to that portion of the loss properly attributable to the nonbusiness use. For example, if a taxpayer sustains a $1,000 loss in respect of an automobile which he uses 60 percent for business and 40 percent for nonbusiness, the loss is allocated 60 percent to business use and 40 percent to nonbusiness use. The $100 limitation applies to the portion of the loss allocable to the nonbusiness loss.
(c)
Loss sustained by an estate.
A casualty loss of property not connected with a trade or business and not incurred in any transaction entered into for profit which is sustained during the settlement of an estate shall be allowed as a deduction under sections 165(a) and 641(b) in computing the taxable income of the estate if the loss has not been allowed under section 2054 in computing the taxable estate of the decedent and if the statement has been filed in accordance with § 1.642(g)-1. See section 165(c)(3).
(d)
Loss treated as though attributable to a trade or business.
For the rule treating a casualty loss not connected with a trade or business as though it were a deduction attributable to a trade or business for purposes of computing a net operating loss, see paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of § 1.172-3.
(e)
Effective date.
The rules of this section are applicable to any taxable year beginning after January 16, 1960. If, for any taxable year beginning on or before such date, a taxpayer computed the amount of any casualty loss in accordance with the rules then applicable, such taxpayer is not required to change the amount of the casualty loss allowable for any such prior taxable year. On the other hand, the taxpayer may, if he so desires, amend his income tax return for such year to compute the amount of a casualty loss in accordance with the provisions of this section, but no provision in this section shall be construed as extending the period of limitations within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed under section 6511.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6712, 29 FR 3652, Mar. 24, 1964; T.D. 6786, 29 FR 18501, Dec. 29, 1964; T.D. 7522, 42 FR 63411, Dec. 16, 1977]
§ 1.165-8
Theft losses.
(a)
Allowance of deduction.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, any loss arising from theft is allowable as a deduction under section 165(a) for the taxable year in which the loss is sustained. See section 165(c)(3).
(2) A loss arising from theft shall be treated under section 165(a) as sustained during the taxable year in which the taxpayer discovers the loss. See section 165(e). Thus, a theft loss is not deductible under section 165(a) for the taxable year in which the theft actually occurs unless that is also the year in which the taxpayer discovers the loss. However, if in the year of discovery there exists a claim for reimbursement with respect to which there is a reasonable prospect of recovery, see paragraph (d) of § 1.165-1.
(3) The same theft loss shall not be taken into account both in computing a tax under chapter 1, relating to the income tax, or chapter 2, relating to additional income taxes, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and in computing the income tax under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. See section 7852(c), relating to items not to be twice deducted from income.
(b)
Loss sustained by an estate.
A theft loss of property not connected with a trade or business and not incurred in any transaction entered into for profit which is discovered during the settlement of an estate, even though the theft actually occurred during a taxable year of the decedent, shall be allowed as a deduction under sections 165(a) and 641(b) in computing the taxable income of the estate if the loss has not been allowed under section 2054 in computing the taxable estate of the decedent and if the statement has been filed in accordance with § 1.642(g)-1. See section 165(c)(3). For purposes of determining the year of deduction, see paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(c)
Amount deductible.
The amount deductible under this section in respect of a theft loss shall be determined consistently with the manner prescribed in § 1.165-7 for determining the amount of casualty loss allowable as a deduction under section 165(a). In applying the provisions of paragraph (b) of § 1.165-7 for this purpose, the fair market value of the property immediately after the theft shall be considered to be zero. In the case of a loss sustained after December 31, 1963, in a taxable year ending after such date, in respect of property not used in a trade or business or for income producing purposes, the amount deductible shall be limited to that portion of the loss which is in excess of $100. For rules applicable in applying the $100 limitation, see paragraph (b)(4) of § 1.165-7. For other rules relating to the treatment of deductible theft losses, see § 1.1231-1, relating to the involuntary conversion of property.
(d)
Definition.
For purposes of this section the term “theft” shall be deemed to include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, larceny, embezzlement, and robbery.
(e)
Application to inventories.
This section does not apply to a theft loss reflected in the inventories of the taxpayer. For provisions relating to inventories, see section 471 and the regulations thereunder.
(f)
Example.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In 1955 B, who makes her return on the basis of the calendar year, purchases for personal use a diamond brooch costing $4,000. On November 30, 1961, at which time it has a fair market value of $3,500, the brooch is stolen; but B does not discover the loss until January 1962. The brooch was fully insured against theft. A controversy develops with the insurance company over its liability in respect of the loss. However, in 1962, B has a reasonable prospect of recovery of the fair market value of the brooch from the insurance company. The controversy is settled in March 1963, at which time B receives $2,000 in insurance proceeds to cover the loss from theft. No deduction for the loss is allowable for 1961 or 1962; but the amount of the deduction allowable under section 165(a) for the taxable year 1963 is $1,500, computed as follows:
Value of property immediately before theft
$3,500
Less: Value of property immediately after the theft
0
Balance
3,500
Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a): ($3,500 but not to exceed adjusted basis of $4,000 at time of theft)
$3,500
Less: Insurance received in 1963
2,000
Deduction allowable for 1963
1,500
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6786, 29 FR 18502, Dec. 29, 1964]
§ 1.165-9
Sale of residential property.
(a)
Losses not allowed.
A loss sustained on the sale of residential property purchased or constructed by the taxpayer for use as his personal residence and so used by him up to the time of the sale is not deductible under section 165(a).
(b)
Property converted from personal use.
(1) If property purchased or constructed by the taxpayer for use as his personal residence is, prior to its sale, rented or otherwise appropriated to income-producing purposes and is used for such purposes up to the time of its sale, a loss sustained on the sale of the property shall be allowed as a deduction under section 165(a).
(2) The loss allowed under this paragraph upon the sale of the property shall be the excess of the adjusted basis prescribed in § 1.1011-1 for determining loss over the amount realized from the sale. For this purpose, the adjusted basis for determining loss shall be the lesser of either of the following amounts, adjusted as prescribed in § 1.1011-1 for the period subsequent to the conversion of the property to income-producing purposes:
(i) The fair market value of the property at the time of conversion, or
(ii) The adjusted basis for loss, at the time of conversion, determined under § 1.1011-1 but without reference to the fair market value.
(3) For rules relating to casualty losses of property converted from personal use, see paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.165-7. To determine the basis for depreciation in the case of such property, see § 1.167(g)-1. For limitations on the loss from the sale of a capital asset, see paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.165-1.
(c)
Examples.
The application of paragraph (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Residential property is purchased by the taxpayer in 1943 for use as his personal residence at a cost of $25,000, of which $15,000 is allocable to the building. The taxpayer uses the property as his personal residence until January 1, 1952, at which time its fair market value is $22,000, of which $12,000 is allocable to the building. The taxpayer rents the property from January 1, 1952, until January 1, 1955, at which time it is sold for $16,000. On January 1, 1952, the building has an estimated useful life of 20 years. It is assumed that the building has no estimated salvage value and that there are no adjustments in respect of basis other than depreciation, which is computed on the straight-line method. The loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a) for the taxable year 1955 is $4,200, computed as follows:
Basis of property at time of conversion for purposes of this section (that is, the lesser of $25,000 cost or $22,000 fair market value)
$22,000
Less: Depreciation allowable from January 1, 1952, to January 1, 1955 (3 years at 5 percent based on $12,000, the value of the building at time of conversion, as prescribed by § 1.167(g)-1)
1,800
Adjusted basis prescribed in § 1.1011-1 for determining loss on sale of the property
20,200
Less: Amount realized on sale
16,000
Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a)
4,200
In this example the value of the building at the time of conversion is used as the basis for computing depreciation. See example (2) of this paragraph wherein the adjusted basis of the building is required to be used for such purpose.

# Example 2.
Residential property is purchased by the taxpayer in 1940 for use as his personal residence at a cost of $23,000, of which $10,000 is allocable to the building. The taxpayer uses the property as his personal residence until January 1, 1953, at which time its fair market value is $20,000, of which $12,000 is allocable to the building. The taxpayer rents the property from January 1, 1953, until January 1, 1957, at which time it is sold for $17,000. On January 1, 1953, the building has an estimated useful life of 20 years. It is assumed that the building has no estimated salvage value and that there are no adjustments in respect of basis other than depreciation, which is computed on the straight-line method. The loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a) for the taxable year 1957 is $1,000, computed as follows:
Basis of property at time of conversion for purposes of this section (that is, the lesser of $23,000 cost or $20,000 fair market value)
$20,000
Less: Depreciation allowable from January 1, 1953, to January 1, 1957 (4 years at 5 percent based on $10,000, the cost of the building, as prescribed by § 1.167(g)-1
2,000
Adjusted basis prescribed in § 1.1011-1 for determining loss on sale of the property
$18,000
Less: Amount realized on sale
17,000
Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a)
1,000
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6712, 29 FR 3652, Mar. 24, 1964]
§ 1.165-10
Wagering losses.
Losses sustained during the taxable year on wagering transactions shall be allowed as a deduction but only to the extent of the gains during the taxable year from such transactions. In the case of a husband and wife making a joint return for the taxable year, the combined losses of the spouses from wagering transactions shall be allowed to the extent of the combined gains of the spouses from wagering transactions.
§ 1.165-11
Election to take disaster loss deduction for preceding year.
(a)
In general.
Section 165(i) allows a taxpayer who has sustained a loss attributable to a federally declared disaster in a taxable year to elect to deduct that disaster loss in the preceding year. This section provides rules and procedures for making and revoking an election to claim a disaster loss in the preceding year.
(b)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:
(1) A
federally declared disaster
means any disaster subsequently determined by the President of the United States to warrant assistance by the Federal Government under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act). A federally declared disaster includes both a major disaster declared under section 401 of the Stafford Act and an emergency declared under section 501 of the Stafford Act.
(2) A
federally declared disaster area
is the area determined to be eligible for assistance pursuant to the Presidential
declaration in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(3) A
disaster loss
is a loss occurring in a federally declared disaster area that is attributable to a federally declared disaster and that is otherwise allowable as a deduction for the disaster year under section 165(a) and §§ 1.165-1 through 1.165-10.
(4) The
disaster year
is the taxable year in which a taxpayer sustains a loss attributable to a federally declared disaster.
(5) The
preceding year
is the taxable year immediately prior to the disaster year.
(c)
Scope and effect of election.
An election made pursuant to section 165(i) for a disaster loss attributable to a particular disaster applies to the entire loss sustained by the taxpayer from that disaster during the disaster year. If the taxpayer makes a section 165(i) election with respect to a particular disaster occurring during the disaster year, the disaster to which the election relates is deemed to have occurred, and the disaster loss to which the election applies is deemed to have been sustained, in the preceding year.
(d)
Requirement to file consistent returns.
A taxpayer may not make a section 165(i) election for a disaster loss if the taxpayer claims a deduction (as a loss, as cost of goods sold, or otherwise) for the same loss for the disaster year. If a taxpayer has claimed a deduction for a disaster loss for the disaster year and the taxpayer wants to make a section 165(i) election with respect to that loss, the taxpayer must file an amended Federal income tax return to remove the previously deducted loss on or before the date that the taxpayer makes the section 165(i) election for the loss. Similarly, if a taxpayer has claimed a deduction for a disaster loss for the preceding year based on a section 165(i) election and the taxpayer wants to revoke that election, the taxpayer must file an amended Federal income tax return to remove the loss for the preceding year on or before the date the taxpayer files the Federal income tax return or amended Federal income tax return for the disaster year that includes the loss.
(e)
Manner of making election.
An election under section 165(i) to deduct a disaster loss for the preceding year is made either on an original Federal income tax return for the preceding year or an amended Federal income tax return for the preceding year in the manner specified by guidance issued pursuant to this section.
(f)
Due date for making election.
The due date for making the section 165(i) election is six months after the due date for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the disaster year (determined without regard to any extension of time to file).
(g)
Revocation.
Subject to the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section, a section 165(i) election may be revoked on or before the date that is ninety (90) days after the due date for making the election.
(h)
Applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, this section applies to elections and revocations that are made on or after October 16, 2019.
(2)
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
The second sentence of paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to elections and revocations that are made on or after June 11, 2021.
[T.D. 9878, 84 FR 55245, Oct. 16, 2019, as amended by T.D. 9950, 86 FR 31150, June 11, 2021]
§ 1.165-12
Denial of deduction for losses on registration-required obligations not in registered form.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, nothing in section 165(a) and the regulations thereunder, or in any other provision of law, shall be construed to provide a deduction for any loss sustained on any registration-required obligation held after December 31, 1982, unless the obligation is in registered form or the issuance of the obligation was subject to tax under section 4701. The term “registration-required obligation” has the meaning given to that term in section 163(f)(2), except that clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) thereof shall not apply. Therefore, although an obligation that is not in registered form is described in § 1.163-5(c)(1), the holder of such an obligation shall not be allowed a deduction for any loss sustained on such obligation unless paragraph (c) of this section applies. The term “holder”
means the person that would be denied a loss deduction under section 165(j)(1) or denied capital gain treatment under section 1287(a). For purposes of this section, the term
United States
means the United States and its possessions within the meaning of § 1.163-5(c)(2)(iv).
(b)
Registered form
—(1)
Obligations issued after September 21, 1984.
With respect to any obligation originally issued after September 21, 1984, the term “registered form” has the meaning given that term in section 103(j)(3) and the regulations thereunder. Therefore, an obligation that would otherwise be in registered form is not considered to be in registered form if it can be transferred at that time or at any time until its maturity by any means not described in § 5f.103-1(c). An obligation that, as of a particular time, is not considered to be in registered form because it can be transferred by any means not described in § 5f.103-1(c) is considered to be in registered form at all times during the period beginning with a later time and ending with the maturity of the obligation in which the obligation can be transferred only by a means described in § 5f.103-1(c).
(2)
Obligations issued after December 31, 1982 and on or before September 21, 1984.
With respect to any obligation originally issued after December 31, 1982 and on or before September 21, 1984 or an obligation originally issued after September 21, 1984 pursuant to the exercise of a warrant or the conversion of a convertible obligation, which warrant or obligation (including conversion privilege) was issued after December 31, 1982 and on or before September 21, 1984, that obligation will be considered in registered form if it satisfied § 5f.163-1 or the proposed regulations provided in § 1.163-5(c) and published in the
Federal Register
on September 2, 1983 (48 FR 39953).
(c)
Registration-required obligations not in registered form which are not subject to section 165(j)(1).
Notwithstanding the fact that an obligation is a registration-required obligation that is not in registered form, the holder will not be subject to section 165(j)(1) if the holder meets the conditions of any one of the following subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this paragraph (c).
(1)
Persons permitted to hold in connection with the conduct of a trade or business.
(i) The holder is an underwriter, broker, dealer, bank, or other financial institution (defined in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)) that holds such obligation in connection with its trade or business conducted outside the United States; or the holder is a broker-dealer (registered under Federal or State law or exempted from registration by the provisions of such law because it is a bank) that holds such obligation for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business.
(ii) The holder must offer to sell, sell and deliver the obligation in bearer form only outside of the United States except that a holder that is a registered broker-dealer as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may offer to sell and sell the obligation in bearer form inside the United States to a financial institution as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section for its own account or for the account of another financial institution or of an exempt organization as defined in section 501(c)(3).

Absent actual knowledge that the representation is false, the holder may rely on a written statement provided by the financial institution or exempt organization, including a statement that is delivered in electronic form. The holder may deliver a registration-required obligation in bearer form that is offered and sold outside the United States to a person other than a financial institution only if the holder has evidence in its records that such person is not a U.S. citizen or resident and does not have actual knowledge that such evidence is false. Such evidence may include a written statement by that person, including a
statement that is delivered electronically. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term
deliver
includes a transfer of an obligation evidenced by a book entry including a book entry notation by a clearing organization evidencing transfer of the obligation from one member of the organization to another member. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term
deliver

(2)
Persons permitted to hold obligations for their own investment account.
The holder is a financial institution holding the obligation for its own investment account that satisfies the conditions set forth in subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of his paragraph (c) (2).
(i) The holder reports on its Federal income tax return for the taxable year any interest payments received (including original issue discount includable in gross income for such taxable year) with respect to such obligation and gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of such obligation;
(ii) The holder indicates on its Federal income tax return that income, gain or loss described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) is attributable to registration-required obligations held in bearer form for its own account;

(iv) The holder delivers such obligation in bearer form to any other person in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
(3)
Persons permitted to hold through financial institutions.
The holder is any person that purchases and holds a registration-required obligation in bearer form through a financial institution with which the holder maintains a customer, custodial or nominee relationship and such institution agrees to satisfy, and does in fact satisfy, the conditions set forth in subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this paragraph (c)(3).
(i) The financial institution makes a return of information to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any interest payments received. The financial institution must report original issue discount includable in the holder's gross income for the taxable year on any obligation so held, but only if the obligation appears in an Internal Revenue Service publication of obligations issued at an original issue discount and only in an amount determined in accordance with information contained in that publication. An information return for any interest payment shall be made on a Form 1099 for the calendar year. It shall indicate the aggregate amount of the payment received, the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the holder,
and such other information as is required by the form. No return of information is required under this subdivision if the financial institution reports payments under section 6041 or 6049.
(ii) The financial institution makes a return of information on Form 1099B with respect to any disposition by the holder of such obligation. The return shall show the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the holder of the obligation, Committee on Uniform Security Information Procedures (CUSIP), gross proceeds, sale date, and such other information as may be required by the form. No return of information is required under this subdivision if such financial institution reports with respect to the disposition under section 6045.

Conversion of obligations into registered form.
The holder is not a person described in paragraph (c) (1), (2), or (3) of this section, and within thirty days of the date when the seller or other transferor is reasonably able to make the bearer obligation available to the holder, the holder surrenders the obligation to a transfer agent or the issuer for conversion of the obligation into registered form. If such obligation is not registered within such 30 day period, the holder shall be subject to sections 165(j) and 1287(a).
(d)
Effective date.
These regulations apply generally to obligations issued after January 20, 1987. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply the rules of § 1.165-12 with respect to an obligation issued after December 31, 1982 and on or before January 20, 1987, which obligation is held after January 20, 1987.
[T.D. 8110, 51 FR 45459, Dec. 19, 1986, as amended by T.D. 8734, 62 FR 53416, Oct. 14, 1997]
§ 1.166-1
Bad debts.
(a)
Allowance of deduction.
Section 166 provides that, in computing taxable income under section 63, a deduction shall be allowed in respect of bad debts owed to the taxpayer. For this purpose, bad debts shall, subject to the provisions of section 166 and the regulations thereunder, be taken into account either as—
(1) A deduction in respect of debts which become worthless in whole or in part; or as
(2) A deduction for a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts.
(b)
Manner of selecting method.
(1) A taxpayer filing a return of income for the first taxable year for which he is entitled to a bad debt deduction may select either of the two methods prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section for treating bad debts, but such selection is subject to the approval of the district director upon examination of the return. If the method so selected is approved, it shall be used in returns for all subsequent taxable years unless the Commissioner grants permission to use the other method. A statement of facts substantiating any deduction claimed under section 166 on account of bad debts shall accompany each return of income.
(2) Taxpayers who have properly selected one of the two methods for treating bad debts under provisions of prior law corresponding to section 166 shall continue to use that method for all subsequent taxable years unless the Commissioner grants permission to use the other method.
(3)(i) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1959, application for permission to change the method of treating bad debts shall be made in accordance with section 446(e) and paragraph (e)(3) of § 1.446-1.
(ii) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1960, application for permission to change the method of treating bad debts shall be made at least 30 days before the close of the
taxable year for which the change is effective.
(4) Nothwithstanding paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, a dealer in property currently employing the accrual method of accounting and currently maintaining a reserve for bad debts under section 166(c) (which may have included guaranteed debt obligations described in section 166(f)(1)(A)) may establish a reserve for section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations for a taxable year ending after October 21, 1965 under section 166(f) and § 1.166-10 by filing on or before April 17, 1986 an amended return indicating that such a reserve has been established. The establishment of such a reserve will not be considered a change in method of accounting for purposes of section 446(e). However, an election by a taxpayer to establish a reserve for bad debts under section 166(c) shall be treated as a change in method of accounting. See also § 1.166-4, relating to reserve for bad debts, and § 1.166-10, relating to reserve for guaranteed debt obligations.
(c)
Bona fide debt required.
Only a bona fide debt qualifies for purposes of section 166. A bona fide debt is a debt which arises from a debtor-creditor relationship based upon a valid and enforceable obligation to pay a fixed or determinable sum of money. A debt arising out of the receivables of an accrual method taxpayer is deemed to be an enforceable obligation for purposes of the preceding sentence to the extent that the income such debt represents have been included in the return of income for the year for which the deduction as a bad debt is claimed or for a prior taxable year. For example, a debt arising out of gambling receivables that are unenforceable under state or local law, which an accrual method taxpayer includes in income under section 61, is an enforceable obligation for purposes of this pargarph. A gift or contribution to capital shall not be considered a debt for purposes of section 166. The fact that a bad debt its not due at the time of deduction shall not of itself prevent is allowance under section 166. For the disallowance of deductions for bad debts owed by a political party, see § 1.271-1.
(d)
Amount deductible
—(1)
General rule.
Except in the case of a deduction for a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts, the basis for determining the amount of deduction under section 166 in respect of a bad debt shall be the same as the adjusted basis prescribed by § 1.1011-1 for determining the loss from the sale or other disposition of property. To determine the allowable deduction in the case of obligations acquired before March 1, 1913, see also paragraph (b) of § 1.1053-1.
(2)
Specific cases.
Subject to any provision of section 166 and the regulations thereunder which provides to the contrary, the following amounts are deductible as bad debts:
(i)
Notes or accounts receivable.
(
a
) If, in computing taxable income, a taxpayer values his notes or accounts receivable at their fair market value when received, the amount deductible as a bad debt under section 166 in respect of such receivables shall be limited to such fair market value even though it is less than their face value.
(
b
) A purchaser of accounts receivable which become worthless during the taxable year shall be entitled under section 166 to a deduction which is based upon the price he paid for such receivables but not upon their face value.
(ii)
Bankruptcy claim.
Only the difference between the amount received in distribution of the assets of a bankrupt and the amount of the claim may be deducted under section 166 as a bad debt.
(iii)
Claim against decedent's estate.
The excess of the amount of the claim over the amount received by a creditor of a decedent in distribution of the assets of the decedent's estate may be considered a worthless debt under section 166.
(e)
Prior inclusion in income required.
Worthless debts arising from unpaid wages, salaries, fees, rents, and similar items of taxable income shall not be allowed as a deduction under section 166 unless the income such items represent has been included in the return of income for the year for which the deduction as a bad debt is claimed or for a prior taxable year.
(f)
Recovery of bad debts.
Any amount attributable to the recovery during the
taxable year of a bad debt, or of a part of a bad debt, which was allowed as a deduction from gross income in a prior taxable year shall be included in gross income for the taxable year of recovery, except to the extent that the recovery is excluded from gross income under the provisions of § 1.111-1, relating to the recovery of certain items previously deducted or credited. This paragraph shall not apply, however, to a bad debt which was previously charged against a reserve by a taxpayer on the reserve method of treating bad debts.
(g)
Worthless securities.
(1) Section 166 and the regulations thereunder do not apply to a debt which is evidenced by a bond, debenture, note, or certificate, or other evidence of indebtedness, issued by a corporation or by a government or political subdivision thereof, with interest coupons or in registered form. See section 166(e). For provisions allowing the deduction of a loss resulting from the worthlessness of such a debt, see § 1.165-5.
(2) The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph do not apply to any loss sustained by a bank and resulting from the worthlessness of a security described in section 165(g)(2)(C). See paragraph (a) of § 1.582-1.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6996, 34 FR 835, Jan. 18, 1969; T.D. 7902, 48 FR 33260, July 21, 1983; T.D. 8071, 51 FR 2479, Jan. 17, 1986]
§ 1.166-2
Evidence of worthlessness.
(a)
General rule.
In determining whether a debt is worthless in whole or in part the district director will consider all pertinent evidence, including the value of the collateral, if any, securing the debt and the financial condition of the debtor.
(b)
Legal action not required.
Where the surrounding circumstances indicate that a debt is worthless and uncollectible and that legal action to enforce payment would in all probability not result in the satisfaction of execution on a judgment, a showing of these facts will be sufficient evidence of the worthlessness of the debt for purposes of the deduction under section 166.
(c)
Bankruptcy
—(1)
General rule.
Bankruptcy is generally an indication of the worthlessness of at least a part of an unsecured and unpreferred debt.
(2)
Year of deduction.
In bankruptcy cases a debt may become worthless before settlement in some instances; and in others, only when a settlement in bankruptcy has been reached. In either case, the mere fact that bankruptcy proceedings instituted against the debtor are terminated in a later year, thereby confirming the conclusion that the debt is worthless, shall not authorize the shifting of the deduction under section 166 to such later year.
(d)
Banks and other regulated corporations
—(1)
Worthlessness presumed in year of charge-off.
If a bank or other corporation which is subject to supervision by Federal authorities, or by State authorities maintaining substantially equivalent standards, charges off a debt in whole or in part, either—
(i) In obedience to the specific orders of such authorities, or
(ii) In accordance with established policies of such authorities, and, upon their first audit of the bank or other corporation subsequent to the charge-off, such authorities confirm in writing that the charge-off would have been subject to such specific orders if the audit had been made on the date of the charge-off,
then the debt shall, to the extent charged off during the taxable year, be conclusively presumed to have become worthless, or worthless only in part, as the case may be, during such taxable year. But no such debt shall be so conclusively presumed to be worthless, or worthless only in part, as the case may be, if the amount so charged off is not claimed as a deduction by the taxpayer at the time of filing the return for the taxable year in which the charge-off takes place.
(2)
Evidence of worthlessness in later taxable year.
If such a bank or other corporation does not claim a deduction for such a totally or partially worthless debt in its return for the taxable year in which the charge-off takes place, but claims the deduction for a later taxable year, then the charge-off in the prior taxable year shall be deemed to have been involuntary and the deduction under section 166 shall be allowed for the taxable year for which claimed, provided that the taxpayer
produces sufficient evidence to show that—
(i) The debt became wholly worthless in the later taxable year, or became recoverable only in part subsequent to the taxable year of the involuntary charge-off, as the case may be; and,
(ii) To the extent that the deduction claimed in the later taxable year for a debt partially worthless was not involuntarily charged off in prior taxable years, it was charged off in the later taxable year.
(3)
Conformity election
—(i)
Eligibility for election.
In lieu of applying paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, a bank (as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section) that is subject to supervision by Federal authorities, or by state authorities maintaining substantially equivalent standards, may elect under this paragraph (d)(3) to use a method of accounting that establishes a conclusive presumption of worthlessness for debts, provided that the bank meets the express determination requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this section for the taxable year of the election.
(ii)
Conclusive presumption
—(A)
In general.
If a bank satisfies the express determination requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this section and elects to use the method of accounting under this paragraph (d)(3)—
(
1
) Debts charged off, in whole or in part, for regulatory purposes during a taxable year are conclusively presumed to have become worthless, or worthless only in part, as the case may be, during that year, but only if the charge-off results from a specific order of the bank's supervisory authority or corresponds to the bank's classification of the debt, in whole or in part, as a loss asset, as described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C) of this section; and
(
2
) A bad debt deduction for a debt that is subject to regulatory loss classification standards is allowed for a taxable year only to the extent that the debt is conclusively presumed to have become worthless under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section during that year.
(B)
Charge-off should have been made in earlier year.
The conclusive presumption that a debt is worthless in the year that it is charged off for regulatory purposes applies even if the bank's supervisory authority determines in a subsequent year that the charge-off should have been made in an earlier year. A pattern of charge-offs in the wrong year, however, may result in revocation of the bank's election by the Commissioner pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(D) of this section.
(C)
Loss asset defined.
A debt is classified as a loss asset by a bank if the bank assigns the debt to a class that corresponds to a loss asset classification under the standards set forth in the “Uniform Agreement on the Classification of Assets and Securities Held by Banks” (See Attachment to Comptroller of the Currency Banking Circular No. 127, Rev. 4-26-91, Comptroller of the Currency, Communications Department, Washington, DC 20219) or similar guidance issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, or the Farm Credit Administration; or for institutions under the supervision of the Office of Thrift Supervision, 12 CFR 563.160(b)(3).
(iii)
Election
—(A)
In general.
An election under this paragraph (d)(3) is to be made on bank-by-bank basis and constitutes either the adoption of or a change in method of accounting, depending on the particular bank's facts. A change in method of accounting that results from the making of an election under this paragraph (d)(3) has the effects described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Effect of change in method of accounting.
A change in method of accounting resulting from an election under this paragraph (d)(3) does not require or permit an adjustment under section 481(a). Under this cut-off approach—
(
1
) There is no change in the § 1.1011-1 adjusted basis of the bank's existing debts (as determined under the bank's former method of accounting for bad debts) as a result of the change in method of accounting;
(
2
) With respect to debts that are subject to regulatory loss classification standards and are held by the bank at the beginning of the year of change (to the extent that they have not been charged off for regulatory
purposes), and with respect to debts subject to regulatory loss classification standards that are originated or acquired subsequent to the beginning of the year of change, bad debt deductions in the year of change and thereafter are determined under the method of accounting for bad debts prescribed by this paragraph (d)(3);
(
3
) With respect to debts that are not subject to regulatory loss classification standards or that have been totally charged off prior to the year of change, bad debt deductions are determined under the general rules of section 166; and
(
4
) If there was any partial charge-off of a debt in a prechange year, any portion of which was not claimed as a deduction, the deduction reflecting that partial charge-off must be taken in the first year in which there is any further charge-off of the debt for regulatory purposes.
(C)
Procedures
—(
1
)
In general.
A new bank adopts the method of accounting under this paragraph (d)(3) for any taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1991 (and for all subsequent taxable years) when it adopts its overall method of accounting for bad debts, by attaching a statement to this effect to its income tax return for that year. Any other bank makes an election for any taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1991 (and for all subsequent taxable years) by filing a completed Form 3115 (Application for Change in Accounting Method) in accordance with the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
) or (
3
) of this section. The statement or Form 3115 must include the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the electing bank and contain a declaration that the express determination requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this section is satisfied for the taxable year of the election. When a Form 3115 is used, the declaration must be made in the space provided on the form for “Other changes in method of accounting.” The words “ELECTION UNDER § 1.166-2(d)(3)” must be typed or legibly printed at the top of the statement or page 1 of the Form 3115.
(
2
)
First election.
The first time a bank makes this election, the statement or Form 3115 must be attached to the bank's timely filed return (taking into account extensions of time to file) for the first taxable year covered by the election. The consent of the Commissioner to make a change in method of accounting under this paragraph (d)(3) is granted, pursuant to section 446(e), to any bank that makes the election in accordance with this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C), provided the bank has not made a prior election under this paragraph (d)(3).
(
3
)
Subsequent elections.
The advance consent of the Commissioner is required to make any election under this paragraph (d)(3) after a previous election has been revoked pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section. This consent must be requested under the procedures, terms, and conditions prescribed under the authority of section 446(e) and § 1.446-1(e) for requesting a change in method of accounting.
(D)
Express determination requirement.
In connection with its most recent examination involving the bank's loan review process, the bank's supervisory authority must have made an express determination (in accordance with any applicable administrative procedure prescribed hereunder) that the bank maintains and applies loan loss classification standards that are consistent with the regulatory standards of that supervisory authority. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D), the supervisory authority of a bank is the
appropriate Federal banking agency
for the bank, as that term is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(q), or, in the case of an institution in the Farm Credit System, the Farm Credit Administration.
(E)
Transition period election.
For taxable years ending before completion of the first examination of the bank by its supervisory authority (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this section) that is after October 1, 1992, and that involves the bank's loan review process, the statement or Form 3115 filed by the bank must include a declaration that the bank maintains and applies loan loss classification standards that are consistent with the regulatory standards of that supervisory authority. A bank that makes this declaration is deemed to satisfy the express determination requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this section for
those years, even though an express determination has not yet been made.
(iv)
Revocation of Election
—(A)
In general.
Revocation of an election under this paragraph (d)(3) constitutes a change in method of accounting that has the effects described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this section. If an election under this paragraph (d)(3) has been revoked, a bank may make a subsequent election only under the provisions of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C)(
3
) of this section.
(B)
Effect of change in method of accounting.
A change in method of accounting resulting from revocation of an election under this paragraph (d)(3) does not require or permit an adjustment under section 481(a). Under this cut-off approach—
(
1
) There is no change in the § 1.1011-1 adjusted basis of the bank's existing debts (as determined under this paragraph (d)(3) method or any other former method of accounting used by the bank with respect to its bad debts) as a result of the change in method of accounting; and
(
2
) Bad debt deductions in the year of change and thereafter with respect to all debts held by the bank, whether in existence at the beginning of the year of change or subsequently originated or acquired, are determined under the new method of accounting.
(C)
Automatic revocation
—(
1
)
In general
—A bank's election under this paragraph (d)(3) is revoked automatically if, in connection with any examination involving the bank's loan review process by the bank's supervisory authority as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(D) of this section, the bank does not obtain the express determination required by that paragraph.
(
2
)
Year of revocation.
If a bank makes the conformity election under the transition rules of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(E) of this section and does not obtain the express determination in connection with the first examination involving the bank's loan review process that is after October 1, 1992, the election is revoked as of the beginning of the taxable year of the election or, if later, the earliest taxable year for which tax may be assessed. In other cases in which a bank does not obtain an express determination in connection with an examination of its loan review process, the election is revoked as of the beginning of the taxable year that includes the date as of which the supervisory authority conducts the examination even if the examination is completed in the following taxable year.
(
3
)
Consent granted.
Under the Commissioner's authority in section 446(e) and § 1.446-1(e), the bank is directed to and is granted consent to change from this paragraph (3)(1) method as of the year of revocation (year of change) prescribed by paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C)(
2
) of this section.
(
4
)
Requirements.
A bank changing its method of accounting under the automatic revocation rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) must attach a completed Form 3115 to its income tax return for the year of revocation prescribed by paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C)(
2
) of this section. The words “REVOCATION OF § 1.166-2(d)(3) ELECTION” must be typed or legibly printed at the top of page 1 of the Form 3115. If the year of revocation is a year for which the bank has already filed its income tax return, the bank must file an amended return for that year reflecting its change in method of accounting and must attach the completed Form 3115 to that amended return. The bank also must file amended returns reflecting the new method of accounting for all subsequent taxable years for which returns have been filed and tax may be assessed.
(D)
Revocation by Commissioner.
An election under this paragraph (d)(3) may be revoked by the Commissioner as of the beginning of any taxable year for which a bank fails to follow the method of accounting prescribed by this paragraph. In addition, the Commissioner may revoke an election as of the beginning of any taxable year for which the Commissioner determines that a bank has taken charge-offs and deductions that, under all facts and circumstances existing at the time, were substantially in excess of those warranted by the exercise of reasonable business judgment in applying the regulatory standards of the bank's supervisory authority as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(III)(D) of this section.
(E)
Voluntary revocation.
A bank may apply for revocation of its election
made under this paragraph (d)(3) by timely filing a completed Form 3115 for the appropriate year and obtaining the consent of the Commissioner in accordance with section 446(e) and § 1.446-1(e) (including any applicable administrative procedures prescribed thereunder). The words “REVOCATION OF § 1.166-2(d)(3) ELECTION” must be typed or legibly printed at the top of page 1 of the Form 3115. If any bank has had its election automatically revoked pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section and has not changed its method of accounting in accordance with the requirements of that paragraph, the Commissioner will require that any voluntary change in method of accounting under this paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(E) be implemented retroactively pursuant to the same amended return terms and conditions as are prescribed by paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section.
(4)
Definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)—
(i)
Bank.
The term
bank
has the meaning assigned to it by section 581. The term
bank
also includes any corporation that would be a bank within the meaning of section 581 except for the fact that it is a foreign corporation, but this paragraph (d) applies only with respect to loans the interest on which is effectively connected with the conduct of a banking business within the United States. In addition, the term
bank
includes a Farm Credit System institution that is subject to supervision by the Farm Credit Administration.
(ii)
Charge-off.
For banks regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision, the term
charge-off
includes the establishment of specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of 100 percent of the portion of the debt classified as loss.

§ 1.166-3
Partial or total worthlessness.
(a)
Partial worthlessness
—(1)
Applicable to specific debts only.
A deduction under section 166(a)(2) on account of partially worthless debts shall be allowed with respect to specific debts only.
(2)
Charge-off required.
(i) If, from all the surrounding and attending circumstances, the district director is satisfied that a debt is partially worthless, the amount which has become worthless shall be allowed as a deduction under section 166(a)(2) but only to the extent charged off during the taxable year.
(ii) If a taxpayer claims a deduction for a part of a debt for the taxable year within which that part of the debt is charged off and the deduction is disallowed for that taxable year, then, in a case where the debt becomes partially worthless after the close of that taxable year, a deduction under section 166(a)(2) shall be allowed for a subsequent taxable year but not in excess of the amount charged off in the prior taxable year plus any amount charged off in the subsequent taxable year. In such instance, the charge-off in the prior taxable year shall, if consistently maintained as such, be sufficient to that extent to meet the charge-off requirement of section 166(a)(2) with respect to the subsequent taxable year.
(iii) Before a taxpayer may deduct a debt in part, he must be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the district director the amount thereof which is worthless and the part thereof which has been charged off.
(3)
Significantly modified debt
—(i)
Deemed charge-off.
If a significant modification of a debt instrument (within the meaning of § 1.1001-3) during a taxable year results in the recognition of gain by a taxpayer under § 1.1001-1(a), and if the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section are met, there is a deemed charge-off of the debt during that taxable year in the amount specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Requirements for deemed charge-off.
A debt is deemed to have been charged off only if—
(A) The taxpayer (or, in the case of a debt that constitutes transferred basis property within the meaning of section 7701(a)(43), a transferor taxpayer) has claimed a deduction for partial worthlessness of the debt in any prior taxable year; and
(B) Each prior charge-off and deduction for partial worthlessness satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section.
(iii)
Amount of deemed charge-off.
The amount of the deemed charge-off, if any, is the amount by which the tax basis of the debt exceeds the greater of the fair market value of the debt or the amount of the debt recorded on the taxpayer's books and records reduced as appropriate for a specific allowance for loan losses. The amount of the deemed charge-off, however, may not exceed the amount of recognized gain described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
(iv)
Effective date.
This paragraph (a)(3) applies to significant modifications of debt instruments occurring on or after September 23, 1996.
(b)
Total worthlessness.
If a debt becomes wholly worthless during the taxable year, the amount thereof which has not been allowed as a deduction from gross income for any prior taxable year shall be allowed as a deduction for the current taxable year.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 29, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8763, 63 FR 4396, Jan. 29, 1998]
§ 1.166-4
Reserve for bad debts.
(a)
Allowance of deduction.
A taxpayer who has established the reserve method of treating bad debts and has maintained proper reserve accounts for bad debts or who, in accordance with paragraph (b) of § 1.166-1, adopts the reserve method of treating bad debts may deduct from gross income a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts in lieu of deducting specific bad debt items. This paragraph applies both to bad debts owed to the taxpayer and to bad debts arising out of section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations. If a reserve is maintained for bad debts arising out of section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations, then a separate reserve must also be maintained for all other debt obligations of the taxpayer in the same trade or business, if any. A taxpayer may not maintain a reserve for bad debts arising out of section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations if with respect to direct debt obligations in the same trade or business the taxpayer takes deductions when the debts become worthless in whole or in part rather than maintaining a reserve for such obligations. See § 1.166-10 for rules concerning section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations.
(b)
Reasonableness of addition to reserve
—(1)
Relevant factors.
What constitutes a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts shall be determined in the light of the facts existing at the close of the taxable year of the proposed addition. The reasonableness of the addition will vary as between classes of business and with conditions of business prosperity. It will depend primarily upon the total amount of debts outstanding as of the close of the taxable year, including those arising currently as well as those arising in prior taxable years, and the total amount of the existing reserve.
(2)
Correction of errors in prior estimates.
In the event that subsequent realizations upon outstanding debts prove to be more or less than estimated at the time of the creation of the existing reserve, the amount of the excess or inadequacy in the existing reserve shall be reflected in the determination of the reasonable addition necessary in the current taxable year.
(c)
Statement required.
A taxpayer using the reserve method shall file with his return a statement showing—
(1) The volume of his charge sales or other business transactions for the taxable year and the percentage of the reserve to such amount;
(2) The total amount of notes and accounts receivable at the beginning and close of the taxable year;
(3) The amount of the debts which have become wholly or partially worthless and have been charged against the reserve account; and
(4) The computation of the addition to the reserve for bad debts.
(d)
Special rules applicable to financial institutions.
For special rules for the addition to the bad debt reserves of certain banks, see §§ 1.585-1 through 1.585-3.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6728, 29 FR 5855, May 5, 1964; T.D. 7444, 41 FR 53481, Dec. 7, 1976; T.D. 8071, 51 FR 2479, Jan. 17, 1986; T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9233, Mar. 14, 2019]
§ 1.166-5
Nonbusiness debts.
(a)
Allowance of deduction as capital loss.
(1) The loss resulting from any nonbusiness debt's becoming partially or wholly worthless within the taxable year shall not be allowed as a deduction under either section 166(a) or section 166(c) in determining the taxable income of a taxpayer other than a corporation. See section 166(d)(1)(A).
(2) If, in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, a nonbusiness debt becomes wholly worthless within the taxable year, the loss resulting therefrom shall be treated as a loss from the sale or exchange, during the taxable year, of a capital asset held for not more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977). Such a loss is subject to the limitations provided in section 1211, relating to the limitation on capital losses, and section 1212, relating to the capital loss carryover, and in the regulations under those sections. A loss on a nonbusiness debt shall be treated as sustained only if and when the debt has become totally worthless, and no deduction shall be allowed for a nonbusiness debt which is recoverable in part during the taxable year.
(b)
Nonbusiness debt defined.
For purposes of section 166 and this section, a nonbusiness debt is any debt other than—
(1) A debt which is created, or acquired, in the course of a trade or business of the taxpayer, determined without regard to the relationship of the debt to a trade or business of the taxpayer at the time when the debt becomes worthless; or
(2) A debt the loss from the worthlessness of which is incurred in the taxpayer's trade or business.
The question whether a debt is a nonbusiness debt is a question of fact in each particular case. The determination of whether the loss on a debt's becoming worthless has been incurred in a trade or business of the taxpayer shall, for this purpose, be made in substantially the same manner for determining whether a loss has been incurred in a trade or business for purposes of section 165(c)(1). For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the character of the debt is to be determined by the relation which the loss resulting from the debt's becoming worthless bears to the trade or business of the taxpayer. If that relation is a proximate one in the conduct of the trade or business in which the taxpayer is engaged at the time the debt becomes worthless, the debt comes within the exception provided by that subparagraph. The use to which the borrowed funds are put by the debtor is of no consequence in making a determination under this paragraph. For purposes of section 166 and this section, a nonbusiness debt does not include a debt described in section 165(g)(2)(C). See § 1.165-5, relating to losses on worthless securities.
(c)
Guaranty of obligations.
For provisions treating a loss sustained by a guarantor of obligations as a loss resulting from the worthlessness of a debt, see §§ 1.166-8 and 1.166-9.
(d)
Examples.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples involving a case where A, an individual who is engaged in the grocery business and who makes his return on the basis of the calendar year, extends credit to B in 1955 on an open account:

# Example 1.
In 1956 A sells the business but retains the claim against B. The claim becomes worthless in A's hands in 1957. A's loss is not controlled by the nonbusiness debt provisions, since the original consideration has been advanced by A in his trade or business.

# Example 2.
In 1956 A sells the business to C but sells the claim against B to the taxpayer, D. The claim becomes worthless in D's hands in 1957. During 1956 and 1957, D is not engaged in any trade or business. D's loss is controlled by the nonbusiness debt provisions even though the original consideration has been advanced by A in his trade or business, since the debt has not been created or acquired in connection with a trade or business of D and since in 1957 D is not engaged in a trade or business incident to the conduct of which a loss from the worthlessness of such claim is a proximate result.

# Example 3.
In 1956 A dies, leaving the business, including the accounts receivable, to his son, C, the taxpayer. The claim against B becomes worthless in C's hands in 1957. C's loss is not controlled by the nonbusiness debt provisions. While C does not advance any consideration for the claim, or create or acquire it in connection with his trade or business, the loss is sustained as a proximate
incident to the conduct of the trade or business in which he is engaged at the time the debt becomes worthless.

# Example 4.
In 1956 A dies, leaving the business to his son, C, but leaving the claim against B to his son, D, the taxpayer. The claim against B becomes worthless in D's hands in 1957. During 1956 and 1957, D is not engaged in any trade or business. D's loss is controlled by the nonbusiness debt provisions even though the original consideration has been advanced by A in his trade or business, since the debt has not been created or acquired in connection with a trade or business of D and since in 1957 D is not engaged in a trade or business incident to the conduct of which a loss from the worthlessness of such claim is a proximate result.

# Example 5.
In 1956 A dies; and, while his executor, C, is carrying on the business, the claim against B becomes worthless in 1957. The loss sustained by A's estate is not controlled by the nonbusiness debt provisions. While C does not advance any consideration for the claim on behalf of the estate, or create or acquire it in connection with a trade or business in which the estate is engaged, the loss is sustained as a proximate incident to the conduct of the trade or business in which the estate is engaged at the time the debt becomes worthless.

# Example 6.
In 1956, A, in liquidating the business, attempts to collect the claim against B but finds that it has become worthless. A's loss is not controlled by the nonbusiness debt provisions, since the original consideration has been advanced by A in his trade or business and since a loss incurred in liquidating a trade or business is a proximate incident to the conduct thereof.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7657, 44 FR 68464, Nov. 29, 1979; T.D. 7728, 45 FR 72650, Nov. 3, 1980]
§ 1.166-6
Sale of mortgaged or pledged property.
(a)
Deficiency deductible as bad debt
—(1)
Principal amount.
If mortgaged or pledged property is lawfully sold (whether to the creditor or another purchaser) for less than the amount of the debt, and the portion of the indebtedness remaining unsatisfied after the sale is wholly or partially uncollectible, the mortgagee or pledgee may deduct such amount under section 166(a) (to the extent that it constitutes capital or represents an item the income from which has been returned by him) as a bad debt for the taxable year in which it becomes wholly worthless or is charged off as partially worthless. See § 1.166-3.
(2)
Accrued interest.
Accrued interest may be included as part of the deduction allowable under this paragraph, but only if it has previously been returned as income.
(b)
Realization of gain or loss
—(1)
Determination of amount.
If, in the case of a sale described in paragraph (a) of this section, the creditor buys in the mortgaged or pledged property, loss or gain is also realized, measured by the difference between the amount of those obligations of the debtor which are applied to the purchase or bid price of the property (to the extent that such obligations constitute capital or represent an item the income from which has been returned by the creditor) and the fair market value of the property.
(2)
Fair market value defined.
The fair market value of the property for this purpose shall, in the absence of clear and convincing proof to the contrary, be presumed to be the amount for which it is bid in by the taxpayer.
(c)
Basis of property purchased.
If the creditor subsequently sells the property so acquired, the basis for determining gain or loss upon the subsequent sale is the fair market value of the property at the date of its acquisition by the creditor.
(d)
Special rules applicable to certain banking organizations.
For special rules relating to the treatment of mortgaged or pledged property by certain mutual savings banks, domestic building and loan associations, and cooperative banks, see section 595 and the regulations thereunder.
(e)
Special rules applicable to certain reacquisitions of real property.
Notwithstanding this section, special rules apply for taxable years beginning after September 2, 1964 (and for certain taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957), to the gain or loss on certain reacquisitions of real property, to indebtedness remaining unsatisfied as a result of such reacquisitions, and to the basis of the reacquired real property. See §§ 1.1038-1 through 1.1038-3.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6814, 30 FR 4472, Apr. 7, 1965, T.D. 6916, 32 FR 5923, Apr. 13, 1967]
§ 1.166-7
Worthless bonds issued by an individual.
(a)
Allowance of deduction.
A bond or other similar obligation issued by an individual, if it becomes worthless in whole or in part, is subject to the bad debt provisions of section 166. The loss from the worthlessness of any such bond or obligation is deductible in accordance with section 166(a), unless such bond or obligation is a nonbusiness debt as defined in section 166(d)(2). If the bond or obligation is a nonbusiness debt, it is subject to section 166(d) and § 1.166-5.
(b)
Decline in market value.
A taxpayer possessing debts evidenced by bonds or other similar obligations issued by an individual shall not be allowed any deduction under section 166 on account of mere market fluctuation in the value of such obligations.
(c)
Worthless bonds issued by corporation.
For provisions allowing the deduction under section 165(a) of the loss sustained upon the worthlessness of any bond or similar obligation issued by a corporation or a government, see § 1.165-5.
(d)
Application to inventories.
This section does not apply to any loss upon the worthlessness of any bond or similar obligation reflected in inventories required to be taken by a dealer in securities under section 471. See § 1.471-5.
§ 1.166-8
Losses of guarantors, endorsers, and indemnitors incurred on agreements made before January 1, 1976.
(a)
Noncorporate obligations
—(1)
Deductible as bad debt.
A payment during the taxable year by a taxpayer other than a corporation in discharge of part or all of his obligation as a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor of an obligation issued by a person other than a corporation shall, for purposes of section 166 and the regulations thereunder, be treated as a debt's becoming worthless within the taxable year, if—
(i) The proceeds of the obligation so issued have been used in the trade or business of the borrower, and
(ii) The borrower's obligation to the person to whom the taxpayer's payment is made is worthless at the time of payment except for the existence of the guaranty, endorsement, or indemnity, whether or not such obligation has in fact become worthless within the taxable year in which payment is made.
(2)
Nonbusiness debt rule not applicable.
If a payment is treated as a loss in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, section 166(d), relating to the special rule for losses sustained on the worthlessness of a nonbusiness debt, shall not apply. Accordingly, in each instance the loss shall be deducted under section 166(a)(1) as a wholly worthless debt even though there has been a discharge of only a part of the taxpayer's obligation. Thus, if the taxpayer makes a payment during the taxable year in discharge of only part of his obligation as a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor, he may treat such payment under section 166(a)(1) as a debt's becoming wholly worthless within the taxable year, provided that he can establish that such part of the borrower's obligation to the person to whom the taxpayer's payment is made is worthless at the time of payment and the conditions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph have otherwise been satisfied.
(3)
Other applicable provisions.
Other provisions of the internal revenue laws relating to bad debts, such as section 111, relating to the recovery of bad debts, shall be deemed to apply to any payment which, under the provisions of this paragraph, is treated as a bad debt. If the requirements of section 166(f) are not met, any loss sustained by a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor upon the worthlessness of the debtor's obligation shall be treated under the provisions of law applicable thereto. See, for example, paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Corporate obligations.
The loss sustained during the taxable year by a taxpayer other than a corporation in discharge of all of his obligation as a guarantor of an obligation issued by a corporation shall be treated, in accordance with section 166(d) and the regulations thereunder, as a loss sustained on the worthlessness of a nonbusiness debt if the debt created in the guarantor's favor as a result of the payment does
not come within the exceptions prescribed by section 166(d)(2) (A) or (B). See paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.166-5.
(c)
Examples.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
During 1955, A, an individual who makes his return on the basis of the calendar year, guarantees payment of an obligation of B, an individual, to the X Bank, the proceeds of the obligation being used in B's business. B defaults on his obligation in 1956. A makes payment to the X Bank during 1957 in discharge of his entire obligation as a guarantor, the obligation of B to the X Bank being wholly worthless. For his taxable year 1957, A is entitled to a deduction under section 166(a)(1) as a result of his payment during that year.

# Example 2.
During 1955, A, an individual who makes his return on the basis of the calendar year, guarantees payment of an obligation of B, an individual, to the X Bank, the proceeds of the obligation being used in B's business. In 1956, B pays a part of his obligation to the X Bank but defaults on the remaining part. In 1957, A makes payment to the X Bank, in discharge of part of his obligation as a guarantor, of the remaining unpaid part of B's obligation to the bank, such part of B's obligation then being worthless. For his taxable year 1957, A is entitled to a deduction under section 166(a) (1) as a result of his payment of the remaining unpaid part of B's obligation.

# Example 3.
During 1955, A, an individual who makes his return on the basis of the calendar year, guarantees payment of an obligation of B, an individual, to the X Bank, the proceeds of the obligation being used for B's personal use. B defaults on his obligation in 1956. A makes payment to the X Bank during 1957 in discharge of his entire obligation as a guarantor, the obligation of B to X Bank being wholly worthless. A may not apply the benefit of section 166(f) to his loss, since the proceeds of B's obligation have not been used in B's trade or business.

# Example 4.
During 1955, A, an individual who makes his return on the basis of the calendar year, guarantees payment of an obligation of Y Corporation to the X Bank, the proceeds of the obligation being used in Y Corporation's business. Y Corporation defaults on its obligation in 1956. A makes payment to the X Bank during 1957 in discharge of his entire obligation as a guarantor, the obligation of Y Corporation to the X Bank being wholly worthless. At no time during 1955 or 1957 is A engaged in a trade or business. For his taxable year 1957, A is entitled to deduct a capital loss in accordance with the provisions of section 166(d) and paragraph (a) (2) of § 1.166-5. He may not apply the benefit of section 166(f) to his loss, since his payment is in discharge of an obligation issued by a corporation.
(d)
Effective date.
This section applies only to losses, regardless of the taxable year in which incurred, on agreements made before January 1, 1976.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7657, 44 FR 68464, Nov. 29, 1979]
§ 1.166-9
Losses of guarantors, endorsers, and indemnitors incurred, on agreements made after December 31, 1975, in taxable years beginning after such date.
(a)
Payment treated as worthless business debt.
This paragraph applies to taxpayers who, after December 31, 1975, enter into an agreement in the course of their trade or business to act as (or in a manner essentially equivalent to) a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor of (or other secondary obligor upon) a debt obligation. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, a payment of principal or interest made during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, by the taxpayer in discharge of part or all of the taxpayer's obligation as a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor is treated as a business debt becoming worthless in the taxable year in which the payment is made or in the taxable year described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Neither section 163 (relating to interest) nor section 165 (relating to losses) shall apply with respect to such a payment.
(b)
Payment treated as worthless nonbusiness debt.
This paragraph applies to taxpayers (other than corporations) who, after December 31, 1975, enter into a transaction for profit, but not in the course of their trade or business, to act as (or in a manner essentially equivalent to) a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor of (or other secondary obligor upon) a debt obligation. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, a payment of principal or interest made during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, by the taxpayer in discharge of part or all of the taxpayer's obligation as a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor is treated as a worthless nonbusiness debt in the taxable year in which the payment is made or in the taxable year
described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Neither section 163 nor section 165 shall apply with respect to such a payment.
(c)
Obligations issued by corporations.
No treatment as a worthless debt is allowed with respect to a payment made by the taxpayer in discharge of part or all of the taxpayer's obligation as a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor of an obligation issued by a corporation if, on the basis of the facts and circumstances at the time the obligation was entered into, the payment constitutes a contribution to capital by a shareholder. The rule of this paragraph (c) applies to payments whenever made (see paragraph (f) of this section).
(d)
Certain payments treated as worthless debts.
A payment in discharge of part or all of taxpayer's agreement to act as guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor of an obligation is to be treated as a worthless debt only if—
(1) The agreement was entered into in the course of the taxpayer's trade or business or a transaction for profit;
(2) There was an enforceable legal duty upon the taxpayer to make the payment (except that legal action need not have been brought against the taxpayer); and
(3) The agreement was entered into before the obligation became worthless (or partially worthless in the case of an agreement entered into in the course of the taxpayer's trade or business). See §§ 1.166-2 and 1.166-3 for rules on worthless and partially worthless debts. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), an agreement is considered as entered into before the obligation became worthless (or partially worthless) if there was a reasonable expectation on the part of the taxpayer at the time the agreement was entered into that the taxpayer would not be called upon to pay the debt (subject to such agreement) without full reimbursement from the issuer of the obligation.
(e)
Special rules
—(1)
Reasonable consideration required.
Treatment as a worthless debt of a payment made by a taxpayer in discharge of part or all of the taxpayer's agreement to act as a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor of an obligation is allowed only if the taxpayer demonstrates that reasonable consideration was received for entering into the agreement. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1), reasonable consideration is not limited to direct consideration in the form of cash or property. Thus, where a taxpayer can demonstrate that the agreement was given without direct consideration in the form of cash or property but in accordance with normal business practice or for a good faith business purpose, worthless debt treatment is allowed with respect to a payment in discharge of part or all of the agreement if the conditions of this section are met. However, consideration received from a taxpayer's spouse or any individual listed in section 152(a) must be direct consideration in the form of cash or property.
(2)
Right of subrogation.
With respect to a payment made by a taxpayer in discharge of part or all of the taxpayer's agreement to act as a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor where the agreement provides for a right of subrogation or other similar right against the issuer, treatment as a worthless debt is not allowed until the taxable year in which the right of subrogation or other similar right becomes totally worthless (or partially worthless in the case of an agreement which arose in the course of the taxpayer's trade or business).
(3)
Other applicable provisions.
Unless inconsistent with this section, other Internal Revenue laws concerning worthless debts, such as section 111 relating to the recovery of bad debts, apply to any payment which, under the provisions of this section, is treated as giving rise to a worthless debt.
(4)
Taxpayer defined.
For purposes of this section, except as otherwise provided, the term “taxpayer” means any taxpayer and includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, trusts and estates.
(f)
Effective date.
This section applies to losses incurred on agreements made after December 31, 1975, in taxable years beginning after such date. However, paragraph (c) of this section also applies to payments, regardless of the taxable year in which made, under
agreements made before January 1, 1976.
[T.D. 7657, 44 FR 68465, Nov. 29, 1979, as amended by T.D. 7920, 48 FR 50712, Nov. 3, 1983]
§ 1.166-10
Reserve for guaranteed debt obligations.
(a)
Definitions.
The following provisions apply for purposes of this section and section 166(f):
(1)
Dealer in property.
A dealer in property is a person who regularly sells property in the ordinary course of the person's trade or business.
(2)
Guaranteed debt obligation.
A guaranteed debt obligation is a legal duty of one person as a guarantor, endorser or indemnitor of a second person to pay a third person. It does not include duties based solely on moral or good public relations considerations that are not legally binding. A guaranteed debt obligation typically arises where a seller receives in payment for property or services the debt obligation of a purchaser and sells that obligation to a third party with recourse. However, a guaranteed debt obligation also may arise out of a sale in respect of which there is no direct debtor-creditor relationship between the debtor purchaser and the seller. For example, it arises where a purchaser borrows money from a third party to make payment to the seller and the seller guarantees the payment of the purchaser's debt. Generally, debt obligations which are sold without recourse do not result in any obligation of the seller as a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor. However, there are certain without-recourse transactions which may give rise to a seller's liability as a guarantor or indemnitor. For example, such a liability may arise where a holder of a debt obligation holds money or other property of a seller which the holder may apply, without seeking permission of the seller, against any uncollectible debt obligations transferred to the holder by the seller without recourse, or where the seller is under a legal obligation to reacquire the real or tangible personal property from the holder of the debt obligation who repossessed property in satisfaction of the debt obligations.
(3)
Real or tangible personal property.
Real or tangible personal property generally does not include other forms of property, such as securities. However, if the sale of other property is related to the sale of actual real or tangible personal property, the other property will be considered to be real or tangible personal property. In order for the sale of other property to be related, it must be—
(i) Incidental to the sale of the actual real or tangible personal property; and
(ii) Made under an agreement, entered into at the same time as the sale of actual real or tangible personal property, between the dealer in that property and the customer with respect to that property.
The other property may be charged for as a part of, or in addition to, the sales price of the actual real or tangible personal property. If the value of the other property is not greater than 20 percent of the total sales price, including the value of all related services other than financing services, the sale of the other property is related to the sale of actual real or tangible personal property.
(4)
Related services.
In the case of a sale of both property and services a determination must be made as to whether the services are related to the property. Related services include only those services which are—
(i) Incidental to the sale of the real or tangible personal property; and
(ii) To be performed under an agreement, entered into at the same time as the sale of the property, between the dealer in property and the customer with respect to the property.
Delivery, financing installation. maintenance, repair, or instructional services generally qualify as related services. The services may be charged for as a part of, or in addition to, the sales price of the property. Where the value of all services other than financing services is not greater than 20 percent of the total of the sales price of the property, including the value of all the services other than financing services, all of the services are considered to be incidental to the sale of the property. Where the value of the services is greater than 20 percent, the determination as to whether a service is a related
service in a particular case is to be made on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples apply to paragraph (a)(4) of this section:

# Example 1.
A. a dealer in television sets sells a television set to B, his customer. If at the time of the sale A, for a separate charge which is added to the sales price of the set and which is not greater than 20 percent of the total sales price, provides a 3-year service contract on only that television set, the service contract is a related service agreement. However, if A does not sell the service contract to B contemporaneously with the sale of the television set, as would be the case if the service agreement were entered into after the sale of the set were completed, or if the service contract includes services for a television set in addition to the one then sold by A to B, the service contract is not an agreement for a related service.

# Example 2.
C, an automobile dealer, at the time of the sale by C of an automobile to D, agrees to made available to D driving instructions furnished by the M driving school, the cost of which is included in the sale price of the automobile and is not greater than 20 percent of the total sales price. C also agrees to pay M for the driving instructions furnished to D. Since C's agreement with D to make available driving instructions is incidental to the sale of the automobile, is made contemporaneously with the sale, and is charged for as part of the sales price of the automobile, it is an agreement for a related service. In contrast, however, because M's agreement with C is not an agreement between the dealer in property and the customer, M's agreement with C to provide driving instructions to C's customers is not an agreement for a related service.
(b)
Incorporation of section 166(c) rules.
A reserve for section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations must be established and maintained under the rules applicable to the reserve for bad debts under section 166(c) (with the exception of the statement requirement under § 1.166-4 (c)). For example, the rules in § 1.166-4(b), relating to what constitutes a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts and to correction of errors in prior estimates, apply to a reserve for section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations as well.
(c)
Special requirements.
Any reserve for section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations must be established and maintained separately from any reserve for other debt obligations. In addition, a taxpayer who charges off direct debts when they become worthless in whole or in part rather than maintaining a reserve for such obligations may not maintain a reserve for section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations in the same trade or business.
(d)
Requirement of statement.
A taxpayer who uses the reserve method of treating section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations must attach to his return for each taxable year, returns for which are filed after April 17, 1986, and for each trade or business for which the reserve is maintained a statement showing—
(1) The total amount of these obligations at the beginning of the taxable year;
(2) The total amount of these obligations incurred during the taxable year;
(3) The amount of the initial balance of the suspense account, if any, established with respect to these obligations;
(4) The balance of the suspense account, if any, at the beginning of the taxable year,
(5) The adjustment, if any, to that account;
(6) The adjusted balance, if any, at the close of the taxable year;
(7) The reconciliation of the beginning and closing balances of the reserve for these obligations and the computation of the addition to the reserve; and
(8) The taxable year for which the reserve for these obligations was established.
(e)
Computation of opening balance
—(1)
In general.
The opening balance of a reserve for section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations established for the first taxable year for which a taxpayer maintains such a reserve shall be determined as if the taxpayer had maintained such a reserve for the taxable years preceding that taxable year. The amount of the opening balance may be determined under the following formula:
EC14NO91.176
where—
OB = the opening balance at the beginning of the first taxable year
CG = the amount of these obligations at the close of the last preceding taxable year
SG = the sum of the amounts of these obligations at the close of the five preceding taxable years
SNL the sum of the amounts of net losses arising from these obligations for the five preceding taxable years
(2)
Example.
The following example applies to paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

# Example.
For 1977, A, a dealer in automobiles who uses the calendar year as the taxable year, adopts in accordance with this section the reserve method of treating section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations. A's first year in business as an automobile dealer is 1973. For 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, and 1976, A's records disclose the following information with respect to these obligations:

More appropriate balance.
A taxpayer may select a balance other than the one produced under paragraph (e)(1) of this section if it is more appropriate, based upon the taxpayer's actual experience, and in the event the taxpayer's return is examined, if the balance is approved by the district director.
(4)
No losses in the five preceding taxable years.
If a taxpayer is in the taxpayer's first taxable year of a particular trade or business, or if the taxpayer has no losses arising from section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations in a particular trade or business for any other reason in the five preceding taxable years, then the taxpayer's opening balance is zero for that particular trade or business.
(5)
Where reserve method was used before October 22, 1965.
If for a taxable year ending before October 22, 1965, the taxpayer maintained a reserve for bad debts under section 166(c) which included guaranteed debt obligations described in section 166(f)(1)(A), and if the taxpayer is allowed a deduction referred to in paragraph (g)(2) of this section on account of those obligations, the amount of the opening balance of the reserve for section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations for the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after October 21, 1965, shall be an amount equal to that portion of the section 166(c) reserve at the close of the last taxable year which is attributable to those debt obligations. The amount of the balance of the section 166(c) reserve for the taxable year shall be reduced by the amount of the opening balance of the reserve for those guaranteed debt obligations.
(f)
Suspense account

Example.
The following example applies to section 166(f)(4)(B), relating to adjustments to the suspense account:

# Example.
In 1977, A, an individual who operates an appliance store and uses the calendar year as the taxable year, adopts the reserve method of treating section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations. The initial balance of A's suspense account is $8,200. At the close of 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980, the balance of A's reserve for these obligations is $8,400, $8,250, $8,150, and $8,175, respectively, after making the addition to the reserve for each year.

Transitional rule.
Section 2(b) of the Act of November 2, 1966 (Pub. L. 89-722, 80 Stat. 1151) allows additions to section 166(c) bad debt reserves in earlier taxable years on account of section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations to be deducted for those earlier taxable years. Paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section do not apply in determining whether a deduction is allowed under section 2(b) of the Act. See Rev. Rul. 68-313 (1968-1C.B. 75) for rules relating to that deduction.
[T.D. 8071, 51 FR 2479, Jan. 17, 1986; 51 FR 9787, Mar. 21, 1986]
§ 1.167(a)-1
Depreciation in general.
(a)
Reasonable allowance.
Section 167(a) provides that a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear, and obsolescence of property used in the trade or business or of property held by the taxpayer for the production of income shall be allowed as a depreciation deduction. The allowance is that amount which should be set aside for the taxable year in accordance with a reasonably consistent plan (not necessarily at a uniform rate), so that the aggregate of the amounts set aside, plus the salvage value, will, at the end of the estimated useful life of the depreciable property, equal the cost or other basis of the property as provided in section 167(g) and § 1.167(g)-1. An asset shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value under any method of computing depreciation. However, see section 167(f) and § 1.167(f)-1 for rules which permit a reduction in the amount of salvage value to be taken into account for certain personal property acquired after October 16, 1962. See also paragraph (c) of this section for definition of salvage. The allowance shall not reflect amounts representing a mere reduction in market value. See section 179 and § 1.179-1 for a further description of the term “reasonable allowance.”
(b)
Useful life.
For the purpose of section 167 the estimated useful life of an asset is not necessarily the useful life inherent in the asset but is the period over which the asset may reasonably be expected to be useful to the taxpayer in his trade or business or in the production of his income. This period shall be determined by reference to his experience with similar property taking into account present conditions and probable future developments. Some of the factors to be considered in determining this period are (1) wear and tear and decay or decline from natural causes, (2) the normal progress of the art, economic changes, inventions, and current developments within the industry and the taxpayer's trade or business, (3) the climatic and other local conditions peculiar to the taxpayer's trade or business, and (4) the taxpayer's policy as to repairs, renewals, and replacements. Salvage value is not a factor for the purpose of determining useful life. If the taxpayer's experience is inadequate, the general experience in the industry may be used until such time as the taxpayer's own experience forms an adequate basis for making the determination. The estimated remaining useful life may be subject to modification by reason of conditions known to exist at the end of the taxable year and shall be redetermined when necessary regardless of the method of computing depreciation. However, estimated remaining useful life shall be redetermined only when the change in the useful life is significant and there is a clear and convincing basis for the redetermination. For rules covering agreements with respect to useful life, see section 167(d) and § 1.167(d)-1. If a taxpayer claims an investment credit with respect to an asset for a taxable year preceding the taxable year in which the asset is considered as placed in service under
§ 1.167(a)-10(b) or § 1.167(a)-11(e), the useful life of the asset under this paragraph shall be the same useful life assigned to the asset under § 1.46-3(e).
(c)
Salvage.
(1) Salvage value is the amount (determined at the time of acquisition) which is estimated will be realizable upon sale or other disposition of an asset when it is no longer useful in the taxpayer's trade or business or in the production of his income and is to be retired from service by the taxpayer. Salvage value shall not be changed at any time after the determination made at the time of acquisition merely because of changes in price levels. However, if there is a redetermination of useful life under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section, salvage value may be redetermined based upon facts known at the time of such redetermination of useful life. Salvage, when reduced by the cost of removal, is referred to as net salvage. The time at which an asset is retired from service may vary according to the policy of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer's policy is to dispose of assets which are still in good operating condition, the salvage value may represent a relatively large proportion of the original basis of the asset. However, if the taxpayer customarily uses an asset until its inherent useful life has been substantially exhausted, salvage value may represent no more than junk value. Salvage value must be taken into account in determining the depreciation deduction either by a reduction of the amount subject to depreciation or by a reduction in the rate of depreciation, but in no event shall an asset (or an account) be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value. See, however, paragraph (a) of § 1.167(b)-2 for the treatment of salvage under the declining balance method, and § 1.179-1 for the treatment of salvage in computing the additional first-year depreciation allowance. The taxpayer may use either salvage or net salvage in determining depreciation allowances but such practice must be consistently followed and the treatment of the costs of removal must be consistent with the practice adopted. For specific treatment of salvage value, see §§ 1.167(b)-1, 1.167(b)-2, and 1.167(b)-3. When an asset is retired or disposed of, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the asset and depreciation reserve accounts. For example, the amount of the salvage adjusted for the costs of removal may be credited to the depreciation reserve.
(2) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, and ending after October 16, 1962, see section 167(f) and § 1.167(f)-1 for rules applicable to the reduction of salvage value taken into account for certain personal property acquired after October 16, 1962.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6712, 29 FR 3653, Mar. 24, 1964; T.D. 7203, 37 FR 17133, Aug. 25, 1972]
§ 1.167(a)-2
Tangible property.
The depreciation allowance in the case of tangible property applies only to that part of the property which is subject to wear and tear, to decay or decline from natural causes, to exhaustion, and to obsolescence. The allowance does not apply to inventories or stock in trade, or to land apart from the improvements or physical development added to it. The allowance does not apply to natural resources which are subject to the allowance for depletion provided in section 611. No deduction for depreciation shall be allowed on automobiles or other vehicles used solely for pleasure, on a building used by the taxpayer solely as his residence, or on furniture or furnishings therein, personal effects, or clothing; but properties and costumes used exclusively in a business, such as a theatrical business, may be depreciated.
§ 1.167(a)-3
Intangibles.
(a)
In general.
If an intangible asset is known from experience or other factors to be of use in the business or in the production of income for only a limited period, the length of which can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, such an intangible asset may be the subject of a depreciation allowance. Examples are patents and copyrights. An intangible asset, the useful life of which is not limited, is not subject to the allowance for depreciation. No allowance will be permitted merely because, in the unsupported opinion of the taxpayer, the intangible asset has a limited useful life. No deduction for depreciation is allowable with respect to
goodwill. For rules with respect to organizational expenditures, see section 248 and the regulations thereunder. For rules with respect to trademark and trade name expenditures, see section 177 and the regulations thereunder. See sections 197 and 167(f) and, to the extent applicable, §§ 1.197-2 and 1.167(a)-14 for amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles acquired after August 10, 1993, or after July 25, 1991, if a valid retroactive election under § 1.197-1T has been made.
(b)
Safe harbor amortization for certain intangible assets
—(1)
Useful life.
Solely for purposes of determining the depreciation allowance referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, a taxpayer may treat an intangible asset as having a useful life equal to 15 years unless—
(i) An amortization period or useful life for the intangible asset is specifically prescribed or prohibited by the Internal Revenue Code, the regulations thereunder (other than by this paragraph (b)), or other published guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter);
(ii) The intangible asset is described in § 1.263(a)-4(c) (relating to intangibles acquired from another person) or § 1.263(a)-4(d)(2) (relating to created financial interests);
(iii) The intangible asset has a useful life the length of which can be estimated with reasonable accuracy; or
(iv) The intangible asset is described in § 1.263(a)-4(d)(8) (relating to certain benefits arising from the provision, production, or improvement of real property), in which case the taxpayer may treat the intangible asset as having a useful life equal to 25 years solely for purposes of determining the depreciation allowance referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
Applicability to acquisitions of a trade or business, changes in the capital structure of a business entity, and certain other transactions.
The safe harbor useful life provided by paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to an amount required to be capitalized by § 1.263(a)-5 (relating to amounts paid to facilitate an acquisition of a trade or business, a change in the capital structure of a business entity, and certain other transactions).
(3)
Depreciation method.
A taxpayer that determines its depreciation allowance for an intangible asset using the 15-year useful life prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section (or the 25-year useful life in the case of an intangible asset described in § 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)) must determine the allowance by amortizing the basis of the intangible asset (as determined under section 167(c) and without regard to salvage value) ratably over the useful life beginning on the first day of the month in which the intangible asset is placed in service by the taxpayer. The intangible asset is not eligible for amortization in the month of disposition.
(4)
Effective date.
This paragraph (b) applies to intangible assets created on or after December 31, 2003.

§ 1.167(a)-4
Leased property.
(a)
In general.
Capital expenditures made by either a lessee or lessor for the erection of a building or for other permanent improvements on leased property are recovered by the lessee or lessor under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) applicable to the cost recovery of the building or improvements, if subject to depreciation or amortization, without regard to the period of the lease. For example, if the building or improvement is property to which section 168 applies, the lessee or lessor determines the depreciation deduction for the building or improvement under section 168. See section 168(i)(8)(A). If the improvement is property to which section 167 or section 197 applies, the lessee or lessor determines the depreciation or amortization deduction for the improvement under section 167 or section 197, as applicable.
(b)
Effective/applicability date

For leasehold improvements placed in service
after December 31, 1986, in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2014, a taxpayer may—
(i) Apply the provisions of this section; or
(ii) Depreciate any leasehold improvement to which section 168 applies under the provisions of section 168 and depreciate or amortize any leasehold improvement to which section 168 does not apply under the provisions of the Code that are applicable to the cost recovery of that leasehold improvement, without regard to the period of the lease.

§ 1.167(a)-5
Apportionment of basis.
In the case of the acquisition on or after March 1, 1913, of a combination of depreciable and nondepreciable property for a lump sum, as for example, buildings and land, the basis for depreciation cannot exceed an amount which bears the same proportion to the lump sum as the value of the depreciable property at the time of acquisition bears to the value of the entire property at that time. In the case of property which is subject to both the allowance for depreciation and amortization, depreciation is allowable only with respect to the portion of the depreciable property which is not subject to the allowance for amortization and may be taken concurrently with the allowance for amortization. After the close of the amortization period or after amortization deductions have been discontinued with respect to any such property, the unrecovered cost or other basis of the depreciable portion of such property will be subject to depreciation. For adjustments to basis, see section 1016 and other applicable provisions of law. For the adjustment to the basis of a structure in the case of a donation of a qualified conservation contribution under section 170(h), see § 1.170A-14(h)(3)(iii).

§ 1.167(a)-6
Depreciation in special cases.
(a)
Depreciation of patents or copyrights.
The cost or other basis of a patent or copyright shall be depreciated over its remaining useful life. Its cost to the patentee includes the various Government fees, cost of drawings, models, attorneys' fees, and similar expenditures. For rules applicable to research and experimental expenditures, see sections 174 and 1016 and the regulations thereunder. If a patent or copyright becomes valueless in any year before its expiration the unrecovered cost or other basis may be deducted in that year. See § 1.167(a)-14(c)(4) for depreciation of a separately acquired interest in a patent or copyright described in section 167(f)(2) acquired after January 25, 2000. See § 1.197-2 for amortization of interests in patents and copyrights that constitute amortizable section 197 intangibles.
(b)
Depreciation in case of farmers.
A reasonable allowance for depreciation
may be claimed on farm buildings (except a dwelling occupied by the owner), farm machinery, and other physical property but not including land. Livestock acquired for work, breeding, or dairy purposes may be depreciated unless included in an inventory used to determine profits in accordance with section 61 and the regulations thereunder. Such depreciation should be determined with reference to the cost or other basis, salvage value, and the estimated useful life of the livestock. See also section 162 and the regulations thereunder relating to trade or business expenses, section 165 and the regulations thereunder relating to losses of farmers, and section 175 and the regulations thereunder relating to soil or water conservation expenditures.

§ 1.167(a)-7
Accounting for depreciable property.
(a) Depreciable property may be accounted for by treating each individual item as an account, or by combining two or more assets in a single account. Assets may be grouped in an account in a variety of ways. For example, assets similar in kind with approximately the same useful lives may be grouped together. Such an account is commonly known as a group account. Another appropriate grouping might consist of assets segregated according to use without regard to useful life, for example, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, or transportation equipment. Such an account is commonly known as a classified account. A broader grouping, where assets are included in the same account regardless of their character or useful lives, is commonly referred to as a composite account. For example, all the assets used in a business may be included in a single account. Group, classified, or composite accounts may be further broken down on the basis of location, dates of acquisition, cost, character, use, etc.
(b) When group, classified, or composite accounts are used with average useful lives and a normal retirement occurs, the full cost or other basis of the asset retired, unadjusted for depreciation or salvage, shall be removed from the asset account and shall be charged to the depreciation reserve. Amounts representing salvage ordinarily are credited to the depreciation reserve. Where an asset is disposed of for reasons other than normal retirement, the full cost or other basis of the asset shall be removed from the asset account, and the depreciation reserve shall be charged with the depreciation applicable to the retired asset. For rules with respect to losses on normal retirements, see § 1.167 (a)-8.
(c) A taxpayer may establish as many accounts for depreciable property as he desires. Depreciation allowances shall be computed separately for each account. Such depreciation preferably should be recorded in a depreciation reserve account; however, in appropriate cases it may be recorded directly in the asset account. Where depreciation reserves are maintained, a separate reserve account shall be maintained for each asset account. The regular books of account or permanent auxiliary records shall show for each account the basis of the property, including adjustments necessary to conform to the requirements of section 1016 and other provisions of law relating to adjustments to basis, and the depreciation allowances for tax purposes. In the event that reserves for book purposes do not correspond with reserves maintained for tax purposes, permanent auxiliary records shall be maintained with the regular books of accounts reconciling the differences in depreciation for tax and book purposes because of different methods of depreciation, bases, rates, salvage, or other factors. Depreciation schedules filed with the income tax return shall show the accumulated reserves computed in accordance with the allowances for income tax purposes.
(d) In classified or composite accounts, the average useful life and rate shall be redetermined whenever additions, retirements, or replacements substantially alter the relative proportion of types of assets in the accounts. See example (2) in paragraph (b) of § 1.167(b)-1 for method of determining the depreciation rate for a classified or composite account.
(e)

§ 1.167(a)-8
Retirements.
(a)
Gains and losses on retirements.
For the purposes of this section the term “retirement” means the permanent withdrawal of depreciable property from use in the trade or business or in the production of income. The withdrawal may be made in one of several ways. For example, the withdrawal may be made by selling or exchanging the asset, or by actual abandonment. In addition, the asset may be withdrawn from such productive use without disposition as, for example, by being placed in a supplies or scrap account. The tax consequences of a retirement depend upon the form of the transaction, the reason therefor, the timing of the retirement, the estimated useful life used in computing depreciation, and whether the asset is accounted for in a separate or multiple asset account. Upon the retirement of assets, the rules in this section apply in determining whether gain or loss will be recognized, the amount of such gain or loss, and the basis for determining gain or loss:
(1) Where an asset is retired by sale at arm's length, recognition of gain or loss will be subject to the provisions of sections 1002, 1231, and other applicable provisions of law.
(2) Where an asset is retired by exchange, the recognition of gain or loss will be subject to the provisions of sections 1002, 1031, 1231, and other applicable provisions of law.
(3) Where an asset is permanently retired from use in the trade or business or in the production of income but is not disposed of by the taxpayer or physically abandoned (as, for example, when the asset is transferred to a supplies or scrap account), gain will not be recognized. In such a case loss will be recognized measured by the excess of the adjusted basis of the asset at the time of retirement over the estimated salvage value or over the fair market value at the time of such retirement if greater, but only if—
(i) The retirement is an abnormal retirement, or
(ii) The retirement is a normal retirement from a single asset account (but see paragraph (d) of this section for special rule for item accounts), or
(iii) The retirement is a normal retirement from a multiple asset account in which the depreciation rate was based on the maximum expected life of the longest lived asset contained in the account.
(4) Where an asset is retired by actual physical abandonment (as, for example, in the case of a building condemned as unfit for further occupancy or other use), loss will be recognized measured by the amount of the adjusted basis of the asset abandoned at the time of such abandonment. In order to qualify for the recognition of loss from physical abandonment, the intent of the taxpayer must be irrevocably to discard the asset so that it will neither
be used again by him nor retrieved by him for sale, exchange, or other disposition.
Experience with assets which have attained an exceptional or unusual age shall, with respect to similar assets, be disregarded in determining the maximum expected useful life of the longest lived asset in a multiple asset account. For example, if a manufacturer establishes a proper multiple asset account for 50 assets which are expected to have an average life of 30 years but which will remain useful to him for varying periods between 20 and 40 years, the maximum expected useful life will be 40 years, even though an occasional asset of this kind may last 60 years.
(b)
Definition of normal and abnormal retirements.
For the purpose of this section the determination of whether a retirement is normal or abnormal shall be made in the light of all the facts and circumstances. In general, a retirement shall be considered a normal retirement unless the taxpayer can show that the withdrawal of the asset was due to a cause not contemplated in setting the applicable depreciation rate. For example, a retirement is considered normal if made within the range of years taken into consideration in fixing the depreciation rate and if the asset has reached a condition at which, in the normal course of events, the taxpayer customarily retires similar assets from use in his business. On the other hand, a retirement may be abnormal if the asset is withdrawn at an earlier time or under other circumstances, as, for example, when the asset has been damaged by casualty or has lost its usefulness suddenly as the result of extraordinary obsolescence.
(c)
Basis of assets retired.
The basis of an asset at the time of retirement for computing gain or loss shall be its adjusted basis for determining gain or loss upon a sale or other disposition as determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1011 and the following rules:
(1) In the case of a normal retirement of an asset from a multiple asset account where the depreciation rate is based on average expected useful life, the term “adjusted basis” means the salvage value estimated in determining the depreciation deduction in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (c) of § 1.167(a)-1.
(2) In the case of a normal retirement of an asset from a multiple asset account on which the depreciation rate was based on the maximum expected life of the longest lived asset in the account, the adjustment for depreciation allowed or allowable shall be made at the rate which would have been proper if the asset had been depreciated in a single asset account (under the method of depreciation used for the multiple asset account) using a rate based upon the maximum expected useful life of that asset, and
(3) In the case of an abnormal retirement from a multiple asset account the adjustment for depreciation allowed or allowable shall be made at the rate which would have been proper had the asset been depreciated in a single asset account (under the method of depreciation used for the multiple asset account) and using a rate based upon either the average expected useful life or the maximum expected useful life of the asset, depending upon the method of determining the rate of depreciation used in connection with the multiple asset account.
(d)
Special rule for item accounts.
(1) As indicated in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, a loss is recognized upon the normal retirement of an asset from a single asset account but a loss on the normal retirement of an asset in a multiple asset account is not allowable where the depreciation rate is based upon the average useful life of the assets in the account. Where a taxpayer with more than one depreciable asset chooses to set up a separate account for each such asset and the depreciation rate is based on the average useful life of such assets (so that he uses the same life for each account), the question arises whether his depreciation deductions in substance are the equivalent of those which would result from the use of multiple asset accounts and, therefore, he should be subject to the rules governing losses on retirements of assets from multiple asset accounts. Where a taxpayer has only a few depreciable assets which he chooses to account for in single asset accounts, particularly where such assets cover a
relatively narrow range of lives, it cannot be said in the usual case that the allowance of losses on retirements from such accounts clearly will distort income. This results from the fact that where a taxpayer has only a few depreciable assets it is usually not possible clearly to determine that the depreciation rate is based upon the average useful life of such assets. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the taxpayer is in effect clearly operating with a multiple asset account using an average life rate so that losses should not be allowed on normal retirements. Therefore, losses normally will be allowed upon retirement of assets from single asset accounts where the taxpayer has only a few depreciable assets. On the other hand, when a taxpayer who has only a few depreciable assets chooses to account for them in single asset accounts, using for each account a depreciation rate based on the average useful life of such assets, and the assets cover a wide range of lives, the likelihood that income will be distorted is greater than where the group of assets covers a relatively narrow range of lives. In those cases where the allowance of losses would distort income, the rules with respect to the allowance of losses on normal retirement shall be applied to such assets in the same manner as though the assets had been accounted for in multiple asset accounts using a rate based upon average expected useful life.
(2) Where a taxpayer has a large number of depreciable assets and depreciation is based on the average useful life of such assets, then, whether such assets are similar or dissimilar and regardless of whether they are accounted for in individual asset accounts or multiple asset accounts the allowance of losses on the normal retirement of such assets would distort income. Such distortion would result from the fact that the use of average useful life (and, accordingly, average rate) assumes that while some assets normally will be retired before the expiration of the average life, others normally will be retired after expiration of the average life. Accordingly, if instead of accounting for a large number of similar or dissimilar depreciable assets in multiple asset accounts, the taxpayer chooses to account separately for such assets, using a rate based upon the average life of such assets, the rules with respect to the allowances of losses on normal retirements will be applied to such assets in the same manner as though the assets were accounted for in multiple asset accounts using a rate based upon average expected useful life.
(3) Where a taxpayer who does not have a large number of depreciable assets (and who therefore is not subject to subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) chooses to set up a separate account for each such asset, and has sought to compute an average life for such assets on which to base his depreciation deductions (so that he uses the same life for each account), the allowance of losses on normal retirements from such accounts may in some situations substantially distort income. Such distortion would result from the fact that the use of average useful life (and, accordingly, average rate) assumes that while some assets normally will be retired before expiration of the average life, others normally will be retired after expiration of the average life. Accordingly, where a taxpayer chooses to account separately for such assets instead of accounting for them in multiple asset accounts, and the result is to substantially distort his income, the rules with respect to the allowance of losses on normal retirements shall be applied to such assets in the same manner as though the assets had been accounted for in multiple asset accounts using a rate based upon average expected useful life.
(4) Whenever a taxpayer is treated under this paragraph as though his assets were accounted for in a multiple asset account using an average life rate, and, therefore, he is denied a loss on retirements, the unrecovered cost less salvage of each asset which was accounted for separately may be amortized in accordance with the regulation stated in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
(e)
Accounting treatment of asset retirements.
(1) In the case of a normal retirement where under the foregoing rules no loss is recognized and where the asset is retired without disposition or abandonment, (i) if the asset was
contained in a multiple asset account, the full cost of such asset, reduced by estimated salvage, shall be charged to the depreciation reserve, or (ii) if the asset was accounted for separately, the unrecovered cost or other basis, less salvage, of the asset may be amortized through annual deductions from gross income in amounts equal to the unrecovered cost or other basis of such asset, divided by the average expected useful life (not the remaining useful life) applicable to the asset at the time of retirement. For example, if an asset is retired after six years of use and at the time of retirement depreciation was being claimed on the basis of an average expected useful life of ten years, the unrecovered cost or other basis less salvage would be amortized through equal annual deductions over a period of ten years from the time of retirement.
(2) Where multiple asset accounts are used and acquisitions and retirements are numerous, if a taxpayer, in order to avoid unnecessarily detailed accounting for individual retirements, consistently follows the practice of charging the reserve with the full cost or other basis of assets retired and of crediting it with all receipts from salvage, the practice may be continued so long as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, it clearly reflects income. Conversely, where the taxpayer customarily follows a practice of reporting all receipts from salvage as ordinary taxable income such practice may be continued so long as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, it clearly reflects income.
(f)
Cross reference.

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 21, 1960, as amended by T.D. 9564, 76 FR 81085, Dec. 27, 2011; T.D. 9636, 78 FR 57707, Sept. 19, 2013]
§ 1.167(a)-9
Obsolescence.
The depreciation allowance includes an allowance for normal obsolescence which should be taken into account to the extent that the expected useful life of property will be shortened by reason thereof. Obsolescence may render an asset economically useless to the taxpayer regardless of its physical condition. Obsolescence is attributable to many causes, including technological improvements and reasonably foreseeable economic changes. Among these causes are normal progress of the arts and sciences, supersession or inadequacy brought about by developments in the industry, products, methods, markets, sources of supply, and other like changes, and legislative or regulatory action. In any case in which the taxpayer shows that the estimated useful life previously used should be shortened by reason of obsolescence greater than had been assumed in computing such estimated useful life, a change to a new and shorter estimated useful life computed in accordance with such showing will be permitted. No such change will be permitted merely because in the unsupported opinion of the taxpayer the property may become obsolete. For rules governing the allowance of a loss when the usefulness of
depreciable property is suddenly terminated, see § 1.167(a)-8. If the estimated useful life and the depreciation rates have been the subject of a previous agreement, see section 167(d) and § 1.167(d)-1.
§ 1.167(a)-10
When depreciation deduction is allowable.
(a) A taxpayer should deduct the proper depreciation allowance each year and may not increase his depreciation allowances in later years by reason of his failure to deduct any depreciation allowance or of his action in deducting an allowance plainly inadequate under the known facts in prior years. The inadequacy of the depreciation allowance for property in prior years shall be determined on the basis of the allowable method of depreciation used by the taxpayer for such property or under the straight line method if no allowance has ever been claimed for such property. The preceding sentence shall not be construed as precluding application of any method provided in section 167(b) if taxpayer's failure to claim any allowance for depreciation was due solely to erroneously treating as a deductible expense an item properly chargeable to capital account. For rules relating to adjustments to basis, see section 1016 and the regulations thereunder.
(b) The period for depreciation of an asset shall begin when the asset is placed in service and shall end when the asset is retired from service. A proportionate part of one year's depreciation is allowable for that part of the first and last year during which the asset was in service. However, in the case of a multiple asset account, the amount of depreciation may be determined by using what is commonly described as an “averaging convention”, that is, by using an assumed timing of additions and retirements. For example, it might be assumed that all additions and retirements to the asset account occur uniformly throughout the taxable year, in which case depreciation is computed on the average of the beginning and ending balances of the asset account for the taxable year. See example (3) under paragraph (b) of § 1.167(b)-1. Among still other averaging conventions which may be used is the one under which it is assumed that all additions and retirements during the first half of a given year were made on the first day of that year and that all additions and retirements during the second half of the year were made on the first day of the following year. Thus, a full year's depreciation would be taken on additions in the first half of the year and no depreciation would be taken on additions in the second half. Moreover, under this convention, no depreciation would be taken on retirements in the first half of the year and a full year's depreciation would be taken on the retirements in the second half. An averaging convention, if used, must be consistently followed as to the account or accounts for which it is adopted, and must be applied to both additions and retirements. In any year in which an averaging convention substantially distorts the depreciation allowance for the taxable year, it may not be used.
§ 1.167(a)-11
Depreciation based on class lives and asset depreciation ranges for property placed in service after December 31, 1970.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Summary.
This section provides an asset depreciation range and class life system for determining the reasonable allowance for depreciation of designated classes of assets placed in service after December 31, 1970. The system is designed to minimize disputes between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service as to the useful life of property, and as to salvage value, repairs, and other matters. The system is optional with the taxpayer. The taxpayer has an annual election. Generally, an election for a taxable year must apply to all additions of eligible property during the taxable year of election, but does not apply to additions of eligible property in any other taxable year. The taxpayer's election, made with the return for the taxable year, may not be revoked or modified for any property included in the election. Generally, the taxpayer must establish vintage accounts for all eligible property included in the election, must determine the allowance for depreciation of such property in the taxable year of election, and in subsequent taxable years,
on the basis of the asset depreciation period selected and must apply the first-year convention specified in the election to determine the allowance for depreciation of such property. This section also contains special provisions for the treatment of salvage value, retirements, and the costs of the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of property. In general, a taxpayer may not apply any provision of this section unless he makes an election and thereby consents to, and agrees to apply, all the provisions of this section. A taxpayer who elects to apply this section does, however, have certain options as to the application of specified provisions of this section. A taxpayer may elect to apply this section for a taxable year only if for such taxable year he complies with the requirements of paragraph (f)(4) of this section.

Definitions.
For the meaning of certain terms used in this section, see paragraphs (b)(2) (“eligible property”), (b)(3) (“vintage account” and “vintage”), (b)(4) (“asset depreciation range”, “asset guideline class”, “asset guideline period”, and “asset depreciation period”), (b)(5)(iii)(
c
) (“used property”), (b)(6)(i) (“public utility property”), (c)(1)(iv) (“original use”), (c)(1)(v) (“unadjusted basis” and “adjusted basis”), (c)(2)(ii) (“modified half-year convention”), (c)(2)(iii) (“half-year convention”), (d)(1)(i) (“gross salvage value”), (d)(1)(ii) (“salvage value”), (d)(2)(iii) (“repair allowance”, “repair allowance percentage”, and “repair allowance property”), (d)(2)(vi) (“excluded addition”), (d)(2)(vii) (“property improvement”), (d)(3)(ii) (“ordinary retirement” and “extraordinary retirement”), (d)(3)(vi) (“special basis vintage account”), and (e)(1) (“first placed in service”) of this section.
(b)
Reasonable allowance using asset depreciation ranges
—(1)
In general.
The allowance for depreciation of eligible property (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) to which the taxpayer elects to apply this section shall be determined as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and shall constitute the reasonable allowance for depreciation of such property under section 167(a).
(2)
Definition of eligible property.
For purposes of this section, the term “eligible property” means tangible property which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided by section 167(a) but only if—
(i) An asset guideline class and asset guideline period are in effect for such property for the taxable year of election (see subparagraph (4) of this paragraph);
(ii) The property is first placed in service (as described in paragraph (e) (1) of this section) by the taxpayer after December 31, 1970 (but see subparagraph (7) of this paragraph for special rule where there is a mere change in the form of conducting a trade or business); and
(iii) The property is either—
(
a
) Section 1245 property as defined in section 1245(a) (3), or
(
b
) Section 1250 property as defined in section 1250(c).
See, however, subparagraph (6) of this paragraph for special rule for certain public utility property as defined in section 167(l)(3)(A). Property which meets the requirements of this subparagraph is eligible property even if depreciation with respect to such property, determined in accordance with this section, is allocated to or otherwise required to be reflected in the cost of a capitalized item. The term “eligible property” includes any property which meets the requirements of this subparagraph, whether such property is new property, “used property” (as described in subparagraph (5)(iii)(
c
) of this paragraph), a “property improvement” (as described in paragraph (d)(2)(vii) of this section), or an “excluded addition” (as described in paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section). For the treatment of expenditures for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of certain property, see paragraph (d) (2) of this section.
(3)
Requirement of vintage accounts
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, a “vintage account” is a closed-end depreciation account containing eligible property to which the taxpayer elects to apply this section, first placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year of election. The “vintage” of an account refers to the taxable year during which the eligible property in
the account is first placed in service by the taxpayer. Such an account will consist of an asset, or a group of assets, within a single asset guideline class established pursuant to subparagraph (4) of this paragraph and may contain only eligible property. Each item of eligible property to which the taxpayer elects to apply this section, first placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year of election (determined without regard to a convention described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) shall be placed in a vintage account of the taxable year of election. For rule regarding “special basis vintage accounts” for certain property improvements, see paragraph (d)(2)(viii) and (3)(vi) of this section. Any number of vintage accounts of a taxable year may be established. More than one account of the same vintage may be established for different assets of the same asset guideline class. See paragraph (d)(3)(xi) of this section for special rule for treatment of certain multiple asset and item accounts.
(ii)
Special rule.
Section 1245 property may not be placed in a vintage account with section 1250 property. Property the original use of which does not commence with the taxpayer may not be placed in a vintage account with property the original use of which commences with the taxpayer. Property described in section 167(f)(2) may not be placed in a vintage account with property not described in section 167(f)(2). Property described in section 179(d)(1) for which the taxpayer elects the allowance for the first taxable year in accordance with section 179(c) may not be placed in a vintage account with property not described in section 179(d)(1) or for which the taxpayer does not elect such allowance for the first taxable year. For special rule for property acquired in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, see paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. For additional rules with respect to accounting for eligible property, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(4)
Asset depreciation ranges and periods
—(i)
Selection of asset depreciation period.
The taxpayers books and records must specify for each vintage account of the taxable year of election—
(
a
) In the case of vintage account for property in an asset guideline class for which no asset depreciation range is in effect for the taxable year, the asset depreciation period (which shall be equal to the asset guideline period for the assets in such account), or
(
b
) In the case of a vintage account for property in an asset guideline class for which an asset depreciation range is in effect for the taxable year, the asset depreciation period selected by the taxpayer from the asset depreciation range for the assets in such account.
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the establishment thereof, for purposes of this section, the term “asset guideline class” means a category of assets (including “subsidiary assets”) for which a separate asset guideline period is in effect for the taxable year as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. The “asset depreciation range” is a period of years which extends from 80 percent of the asset guideline period to 120 percent of such period, determined in each case by rounding any fractional part of a year to the nearer of the nearest whole or half year. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, in the case of an asset guideline class for which an asset depreciation range is in effect, any period within the asset depreciation range for the assets in a vintage account which is a whole number of years or a whole number of years plus a half year, may be selected. The term “asset depreciation period” means the period selected from the asset depreciation range, or if no asset depreciation range is in effect for the class, the asset guideline period. The “asset guideline period” is established in accordance with subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph and is the class life under section 167(m). See Revenue Procedure 72-10 for special rules for section 1250 property and property predominately used outside the United States. In general, an asset guideline period, but no asset depreciation range, is in effect for such property.
(ii)
Establishment of asset guideline classes and periods.
The asset guideline classes and the asset guideline periods, and the asset depreciation ranges determined from such periods, in effect
for taxable years ending before the effective date of the first supplemental asset guideline classes, asset guideline periods, and asset depreciation ranges, established pursuant to this section are set forth in Revenue Procedure 72-10. Asset guideline classes and periods, and asset depreciation ranges, will from time to time be established, supplemented, and revised with express reference to this section, and will be published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. The asset guideline classes, the asset guideline periods, and the asset depreciation ranges determined from such periods in effect as of the last day of a taxable year of election shall apply to all vintage accounts of such taxable year, except that neither the asset guideline period nor the lower limit of the asset depreciation range for any such account shall be longer than the asset guideline period or the lower limit of the asset depreciation range, as the case may be, for such account in effect as of the first day of the taxable year (or as of such later time in such year as an asset guideline class first established during such year becomes effective). Generally, the reasonable allowance for depreciation of property for any taxable year in a vintage account shall not be changed to reflect any supplement or revision of the asset guideline classes or periods, and asset depreciation ranges, for the taxable year in which the account is established, which occurs after the end of such taxable year. However, if expressly provided in such a supplement or revision, the taxpayer may, at his option in the manner specified therein, apply the revised or supplemented asset guideline classes or periods and asset depreciation ranges to such property for such taxable year and succeeding taxable years.
(iii)
Applicable guideline classes and periods in special situations.
(
a
) An electric or gas utility which would in accordance with Revenue Procedure 64-21 be entitled to use a composite guideline class basis for applying Revenue Procedure 62-21 may, solely with respect to property for which an asset depreciation range is in effect for the taxable year, elect to apply this section on the basis of a composite asset guideline class and asset guideline period determined by applying the provisions of Revenue Procedure 64-21 to such property. The asset depreciation range for such a composite asset guideline class shall be determined by reference to the composite asset guideline period at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the taxpayer elects to apply this section and shall not be changed until such time as major variations in the asset mix or the asset guideline classes or periods justify some other composite asset guideline period. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section with respect to buildings and other structures, for the purposes of this section, all property in the composite asset guideline class shall be treated as included in a single asset guideline class. If the taxpayer elects to apply this subdivision, the election shall be made on the tax return filed for the first taxable year for which the taxpayer elects to apply this section. An election to apply this subdivision for any taxable year shall apply to all succeeding taxable years to which the taxpayer elects to apply this section, except to the extent the election to apply this subdivision is with the consent of the Commissioner terminated with respect to a succeeding taxable year and all taxable years thereafter.
(
b
) For purposes of this section, property shall be included in the asset guideline class for the activity in which the property is primarily used. See paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section for rule for leased property. Property shall be classified according to primary use even though the activity in which such property is primarily used is insubstantial in relation to all the taxpayer's activities. No change in the classification of property shall be made because of a change in primary use after the end of the taxable year in which property is first placed in service, including a change in use which results in section 1250 property becoming section 1245 property.

) An incorrect classification or characterization by the taxpayer of property for the purposes of this section (such as under (
b
) of this subdivision or under subparagraph (2) or (3) (ii) of this paragraph) shall not cause or permit a revocation of the election
to apply this section for the taxable year in which such property was first placed in service. The classification or characterization of such property shall be corrected. All adjustments necessary to the correction shall be made, including adjustments of unadjusted basis, adjusted basis, salvage value, the reserve for depreciation of all vintage accounts affected, and the amount of depreciation allowable for all taxable years for which the period for assessment of tax prescribed in section 6501 has not expired. If because of incorrect classification or characterization property included in an election to apply this section was not placed in a vintage account and no asset depreciation period was selected for the property or the property was placed in a vintage account but an asset depreciation period was selected from an incorrect asset depreciation range, the taxpayer shall place the property in a vintage account and select an asset depreciation period for the account from the correct asset depreciation range.
(
d
) Generally, except as provided in subparagraph (5)(v)(
a
) of this paragraph, a taxpayer may not compute depreciation for eligible property first placed in service during the taxable year under a method of depreciation not described in section 167(b) (1), (2), or (3). (If the taxpayer computes depreciation with respect to such property under section 167(k), or amortizes such property, the property must be excluded from the election to apply this section.) (See subparagraph (5)(v)(
b
) of this paragraph.) However, if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that a method of depreciation not described in section 167(b) (1), (2), (3), or (k) was adopted for property in the asset guideline class on the basis of a good faith mistake as to the proper asset guideline class for the property, then, unless the requirements of subparagraph (5)(v)(
a
) of this paragraph are met, the taxpayer must terminate (as of the beginning of the taxable year) such method of depreciation with respect to all eligible property in the asset guideline class which was first placed in service during the taxable year. In such event, the taxpayer's election to apply this section shall include eligible property in the asset guideline class without regard to subparagraph (5)(v)(
a
) of this paragraph. The provisions of (
c
) of this subdivision shall apply to the correction in the classification of the property.
(
e
) If the provisions of section 167(j) apply to require a change in the method of depreciation with respect to an item of section 1250 property in a multiple asset vintage account, the asset shall be removed from the account and placed in a separate item vintage account. The unadjusted basis of the asset shall be removed from the unadjusted basis of the vintage account as of the first day of the taxable year in which the change in method of depreciation is required and the depreciation reserve established for the account shall be reduced by the depreciation allowable for the property computed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c)(1)(v)(
b
) of this section for determination of the adjusted basis of property. See paragraph (d)(3)(vii)(
e
) of this section for treatment of salvage value when property is removed from a vintage account.
(iv)
Examples.
The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X purchases a bulldozer for the use in its construction business. The bulldozer is first placed in service in 1972. Since the bulldozer is tangible property for which an asset guideline class and period have been established, the bulldozer is eligible property. The bulldozer is in asset guideline class 15.1 of Revenue Procedure 72-10, and the asset depreciation range is 4-6 years.

# Example 2.
In 1972, corporation Y first places in service a factory building. Since the factory building is tangible property for which an asset guideline class and period have been established, it is eligible property. The factory building is in asset guideline class 65.11 of Revenue Procedure 72-10. Since no asset depreciation range is in effect for the asset guideline class, the asset depreciation period is the asset guideline period of 45 years. (See subparagraph (5)(vi) of this paragraph for election to exclude certain section 1250 property during transition period.)

# Example 3.
In January of 1971, corporation Y, a calendar year taxpayer, pays or incurs $2,000 for the rehabilitation and improvement of machine A which was first placed in service in 1969. On January 1, 1971, corporation Y first placed in service machines B and C, each with an unadjusted basis of $10,000.
Machines B and C are eligible property. Machine A would be eligible property but for the fact it was first placed in service prior to January 1, 1971 (that is, machine A is eligible property determined without regard to subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph). Corporation Y elects to apply this section for the taxable year, and adopts the modified half-year convention described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, but does not elect to apply the asset guideline class repair allowance described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. Machines A, B, and C are in asset guideline class 24.4 under Revenue Procedure 72-10 for which the asset depreciation range is 8 to 12 years. The $2,000 expended on machine A substantially increases its capacity and is a capital expenditure under sections 162 and 263. The $2,000 is a property improvement (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(
b
) of this section) which is eligible property. However, corporation Y by mistake treats the property improvement of $2,000 as a deductible repair. Also by mistake, corporation Y includes machine B in asset guideline class 24.3 under Revenue Procedure 72-10 for which the asset depreciation range is 5 to 7 years. Corporation Y establishes vintage accounts for 1971, and computes depreciation for 1971 and 1972 as follows:
Dec. 31, 1972, reserve for depreciation
Dec. 31, 1972, adjusted basis
Vintage account for machine B, with an asset depreciation period of 5 years and an unadjusted basis of $10,000 for which corporation Y adopts the straight line method
$4,000
$6,000
Vintage account for machine C, with an asset depreciation period of 8 years and an unadjusted basis of $10,000 for which corporation Y adopts the straight line method
2,500
7,500
After audit in 1973 of corporation Y's taxable years 1971 and 1972, it is determined that the $2,000 paid in 1971 for the rehabilitation and improvement of machine A is a capital expenditure and that machine B is in asset guideline class 24.4. The incorrect classification is corrected. Corporation Y places machine B and the property improvement in a vintage account of 1971 and on its tax return filed for 1973 selects an asset depreciation period of 8 years for that account. Giving effect to the correction in classification of the property in accordance with subdivision (iii) (
c
) of this subparagraph, at the end of 1972 the unadjusted basis, reserve for depreciation, and adjusted basis of the vintage account for machine B and the property improvement with respect to machine A are $12,000, $3,000, and $9,000, respectively. Corporation Y's deduction of the $2,000 property improvement in 1971 as a repair expense under section 162 is disallowed. For 1971 and 1972 depreciation deductions are disallowed in the amount of $500 each year (that is, $750 excess annual depreciation on machine B minus $250 annual depreciation on the property improvement).

# Example 4.
(a) In 1971, Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, first places in service machines A through M, all of which are eligible property. All the machines except machine A are in asset guideline class 24.3 under Revenue Procedure 72-10. Machine A is in asset guideline class 24.4 under Revenue Procedure 72-10. Machine B has an unadjusted basis equal to 80 percent of the total unadjusted basis of machines B through M. By good faith mistake as to proper classification, corporation X includes both machine A and machine B in asset guideline class 24.4. Corporation X consistently uses the machine hour method of depreciation on all property in asset guideline class 24.4, and for 1971 computes depreciation for machines A and B under that method. Corporation X elects to apply this section for 1971 on the assumption that the election includes machines C through M which are in asset guideline class 24.3. In 1973, upon audit of corporation X's taxable years 1971 and 1972, it is determined that machine B is included in asset guideline class 24.3 and that since for 1971 corporation X computed depreciation on machine B under the machine hour method, in accordance with subparagraph (5)(v)(
a
) of this paragraph, all property in asset guideline class 24.3 (machines B through M) is excluded from corporation X's election to apply this section for 1971. Although corporation X has consistently used the machine hour method for asset guideline class 24.4, corporation X has not in the past used the machine hour method for machines of the type and function of machines C through M which are in asset guideline class 24.3. Both machine A and machine B are used in connection with the manufacture of wood products. There is reasonable basis for corporation X having assumed that machine B is in asset guideline class 24.4 along with machine A to which it is similar. Corporation X establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that it used the machine hour method for machine B on the basis of a good faith mistake as to the proper classification of the machine. Corporation X may, at its option (see subparagraph (5)(v) of this paragraph), terminate the machine hour method of depreciation for machine B as of the beginning of 1971, and in that event corporation X's election to apply this section for 1971 will apply to machines B through M without regard to subparagraph (5)(v)(
a
) of this paragraph. The adjustments provided in subdivision (iii)(
c
) of this subparagraph will be made as a result of the correction in classification
of property. If corporation X does not terminate the machine hour method with respect to machine B, machines B through M must be excluded from the election to apply this section (see subparagraph (5)(v) of this paragraph).
(
b
) The facts are the same as in (
a
) of this example except that machine B has an unadjusted basis equal to only 65 percent of the total unadjusted basis of machines B through M.
In this case, corporation X must either terminate the machine hour method of depreciation with respect to asset B (since the provisions of subparagraph (5)(v) of this paragraph do not permit the exclusion of the property from the election to apply this section) or otherwise comply with the provisions of subparagraph (5)(v) of this paragraph. (See paragraph (c)(1)(iv) for limitation on methods which may be adopted for property included in the election to apply this section.)
(5)
Requirements of election
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section dealing with expenditures for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of certain property, no provision of this section shall apply to any property other than eligible property to which the taxpayer elects in accordance with this section, to apply this section. For the time and manner of election, and certain conditions to an election, see paragraph (f) of this section. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (4)(iii) of this paragraph, subdivision (v) of this subparagraph and in subparagraph (6)(iii) of this paragraph, a taxpayer's election to apply this section may not be revoked or modified after the last day prescribed for filing the election. Thus, for example, after such day, a taxpayer may not cease to apply this section to property included in the election, establish different vintage accounts for the taxable year of election, select a different period from the asset depreciation range for any such account, or adopt a different first-year convention for any such account.
(ii)
Property required to be included in election.
Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph dealing with certain “used property”, in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph dealing with “section 38 property”, in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph dealing with property subject to special depreciation or amortization, in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph dealing with certain section 1250 property, in subdivision (vii) of this subparagraph dealing with certain subsidiary assets, and in paragraph (e)(3) (i) and (iv) of this section dealing with transactions to which section 381(a) applies, if the taxpayer elects to apply this section to any eligible property first placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year of election, the election shall apply to all such eligible property, whether placed in service in a trade or business or held for production of income.
(iii)
Special 10 percent used property rule.
(
a
) If (
1
) the unadjusted basis of eligible used section 1245 property (as defined in (
c
) of this subdivision) first placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year of election, for which no specific used property asset guideline class (as defined in (
c
) of this subdivision) is in effect for the taxable year, exceeds (
2
) 10 percent of the unadjusted basis of all eligible section 1245 property first placed in service during the taxable year of election, the taxpayer may exclude all (but not less than all) the property described in (
a
)(
1
) of this subdivision from the election to apply this section.
(
b
) If (
1
) the unadjusted basis of eligible used section 1250 property first placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year of election, for which no specific used property asset guideline class is in effect for the taxable year, exceeds (
2
) 10 percent of the unadjusted basis of all eligible section 1250 property first placed in service during the taxable year of election, the taxpayer may exclude all (but not less than all) the property described in (
b
)(
1
) of this subdivision from the election to apply this section.
(
c
) For the purposes of this section, the term “used property” means property the original use of which does not commence with the taxpayer. Solely for the purpose of determining whether the 10 percent rule of this subdivision is satisfied, (
1
) eligible used property first placed in service during the taxable year and excluded from the election to apply this section pursuant to subdivision (v)(
a
) of this subparagraph
and (
2
) eligible property acquired during the taxable year in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall all be treated as used property regardless of whether such property would be treated as new property under section 167(c) and the regulations thereunder. The term “specific used property asset guideline class” means a class established in accordance with subparagraph (4) of this paragraph solely for used property primarily used in connection with the activity to which the class relates.
(iv)
Property subject to investment tax credit.
The taxpayer may exclude from an election to apply this section all, or less than all, units of eligible property first placed in service during the taxable year which is—
(
a
) “Section 38 property” as defined in section 48(a) which meets the requirements of section 49 and which is not property described in section 50, or
(
b
) Property to which section 47(a)(5)(B) applies which would be section 38 property but for section 49 and which is placed in service to replace section 38 property (other than property described in section 50) disposed of prior to August 15, 1971.
(v)
Property subject to special method of depreciation or authorization.
(
a
) In the case of eligible property first placed in service in a taxable year of election (and not otherwise properly excluded from an election to apply this section) the taxpayer may not compute depreciation for any of such property in the asset guideline class under a method not described in section 167(b) (1), (2), (3), or (k) unless he (
1
) computes depreciation under a method or methods not so described for eligible property first placed in service in the taxable year in the asset guideline class with an unadjusted basis at least equal to 75 percent of the unadjusted basis of all eligible property first placed in service in the taxable year in the asset guideline class and (
2
) agrees to continue to depreciate such property under such method or methods until the consent of the Commissioner is obtained to a change in method. The consent of the Commissioner must be obtained by filing Form 3115 with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, D.C. 20224, within the first 180 days of the taxable year for which the change is desired. If for the taxable year of election the taxpayer computes depreciation under any method not described in section 167(b) (1), (2), (3), or (k) for any eligible property (other than property otherwise properly excluded from an election to apply this section) first placed in service during the taxable year, an election to apply this section for the taxable year shall not include such property or any other eligible property in the same asset guideline class as such property. With respect to a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1973, if the taxpayer has adopted a method of depreciation which is not permitted under this subdivision, the taxpayer may under this section adopt a method of depreciation permitted under this subdivision or otherwise comply with the provisions of this subdivision.
(
b
) An election to apply this section shall not include eligible property for which, for the taxable year of election, the taxpayer computes depreciation under section 167(k), or computes amortization under section 169, 184, 185, 187, 188, or paragraph (b) of § 1.162-11. If the taxpayer has elected to apply this section to eligible property described in section 167(k), 169, 184, 185, or 187 and the taxpayer thereafter computes depreciation or amortization for such property for any taxable year in accordance with section 167(k), 169, 184, 185, or 187, then the election to apply this section to such property shall terminate as of the beginning of the taxable year for which depreciation or amortization is computed under such section. Application of this section to the property for any period prior to the termination date will not be affected by the termination. The unadjusted basis of the property shall be removed as of the termination date from the unadjusted basis of the vintage account. The depreciation reserve established for the account shall be reduced by the depreciation allowable for the property, computed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c)(1)(v)(
b
) of this section for determination of the adjusted basis of the property. See paragraph (d)(3)(vii)(
e
) of this section for
treatment of salvage value when property is removed from a vintage account.
(vi)
Certain section 1250 property.
(
a
) The taxpayer may exclude from an election to apply this section all, or less than all, items of eligible section 1250 property first placed in service during the taxable year of election provided that—
(
1
) The item is first placed in service before the earlier of the effective date of the first supplemental asset guideline class including such property established in accordance with subparagraph (4)(ii) of this paragraph, or January 1, 1974, and
(
2
) The taxpayer establishes that a useful life shorter than the asset guideline period in effect on January 1, 1971, for such item of property is justified for such taxable year.
A useful life shorter than the asset guideline period in effect on January 1, 1971, will be considered justified only if such life is justified in accordance with the provisions of Revenue Procedure 62-21 (including all modifications, amendments or supplements thereto as of January 1, 1971), determined without application of the minimal adjustment rule in section 4, part II, of Revenue Procedure 65-13. If an item of section 1250 property is excluded from an election to apply this section pursuant to this subdivision, any elevator or escalator which is a part of such item shall also be excluded from the election.
(
b
) If the taxpayer excludes an item of section 1250 property from an election to apply this section in accordance with this subdivision, the useful life justified under Revenue Procedure 62-21 in accordance with this subdivision for the taxable year of exclusion will be treated as justified for such item of section 1250 property for the taxable year of the exclusion and all subsequent taxable years.
(vii)
Subsidiary assets.
The taxpayer may exclude from an election to apply this section all (but not less than all) subsidiary assets first placed in service during the taxable year of election in an asset guideline class, provided that—
(
a
) The unadjusted basis of eligible subsidiary assets first placed in service during the taxable year in the class is as much as 3 percent of the unadjusted basis of all eligible property first placed in service during the taxable year in the class, and
(
b
) Such subsidiary assets are first placed in service by the taxpayer before the earlier of (
1
) the effective date of the first supplemental asset guideline class including such subsidiary assets established in accordance with subparagraph (4)(ii) of this paragraph, or (
2
) January 1, 1974.
For purposes of this subdivision the term “subsidiary assets” includes jigs, dies, molds, returnable containers, glassware, silverware, textile mill cam assemblies, and other equipment included in group 1, class 5, of Revenue Procedure 62-21. which is usually and property accounted for separately from other property and under a method of depreciation not expressed in terms of years.
(6)
Special rule for certain public utility property
—(i)
Requirement of normalization in certain cases.
Under section 167(1), in the case of public utility property (as defined in section 167(1)(3)(A)), if the taxpayer—
(
a
) Is entitled to use a method of depreciation other than a “subsection (1) method” of depreciation (as defined in section 167(1)(3)(F)) only if it uses the “normalization method of accounting” (as defined in section 167(1)(3)(G)) with respect to such property, or
(
b
) Is entitled for the taxable year to use only a “subsection (1) method” of depreciation, such property shall be eligible property (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) only if the taxpayer normalizes the tax deferral resulting from the election to apply this section.
(ii)
Normalization.
The taxpayer will be considered to normalize the tax deferral resulting from the election to apply this section only if it computes its tax expense for purposes of establishing its cost of service for ratemaking purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account using a period for depreciation no less than the lesser of—
(
a
) 100 percent of the asset guideline period in effect in accordance with subparagraph (4)(ii) of this paragraph for the first taxable year to which this section applies, or
(
b
) The period for computing its depreciation expense for ratemaking purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account, and makes adjustments to a reserve to reflect the deferral of taxes resulting from the election to apply this section. A determination whether the taxpayer is considered to normalize (within the meaning of the preceding sentence) the tax deferral resulting from the election to apply this section shall be made in a manner consistent with the principles for determining whether a taxpayer is using the “normalization method of accounting” (within the meaning of section 167(1)(3)(G)). [Removed] See § 1.167(1)-1(h).
(iii)
Failure to normalize.
If a taxpayer, which has elected to apply this section to any eligible public utility property and is required under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to normalize the tax deferral resulting from the election to apply this section to such property, fails to normalize such tax deferral, the election to apply this section to such property shall terminate as of the beginning of the taxable year for which the taxpayer fails to normalize such tax deferral. Application of this section to such property for any period prior to the termination date will not be affected by the termination. The unadjusted basis of the property shall be removed as of the termination date from the unadjusted basis of the vintage account. The depreciation reserve established for the account shall be reduced by the depreciation allowable for the property, computed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c)(1)(v)(
b
) of this section for determination of the adjusted basis of the property. See paragraph (d)(3)(vii)(
e
) of this section for treatment of salvage value when property is removed from a vintage account.
(iv)
Examples.
The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation A is a gas pipeline company, subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, which is entitled under section 167(1) to use a method of depreciation other than a “subsection (1) method” of depreciation (as defined in section 167(1) (3) (F)) only if it uses the “normalization method of accounting” (as defined in section 167(1)(3)(G)). Corporation A elects to apply this section for 1972 with respect to all eligible property. In 1972, corporation A places in service eligible property with an unadjusted basis of $2 million. One hundred percent of the asset guideline period for such property is 22 years and the asset depreciation range is from 17.5 years to 26.5 years. The taxpayer uses the double declining balance method of depreciation, selects an asset depreciation period of 17.5 years and applies the half-year convention (described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section). The depreciation allowable under this section with respect to such property in 1972 is $114,285. The taxpayer will be considered to normalize the tax deferral resulting from the election to apply this section and to use the “normalization method of accounting” (within the meaning of section 167(1)(3)(G)) if it computes its tax expense for purposes of determining its cost of service for rate making purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account using a “subsection (1) method” of depreciation, such as the straight line method, determined by using a depreciation period of 22 years (that is, 100 percent of the asset guideline period). A depreciation allowance computed in this manner is $45,454. The difference in the amount determined under this section ($114,285) and the amount used in computing its tax expense for purposes of estimating its cost of service for rate making purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account ($45,454) is $68,831. Assuming a tax rate of 48 percent, the deferral of taxes resulting from an election to apply this section and using a different method of depreciation for tax purposes from that used for establishing its cost of service for rate making purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account is 48 percent of $68,831, or $33,039, which amount should be added to a reserve to reflect the deferral of taxes resulting from the election to apply this section and from the use of a different method of depreciation in computing the allowance for depreciation under section 167 from that used in computing its depreciation expense for purposes of establishing its cost of service for rate making purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account.

# Example 2.
Corporation B, a telephone company subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission used a “flow-through method of accounting” (as defined in section 167(1)(3)(H)) for its “July 1969 accounting period” (as defined in section 167(1)(3)(I)) with respect to all of its pre-1970 public utility property and did not make an election under section 167(1)(4)(A). Thus, corporation B is entitled under section 167(1) to use a method of depreciation other than a
“subsection (1) method” with respect to certain property without using the “normalization method of accounting.” In 1972, corporation B makes an election to apply this section with respect to all eligible property. Corporation B is not required to normalize the tax deferral resulting from the election to apply this section in the case of property for which it is not required to use the “normalization method of accounting” under section 167(1).

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that corporation B made a timely election under section 167(1)(4)(A) that section 167(1)(2)(C) not apply with respect to property which increases the productive or operational capacity of the taxpayer. Corporation B must normalize the tax deferral resulting from the election to apply this section with respect to such property.
(7)
Mere change in form of conducting a trade or business.
Property which was first placed in service by the transferor before January 1, 1971, shall not be eligible property if such property is first placed in service by the transferee after December 31, 1970, by reason of a mere change in the form of conducting a trade or business in which such property is used. A mere change in the form of conducting a trade or business in which such property is used will be considered to have occurred if—
(i) The transferor (or in a case where the transferor is a partnership, estate, trust, or corporation, the partners, beneficiaries, or shareholders) of such property retains a substantial interest in such trade or business, or
(ii) The basis of such property in the hands of the transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such property in the hands of the transferor.
For purposes of this subparagraph, a transferor (or in a case where the transferor is a partnership, estate, trust, or corporation, the partners, beneficiaries, or shareholders) shall be considered as having retained a substantial interest in the trade or business only if, after the change in form, his (or their) interest in such trade or business is substantial in relation to the total interest of all persons in such trade or business. This subparagraph shall apply to property first placed in service prior to January 1, 1971, held for the production of income (within the meaning of section 167(a)(2)) as well as to property used in a trade or business. The principles of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X and corporation Y are includible corporations in an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a). In 1971 corporation X sells property to corporation Y for cash. The property would meet the requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for eligible property except that it was first placed in service by corporation X in 1970. After the transfer, the property is first placed in service by corporation Y in 1971. The property is not eligible property because of the mere change in the form of conducting a trade or business.

# Example 2.
In 1971, in a transaction to which section 351 applies, taxpayer B transfers to corporation W property which would meet the requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for eligible property except that the property was first placed in service by B in 1969. Corporation W first places the property in service in 1971. The property is not eligible property because of the mere change in the form of conducting a trade or business.
(c)
Manner of determining allowance
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Computation of allowance.
(
a
) The allowance for depreciation of property in a vintage account shall be determined in the manner specified in this paragraph by using the method of depreciation adopted by the taxpayer for the account and a rate based upon the asset depreciation period for the account. (For limitations on methods of depreciation permitted with respect to property, see section 167 (c) and (j) and subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph.) In applying the method of depreciation adopted by the taxpayer, the annual allowance for depreciation of a vintage account shall be determined without adjustment for the salvage value of the property in such account except that no account may be depreciated below the reasonable salvage value of the account. (For rules regarding estimation and treatment of salvage value, see paragraph (d)(1) and (3) (vii) and (viii) of this section.) Regardless of the method of depreciation adopted by the taxpayer, the depreciation allowable for a taxable year with respect to a vintage account may not exceed the amount by which (as of the beginning of the taxable year) the unadjusted basis of the account exceeds
(
1
) the reserve for depreciation established for the account plus (
2
) the salvage value of the account. The unadjusted basis of a vintage account is defined in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph. The adjustments to the depreciation reserve are described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
(
b
) The annual allowance for depreciation of a vintage account using the straight line method of depreciation shall be determined by dividing the unadjusted basis of the vintage account (without reduction for salvage value) by the number of years in the asset depreciation period selected for the account. See subdivision (iii)(
b
) of this subparagraph for the manner of computing the depreciation allowance following a change from the declining balance method or the sum of the years-digits method to the straight line method.
(
c
) In the case of the sum of the years-digits method, the annual allowance for depreciation of a vintage account shall be computed by multiplying the unadjusted basis of the vintage account (without reduction for salvage value) by a fraction, the numerator of which changes each year to a number which corresponds to the years remaining in the asset depreciation period for the account (including the year for which the allowance is being computed) and the denominator of which is the sum of all the year's digits corresponding to the asset depreciation period for the account. See subdivision (iii)(
c
) of this subparagraph for the manner of computing the depreciation allowance following a change from the declining balance method to the sum of the years-digits method.
(
d
) The annual allowance for depreciation of a vintage account using a declining balance method is determined by applying a uniform rate to the excess of the unadjusted basis of the vintage account over the depreciation reserve established for that account. The rate under the declining balance method may not exceed twice the straight line rate based upon the asset depreciation period for the vintage account.
(
e
) The allowance for depreciation under this paragraph shall constitute the amount of depreciation allowable under section 167. See section 179 for additional first-year allowance for certain property.
(ii)
Establishment of depreciation reserve.
The taxpayer must establish a depreciation reserve for each vintage account. The amount of the reserve for a guideline class must be stated on each income tax return on which depreciation with respect to such class is determined under this section. The depreciation reserve for a vintage account consists of the accumulated depreciation allowable under this section with respect to the vintage account, increased by the adjustments for ordinary retirements prescribed by paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, by the adjustments for reduction of the salvage value of a vintage account prescribed by paragraph (d)(3)(vii)(
d
) of this section, and by the adjustments for transfers to supplies or scrap prescribed by paragraph (d)(3)(viii)(
b
) of this section, and decreased by the adjustments for extraordinary retirements and certain special retirements as prescribed by paragraph (d)(3) (iv) and (v) of this section, by the adjustments for the amount of the reserve in excess of the unadjusted basis of a vintage account prescribed by paragraph (d)(3)(ix)(
a
) of this section, and by the adjustments for property removed from a vintage account prescribed by paragraphs (b)(4)(iii)(
e
), (5)(v)(
b
) and (6)(iii) of this section. The adjustments to the depreciation reserve for ordinary retirements during the taxable year shall be made as of the beginning of the taxable year. The adjustments to the depreciation reserve for extraordinary retirements shall be made as of the date the retirement is treated as having occurred in accordance with the first-year convention (described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) adopted by the taxpayer for the vintage account. The adjustment to the depreciation reserve for reduction of salvage value and for transfers to supplies or scrap shall, in the case of an ordinary retirement, be made as of the beginning of the taxable year, and in the case of an extraordinary retirement the adjustment for reduction of salvage value shall be made as of the date the retirement is treated as having occurred in accordance with the first-year convention (described in subparagraph (2) of this
paragraph) adopted by the taxpayer for the vintage account. The adjustment to the depreciation reserve for property removed from a vintage account in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(
e
), (5)(v)(
b
) and (6)(iii) of this section shall be made as of the beginning of the taxable year. The depreciation reserve of a vintage account may not be decreased below zero.
(iii)
Consent to change in method of depreciation.
(
a
) During the asset depreciation period for a vintage account, the taxpayer is permitted to change under this section from a declining balance method of depreciation to the sum of the years-digits method of depreciation and from a declining balance method of depreciation or the sum of the years-digits method of depreciation to the straight line method of depreciation with respect to such account. Except as provided in section 167(j)(2)(1), and paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, no other changes in the method of depreciation adopted for a vintage account will be permitted. The provisions of § 1.167(e)-1 shall not apply to any change in depreciation method permitted under this section. The change in method applies to all property in the vintage account and must be adhered to for the entire taxable year of the change.
(
b
) When a change is made to the straight line method of depreciation, the annual allowance for depreciation of the vintage account shall be determined by dividing the adjusted basis of the vintage account (without reduction for salvage value) by the number of years remaining (at the time as of which the change is made) in the asset depreciation period selected for the account. However, the depreciation allowable for any taxable year following a change to the straight line method may not exceed an amount determined by dividing the unadjusted basis of the vintage account (without reduction for salvage value) by the number of years in the asset depreciation period selected for the account.
(
c
) When a change is made from the declining balance method of depreciation to the sum of the years-digits method of depreciation, the annual allowance for depreciation of a vintage account shall be determined by multiplying the adjusted basis of the account (without reduction for salvage value) at the time as of which the change is made by a fraction, the numerator of which changes each year to a number which corresponds to the number of years remaining in the asset depreciation period selected for the account (including the year for which the allowance is being computed), and the denominator of which is the sum of all the year's digits corresponding to the number of years remaining in the asset depreciation period at the time as of which the change is made.
(
d
) The number of years remaining in the asset depreciation period selected for an account is equal to the asset depreciation period less the number of years of depreciation previously allowed. For this purpose, regardless of the first year convention adopted by the taxpayer, it will be assumed that depreciation was allowed for one-half of a year in the first year.
(
e
) The taxpayer shall furnish a statement setting forth the vintage accounts for which the change is made with the income tax return filed for the taxable year of the change.
(
f
) The principles of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a calendar year taxpayer, places new section 1245 property in service in a trade or business as follows:

The property is eligible property and is properly included in a single vintage account. The asset depreciation range for such property is 5 to 7 years and the taxpayer selects an asset depreciation period of 5
1/2
years and adopts the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation. The taxpayer adopts the half-year convention described in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph. After 3 years, A changes from the 200-percent declining balance method to the straight line method of depreciation. Depreciation allowances would be as follows:

(iv)
Limitation on methods.
(
a
) The same method of depreciation must be adopted for all property in a single vintage account. Generally, the method of depreciation which may be adopted is subject to the limitations contained in section 167 (c), (j) and (l).
(
b
) Except as otherwise provided in section 167(j) with respect to certain eligible section 1250 property—
(
1
) In the case of a vintage account for which the taxpayer has selected an asset depreciation period of 3 years or more and which only contains property the original use of which commences with the taxpayer, any method of depreciation described in section 167(b) (1), (2), or (3) may be adopted, but if the vintage account contains property the original use of which does not commence with the taxpayer, or if the asset depreciation period for the account is less than 3 years, a method of depreciation described in section 167(b) (2) or (3) may not be adopted for the account, and
(
2
) The declining balance method using a rate not in excess of 150 percent of the straight line rate based upon the asset depreciation period for the vintage account may be adopted for the account even if the original use of the property does not commence with the taxpayer provided the asset depreciation period for the account is at least 3 years.
(
c
) The term “original use” means the first use to which the property is put, whether or not such use corresponds to the use of such property by the taxpayer. (See § 1.167(c)-1).
(v)
Unadjusted and adjusted basis.
(
a
) For purposes of this section, the unadjusted basis of an asset (including an “excluded addition” and a “property improvement” as described, respectively, in paragraph (d)(2) (vi) and (vii) of this section) is its cost or other basis without any adjustment for depreciation or amortization (other than depreciation under section 179) but with other adjustments required under section 1016 or other applicable provisions of law. The unadjusted basis of a vintage account is the total of the unadjusted bases of all the assets in the account. The unadjusted basis of a “special basis vintage account” as described in paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section is the amount of the property improvement determined in paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(
a
) of this section.
(
b
) The adjusted basis of a vintage account is the amount by which the unadjusted basis of the account exceeds the reserve for depreciation for the account. The adjusted basis of an asset in a vintage account is the amount by which the unadjusted basis of the asset exceeds the amount of depreciation allowable for the asset under this section computed by using the method of depreciation and the rate applicable to the account. For purposes of this subdivision, the depreciation allowable for an asset shall include, to the extent identifiable, the amount of proceeds previously added to the depreciation reserve in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section upon the retirement of any portion of such asset. (See paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section for election under certain circumstances to allocate adjusted basis of an amount of property improvement determined under paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(
a
) of this section.)
(2)
Conventions applied to additions and retirements
—(i)
In general.
The allowance for depreciation of a vintage account (whether an item account or a multiple asset account) shall be determined by applying one of the conventions described in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph. (For the manner of applying a convention in the case of taxable years beginning before and ending after December 31, 1970, see
subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.) The same convention must be adopted for all vintage accounts of a taxable year, but the same convention need not be adopted for the vintage accounts of another taxable year. An election to apply this section must specify the convention adopted. (See paragraph (f) of this section for information required in making the election.) The convention adopted by the taxpayer is a method of accounting for purposes of section 446, but the consent of the Commissioner will be deemed granted to make an annual adoption of either of the conventions described in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph.
(ii)
Modified half-year convention.
The depreciation allowance for a vintage account for which the taxpayer adopts the “modified half-year convention” shall be determined by treating: (
a
) All property in such account which is placed in service during the first half of the taxable year as placed in service on the first day of the taxable year; and (
b
) all property in such account which is placed in service during the second half of the taxable year as placed in service on the first day of the succeeding taxable year. The depreciation allowance for a vintage account for a taxable year in which there is an extraordinary retirement (as defined in paragraph (d) (3) (ii) of this section) of property first placed in service during the first half of the taxable year is determined by treating all such retirements from such account during the first half of the taxable year as occurring on the first day of the taxable year and all such retirements from such account during the second half of the taxable year as occurring on the first day of the second half of the taxable year. The depreciation allowance for a vintage account for a taxable year in which there is an extraordinary retirement (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) of property first placed in service during the second half of the taxable year is determined by treating all such retirements from such account during the first half of the taxable year as occurring on the first day of the second half of the taxable year and all such retirements in the second half of the taxable year as occurring on the first day of the succeeding taxable year.
(iii)
Half-year convention.
The depreciation allowance for a vintage account for which the taxpayer adopts the “half-year convention” shall be determined by treating all property in the account as placed in service on the first day of the second half of the taxable year and by treating all extraordinary retirements (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) from the account as occurring on the first day of the second half of the taxable year.
(iv)
Rules of application.
(
a
) The first-year convention adopted for a vintage account must be consistently applied to all additions to and all extraordinary retirements from such account. See paragraph (d)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section for definition and treatment of ordinary retirements.
(
b
) If the actual number of months in a taxable year is other than 12 full calendar months, depreciation is allowed only for such actual number of months and the term “taxable year”, for purposes of this subparagraph, shall mean only such number of months. In such event, the first half of such taxable year shall be deemed to expire at the close of the last day of a calendar month which is the closest such last day to the middle of such taxable year and the second half of such taxable year shall be deemed to begin the day after the expiration of the first half of such taxable year. If a taxable year consists of a period which includes only 1 calendar month, the first half of the taxable year shall be deemed to expire on the first day which is nearest to the midpoint of the month, and the second half of the taxable year shall begin the day after the expiration of the first half of the month.
(
c
) For purposes of this subparagraph, for property placed in service after November 14, 1979, other than depreciable property described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(
e
) of this section, the taxable year of the person placing such property in service does not include any month before the month in which the person begins engaging in a trade or business or holding depreciable property for the production of income.
(
d
) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) (iv)(
c
) of this section—
(
1
) For property placed in service after February 21, 1981, an employee is not considered engaged in a trade or business by virtue of employment.
(
2
) If a person engages in a small amount of trade or business activity after February 21, 1981, for the purpose of obtaining a disproportionately large depreciation deduction for assets for the taxable year in which they are placed in service, and placing those assets in service represents a substantial increase in the person's level of business activity, then for purposes of depreciating those assets the person will not be treated as beginning a trade or business until the increased amount of business activity begins. For property held for the production of income, the principle of the preceding sentence applies.
(
3
) A person may elect to apply the rules of § 1.167(a)-11 (c)(2)(iv)(
d
) as set forth in T.D. 7763 (“(
d
) rules in T.D. 7763”). This election shall be made by reflecting it under paragraph (f)(4) of this section in the books and records. If necessary, amended returns shall be filed.
(
4
) If an averaging convention was adopted in reliance on or in anticipation of the (
d
) rules in T.D. 7763, that convention may be changed without regard to paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Similarly, if an election is made under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(
d
)(
3
) of this section to apply to the (
d
) rules in T.D. 7763, the averaging convention adopted for the taxable years for which the election is made may be changed. The change shall be made by filing a timely amended return for the taxable year for which the convention was adopted. Notwithstanding the three preceding sentences, if an averaging convention was adopted in reliance on or in anticipation of the (
d
) rules in T.D. 7763, and if an election is made to apply those rules, the averaging convention adopted cannot be changed except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
(
e
) The rules in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(
c
) of this section do not apply to depreciable property placed in service after November 14, 1979, and the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(
d
) of this section do not apply to depreciable property placed in service after February 21, 1981, with respect to which substantial expenditures were paid or incurred prior to November 15, 1979. For purposes of the preceding sentence, expenditures will not be considered substantial unless they exceed the lesser of 30 percent of the final cost of the property or $10 million. Expenditures that are not includible in the basis of the depreciable property will be considered expenditures with respect to property if they are directly related to a specific project involving such property. For purposes of determining whether expenditures were paid or incurred prior to November 15, 1979, expenditures made by a person (transferor) other than the person placing the property in service (transferee) will be taken into account only if the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor. The principle of the preceding sentence also applies if there are multiple transfers.
(v)
Mass assets.
In the case of mass assets, if extraordinary retirements of such assets in a guideline class during the first half of the taxable year are allocated to a particular vintage year for which the taxpayer applied the modified half-year convention, then that portion of the mass assets so allocated which bears the same ratio to the total number of mass assets so allocated as the mass assets in the same vintage and assets guideline class placed in service during the first half of that vintage year bear to the total mass assets in the same vintage and asset guideline class shall be treated as retired on the first day of the taxable year. The remaining mass assets which are subject to extraordinary retirement during the first half of the taxable year and which are allocated to that vintage year and assets guideline class shall be treated as retired on the first days of the second half of the taxable year. If extraordinary retirements of mass assets in a guideline class occur in the second half of the taxable year and are allocated to a particular vintage year for which the taxpayer applied the modified half-year convention, then that portion of the mass assets so allocated which bears the same ratio to the total number of mass assets so allocated as the mass assets in the same vintage and asset
guideline class first placed in service during the first half of that vintage year bear to the total mass assets in the same vintage and asset guideline class shall be treated as retired on the first day of the second half of the taxable year. The remaining mass assets which are subject to extraordinary retirements during the second half of the taxable year and which are allocated to that same vintage and asset guideline class shall be treated as retired on the first day of the succeeding taxable year. If the taxpayer has applied the half-year convention for the vintage year to which the extraordinary retirements are allocated, the mass assets shall be treated as retired on the first day of the second half of the taxable year.
(3)
Taxable years beginning before and ending after December 31, 1970.
In the case of a taxable year which begins before January 1, 1971, and ends after December 31, 1970, property first placed in service after December 31, 1970, but treated as first placed in service before January 1, 1971, by application of a convention described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall be treated as provided in this subparagraph. The depreciation allowed (or allowable) for the taxable year shall consist of the depreciation allowed (or allowable) for the period before January 1, 1971, determined without regard to this section plus the amount allowable for the period after December 31, 1970, determined under this section. However, neither the modified half-year convention described in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, nor the half-year convention described in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph may for any such taxable year be applied with respect to property placed in service after December 31, 1970, to allow depreciation for any period prior to January 1, 1971, unless such convention is consistent with the convention applied by the taxpayer with respect to property placed in service in such taxable year prior to January 1, 1971.
(4)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A, a calendar year taxpayer, places new property in service in a trade or business as follows:
Asset
Placed in service
Unadjusted basis
W
Apr. 1, 1971
$5,000
X
June 30, 1971
8,000
Y
July 15, 1971
12,000
Taxpayer A adopts the modified half-year convention described in subparagraph (2) (ii) of this paragraph. Assets W, X, and Y are placed in a multiple asset account for which the asset depreciation range is 8 to 12 years. A selects 8 years, the minimum asset depreciation period with respect to such assets, and adopts the declining balance method of depreciation using a rate twice the straight line rate (computed without reduction for salvage). The annual rate under this method using a period of 8 years is 25 percent. The depreciation allowance for assets W and X for 1971 is $3,250, a full year's depreciation under the modified half-year convention (that is, basis of $13,000 (unreduced by salvage) multiplied by 25 percent). The depreciation allowance for asset Y for 1971 is zero under the modified half-year convention.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that the taxpayer adopts the half-year convention described in subparagraph (2) (iii) of this paragraph. The depreciation allowance with respect to asset Y is $1,500 (that is the basis of $12,000 multiplied by 25 percent, then multiplied by
1/2
). Assets W and X are also entitled to a depreciation allowance for only a half year. Thus, the depreciation allowance for assets W and X for 1971 is $1,625 (that is,
1/2
of the $3,250 allowance computed in example (1)).

# Example 3.
Asset Z is placed in service by a calendar year taxpayer on December 1, 1971. The taxpayer places asset Z in an item account and adopts the sum of the years-digits method and the half year convention described in subparagraph (2) (iii) of this paragraph. The asset depreciation range for such asset is 4 to 6 years and the taxpayer selects an asset depreciation period of 5 years. The depreciation allowance for asset Z in 1971 is $10,000 (that is, basis of $60,000 (unreduced by salvage) multiplied by
5/15
, the appropriate fraction using the sum of the years-digits method then multiplied by
1/2
, since only one half year's depreciation is allowable under the convention).

# Example 4.
A is a calendar year taxpayer. All taxpayer A's assets are placed in service in the first half of 1971. If the taxpayer selects the modified half-year convention described in subparagraph (2) (ii) of this paragraph, a full year's depreciation is allowable for all assets.

# Example 5.
(i) The taxpayer during his taxable year which begins April 1, 1970, and ends March 31, 1971, places new property in service in a trade or business as follows:
Asset

The taxpayer adopted a convention under § 1.167(a)-10(b) with respect to assets placed in service prior to January 1, 1971, which treats assets placed in service during the first half of the year as placed in service on the first day of such year and assets placed in service in the second half of the year as placed in service on the first day of the following year. If the taxpayer selects the half-year convention described in subparagraph (2) (iii) of this paragraph, one year's depreciation is allowable on asset A determined without regard to this section. No depreciation is allowable for asset B. No depreciation is allowable for asset C for the period prior to January 1, 1971. One-fourth year's depreciation is allowable on asset C determined under this section.
(ii) The facts are the same as in (i) of this example except that the taxpayer adopts the modified half-year convention described in subparagraph (2) (ii) of this paragraph for 1971. No depreciation is allowable for assets B and C which were placed in service in the second half of the taxable year.

# Example 6.
The taxpayer during his taxable year which begins August 1, 1970, and ends July 31, 1971, places new property in service in a trade or business as follows:
Asset
Placed in service
A
Aug. 1, 1970.
B
Jan. 15, 1971.
C
June 30, 1971.
The taxpayer adopted a convention under § 1.167(a)-10(b) with respect to assets placed in service prior to January 1, 1971, which treats all assets as placed in service at the mid-point of the taxable year. If the taxpayer selects the half-year convention described in subparagraph (2) (iii) of this paragraph, one-half year's depreciation is allowable for asset A determined without regard to this section. One-half year's depreciation is allowable for assets B and C determined under this section.

# Example 7.
X, a calendar year corporation, is incorporated on July 1, 1978, and begins engaging in a trade or business in September 1979. X purchases asset A and places it in service on November 20, 1979. Substantial expenditures were not paid or incurred by X with respect to asset A prior to November 15, 1979. For purposes of applying the conventions under this section to determine depreciation for asset A, the 1979 taxable year is treated as consisting of 4 months. The first half of the taxable year ends on October 31, 1979, and the second half begins on November 1, 1979. X adopts the half-year convention. Asset A is treated as placed in service on November 1, 1979.

# Example 8.
On January 20, 1982, A, B, and C enter an agreement to form partnership P for the purpose of purchasing and leasing a ship to a third party, Z. P uses the calendar year as its taxable year. On December 15, 1982, P acquires the ship and leases it to Z. For purposes of applying the conventions, P begins its leasing business in December 1982, and its taxable year begins on December 1, 1982. Assuming that P elects to apply this section and adopts the modified half-year convention, P depreciates the ship placed in service in 1982 for the 1-month period beginning December 1, 1982, and ending December 31, 1982.

# Example 9.
A and B form partnership P on December 15, 1981, to conduct a business of leasing small aircraft. P uses the calendar year as its taxable year. On January 15, 1982, P acquires and places in service a $25,000 aircraft. P begins engaging in business with only one aircraft for the purpose of obtaining a disproportionately large depreciation deduction for aircraft that P plans to acquire at the end of the year. On December 10, 1982, P acquires and places in service 4 aircraft, the total purchase price of which is $250,000. For purposes of applying the conventions to the aircraft acquired in December, P begins its leasing business in December 1982, and P's taxable year begins December 1, 1982, and ends December 31, 1982. Assuming that P elects to apply this section and adopts the modified half-year convention, P depreciates the aircraft placed in service in December 1982, for the 1-month period beginning December 1, 1982, and ending December 31, 1982. P depreciates the aircraft placed in service in January 1982, for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1982, and ending December 31, 1982.

Special rules for salvage, repairs and retirements
—(1)
Salvage value
—(i)
Definition of gross salvage value.
“Gross salvage” value is the amount which is estimated will be realized upon a sale or other disposition of the property in the vintage account when it is no longer useful in the taxpayer's trade or business or in the production of his income and is to be retired from service, without reduction for the cost of removal, dismantling, demolition or similar operations. If a taxpayer customarily sells or otherwise disposes of property at a time when such property is still in good operating condition, the gross salvage value of such property is the amount expected to be realized upon such sale or disposition, and under certain circumstances, as where such
property is customarily sold at a time when it is still relatively new, the gross salvage value may constitute a relatively large proportion of the unadjusted basis of such property.
(ii)
Definition of salvage value.
“Salvage value” means gross salvage value less the amount, if any, by which the gross salvage value is reduced by application of section 167(f). Generally, as provided in section 167(f), a taxpayer may reduce the amount of gross salvage value of a vintage account by an amount which does not exceed 10 percent of the unadjusted basis of the personal property (as defined in section 167(f)(2)) in the account. See paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section for requirement of separate vintage accounts for personal property described in section 167(f)(2).
(iii)
Estimation of salvage value.
The salvage value of each vintage account of the taxable year shall be estimated by the taxpayer at the time the election to apply this section is made, upon the basis of all the facts and circumstances existing at the close of the taxable year in which the account is established. The taxpayer shall specify the amount, if any, by which gross salvage value taken into account is reduced by application of section 167(f). See paragraph (f)(2) of this section for requirement that the election specify the estimated salvage value for each vintage account of the taxable year of election. The salvage value estimated by the taxpayer will not be redetermined merely as a result of fluctuations in price levels or as a result of other facts and circumstances occurring after the close of the taxable year of election. Salvage value for a vintage account need not be established or increased as a result of a property improvement as described in subparagraph (2) (vii) of this paragraph. The taxpayer shall maintain records reasonably sufficient to determine facts and circumstances taken into account in estimating salvage value.
(iv)
Salvage as limitation on depreciation.
In no case may a vintage account be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value after taking into account any reduction in gross salvage value permitted by section 167(f).
(v)
Limitation on adjustment of reasonable salvage value.
The salvage value established by the taxpayer for a vintage account will not be redetermined if it is reasonable. Since the determination of salvage value is a matter of estimation, minimal adjustments will not be made. The salvage value established by the taxpayer will be deemed to be reasonable unless there is sufficient basis in the facts and circumstances existing at the close of the taxable year in which the account is established for a determination of an amount of salvage value for the account which exceeds the salvage value established by the taxpayer for the account by an amount greater than 10 percent of the unadjusted basis of the account at the close of the taxable year in which the account is established. If the salvage value established by the taxpayer for the account is not within the 10 percent range, or if the taxpayer follows the practice of understating his estimates of gross salvage value to take advantage of this subdivision, and if there is a determination of an amount of salvage value for the account which exceeds the salvage value established by the taxpayer for the account, an adjustment will be made by increasing the salvage value established by the taxpayer for the account by an amount equal to the difference between the salvage value as determined and the salvage value established by the taxpayer for the account. For the purposes of this subdivision, a determination of salvage value shall include all determinations at all levels of audit and appellate proceedings, and as well as all final determinations within the meaning of section 1313(a) (1). This subdivision shall apply to each such determination. (See example (3) of subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph.)
(vi)
Examples.
The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples in which it is assumed that the taxpayer has not followed a practice of understating his estimates of gross salvage value:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer B elects to apply this section to assets Y and Z, which are placed in a multiple asset vintage account of 1971 for which the taxpayer selects an asset depreciation period of 8 years. The unadjusted basis of asset Y is $50,000 and the unadjusted
basis of asset Z is $30,000. B estimates a gross salvage value of $55,000. The property qualifies under section 167(f) (2) and B reduces the amount of salvage taken into account by $8,000 (that is, 10 percent of $80,000 under section 167(f)). Thus, B establishes a salvage value of $47,000 for the account. Assume that there is not sufficient basis for determining a salvage value for the account greater than $52,000 (that is, $60,000 minus the $8,000 reduction under section 167(f)). Since the salvage value of $47,000 established by B for the account is within the 10 percent range, it is reasonable. Salvage value for the account will not be redetermined.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that B estimates a gross salvage value of $50,000 and establishes a salvage value of $42,000 for the account (that is, $50,000 minus the $8,000 reduction under section 167(f)). There is sufficient basis for determining an amount of salvage value greater than $50,000 (that is, $58,000 minus the $8,000 reduction under section 167(f)). The salvage value of $42,000 established by B for the account can be redetermined without regard to the limitation in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph, since it is not within the 10 percent range. Upon audit of B's tax return for a taxable year for which the redetermination would affect the amount of depreciation allowable for the account, salvage value is determined to be $52,000 after taking into account the reduction under section 167(f). Salvage value for the account will be adjusted to $52,000.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that upon audit of B's tax return for a taxable year the examining officer determines the salvage value to be $58,000 (that is, $66,000 minus the $8,000 reduction under section 167(f)), and proposes to adjust salvage value for the vintage account to $58,000 which will result in disallowing an amount of depreciation for the taxable year. B does not agree with the finding of the examining officer. After receipt of a “30-day letter”, B waives a district conference and initiates proceedings before the Appellate Division. In consideration of the case by the Appellate Division it is concluded that there is not sufficient basis for determining an amount of salvage value for the account in excess of $55,000 (that is $63,000 minus the $8,000 reduction under section 167(f)). Since the salvage of $47,000 established by B for the account is within the 10 percent range, it is reasonable. Salvage value for the account will not be redetermined.

# Example 4.
Taxpayer C elects to apply this section to factory building X which is placed in an item vintage account of 1971. The unadjusted basis of factory building X is $90,000. C estimates a gross salvage value for the account of $10,000. The property does not qualify under section 167(f)(2). C establishes a salvage value of $10,000 for the account. Assume that there is not sufficient basis for determining a salvage value for the account greater than $18,000. Since the salvage value of $10,000 established by B for the account is within the 10 percent range, it is reasonable. Salvage value for the account will not be redetermined.
(2)
Treatment of repairs
—(i)
In general.
(
a
) Sections 162, 212, and 263 provide general rules for the treatment of certain expenditures for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of property. In general, under those sections, expenditures which substantially prolong the life of an asset, or are made to increase its value or adapt it to a different use are capital expenditures. If an expenditure is treated as a capital expenditure under section 162, 212, or 263, it is subject to the allowance for depreciation. On the other hand, in general, expenditures which do not substantially prolong the life of an asset or materially increase its value or adapt it for a substantially different use may be deducted as an expense in the taxable year in which paid or incurred. Expenditures, or a series of expenditures, may have characteristics both of deductible expenses and capital expenditures. Other expenditures may have the characteristics of capital expenditures, as in the case of an “excluded addition” (as defined in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph). This subparagraph provides a simplified procedure for determining whether expenditures with respect to certain property are to be treated as deductible expenses or capital expenditures.
(
b
) [Reserved]
(ii)
Election of repair allowance.
In the case of an asset guideline class which consists of “repair allowance property” as defined in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, subject to the provisions of subdivision (v) of this subparagraph, the taxpayer may elect to apply the asset guideline class repair allowance described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1970, for which the taxpayer elects to apply this section.
(iii)
Repair allowance for an asset guideline class.
For a taxable year for which the taxpayer elects to apply this section, the “repair allowance” for an asset guideline class which consists of
“repair allowance property” is an amount equal to—
(
a
) The average of (
1
) the unadjusted basis of all “repair allowance property” in the asset guideline class at the beginning of the taxable year, less in the case of such property in a vintage account the unadjusted basis of all such property retired in an ordinary retirement (as described in subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph) in prior taxable years, and (
2
) the unadjusted basis of all “repair allowance property” in the asset guideline class at the end of the taxable year, less in the case of such property in a vintage account the unadjusted basis of all such property retired in an ordinary retirement (including ordinary retirements during the taxable year), multiplied by—
(
b
) The repair allowance percentage in effect for the asset guideline class for the taxable year.
In applying the assets guideline class repair allowance to buildings which are section 1250 property, for the purpose of this subparagraph each building shall be treated as in a separate asset guideline class. If two or more buildings are in the same asset guideline class determined without regard to the preceding sentence and are operated as an integrated unit (as evidenced by their actual operation, management, financing and accounting), they shall be treated as a single building for this purpose. The “repair allowance percentages” in effect for taxable years ending before the effective date of the first supplemental repair allowance percentages established pursuant to this section are set forth in Revenue Procedure 72-10. Repair allowance percentages will from time to time be established, supplemented and revised with express reference to this section. These repair allowance percentages will be published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. The repair allowance percentages in effect on the last day of the taxable year shall apply for the taxable year, except that the repair allowance percentage for a particular taxable year shall not be less than the repair allowance percentage in effect on the first day of such taxable year (or as of such later time in such year as a repair allowance percentage first established during such year becomes effective). Generally, the repair allowance percentages for a taxable year shall not be changed to reflect any supplement or revision of the repair allowance percentages after the end of such taxable year. However, if expressly provided in such a supplement or revision of the repair allowance percentages, the taxpayer may, at his option in the manner specified therein, apply the revised or supplemented repair allowance percentages for such taxable year and succeeding taxable years. For the purposes of this section, “repair allowance property” means eligible property determined without regard to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section (that is, without regard to whether such property was first placed in service by the taxpayer before or after December 31, 1970) in an asset guideline class for which a repair allowance percentage is in effect for the taxable year. The determination whether property is repair allowance property shall be made without regard to whether such property is excluded, under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, from an election to apply this section. Property in an asset guideline class for which the taxpayer elects to apply the asset guideline class repair allowance described in this subdivision, which results from expenditures in the taxable year of election for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation, or improvement of property in an asset guideline class shall not be “repair allowance property” for such taxable year but shall be for each succeeding taxable year provided such property is a property improvement as described in subdivision (vii) (
a
) of this subparagraph and is in an asset guideline class for which a repair allowance percentage is in effect for such succeeding taxable year.
(iv)
Application of asset guideline class repair allowance.
In accordance with the principles of sections 162, 212, and 263, if the taxpayer pays or incurs any expenditures during the taxable year for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of eligible property (determined without regard to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section), the taxpayer must either—
(
a
) If such property is repair allowance property and if the taxpayer elects to apply the repair allowance for
the asset guideline class, treat an amount of all such expenditures in such taxable year with respect to all such property in the asset guideline class which does not exceed in total the repair allowance for that asset guideline class as deductible repairs, and treat the excess of all such expenditures with respect to all such property in the asset guideline class in the manner described for a property improvement in subdivision (viii) of this subparagraph, or
(
b
) If such property is not repair allowance property or if the taxpayer does not elect to apply the repair allowance for the asset guideline class, treat each of such expenditures in such taxable year with respect to all such property in the asset guideline class as either a capital expenditure or as a deductible repair in accordance with the principles of sections 162, 212, and 263 (without regard to (
a
) of this subdivision), and treat the expenditures which are required to be capitalized under sections 162, 212, and 263 (without regard to (
a
) of this subdivision) in the manner described for a property improvement in subdivision (viii) of this subparagraph.
For the purposes of (
a
) of this subdivision, expenditures for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of property do not include expenditures for an excluded addition or for which a deduction is allowed under section 167(k). (See subdivision (viii) of this subparagraph for treatment of an excluded addition.) The taxpayer shall elect each taxable year whether to apply the repair allowance and treat expenditures under (
a
) of this subdivision, or to treat expenditures under (
b
) of this subdivision. The treatment of expenditures under this subdivision for a taxable year for all asset guideline classes shall be specified in the books and records of the taxpayer for the taxable year. The taxpayer may treat expenditures under (
a
) of this subdivision with respect to property in one asset guideline class and treat expenditures under (
b
) of this subdivision with respect to property in some other asset guideline class. In addition, the taxpayer may treat expenditures with respect to property in an asset guideline class under (
a
) of this subdivision in one taxable year, and treat expenditures with respect to property in that asset guideline class under (
b
) of this subdivision in another taxable year.
(v)
Special rules for repair allowance.
(
a
) The asset guideline class repair allowance described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph shall apply only to expenditures for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of repair allowance property (as described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph). The taxpayer may apply the asset guideline class repair allowance for the taxable year only if he maintains books and records reasonably sufficient to determine:
(
1
) The amount of expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of repair allowance property in the asset guideline class, and
(
2
) The expenditures (and the amount thereof) with respect to such property which are for excluded additions (such as whether the expenditure is for an additional identifiable unit of property, or substantially increases the productivity or capacity of an existing identifiable unit of property or adapts it for a substantially different use).
In general, such books and records shall be sufficient to identify the amount and nature of expenditures with respect to specific items of repair allowance property or groups of similar properties in the same asset guideline class. However, in the case of such expenditures with respect to property, part of which is in one asset guideline class and part in another, or part of which is repair allowance property and part of which is not, and in comparable circumstances involving property in the same asset guideline class, to the extent books and records are not maintained identifying such expenditures with specific items of property or groups of similar properties and it is not practicable to do so, the total amount of such expenditures which is not specifically identified may be allocated by any reasonable method consistently applied. In any case, the cost of repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of property performed
by production personnel may be allocated by any reasonable method consistently applied and if performed incidental to production and not substantial in amount, no allocation to repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement need be made. The types of expenditures for which specific identification would ordinarily be made include: Substantial expenditures such as for major parts or major structural materials for which a work order is or would customarily be written; expenditures for work performed by an outside contractor; or expenditures under a specific down time program. Types of expenditures for which specific identification would ordinarily be impractical include: General maintenance costs of machinery, equipment, and plant in the case of a taxpayer having assets in more than one class (or different types of assets in the same class) which are located together and generally maintained by the same work crew; small supplies which are used with respect to various classes or types of property; labor costs of personnel who work on property in different classes, or different types of property in the same class, if the work is performed on a routine, as needed, basis and the only identification of the property repaired is by the personnel. Factors which will be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of the taxpayer's allocation of expenditures include prior experience of the taxpayer; relative bases of the assets in the guideline class; types of assets involved; and relationship to specifically identified expenditures.
(
b
) If for the taxable year the taxpayer elects to deduct under section 263(e) expenditures with respect to repair allowance property consisting of railroad rolling stock (other than a locomotive) in a particular asset guideline class, the taxpayer may not, for such taxable year, use the asset guideline class repair allowance described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for any property in such asset guideline class.
(
c
)(
1
) If the taxpayer repairs, rehabilitates or improves property for sale or resale to customers, the asset guideline class repair allowance described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph shall not apply to expenditures for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of such property, or (
2
) if a taxpayer follows the practice of acquiring for his own use property (in need of repair, rehabilitation or improvement to be suitable for the use intended by the taxpayer) and of making expenditures to repair, rehabilitate or improve such property in order to take advantage of this subparagraph, the asset guideline class repair allowance described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph shall not apply to such expenditures. In either event, such property shall not be “repair allowance property” as described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.
(vi)
Definition of excluded addition.
The term “excluded addition” means—
(
a
) An expenditure which substantially increases the productivity of an existing identifiable unit of property over its productivity when first acquired by the taxpayer;
(
b
) An expenditure which substantially increases the capacity of an existing identifiable unit of property over its capacity when first acquired by the taxpayer;
(
c
) An expenditure which modifies an existing identifiable unit of property for a substantially different use;
(
d
) An expenditure for an identifiable unit of property if (
1
) such expenditure is for an additional identifiable unit of property or (
2
) such expenditure (other than an expenditure described in (
e
) of this subdivision) is for replacement of an identifiable unit of property which was retired;
(
e
) An expenditure for replacement of a part in or a component or portion of an existing identifiable unit of property (whether or not such part, component or portion is also an identifiable unit of property) if such part, component or portion is for replacement of a part, component or portion which was retired in a retirement upon which gain or loss is recognized (or would be recognized but for a special nonrecognition provision of the Code or § 1.1502-13).
(
f
) In the case of a building or other structure (in addition to (
b
), (
c
), (
d
), and (
e
) of this subdivision which also apply to such property), an expenditure
for additional cubic or linear space; and
(
g
) In the case of those units of property of pipelines, electric utilities, telephone companies, and telegraph companies consisting of lines, cables and poles (in addition to (
a
) through (
e
) of this subdivision which also apply to such property), an expenditure for replacement of a material portion of the unit of property.
Except as provided in (
d
) and (
e
) of this subdivision, notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, the term “excluded addition” does not include any expenditure in connection with the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of an identifiable unit of property which does not exceed $100. For this purpose all related expenditures with respect to the unit of property shall be treated as a single expenditure. For the purposes of (
a
), and (
b
) of this subdivision, an increase in productivity or capacity is substantial only if the increase is more than 25 percent. An expenditure which merely extends the productive life of an identifiable unit of property is not an increase in productivity within the meaning of (
a
) of this subdivision. Under (
g
) of this subdivision a replacement is material only if the portion replaced exceeds 5 percent of the unit of property with respect to which the replacement is made. For the purposes of this subdivision, a unit of property generally consists of each operating unit (that is, each separate machine or piece of equipment) which performs a discrete function and which the taxpayer customarily acquires for original installation and retires as a unit. The taxpayer's accounting classification of units of property will generally be accepted for purposes of this subdivision provided the classifications are reasonably consistent with the preceding sentence and are consistently applied. In the case of a building the unit of property generally consists of the building as well as its structural components; except that each building service system (such as an elevator, an escalator, the electrical system, or the heating and cooling system) is an identifiable unit for the purpose of (
a
), (
b
), (
c
), and (
d
) of this subdivision. However, both in the case of machinery and equipment and in the case of a building, for the purpose of applying (
d
)(
1
) of this subdivision a unit of property may consist of a part in or a component or portion of a larger unit of property. In the case of property described in (
g
) of this subdivision (such as a pipeline), a unit of property generally consists of each segment which performs a discrete function either as to capacity, service, transmission or distribution between identifiable points. Thus, for example, under this subdivision in the case of a vintage account of five automobiles each automobile is an identifiable unit of property (which is not merely a part in or a component or portion of larger unit of property within the meaning of (
e
) of this subdivision). Accordingly, the replacement of one of the automobiles (which is retired) with another automobile is an excluded addition under (
d
)(
2
) of this subdivision. Also the purchase of a sixth automobile is an expenditure for an additional identifiable unit of property and is an excluded addition under (
d
)(
1
) of this subdivision. An automobile air conditioner is also an identifiable unit of property for the purposes of (
d)(1)
of this subdivision, but not for the purposes of (
d
)(
2
) of this subdivision. Accordingly, the addition of an air conditioner to an automobile is an excluded addition under (
d
)(
1
) of this subdivision, but the replacement of an existing air conditioner in an automobile is not an excluded addition under (
d
)(
2
) of this subdivision (since it is merely the replacement of a part in an existing identifiable unit of property). The replacement of the air conditioner may, however, be an excluded addition under (
e
) of this subdivision, if the air conditioner replaced was retired in a retirement upon which gain or loss was recognized. The principles of this subdivision may be further illustrated by the following examples in which it is assumed (unless otherwise stated) that (
e
) of this subdivision does not apply:

# Example 1.
For the taxable year, B pays or incurs only the following expenditures: (
1
) $5,000 for general maintenance of repair allowance property (as described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) such as inspection, oiling, machine adjustments, cleaning, and painting; (
2
) $175 for replacement of bearings and gears in an existing lathe; (
3
) $125 for replacement of an electric starter (of the same
capacity) and certain electrical wiring in an automatic drill press; (
4
) $300 for modification of a metal fabricating machine (including replacement of certain parts) which substantially increases its capacity; (
5
) $175 for repair of the same metal fabricating machine which does not substantially increase its capacity; (
6
) $800 for the replacement of an existing lathe with a new lathe; and (
7
) $65 for the repair of a drill press. Expenditures (
1
) through (
3
) are expenditures for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of property to which B can elect to apply the asset guideline class repair allowance described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. Expenditure (
4
) is an excluded addition under (
b
) of this subdivision. Expenditure (
5
) is not an excluded addition. Expenditure (
6
) is an excluded addition under (
d
)(
2
) of this subdivision. Without regard to (
a
), (
b
), and (
c
) of this subdivision, expenditure (
7
) is not an excluded addition since the expenditure does not exceed $100.

# Example 2.
Corporation M operates a steel plant which produces rails, blooms, billets, special bar sections, reinforcing bars, and large diameter line pipe. During the taxable year, corporation M: (
1
) relines an openhearth furnace; (
2
) places in service 20 new ingot molds; (
3
) replaces one reversing roll in the blooming mill; (
4
) overhauls the rail and billet mill with no increase in capacity; (
5
) replaces a roll stand in the 20-inch bar mill; and (
6
) overhauls the 11-inch bar mill and reducing stands increasing billet speed from 1,800 feet per minute to 2,300 feet per minute. Assume that each expenditure exceeds $100. Expenditure (
1
) is not an excluded addition. Expenditure (
2
) is an excluded addition under (
d
)(
1
) of this subdivision. Expenditure (
3
) is not an excluded addition since the expenditure for the reversing roll merely replaces a part in an existing identifiable unit of property. Expenditure (
4
) is not an excluded addition. Expenditure (
5
) is an excluded addition under (
d
)(
2
) of this subdivision since the roll stand is not merely a part of an existing identifiable unit of property. Expenditure (
6
) is an excluded addition under (
a
) of this subdivision since it increases the billet speed by more than 25 percent.

# Example 3.
For the taxable year, corporation X pays or incurs the following expenditures: (
1
) $1,000 for two new temporary partition walls in the company's offices; (

(vii)
Definition of property improvement.
The term “property improvement” means—
(
a
) If the taxpayer treats expenditures for the asset guideline class under subdivision (iv) (
a
) of this subparagraph, the amount of all expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of repair allowance property in the asset guideline class, which exceeds the asset guideline class repair allowance for the taxable year; and
(
b
) If the taxpayer treats expenditures for the asset guideline class under subdivision (iv) (
b
) of this subparagraph, the amount of each expenditure paid or incurred during the taxable year for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of property which is treated under sections 162, 212, and 263 as a capital expenditure.
The term “property improvement” does not include any expenditure for an excluded addition.
(viii)
Treatment of property improvements and excluded additions.
If for the
taxable year there is a property improvement as described in subdivision (vii) of this subparagraph or an excluded addition as described in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph, the following rules shall apply—
(
a
) The total amount of any property improvement for the asset guideline class determined under subdivision (vii)(
a
) of this subparagraph shall be capitalized in a single “special basis vintage account” of the taxable year in accordance with the taxpayer's election to apply this section for the taxable year (applied without regard to paragraph (b)(5)(v)(
a
) of this section). See subparagraph (3)(vi) of this paragraph for definition and treatment of a “special basis vintage account”.
(
b
) Each property improvement determined under subdivision (vii)(
b
) of this subparagraph, if it is eligible property, shall be capitalized in a vintage account of the taxable year in accordance with the taxpayer's election to apply this section for the taxable year (applied without regard to paragraph (b)(5)(v)(
a
) of this section).
(
c
) Each excluded addition, if it is eligible property, shall be capitalized in a vintage account of the taxable year in accordance with the taxpayer's election to apply this section for the taxable year.
For rule as to date on which a property improvement or an excluded addition is first placed in service, see paragraph (e)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section.
(ix)
Examples.
The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
For the taxable year 1972, B elects to apply this section. B has repair allowance property (as described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) in asset guideline class 20.2 under Revenue Procedure 72-10 with an average unadjusted basis determined as provided in subdivision (iii) (
a
) of this subparagraph of $100,000 and repair allowance property in asset guideline class 24.4 with an average unadjusted basis of $300,000. The repair allowance percentage for asset guideline class 20.2 is 4.5 percent and for asset guideline class 24.4 is 6.5 percent. The two asset guideline class repair allowances for 1972 are $4,500 and $19,500, respectively, determined as follows:
Asset Guideline Class 20.2
$100,000 average unadjusted basis multiplied by 4.5 percent
$4,500
Asset Guideline Class 24.4
$300,000 average unadjusted basis multiplied by 6.5 percent
$19,500

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1). During the taxable year 1972, B pays or incurs the following expenditures for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of repair allowance property in asset guideline class 20.2
General maintenance (including primarily labor costs)
$3,000
Replacement of parts in several machines (including labor costs of $1,650)
4,000
7,000
In addition, in connection with the rehabilitation and improvement of two other machines B pays or incurs $6,000 (including labor costs of $2,000) which is treated as an excluded addition because the capacity of the machines was substantially increased. For 1972, B elects to apply this section and to apply the asset guideline class repair allowance to asset guideline class 20.2. Since the asset guideline class repair allowance is $4,500, B can deduct $4,500 in accordance with subdivision (iv) (
a
) of this subparagraph. B must capitalize $2,500 in a special basis vintage account in accordance with subdivisions (vii) (
a
) and (viii) (
a
) of this subparagraph. Since the excluded addition is a capital item and is eligible property, B must also capitalize $6,000 in a vintage account in accordance with subdivision (viii) (
c
) of this subparagraph. B selects from the asset depreciation range an asset depreciation period of 17 years for the special basis vintage account. B includes the excluded addition in a vintage account of 1972 for which he also selects an asset depreciation period of 17 years.
(3)
Treatment of retirements
—(i)
In general.
The rules of this subparagraph specify the treatment of all retirements from vintage accounts. The rules of § 1.167(a)-8 shall not apply to any retirement from a vintage account. An asset in a vintage account is retired when such asset is permanently withdrawn from use in a trade or business or in the production of income by the taxpayer. A retirement may occur as a result of a sale or exchange, by other act of the taxpayer amounting to a permanent disposition of an asset, or by physical abandonment of an asset. A retirement may also occur by transfer of an asset to supplies or scrap.
(ii)
Definitions of ordinary and extraordinary retirements.
The term “ordinary retirement” means any retirement of section 1245 property from a vintage account which is not treated as an “extraordinary retirement” under this
subparagraph. The retirement of an asset from a vintage account in a taxable year is an “extraordinary retirement” if—
(
a
) The asset is section 1250 property;
(
b
) The asset is section 1245 property which is retired as the direct result of fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty and the taxpayer, at his option consistently applied (taking into account type, frequency, and the size of such casualties) treats such retirements as extraordinary; or
(
c)(1
) The asset is section 1245 property which is retired (other than by transfer to supplies or scrap) in a taxable year as the direct result of a cessation, termination, curtailment, or disposition of a business, manufacturing, or other income producing process, operation, facility or unit, and (2) the unadjusted basis (determined without regard to subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph) of all such assets so retired in such taxable year from such account as a direct result of the event described in (
c)(1
) of this subdivision exceeds 20 percent of the unadjusted basis of such account immediately prior to such event.
For the purposes of (
c
) of this subdivision, all accounts (other than a special basis vintage account as described in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph) containing section 1245 property of the same vintage in the same asset guideline class, and from which a retirement as a direct result of such event occurs within the taxable year, shall be treated as a single vintage account. See subdivision (xi) of this subparagraph for special rule for item accounts. The principles of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A is a processor and distributor of dairy products. Part of taxpayer A's operation is a bottle washing facility consisting of machines X, Y, and Z, each of which is in an item vintage account of 1971. Each item vintage account has an unadjusted basis of $1,000. Taxpayer A also has a 1971 multiple asset vintage account consisting of machines E, S, and C. Machines E and S, used in processing butter, each has an unadjusted basis of $10,000. Machine C used in capping bottles has an unadjusted basis of $1,000. In 1975, taxpayer A changes to the use of paper milk cartons and disposes of all bottle washing machines (X, Y, and Z) as well as machine C which was used in capping bottles. The sales of machine C, X, Y, and Z are the direct result of the termination of a manufacturing process. However, since the total unadjusted basis of the eligible section 1245 property retired as a direct result of such event is only $4,000 (which is less than 20 percent of the total unadjusted basis of machines E, S, C, X, Y, and Z, $24,000) the sales are ordinary retirements. All the assets are in the same asset guideline class and are of the same vintage. Accordingly, machines E, S, C, X, Y, and Z are for this purpose treated as being in a single vintage account.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that in 1976, taxpayer A sells six of his 12 milk delivery trucks as a direct result of eliminating home deliveries to customers in the suburbs. Deliveries within the city require only six trucks. Each of the trucks has an unadjusted basis of $3,000. Six of the taxpayer's delivery trucks are in a multiple asset vintage account of 1974 and six are in a multiple asset vintage account of 1972. Neither account contains any other property. Four trucks are retired from the 1972 vintage account and two trucks are retired from the 1974 vintage account. The sales result from the curtailment of taxpayer A's home delivery operation. The unadjusted basis of the four trucks retired from the 1972 vintage exceeds 20 percent of the total unadjusted basis of the affected account. The same is true for the two trucks retired from the 1974 vintage account. The sales of the trucks are extraordinary retirements.
(
d
) The asset is section 1245 property which is retired after December 30, 1980 by a charitable contribution for which a deduction is allowable under section 170.
(iii)
Treatment of ordinary retirements.
No loss shall be recognized upon an ordinary retirement. Gain shall be recognized only to the extent specified in this subparagraph. All proceeds from ordinary retirements shall be added to the depreciation reserve of the vintage account from which the retirement occurs. See subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph for optional allocation of basis in the case of a special basis vintage account. See subdivision (ix) of this subparagraph for recognition of gain when the depreciation reserve exceeds the unadjusted basis of the vintage account. The amount of salvage value for a vintage account shall be reduced (but not below zero) as of the beginning of the taxable year by the excess of (
a
) the depreciation reserve for the account, after adjustment for depreciation allowable for such taxable
year and all other adjustments prescribed by this section (other than the adjustment prescribed by subdivision (ix) of this subparagraph), over (
b
) the unadjusted basis of the account less the amount of salvage value for the account before such reduction. Thus, in the case of a vintage account with an unadjusted basis of $1,000 and a salvage value of $100, to the extent that proceeds from ordinary retirements increase the depreciation reserve above $900, the salvage value is reduced. If the proceeds increase the depreciation reserve for the account to $1,000, the salvage value is reduced to zero. The unadjusted basis of the asset retired in an ordinary retirement is not removed from the account and the depreciation reserve for the account is not reduced by the depreciation allowable for the retired asset. The previously unrecovered basis of the retired asset will be recovered through the allowance for depreciation with respect to the vintage account. See subdivision (v)(
a
) of this subparagraph for treatment of retirements on which gain or loss is not recognized in whole or in part. See subdivision (v)(
b
) of this subparagraph for treatment of retirements by disposition to a member of an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a). See subdivision (v)(
c
) of this subparagraph for treatment of transfers between members of an affiliated group of corporations or other related parties as extraordinary retirements.
(iv)
Treatment of extraordinary retirements.
(
a
) Unless the transaction is governed by a special nonrecognition section of the Code such as 1031 or 337 or is one to which subdivision (v)(
b
) of this subparagraph applies, gain or loss shall be recognized upon an extraordinary retirement in the taxable year in which such retirement occurs subject to section 1231, section 165, and all other applicable provisions of law such as sections 1245 and 1250. If the asset which is retired in an extraordinary retirement is the only or last asset in the account, the account shall terminate and no longer be an account to which this section applies. In all other cases, the unadjusted basis of the retired asset shall be removed from the unadjusted basis of the vintage account, and the depreciation reserve established for the account shall be reduced by the depreciation allowable for the retired asset computed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c) (1)(v)(
b
) of this section for determination of the adjusted basis of the asset. See subdivision (ix) of this subparagraph for recognition of gain in the case of an account containing section 1245 property when the depreciation reserve exceeds the unadjusted basis of the vintage account. See subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for reduction of salvage value for such an account when the depreciation reserve exceeds the unadjusted basis of the account minus salvage value. See subdivision (v)(
b
) of this subparagraph for treatment of retirements by disposition to a member of an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a).
(
b
) The principles of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X has a multiple asset vintage account of 1971 consisting of assets K, R, A, and P all of which are section 1245 property. The unadjusted basis of the account is $40,000. The unadjusted basis of asset A is $10,000. When the reserve for depreciation for the account is $20,000, asset A is sold in an extraordinary retirement for $8,000 in cash. The $10,000 unadjusted basis of asset A is removed from the account and the $5,000 depreciation allowable for asset A is removed from the reserve for depreciation. Gain in the amount of $3,000 (to which section 1245 applies) is recognized upon the sale of asset A.

# Example 2.
Corporation X has an item vintage account of 1972 consisting of residential apartment unit A. Unit A is section 1250 property. It is residential rental property and meets the requirements of section 167(j)(2). Corporation X adopts the declining balance method of depreciation using a rate twice the straight line rate. The asset depreciation period is 40 years. Unit A has an unadjusted basis of $200,000. On June 30, 1974, when the reserve for depreciation for the account is $19,500, unit A is sold for $220,000. Since unit A is section 1250 property, the sale is an extraordinary retirement in accordance with subdivision (ii)(
a
) of this subparagraph (without regard to subdivision (ii)(
b
) or (
c
) of this subparagraph). The adjusted basis of unit A is $180,500. Gain in the amount of $39,500 is recognized. The “additional depreciation” (as defined in section 1250(b)) for unit A is $9,500. Accordingly, $9,500 is in accordance with section 1250 treated as gain from the sale or exchange of an asset which is neither a capital asset nor
property described in section 1231. The $30,000 balance of the gain from the sale of unit A may be gain to which section 1231 applies.
(v)
Special rule for certain retirements.
(
a
) In the case of an ordinary retirement on which gain or loss is in whole or in part not recognized because of a special nonrecognition section of the Code, such as 1031 or 337, no part of the proceeds from such retirement shall be added to the depreciation reserve of the vintage account in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. Instead, such retirement shall for all purposes of this section be treated as an extraordinary retirement.
(
b
) The provisions of § 1.1502-13 shall apply to a retirement. In the case of an ordinary retirement to which the provisions of § 1.1502-13 apply, no part of the proceeds from such retirement shall be added to the depreciation reserve of the vintage account in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. Instead, such retirement shall for all purposes of this section be treated as an extraordinary retirement.
(
c
) In a case in which property is transferred, in a transaction which would without regard to this subdivision be treated as an ordinary retirement, during the taxable year in which first placed in service to a person who bears a relationship described in section 179(d)(2) (A) or (B), such transfer shall for all purposes of this section be treated as an extraordinary retirement.
(
d
)(
1
) If, in the case of mass assets, it is impracticable for the taxpayer to maintain records from which he can establish the vintage of such assets as retirements occur, and if he adopts other reasonable recordkeeping practices, then the vintage of mass asset retirements may be determined by use of an appropriate mortality dispersion table. Such a mortality dispersion table may be based upon an acceptable sampling of the taxpayer's actual experience or other acceptable statistical or engineering techniques. Alternatively, the taxpayer may use a standard mortality dispersion table prescribed by the Commissioner for this purpose. If the taxpayer uses such standard mortality dispersion table for any taxable year of election, it must be used for all subsequent taxable years of election unless the taxpayer obtains the consent of the Commissioner to change to another dispersion table or to actual identification of retirements. For information requirements regarding mass assets, see paragraph (f)(5) of this section.
(
2
) For purposes of this section, the term “mass assets” has the same meaning as when used in paragraph (e)(4) of § 1.47-1.
(
e
) The principles of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X has a vintage account of 1971 consisting of machines A, B, and C, each with an unadjusted basis of $1,000. The unadjusted basis of the account is $3,000 and at the end of 1977 the reserve for depreciation is $2,100. On January 1, 1978, machine A is transferred to corporation Y solely for stock in the amount of $1,400 in a transaction to which section 351 applies. Since the adjusted basis of machine A is $300, a gain of $1,100 is realized, but no gain is recognized under section 351. Even though machine A was transferred in an ordinary retirement in accordance with (
a
) of this subdivision the rules for an extraordinary retirement are applied. The proceeds are not added to the reserve for depreciation for the account. Machine A is removed from the account, the unadjusted basis of the account is reduced by $1,000, and the reserve for depreciation for the account is reduced by $700.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that the consideration received for machine A is stock of corporation Y in the amount of $1,200 and cash in the amount of $200. The result is the same as in example (1) except that gain is recognized in the amount of $200 all of which is gain to which section 1245 applies.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that machine A is sold for $1,400 cash in an ordinary retirement and corporation X and corporation Y are includible corporations in an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) which files a consolidated return for 1978. Accordingly, (
b
) of this subdivision applies. The retirement is treated as an extraordinary retirement. Machine A is removed from the account, the unadjusted basis of the account is reduced by $1,000, and the reserve for depreciation for the account is reduced by $700. The gain of $1,100 is deferred gain to which § 1.1502-13 applies.
(vi)
Treatment of special basis vintage accounts.
A “special basis vintage account” is a vintage account for an
amount of property improvement determined under subparagraph (2) (vii)(
a
) of this paragraph. In general, reference in this section to a “vintage account” shall include a special basis vintage account. The unadjusted basis of a special basis vintage account shall be recovered through the allowance for depreciation in accordance with this section over the asset depreciation period for the account. Except as provided in this subdivision, the unadjusted basis, adjusted basis and reserve for depreciation of such account shall not be allocated to any specific asset in the asset guideline class, and the provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to such account. However, in the event of a sale, exchange or other disposition of “repair allowance property” (as described in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph) in an extraordinary retirement as described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph (or if the asset is not in a vintage account, in an abnormal retirement as described in § 1.167(a)-8), the taxpayer may, if consistently applied to all such retirements in the taxable year and adequately identified in the taxpayer's books and records, elect to allocate the adjusted basis (as of the end of the taxable year) of all special basis vintage accounts for the asset guideline class to each such retired asset in the proportion that the adjusted basis of the retired asset (as of the beginning of the taxable year) bears to the adjusted basis of all repair allowance property in the asset guideline class at the beginning of the taxable year. The election to allocate basis in accordance with this subdivision shall be made on the tax return filed for the taxable year. The principles of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In addition to other property, the taxpayer has machines A, B, and C all in the same asset guideline class and each with an adjusted basis on January 1, 1977, of $10,000. The adjusted basis on January 1, 1977, of all repair allowance property (as described in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph) in the asset guideline class is $90,000. The machines are sold in an extraordinary retirement in 1977. The taxpayer is entitled to and does elect to allocate basis in accordance with this subdivision. There is also a 1972 special basis vintage account for the asset guideline class, as follows:
Unadjusted basis
Reserve for depreciation
Dec. 31, 1977, adjusted basis
1972 special basis vintage account, for which the taxpayer selected an asset depreciation period of 10 years, adopted the straight line method, and used the half-year convention
$2,000
$1,100
$900
By application of this subdivision, the adjusted basis of machines A, B, and C is increased to $10,100 each (that is, $10,000 ÷ $90,000 × $900 = $100). The unadjusted basis, reserve for depreciation and adjusted basis of the special basis vintage account are reduced, respectively, by one-third (that is, $300 ÷ $900=
1/3
) in order to reflect the allocation of basis from the special basis vintage account.
(vii)
Reduction in the salvage value of a vintage account.
(
a
) A taxpayer may apply this section without reducing the salvage value for a vintage account in accordance with this subdivision or in accordance with subdivision (viii) of this subparagraph (relating to transfers to supplies or scrap). See subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for reduction of salvage value in certain circumstances in the amount of proceeds from ordinary retirements.
(
b
) However, the taxpayer may, at his option, follow the consistent practice of reducing, as retirements occur, the salvage value for a vintage account by the amount of salvage value attributable to the retired asset, or the taxpayer may consistently follow the practice of so reducing the salvage value for a vintage account as extraordinary retirements occur while not reducing the salvage value for the account as ordinary retirements occur. If the taxpayer does not reduce the salvage value for a vintage account as ordinary retirements occur, the taxpayer may be entitled to a deduction in the taxable year in which the last asset is retired from the account in accordance with subdivision (ix) (
b
) of this subparagraph.
(
c
) For purposes of this subdivision, the portion of the salvage value for a
vintage account attributable to a retired asset may be determined by multiplying the salvage value for the account by a fraction, the numerator of which is the unadjusted basis of the retired asset and the denominator of which is the unadjusted basis of the account, or any other method consistently applied which reasonably reflects that portion of the salvage value for the account originally attributable to the retired asset.
(
d
) In the case of ordinary retirements the taxpayer may—
(
1
) In the case of retirements (other than by transfer to supplies or scrap) follow the consistent practice of reducing the salvage value for the account by the amount of salvage value attributable to the retired asset and not adding the same amount to the depreciation reserve for the account, and
(
2
) In the case of retirements by transfer to supplies or scrap, follow the consistent practice of reducing the salvage value for the account by the amount of salvage value attributable to the retired asset and not adding the same amount to the depreciation reserve for the account (in which case the basis in the supplies or scrap account of the retired asset will be zero) or follow the consistent practice of reducing the salvage value for the account by the amount of salvage value attributable to the retired asset and adding the same amount to the depreciation reserve for the account (up to an amount which does not increase the depreciation reserve to an amount in excess of the unadjusted basis of the account) in which case the basis in the supplies or scrap account of the retired asset will be the amount added to the depreciation reserve for the account.
Thus, for example, in the case of an ordinary retirement by transfer of an asset to supplies or scrap, the basis of the asset in the supplies or scrap account would either be zero or the amount added to the depreciation reserve of the vintage account from which the retirement occurred. When the depreciation reserve for the account equals the unadjusted basis of the account no further adjustment to salvage value for the account will be made. See subdivision (viii) of this subparagraph for special optional rule for reduction of salvage value in the case of an ordinary retirement by transfer of an asset to supplies or scrap.
(
e
) In the event of a removal of property from a vintage account in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(
e
), (5)(v)(
b
) or (6)(iii) of this section the salvage value for the account may be reduced by the amount of salvage value attributable to the asset removed determined as provided in (
c
) of this subdivision.
(viii)
Special optional adjustments for transfers to supplies or scrap.
If the taxpayer does not follow the consistent practice of reducing, as ordinary retirements occur, the salvage value for a vintage account in accordance with subdivision (vii) of this subparagraph, the taxpayer may (in lieu of the method described in subdivision (vii) (
c
) and (
d
) of this subparagraph) follow the consistent practice of reducing salvage value as ordinary retirements occur by transfer of assets to supplies or scrap and of determining the basis (in the supplies or scrap account) as assets retired in an ordinary retirement by transfer to supplies or scrap, in the following manner—
(
a
) The taxpayer may determine the value of the asset (not to exceed its unadjusted basis) by any reasonable method consistently applied (such as average cost, conditioned cost, or fair market value) if such method is adequately identified in the taxpayer's books and records.
(
b
) The value attributable to the asset determined in accordance with (
a
) of this subdivision shall be subtracted from the salvage value for the account (to the extent thereof) and the greater of (
1
) the amount subtracted from the salvage value for the vintage account and (
2
) the value of the asset determined in accordance with (
a
) of this subdivision, shall be added to the reserve for depreciation of this vintage account.
(
c
) The amount added to the reserve for depreciation of the vintage account in accordance with (
b
) of this subdivision shall be treated as the basis of the retired asset in the supplies or scrap account.
If the taxpayer makes the adjustments in accordance with this subdivision,
the reserve for depreciation of the vintage account may exceed the unadjusted basis of the account, and in that event gain will be recognized in accordance with subdivision (ix) of this subparagraph.
(ix)
Recognition of gain or loss in certain situations.
(
a
) In the case of a vintage account for section 1245 property, if at the end of any taxable year after adjustment for depreciation allowable for such taxable year and all other adjustments prescribed by this section, the depreciation reserve established for such account exceeds the unadjusted basis of the account, the entire amount of such excess shall be recognized as gain in such taxable year. Such gain—
(
1
) Shall constitute gain to which section 1245 applies to the extent that it does not exceed the total amount of depreciation allowances in the depreciation reserve at the end of such taxable year, reduced by gain recognized pursuant to this subdivision with respect to the account previously treated as gain to which section 1245 applies, and
(
2
) May constitute gain to which section 1231 applies to the extent that it exceeds such total amount as so reduced.
In such event, the depreciation reserve shall be reduced by the amount of gain recognized, so that after such reduction the amount of the depreciation reserve is equal to the unadjusted basis of the account.
(
b
) In the case of an account for section 1245 property, if at the time the last asset in the vintage account is retired the unadjusted basis of the account exceeds the depreciation reserve for the account (after all adjustments prescribed by this section), the entire amount of such excess shall be recognized in such taxable year as a loss under section 165 or as a deduction for depreciation under section 167. If the retirement of such asset occurs by sale or exchange on which gain or loss is recognized, the amount of such excess may constitute a loss subject to section 1231. Upon retirement of the last asset in a vintage account, the account shall terminate and no longer be an account to which this section applies. See subdivision (xi) of this subparagraph for treatment of certain multiple asset and item accounts.
(
c
) The principles of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The taxpayer has a vintage account for section 1245 property with an unadjusted basis of $1,000 and a depreciation reserve of $700 (of which $600 represents depreciation allowances and $100 represents the proceeds of ordinary retirements from the account). If $500 is realized during the taxable year from ordinary retirements of assets from the account, the reserve is increased to $1,200, gain is recognized to the extent of $200 (the amount by which the depreciation reserve before further adjustment exceeds $1,000) and the depreciation reserve is then decreased to $1,000. The $200 of gain constitutes gain to which section 1245 applies. If the amount realized from ordinary retirements during the year had been $1,100 instead of $500, the gain of $800 would have consisted of $600 of gain to which section 1245 applies and $200 of gain to which section 1231 may apply.
(x)
Dismantling cost.
The cost of dismantling, demolishing, or removing an asset in the process of a retirement from the vintage account shall be treated as an expense deductible in the year paid or incurred, and such cost shall not be subtracted from the depreciation reserve for the account.
(xi)
Special rule for treatment of multiple asset and item accounts.
For the purposes of subdivision (ix)(
b
) of this subparagraph, all accounts (other than a special basis vintage account as described in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph) of the same vintage in the same asset guideline class for which the taxpayer has selected the same asset depreciation period and adopted the same method of depreciation, and which contain only section 1245 property permitted by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section to be included in the same vintage account, shall be treated as a single multiple asset vintage account.
(4)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(
a
)Taxpayer A has a multiple asset vintage account for selection 1245 property with an unadjusted basis of $1,000. All the assets were first placed in service by A on January 15, 1971. This account contains all of A's assets in a single asset guideline class. A elects to apply this section for 1971
and adopts the modified half-year convention. A estimates a salvage value for the account of $100 and this estimate is determined to be reasonable. (See subparagraph (1)(v) of this paragraph for limitation on adjustment of reasonable salvage value.) A adopts the straight line method of depreciation with respect to the account and selects a 10-year asset depreciation period. A does not follow a practice of reducing the salvage value for the account in the amount of salvage value attributable to each retired asset in accordance with subparagraph (3)(vii) of this paragraph. The depreciation allowance for each of the first 4 years is $100, that is
1/10
multiplied by the unadjusted basis of $1,000, with reduction for salvage.
(
b
) In the fifth year of the asset depreciation period, three assets are sold in an ordinary retirement for $300. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph, the proceeds of the retirement are added to the depreciation reserve as of the beginning of the fifth year. Accordingly, the reserve as of the beginning of the fifth year is $700, that is, $400 of depreciation as of the beginning of the year plus $300 proceeds from ordinary retirements. The depreciation allowance for the fifth year is $100, that is
1/10
multiplied by the unadjusted basis of $1,000, without reduction for salvage. Accordingly, the depreciation reserve at the end of the fifth year is $800.
(
c
) In the sixth year, asset X is sold in an extraordinary retirement for $30 and gain or loss is recognized. Under the first-year convention used by the taxpayer, the unadjusted basis of X, $300, is removed from the unadjusted basis of the vintage account as of the beginning of the sixth year and the depreciation reserve as of the beginning of such year is reduced to $650 by removing the depreciation applicable to asset X, $150 (see subparagraph (3)(iv) of this paragraph). Since the depreciation reserve ($650) exceeds the unadjusted basis of the account ($700) minus salvage value ($100) by $50, under subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph, salvage value is reduced by $50. No depreciation is allowable for the sixth year.
(
d
) In the seventh year, an asset is sold in an ordinary retirement for $110. This would increase the reserve as of the beginning of the seventh year to $760 and under subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph the salvage value is reduced to zero. Under subparagraph (3)(ix)(
a
) of this paragraph the depreciation reserve is then decreased to $700 (the unadjusted basis of the account) and $60 is reported as gain, without regard to the adjusted basis of the asset. No depreciation is allowable for the seventh year since the depreciation reserve ($700) equals the unadjusted basis of the account ($700).
(
e
)(
1
) In the eighth year, A elects to apply this section and to treat expenditures during the year for repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement under subparagraph (2)(iii) and (iv)(
a
) of this paragraph (the “guideline class repair allowance”). This results in the treatment of $300 as a property improvement for the asset guideline class. (See subparagraph (2)(vii) of this paragraph for definition of a property improvement.) The property improvement is capitalized in a special basis vintage account of the eighth taxable year (see subparagraph (2)(viii)(
a
) of this paragraph). A selects an asset depreciation period of 10 years and adopts the straight line method for the special basis vintage account. A adopts the modified half-year convention for the eighth year.
(
2
) In the eighth year, A sells asset Y in an ordinary retirement for $175. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph, $175 is added to the depreciation reserve for the account as of the beginning of the taxable year. Since the depreciation reserve for the account ($875) exceeds the unadjusted basis of the account ($700) by $175, that amount of gain is recognized under subparagraph (3)(ix) of this paragraph. Upon recognition of gain in the amount of $175, the depreciation reserve for the account is reduced to $700.
(
3
) No depreciation is allowable in the eighth year for the vintage account since the depreciation reserve ($700) equals the unadjusted basis of the account ($700). The depreciation allowable in the eighth year for the special basis vintage account is $15, that is, unadjusted basis of $300, multiplied by
1/10
, the asset depreciation period selected for the special basis vintage account, but limited to $15 under the modified half-year convention. (See paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section for treatment of $150 of the property improvement as first placed in service in the first half of the taxable year and $150 of the property improvement as first placed in service in the last half of the taxable year.)

# Example 2.
Taxpayer B has a 1971 multiple asset vintage account for section 1245 property with an unadjusted basis of $100,000. B selects from the asset depreciation range an asset depreciation period of 10 years and adopts the straight line method of depreciation and the modified half-year convention. B establishes a salvage value for the account of $10,000. All the assets in the account are first placed in service on January 15, 1971. B follows the practice of reducing salvage value for the account as ordinary retirements occur in accordance with subparagraph (3)(vii) of this paragraph, but does not follow the optional practice of determining the basis of assets transferred to supplies or scrap in accordance with subparagraph (3)(vii) of this paragraph. No retirements occur during the first five years. The depreciation reserve at the beginning of the sixth year is $50,000. In the sixth year an asset with an unadjusted basis of $20,000 is transferred to supplies in an ordinary retirement.
By application of subparagraph (3)(vii) (
c
) and (
d
)(
2
) of this paragraph B determines the reduction in salvage value for the account attributable to such asset to be $2,000 (that is, $20,000 ÷ $100,000 × $10,000 = $2,000).
B reduces the salvage value for the account by $2,000 and adds 2,000 to the depreciation reserve for the account. The basis of the retired asset in the supplies account is $2,000. The depreciation allowable for the account for the sixth year is $10,000. The depreciation reserve for the account at the beginning of the seventh year is $62,000. At the mid-point of the seventh year all the remaining assets in the account are sold in an ordinary retirement for $20,000, which is added to the depreciation reserve as of the beginning of the seventh year, thus increasing the reserve to $82,000. The $5,000 depreciation allowable for the account for the seventh year (one-half of a full-year's depreciation of $10,000) increases the depreciation reserve to $87,000. Under subparagraph (3)(ix)(
b
) of this paragraph, a loss of $13,000 subject to section 1231 is realized in the seventh year (that is, the excess of the unadjusted basis of $100,000 over the depreciation reserve of $87,000). No depreciation is allowable for the account after the mid-point of the seventh year since all the assets are retired and the account has terminated.

Accounting for eligible property
—(1)
Definition of first placed in service
—(i)
In general.
The term “first placed in service” refers to the time the property is first placed in service by the taxpayer, not to the first time the property is placed in service. Property is first placed in service when first placed in a condition or state of readiness and availability for a specifically assigned function, whether in a trade or business, in the production of income, in a tax-exempt activity, or in a personal activity. In general, the provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) of § 1.46-3 shall apply for the purpose of determining the date on which property is placed in service, but see subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph for special rule for certain replacement parts. In the case of a building which is intended to house machinery and equipment and which is constructed, reconstructed, or erected by or for the taxpayer and for the taxpayer's use, the building will ordinarily be placed in service on the date such construction, reconstruction, or erection is substantially complete and the building is in a condition or state of readiness and availability. Thus, for example, in the case of a factory building, such readiness and availability shall be determined without regard to whether the machinery or equipment which the building houses, or is intended to house, has been placed in service. However, in an appropriate case, as for example where the building is essentially an item of machinery or equipment, or the use of the building is so closely related to the use of the machinery or equipment that it clearly can be expected to be replaced or retired when the property it initially houses is replaced or retired, the determination of readiness or availability of the building shall be made by taking into account the readiness and availability of such machinery or equipment. The date on which depreciation begins under a convention used by the taxpayer or under a particular method of depreciation, such as the unit of production method or the retirement method, shall not determine the date on which the property is first placed in service. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section for application of a first-year convention to determine the allowance for depreciation of property in a vintage account.
(ii)
Certain replacement parts.
Property (such as replacement parts) the cost or other basis of which is deducted as a repair expense in accordance with the asset guideline repair allowance described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section shall not be treated as placed in service.
(iii)
Property improvements and excluded additions.
(
a
) Except as provided in (
b
) of this subdivision, a property improvement determined under paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(
b
) of this section, and an excluded addition (other than an excluded addition referred to in the succeeding sentence) is first placed in service when its cost is paid or incurred. The general rule in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph applies to an excluded addition described in paragraph (d) (2)(vi) (
d
), (
e
), (
f
), or (
g
) of this section.
(
b
) If a property improvement or an excluded addition to which the first sentence of (
a
) of this subdivision applies is paid or incurred in part in one taxable year and in part in the succeeding taxable year (or in part in the first half of a taxable year and in part
in the last half of the taxable year) the taxpayer may at his option consistently treat such property improvements and excluded additions under the general rule in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(iv)
Certain property improvements.
In the case of an amount of property improvement determined under paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(
a
) of this section, one-half of such amount is first placed in service in the first half of the taxable year in which the cost is paid or incurred and one-half is first placed in service in the last half of such taxable year.
(v)
Special rules for clearing accounts.
In the case of public utilities which consistently account for certain property through “clearing accounts,” the date on which such property is first placed in service shall be determined in accordance with rules to be prescribed by the Commissioner.
(2)
Special rules for transferred property.
If eligible property is first placed in service by the taxpayer during a taxable year of election, and the property is disposed of before the end of the taxable year, the election for such taxable year shall include such property unless such property is excluded in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) (iii), (iv, (v), (vi), or (vii) of this section.
(3)
Special rules in the case of certain transfers
—(i)
Transaction to which section 381(a) applies.
(
a
) In general the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies is for the purposes of this section treated as if it were the distributor or transferor corporation.
(
b
) If the distributor or transferor corporation (including any distributor or transferor corporation of any distributor or transferor corporation) has made an election to apply this section to eligible property transferred in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation must segregate such eligible property (to which the distributor or transferor corporation elected to apply this section) into vintage accounts as nearly coextensive as possible with the vintage accounts created by the distributor or transferor corporation identified by reference to the year the property was first placed in service by the distributor or transferor corporation. The asset depreciation period for the vintage account in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation must be used by the acquiring corporation. The method of depreciation adopted by the distributor or transferor corporation, shall be used by the acquiring corporation unless such corporation obtains the consent of the Commissioner to use another method of depreciation in accordance with paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1 or changes the method of depreciation under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
(
c
) The acquiring corporation may apply this section to the property so acquired only if the distributor or transferor corporation elected to apply this section to such property.
(
d
) See paragraph (b)(7) of this section for special rule for certain property where there is a mere change in the form of conducting a trade or business.
(ii)
Partnerships, trusts, estates, donees, and corporations.
Except as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph with respect to transactions to which section 381(a) applies and subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph with respect to certain transfers between members of an affiliated group of corporations or other related parties, if eligible property is placed in service by an individual, trust, estate, partnership or corporation, the election to apply this section shall be made by the individual, trust, estate, partnership or corporation placing such property in service. For example, if a partnership places in service property contributed to the partnership by a partner, the partnership may elect to apply this section to such property. If the partnership does not make the election, this section will not apply to such property. See paragraph (b)(7) of this section for special rule for certain property where there is mere change in the form of conducting a trade or business.
(iii)
Leased property.
The asset depreciation range and the asset depreciation period for eligible property subject to a lease shall be determined without regard to the period for which such property is leased, including any extensions or renewals of such period. See paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section for
exclusion of property amortized under paragraph (b) of § 1.162-11 from an election to apply this section. In the case of a lessor of property, unless there is an asset guideline class in effect for lessors of such property, the asset guideline class for such property shall be determined as if the property were owned by the lessee. However, in the case of an asset guideline class based upon the type of property (such as trucks or railroad cars) as distinguished from the activity in which used, the property shall be classified without regard to the activity of the lessee. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a lease with respect to property, which would be includible in an asset guideline class based upon the type of property under the preceding sentence (such as trucks or railroad cars), is entered into after March 12, 1971, and before April 23, 1973, or a written contract to execute such a lease is entered into during such period and such contract is binding on April 23, 1973, and at all times thereafter, and if the rent or rate of return is based on a classification of such property as if it were owned by the lessee, then such property shall be classified as if it were owned by the lessee. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply if pursuant to the terms or conditions of the lease or binding contract the rent or rate of return may be adjusted to take account of a change in the period for depreciation with respect to the property resulting from inclusion of the property in an asset guideline class based upon the type of property rather than in an asset guideline class based upon the activity of the lessee. Similarly, where the terms of such a lease or contract provide that the obligation of the taxpayer to enter into the lease is subject to a condition that the property be included in an asset guideline class based upon the activity of the lessee, the contract or lease will not be considered as binding upon the taxpayer, for purposes of this subdivision. See paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(
b
) of this section for general rule for classification of property according to primary use.
(iv)
Treatment of certain transfers between members of affiliated groups or other related persons.
If section 38 property in an asset guideline class (determined without regard to whether the taxpayer elects to apply this section) is transferred by the taxpayer to a person who bears a relationship described in section 179(d)(2) (A) or (B), such property is in the same asset guideline class in the hands of transferee, and the transfer is neither described in section 381(a) nor treated as a disposition or cessation within the meaning of section 47, then the asset guideline period for such property selected by the taxpayer under this section shall not be shorter than the period used for computing the qualified investment with respect to the property under section 46(c). In a case in which the asset depreciation range for the asset guideline class which includes such property does not include the period for depreciation used by the transferor in computing the qualified investment with respect to such property, the transferee will not be permitted to include such property in an election under this section. However, in such a case, the transferor of the property may recompute the qualified investment for the year the property was placed in service using a period for depreciation which falls within the asset depreciation range.
(f)
Election with respect to eligible property
—(1)
Time and manner of election
—(i)
In general.
An election to apply this section to eligible property shall be made with the income tax return filed for the taxable year in which the property is first placed in service (see paragraph (e)(1) of this section) by the taxpayer. In the case of an affiliated group of corporations (as defined in section 1504(a)) which makes a consolidated return with respect to income tax in accordance with section 1502 and the regulations thereunder, each corporation which joins in the making of such return may elect to apply this section for a taxable year. An election to compute the allowance for depreciation under this section is a method of accounting but the consent of the Commissioner will be deemed granted to make an annual election. For election by a partnership see section 703 (b) and paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. If the taxpayer does not file a timely return (taking into account extensions of the time for filing) for the taxable year in which the property is first placed in
service, the election shall be filed at the time the taxpayer files his first return for that year. The election may be made with an amended return filed within the time prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the original return for the taxable year of election. If an election is not made within the time and in the manner prescribed in this paragraph, no election may be made for such taxable year (by the filing of an amended return or in any other manner) with respect to any eligible property placed in service in the taxable year.
(ii)
Other elections under this section.
All other elections under this section may be made only within the time and in the manner prescribed by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph with respect to an election to apply this section.
(iii)
Effective date.
See paragraph (f)(6) of this section for the effective date of this paragraph.
(2)
Information required.
A taxpayer who elects to apply this section must specify in the election:
(i) That the taxpayer makes such election and consents to and agrees to apply, all the provisions of this section;
(ii) The asset guideline class for each vintage account of the taxable year;
(iii) The first-year convention adopted by the taxpayer for the taxable year of election;
(iv) Whether the special 10 percent used property rule described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section has been applied to exclude used property from the election;
(v) Whether the taxpayer elects to apply the asset guideline class repair allowance described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section;
(vi) Whether the taxpayer elects for the taxable year to allocate the adjusted basis of a special basis vintage account in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section;
(vii) Whether any eligible property for which the taxpayer was not required or permitted to make an election was excluded because of the special rules of paragraph (b)(5)(v) or (6), or paragraph (e)(3)(i) or (iv) of this section;
(viii) Whether any “section 38 property” was excluded under paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section from the election to apply this section;
(ix) If the taxpayer is an electric or gas utility, whether the taxpayer elects to apply this section on the basis of a composite asset guideline class in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(
a
) of this section; and
(x) Such other information as may reasonably be required.
The information required under this subparagraph may be provided in accordance with rules prescribed by the Commissioner for reasonable grouping of assets or accounts. Form 4832 is provided for making an election and for submission of the information required. An election may be made and the information submitted only in accordance with Form 4832. An election to apply this section will not be rendered invalid under this subparagraph so long as there is substantial compliance, in good faith, with the requirements of this subparagraph.
(3)
Irrevocable election.
An election to apply this section to eligible property for any taxable year may not be revoked or changed after the time for filing the election prescribed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph has expired. No other election under this section may be revoked or changed after such time unless expressly provided for under this section. (See paragraph (b)(5)(v)(
b
) of this section for special rule.)
(4)
Special conditions to election to apply this section
—(i)
Maintenance of books and records.
The taxpayer may not elect to apply this section for a taxable year unless the taxpayer maintains the books and records required under this section. In addition to any other information required under this section, the taxpayer's books and records must specify—
(
a
) The asset depreciation period selected by the taxpayer for each vintage account;
(
b
) If the taxpayer applies the modified half-year convention, the total cost or other basis of all eligible property first placed in service in the first half of the taxable year and the total cost or other basis of all eligible property first placed in service in the last half of the taxable year;
(
c
) The unadjusted basis and salvage value for each vintage account, and the amount, if any, by which gross salvage value was decreased under section 167 (f);
(
d
) Each asset guideline class for which the taxpayer elects to apply the asset guideline class repair allowance described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section;
(
e
) The amount of property improvement, determined under paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(
a
) of this section, for each asset guideline class for which the taxpayer elects to apply the asset guideline class repair allowance;
(
f
) A reasonable description of property excluded from an election to apply this section and the basis for the exclusion;
(
g
) The total unadjusted basis of all assets retired during the taxable year from each asset guideline class, and the proceeds realized during the taxable year from such retirements; and
(
h
) The vintage (that is, the taxable year in which established) of the assets retired during the year from each asset guideline class.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(i) (
g
) and (
h
) of this section, all accounts of the same vintage and asset guideline class may be treated as a single account. The taxpayer must specify the information required under paragraph (f)(4)(i) (
g
) and (
h
) without regard to the retirement of an asset by transfer to a supplies account for reuse.
(ii)
Response to survey.
Taxpayers who elect to apply this section must respond to infrequent data surveys conducted by the Treasury Department. These periodic surveys, which will be conducted on the basis of scientifically sound sampling methods, are designed to obtain data (including industry asset acquisitions and retirements) used to keep the asset guideline classes and periods up to date.
(iii)
Effect of noncompliance.
An election to apply this section will not be rendered invalid under this subparagraph so long as there is substantial compliance, in good faith, with the requirements of this subparagraph.
(5)
Mass assets.
In the case of mass assets, if the taxpayer assigns retirements to vintage accounts in the manner provided in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(
c
) of this section, the following information must be supplied with form 4832:
(i) Whether the taxpayer used the standard mortality dispersion curve or a curve based upon his own experience, and
(ii) Such other reasonable information as may be required by the Commissioner.
(6)
Effective date.
The rules in this paragraph apply to elections for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1978. In the case of an election for a taxable year ending before December 31, 1978, the rules in paragraph (f) of this section, in effect before the amendments made by T.D. 7593 approved January 11, 1979, shall apply. See 26 CFR § 1.167(a)-11(f) (1977) for paragraph (f) of this section as it appeared before the amendments made by T.D. 7593.
(g)
Relationship to other provisions
—(1)
Useful life
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, an election to apply this section to eligible property constitutes an agreement under section 167(d) and this section to treat the asset depreciation period for each vintage account as the useful life of the property in such account for all purposes of the Code, including sections 46, 47, 48, 57, 163(d), 167(c), 167(f)(2), 179, 312(m), 514(a), and 4940(c). For example, since section 167(c) requires a useful life of at least 3 years and the asset depreciation period selected is treated as the useful life for purposes of section 167(c), the taxpayer may adopt a method of depreciation described in section 167(b) (2) or (3) for an account only if the asset depreciation period selected for the account is at least 3 years.
(ii)
Special rules.
(
a
) For the purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, the anticipated period of use (estimated at the close of the taxable year in which the asset is first placed in service) on the basis of which salvage value is estimated, shall be determined without regard to the asset depreciation period for the property.
(
b
) For the purposes of sections 162 and 263 and the regulations thereunder, whether an expenditure prolongs the life of an asset shall be determined on the basis of the anticipated period of use of the asset (estimated at the close
of the taxable year in which the asset is first placed in service) without regard to the asset depreciation period for such asset.
(
c
) The determination whether a transaction with respect to qualified property constitutes a sale or a lease of such property shall be made without regard to the asset depreciation period for the property.
(
d
) The principles of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Corporation X has assets in asset guideline class 32.3 which are used in the manufacture of stone and clay products. The asset depreciation range for assets in asset guideline class 32.3 is from 12 to 18 years. Assume that corporation X selects 14 years as the asset depreciation period for all assets in asset guideline class 32.3. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, corporation X must estimate salvage value on the basis of the anticipated period of use of the property (determined as of the close of the taxable year in which the property is first placed in service). The anticipated period of use must also be used for purposes of sections 162 and 263 in determining whether an expenditure materially prolongs the useful life of an asset. The anticipated period of use of an asset is determined without regard to the asset depreciation period of 14 years. Corporation X has, among other assets in the asset guideline class, machines A, B, and C. Corporation X estimates the anticipated period of use of machines A, B, and C as 8 years, 14 years, and 22 years, respectively. These estimates are reasonable and will be used for estimating salvage value and for purposes of sections 162 and 263.
(2)
Section 167(d) agreements.
If the taxpayer has, prior to January 1, 1971, entered into a section 167(d) agreement which applies to any eligible property, the taxpayer will be permitted to withdraw the eligible property from the agreement provided that an election is made to apply this section to such property. The statement of intent to withdraw eligible property from such an agreement must be made in an election filed for the taxable year in which the property is first placed in service. The withdrawal, in accordance with this subparagraph, of any eligible property from a section 167(d) agreement shall not affect any other property covered by such an agreement.
(3)
Relationship to the straight line method
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining the amount of depreciation which would be allowable under the straight line method of depreciation, such amount shall be computed with respect to any property in a vintage account using the straight line method in the manner described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and a rate based upon the period for the vintage account selected from the asset depreciation range. Thus, for example, section 57(a)(3) requires a taxpayer to compute an amount using the straight line method of depreciation if the taxpayer uses an accelerated method of depreciation. For purposes of section 57(a)(3), the amount for property in a vintage account shall be computed using the asset depreciation period for the vintage account selected from the asset depreciation range. In the case of property to which the taxpayer does not elect to apply this section, such amount computed by using the straight line method shall be determined under § 1.167(b)-1 without regard to this section.
(ii)
Examples.
The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(
a
) Corporation X places a new asset in service to which it elects to apply this section. The cost of the asset is $200,000 and the estimated salvage value is zero. The taxpayer selects 9 years from the applicable asset depreciation range of 8 to 12 years. Corporation X adopts the double declining balance method of depreciation and thus the rate of depreciation is 22.2 percent (twice the applicable straight line rate). The depreciation allowance in the first year would be $44,400, that is, 22.2 percent of $200,000.
(
b
) Assume that the provisions of section 57(a)(3) apply to the property. The amount of the tax preference would be $22,200, that is, the excess of the depreciation allowed under this section ($44,400) over the depreciation which would have been allowable if the taxpayer had used the period selected from the asset depreciation range and the straight line rate ($22,200).

§ 1.167(a)-12
Depreciation based on class lives for property first placed in service before January 1, 1971.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Summary.
This section provides an elective class life system for determining the reasonable allowance for depreciation of certain classes of assets for taxable years ending after December 31, 1970. The system applies only to assets placed in service before January 1, 1971. Depreciation for such assets during periods prior to January 1, 1971, may have been determined in accordance with Revenue Procedure 62-21. Accordingly, rules are provided which permit taxpayers to apply the system in taxable years ending after December 31, 1970, to such assets without the necessity of changing or regrouping their depreciation accounts other than as previously required by Revenue Procedure 62-21. The system is designed to minimize disputes between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service as to the useful life of assets, salvage value, and repairs. See § 1.167(a)-11 for a similar system for property placed in service after December 31, 1970. See paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.167(a)-11 for treatment of expenditures for the repair, maintenance, rehabilitation or improvement of certain property. The system provided by this section is optional with the taxpayer. An election under this section applies only to qualified property in an asset guideline class for which an election is made and only for the taxable year of election. The taxpayer's election is made with the income tax return for the taxable year. This section also revokes the reserve ratio test for taxable years ending after December 31, 1970, and provides transitional rules for taxpayers who after January 11, 1971, adopt Revenue Procedure 62-21 for a taxable year ending prior to January 1, 1971.
(2)
Revocation of reserve ratio test and other matters.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section and in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of § 1.167(a)-11, the provisions of Revenue Procedure 62-21 shall not apply to any property for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1970, whether or not the taxpayer elects to apply this section to any property. See paragraph (f) of this section for rules for the adoption of Revenue Procedure 62-21 for taxable years ending prior to January 1, 1971.
(3)
Definition of qualified property.
The term “qualified property” means tangible property which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided by section 167(a), but only if—
(i) An asset guideline class and asset guideline period are in effect for such property for the taxable year, and
(ii) The property is first placed in service by the taxpayer before January 1, 1971,
(iii) The property is placed in service before January 1, 1971, but first placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1970, and is not includible in an election under § 1.167(a)-11 by reason of § 1.167(a)-11(b)(7) (property acquired as a result of a mere change in form) or § 1.167(a)-11(e)(3)(i) (certain property acquired in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies), or
(iv) The property is acquired and first placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1970, pursuant to a binding written contract entered into prior to January 1, 1971, and is excluded in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of § 1.167(a)-11 from an election to apply § 1.167(a)-11.
The provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of § 1.167(a)-11 apply in determining whether property is first placed in service before January 1, 1971. See subparagraph (4)(ii) of this paragraph for special rules for the exclusion of property from the definition of qualified property.
(4)
Requirements of election
—(i)
In general.
An election to apply this section to qualified property must be made within the time and in the manner specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The election must specify that the taxpayer consents to and agrees to apply all the provisions of this section. The election may be made separately for each asset guideline class. Thus, a taxpayer may for the taxable year elect to apply this section to one, more than one, or all asset guideline classes in which he has qualified property. An election to apply this section for a taxable year must include all qualified property in the asset guideline class for which the election is made.
(ii)
Special rules for exclusion of property from application of this section.
(
a
) If
for the taxable year of election, the taxpayer computes depreciation under section 167(k) or computes amortization under sections 169, 185, 187, 188, or paragraph (b) of § 1.162-11 with respect to property, such property is not qualified property for such taxable year. If for the taxable year of election, the taxpayer computes depreciation under any method of depreciation (other than a method described in the preceding sentence) not permitted by subparagraph (5)(v) of this paragraph for any property in an asset guideline class (other than subsidiary assets excluded from an election under (
b
) of this subdivision), no property in such asset guideline class is qualified property for such taxable year.
(
b
) The taxpayer may exclude from an election to apply this section all (but not less than all) subsidiary assets. Subsidiary assets so excluded are not qualified property for such taxable year. For purposes of this subdivision the term “subsidiary assets” includes jigs, dies, molds, returnable containers, glassware, silverware, textile mill cam assemblies, and other equipment includable in Group One, Class 5, of Revenue Procedure 62-21 which is usually and properly accounted for separately from other property and under a method of depreciation not expressed in terms of years.
(iii)
Special rule for certain public utility property.
(
a
) In the case of public utility property described in section 167(1)(3)(A)(iii) for which no guideline life was prescribed in Revenue Procedure 62-21 (or for which reference was made in Revenue Procedure 62-21 to lives or rates established by governmental regulatory agencies) of a taxpayer which—
(
1
) Is entitled to use a method of depreciation other than a “subsection (1) method” of depreciation (as defined in section 167(1)(3)(F)) only if it uses the “normalization method of accounting” (as defined in section 167(1)(3)(G)) with respect to such property, or
(
2
) Is entitled for the taxable year to use only a “subsection (1) method” of depreciation, such property shall be qualified property (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) only if the taxpayer normalizes the tax deferral resulting from the election to apply this section.
(
b
) The taxpayer will be considered to normalize the tax deferral resulting from the election to apply this section only if it computes its tax expense for purposes of establishing its cost of service for ratemaking purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account using a period for depreciation no less than the period used for computing its depreciation expense for ratemaking purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account for the taxable year, and the taxpayer makes adjustments to a reserve to reflect the deferral of taxes resulting from the use of a period for depreciation under section 167 in accordance with an election to apply this section different from the period used for computing its depreciation expense for ratemaking purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account for the taxable year. A determination whether the taxpayer is considered to normalize under this subdivision the tax deferral resulting from the election to apply this section shall be made in a manner consistent with the principles for determining whether a taxpayer is using the “normalization method of accounting” (within the meaning of section 167(1)(3)(G)). See § 1.167(l)-1(h).
(
c
) If a taxpayer, which has elected to apply this section to any qualified public utility property and is required under (
a
) of this subdivision to normalize the tax deferral resulting from the election to apply this section to such property, fails to normalize such tax deferral, the election to apply this section to such property shall terminate as of the beginning of the taxable year for which the taxpayer fails to normalize such tax deferral. Application of this section to such property for any period prior to the termination date will not be affected by this termination.
(5)
Determination of reasonable allowance for depreciation
—(i)
In general.
The allowance for depreciation of qualified property to which the taxpayer elects to apply this section shall be determined in accordance with this section. The annual allowance for depreciation is determined by using the method of
depreciation adopted by the taxpayer and a rate based upon a life permitted by this section. In the case of the straight-line method of depreciation, the rate of depreciation shall be based upon the class life (or individual life if the taxpayer assigns individual depreciable lives in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) used by the taxpayer with respect to the assets in the asset guideline class. Such rate will be applied to the unadjusted basis of the asset guideline class (individual assets or depreciation accounts if the taxpayer assigns individual depreciable lives). In the case of the sum of the years-digits method of depreciation, the rate of depreciation will be determined based upon the remaining life of the class (or individual remaining lives if the taxpayer assigns such lives in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) and is applied to the adjusted basis of the class (or individual accounts or assets) as of the beginning of the taxable year of election. The remaining life of a depreciation account is determined by dividing the unrecovered cost or other basis of the account, as computed by straight-line depreciation, by the gross cost or unadjusted basis of the account, and multiplying the result by the class life used with respect to the account. In the case of the declining balance method of depreciation, the rate of depreciation for the asset guideline class shall be based upon the class life (or individual life if the taxpayer assigns such lives in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph). Such rate is applied to the adjusted basis of the class (or individual accounts or assets) as of the beginning of the taxable year of election.
(ii)
Reasonable allowance by reference to class lives.
The amount of depreciation for all qualified property in an asset guideline class to which the taxpayer elects to apply this section will constitute the reasonable allowance provided by section 167(a) and the depreciation for the asset guideline class will not be adjusted if—
(
a
) The taxpayer's qualified property is accounted for in one or more depreciation accounts which conform to the asset guideline class, and the depreciation for each such account is determined by using a rate based upon a life not less than the class life, or
(
b
) The taxpayer's qualified property is accounted for in one or more depreciation accounts (whether or not conforming to the asset guideline class) for which depreciation is determined at a rate based upon the taxpayer's estimate of the lives of the assets (instead of the class life) and the total amount of depreciation so determined for the asset guideline class for the taxable year of election is not more than would be permitted under (
a
) of this subdivision for such year using the method of depreciation adopted by the taxpayer for the property.
See subdivision (vii) of this subparagraph for determination of reasonable allowance if depreciation exceeds the amount permitted by this subdivision. See paragraph (b) of this section for rules regarding the determination of “class life”. For rules for regrouping depreciation accounts to conform to the asset guideline class, see subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph.
(iii)
Consistency when individual lives are used.
If the taxpayer assigns individual depreciable lives to assets in accordance with subdivision (ii)(
b
) of this subparagraph, even though the total amount of depreciation for the asset guideline class will not be adjusted, the lives assigned to the various assets in the asset guideline class must be reasonably in proportion to their relative expected periods of use in the taxpayer's business. Thus, although the taxpayer who uses individual asset lives normally has latitude in thereby allocating the depreciation for the asset guideline class among the assets, if the lives are grossly disproportionate (as where a short life is assigned to one asset and a long life to another even though the expected periods of use are the same), the taxpayer's allocation of depreciation to particular assets or depreciation accounts may be adjusted. For example, the taxpayer's allocation may be adjusted for purposes of determining adjusted basis under section 1016(a) or in allocating depreciation to the 50-percent limitation on percentage depletion provided by section 613(a). See paragraph (d) of this section for rules regarding the use of individual
asset lives for purposes of classifying retirements as normal or abnormal.
(iv)
Regrouping depreciation accounts.
Without the consent of the Commissioner, the taxpayer may for any taxable year for which he elects to apply this section to an asset guideline class, regroup his accounts for that and all succeeding taxable years to conform to the asset guideline class. Other changes in accounting, including a change from item accounts to multiple-asset accounting, may be made with the consent of the Commissioner. No depreciation accounts for which the straight line or sum of the years-digits method of depreciation is adopted may be combined under this section which would not be permitted to be combined under part III of Revenue Procedure 65-13, as in effect on January 1, 1971. Accordingly, whether or not the taxpayer adopted the guideline system of Revenue Procedure 62-21 for a taxable year to which part III of Revenue Procedure 65-13 is applicable, the depreciation allowance for any taxable year of election under this section may not exceed that amount which would have been allowed for such year if the taxpayer had used item accounts or year of acquisition accounts. Thus, for example, if a calendar year taxpayer acquired a $90 asset on the first day of each year from 1966 through 1970, placed such assets in a single multiple asset account, adopted the sum of the years-digits method of depreciation and used a 5-year depreciable life for such assets, and in 1971 uses the 5-year class life determined under paragraph (b) of this section, the depreciation allowance for such assets in 1971 under this section may not exceed $60, that is, the amount which would be allowed if the taxpayer had used year of acquisition accounts for the assets for the years 1966 through 1970.
For purposes of this subparagraph, a taxpayer's depreciation accounts conform to the asset guideline class if each depreciation account includes only assets of the same asset guideline class.
(v)
Method of depreciation.
The same method of depreciation must be applied to all property in a single depreciation account. The method of depreciation is subject to the limitations of section 167 (c), (j), and (l). Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the taxpayer must apply a method of depreciation described in section 167(b) (1), (2), or (3) for qualified property to which the taxpayer elects to apply this section. A method of depreciation permitted under section 167(b)(4) may be used under this section if the method was used by the taxpayer with respect to the property for his last taxable year ending before January 1, 1971, the method is expressed in terms of years, the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the method is both a reasonable and consistent method, and if the taxpayer applies paragraph (b)(2) of this section (relating to class lives in special situations) to determine a class life, that the method of determining such class life is consistent with the principles of Revenue Procedure 62-21 as applied to such a method. If the taxpayer has applied a method of depreciation with respect to the property which is not described in section 167(b) (1), (2), (3), or (4) (as permitted under the preceding sentence), he must change under this section to a method of depreciation described in section 167(b) (1), (2), or (3) for the first taxable year for which an election is made under this section. Other changes in depreciation method may be made with the consent of the Commissioner (see sec. 446 and the regulations thereunder). (See also sec. 167(e).)
(vi)
Salvage value.
In applying the method of depreciation adopted by the taxpayer, the annual allowance for depreciation is determined without adjustment for the salvage value of the property, except that no depreciation account may be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value for the account. See paragraph (c) of this section for definition and treatment of salvage value.
(vii)
Reasonable allowance when depreciation exceeds amount based on class life.
In the event that the total amount of depreciation claimed by the taxpayer on his income tax return, in a claim for refund, or otherwise, for an asset guideline class with respect to which an election is made under this section for the taxable year, exceeds the maximum amount permitted under subdivision (ii)(
a
) of this subparagraph—
(
a
) If the excess is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to be the result of a good faith mistake by the taxpayer in determining the maximum amount permitted under subdivision (ii) (
a
) of this subparagraph, the taxpayer's election to apply this section will be treated as valid and only such excess will be disallowed, and
(
b
) In all other cases, the taxpayer's election to apply this section to the asset guideline class for the taxable year is invalid and the reasonable allowance for depreciation will be determined without regard to this section. (See § 1.167(a)-1 (b) for rules regarding the estimated useful life of property.)
(b)
Determination of class lives
—(1)
Class lives in general.
The class life determined under this paragraph (without regard to any range or variance permitted with respect to class lives under § 1.167(a)-11) will be applied for purposes of determining whether the allowance for depreciation for qualified property included in an election under this section is subject to adjustment. The taxpayer is not required to use the class life determined under this paragraph for purposes of determining the allowance for depreciation. Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the class life of qualified property to which the taxpayer elects to apply this section is the shorter of—
(i) The asset guideline period for the asset guideline class as set forth in Revenue Procedure 72-10 as in effect on March 1, 1972 (applied without regard to any special provision therein with respect to property predominantly used outside the United States), or
(ii) The asset guideline period for the asset guideline class as set forth in any supplement or revision of Revenue Procedure 72-10, but only if and to the extent by express reference in such supplement or revision made applicable for the purpose of changing the asset guideline period or classification of qualified property to which this section applies.
See paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section for requirement that the election for the taxable year specify the class life for each asset guideline class. Generally, the applicable asset guideline class and asset guideline period for qualified property to which the taxpayer has elected to apply this section will not be changed for the taxable year of election to reflect any supplement or revision thereof after the taxable year. However, if expressly provided in such a supplement or revision, the taxpayer may, at his option in the manner specified therein, apply the revised or supplemented asset guideline classes or periods to such property for such taxable year and succeeding taxable years. The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, has assets in asset guideline class 20.4 of Revenue Procedure 72-10 which were placed in service by corporation X in 1967, 1968, and 1970. Corporation X also has assets in asset guideline class 22.1 of Revenue Procedure 72-10 which were placed in service at various times prior to 1971. Corporation X has no other qualified property. Corporation X elects to apply this section for 1971 to both classes. Assume that the class lives are determined under this subparagraph and not under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(ii) The class lives for asset guideline classes 20.4 and 22.1 are their respective asset guideline periods of 12 years and 9 years in Revenue Procedure 72-10.
(iii) Accordingly, in the election for the taxable year, in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, corporation X specifies a class life of 12 years for asset guideline class 20.4 and a class life of 9 years for asset guideline class 22.1.
(2)
Class lives in special situations.
Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, for the purposes of this section the class life for the asset guideline class determined under this subparagraph shall be used if such class life is shorter than the class life determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. If property described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section in an asset guideline class is acquired by the taxpayer in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, for purposes of this subparagraph such property shall be segregated from other property in the class and treated as in a separate asset guideline class, and the class life for that asset guideline class under this subparagraph shall be the shortest class life the transferor was entitled to use under this section for such property on the date of such transfer. In all other cases, the class life for the asset
guideline class for purposes of this subparagraph shall be the shortest class life (within the meaning of sec. 4, part II, of Revenue Procedure 62-21) which can be justified by application of secs. 3.02(a), 3.03(a), or 3.05, part II, of Revenue Procedure 62-21 (other than the portion of such sec. 3.05 dealing with justification of a class life by reference to facts and circumstances) for the taxpayer's last taxable year ending prior to January 1, 1971.
A class life justified by application of section 3.03(a), Part II, of Revenue Procedure 62-21 shall not be shorter than can be justified under the Adjustment Table for Class Lives in Part III of such Revenue Procedure. For purposes of this subparagraph and paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, the reserve ratio test is met only if the taxpayer's reserve ratio does not exceed the upper limit of the appropriate reserve ratio range or in the alternative during the transitional period there provided does not exceed the appropriate “transitional upper limit” in section 3, Part II, of Revenue Procedure 65-13. References to Revenue Procedure 62-21 include all morifications, amendments, and supplements thereto as of January 1, 1971. The guideline form of the reserve ratio test, as described in Revenue Procedure 65-13, may be applied for purposes of this subparagraph in a manner consistent with the rules contained in section 7, Part II, of Revenue Procedure 65-13 and sections 3.02, 3.03, and 3.05, Part II, of Revenue Procedure 62-21. The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, has all its assets in asset guideline class 20.4 of Revenue Procedure 72-10 which were placed in service by corporation X prior to 1971. Corporation X elects to apply this section for 1971. For taxable years 1967 through 1969, corporation X had used a class life (within the meaning of section 4, Part II, of Revenue Procedure 62-21) for asset guideline class 20.4 of 12 years. The asset guideline period in Revenue Procedure 72-10 in effect for 1971 is also 12 years. Assume that for 1969 corporation X's reserve ratio was below the appropriate reserve ratio lower limit. However, corporation X could not justify a class life shorter than the asset guideline period of 12 years for 1970 since corporation X had not used the 12-year class life for a period at least equal to one-half of 12 years. (See section 3.03(a), Part II, of Revenue Procedure 62-21.) Accordingly, the class life for asset guideline class 20.4 in 1971 is the asset guideline period of 12 years in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that corporation X had used a class life of 10 years for guideline class 20.4 since 1967. Corporation X had not used the class life of 10 years for a period at least equal to one-half of 10 years. However, in 1968 corporation X's 10-year class life was accepted on audit by the Internal Revenue Service and corporation X met the reserve ratio test in 1970 for guideline class 20.4 using a test life of 10 years. (See section 3.05, Part II, of Revenue Procedure 62-21.) Accordingly, the class life of 10 years is justified for 1970 and the class life for 1971 is 10 years in accordance with this subparagraph. If the taxpayer's class life had not been audited and accepted for 1968, and in the absence of other circumstances, the taxpayer could not justify a class life shorter than the asset guideline period of 12 years since it had not used the 10-year class life for a period at least equal to one-half of 10 years. (See section 3.02, Part II, of Revenue Procedure 62-21.)

# Example 3.
Corporation Y, a calendar year taxpayer, has all its assets in asset guideline class 13.3 of Revenue Procedure 72-10 which were placed in service from 1960 through 1970. Corporation Y elects to apply this section for 1971. The asset guideline period in Revenue Procedure 72-10 in effect for 1971 is 16 years. Since 1963 corporation Y had used a class life of 16 years for asset guideline 13.3. At the end of 1969 corporation Y's reserve ratio for guideline class 13.3 was 36 percent. With a growth rate of 8 percent and a test life of 16 years the appropriate reserve ratio lower limit was 37 percent. Corporation Y's reserve ratio of 36 percent was below the lower limit of the appropriate reserve ratio range. Corporation Y had used the 16-year class life for at least eight years. A class life of 13.5 years for 1970 was justified by application of section 3.03(a), Part II, of Revenue Procedure 62-21 and the Adjustment Table for Class Lives in Part III, of Revenue Procedure 62-21. The class life for 1971 is 13.5 years in accordance with this subparagraph.
(3)
Classification of property
—(i)
In general.
Property to which this section applies shall be included in the asset guideline class for the activity in which the property is primarily used in the taxable year of election. See paragraph (d)(5) of this section for rule regarding the classification of leased property.
(ii)
Insubstantial activity.
The provisions of Revenue Produce 62-21 with respect to classification of assets used in
an activity which is insubstantial may be applied under this section.
(iii)
Special rule for certain public utilities.
An electric or gas utility which in accordance with Revenue Procedure 64-21 used a composite guideline class basis for applying Revenue Procedure 62-21 for its last taxable year prior to January 1, 1971, may apply Revenue Procedure 72-10 and this section on the basis of such composite asset guideline class determined as provided in Revenue Procedure 64-21. For the purposes of this section all property in the composite guideline class shall be treated as included in a single asset guideline class.
(c)
Salvage value
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Definition of gross salvage value.
“Gross salvage” value is the amount (determined at or as of the time of acquisition but without regard to the application of Revenue Procedure 62-21) which is estimated will be realized upon a sale or other disposition of qualified property when it is no longer useful in the taxpayer's trade or business or in the production of his income and is to be retired from service, without reduction for the cost of removal, dismantling, demolition, or similar operations. “Net salvage” is gross salvage reduced by the cost of removal, dismantling, demolition, or similar operations. If a taxpayer customarily sells or otherwise disposes of property at a time when such property is still in good operating condition, the gross salvage value of such property is the amount expected to be realized upon such sale or disposition, and under certain circumstances, as where such property is customarily sold at a time when it is still relatively new, the gross salvage value may constitute a relatively large proportion of the unadjusted basis of such property.
(ii)
Definition of salvage value.
“Salvage value” for purposes of this section means gross or net salvage value less the amount, if any, by which reduced by application of section 167(f). Generally, as provided in section 167(f), a taxpayer may reduce the gross or net salvage value for an account by an amount which does not exceed 10 percent of the unadjusted basis of the personal property (as defined in section 167(f)(2)) in the account.
(2)
Estimation of salvage value
—(i)
In general.
For the first taxable year for which he elects to apply this section, the taxpayer must (in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(
c
) of this section) establish salvage value for all qualified property to which the election applies. The taxpayer may (in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph) determine either gross or net salvage, but an election under this section does not constitute permission to change the manner of estimating salvage. Permission to change the manner of estimating salvage must be obtained by filing form 3115 with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, D.C. 20224, within the time otherwise permitted for the taxable year or before September 6, 1973. Salvage value in succeeding taxable years of election will be determined by adjustments of such initial salvage value for the account, as retirements occur. This salvage value established by the taxpayer for the first taxable year of election will not be redetermined merely as a result of fluctuations in price levels or as a result of other circumstances occurring after the close of such taxable year. See paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section for requirements that the taxpayer specify in his election the aggregate amount of salvage value for an asset guideline class and that the taxpayer maintain records reasonably sufficient to identify the salvage value established for each depreciation account in the class.
(ii)
Salvage as limitation on depreciation.
In no case may an account be depreciated under this section below a reasonable salvage value, after taking into account any reduction in gross or net salvage value permitted by section 167(f). For example, if the salvage value of an account for 1971 is $75, the unadjusted basis of the account is $500, and the depreciation reserve is $425, no depreciation is allowable for 1971.
(iii)
Special rule for first taxable year.
If for a taxable year ending prior to January 1, 1971, the taxpayer had adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 prior to January 12, 1971 (see paragraph (f)(2) of this section), no adjustment in the amount of depreciation allowable for
any taxable year ending prior to January 1, 1971, shall be made solely by reason of establishing salvage value under this paragraph for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1970. The principles of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Taxpayer A had adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 prior to January 12, 1971, for taxable years prior to 1971. Taxpayer A had not taken into account any salvage value for account No. 1 which is one of four depreciation accounts A has in the class. The reserve ratio test has been met for all years prior to 1971 and in accordance with Revenue Procedure 62-21 no adjustments in depreciable lives or salvage values were made. At the end of A's taxable year 1970, the unadjusted basis of account No. 1 was $10,000 and the reserve for depreciation was $9,800. Pursuant to this paragraph, A establishes a salvage value of $400 for account No. 1 (determined at or as of the time of acquisition). This salvage value is determined to be correct. No depreciation is allowable for account No. 1 in 1971. No depreciation is disallowed for any taxable year prior to 1971, solely by reason of establishing salvage value under this paragraph.
(3)
Limitation on adjustment of reasonable salvage value.
The salvage value established by the taxpayer for a depreciation account will not be redetermined if it is reasonable. Since the determination of salvage value is a matter of estimation, minimal adjustments will not be made. The salvage value established by the taxpayer will be deemed to be reasonable unless there is sufficient basis for a determination of an amount of salvage value for the account which exceeds the salvage value established by the taxpayer for the account by an amount greater than 10 percent of the unadjusted basis of the account at the close of such taxable year. If the salvage value established by the taxpayer for the account is not within the 10-percent range or if the taxpayer follows the practice of understating his estimates of salvage to take advantage of this subdivision, and if there is a determination of an amount of salvage value for the account for the taxable year which exceeds the salvage value established by the taxpayer for the account for such taxable year, an adjustment will be made by increasing the salvage value established by the taxpayer for the account by an amount equal to the difference between the salvage value as determined and the salvage value established by the taxpayer for the account. For the purposes of this subdivision, a determination of salvage value shall include all determinations at all levels of audit and appellate proceedings, and as well as all final determinations within the meaning of section 1313(a)(1). This subparagraph shall apply to each such determination.
(4)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples in which it is assumed that the taxpayer has established salvage value in accordance with this paragraph and has not followed a practice of understating his estimates of salvage value:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer B elects to apply this section for 1971. Assets Y and Z are the only assets in a multiple asset account of 1967, the year in which the assets were acquired. The unadjusted basis of asset Y is $50,000 and the unadjusted basis of asset Z is $30,000. B estimated a gross salvage value of $55,000 at the time of acquisition. The property qualified under section 167(f)(2) and B reduced the amount of salvage taken into account by $8,000 (that is, 10 percent of $80,000, under sec. 167(f)). Thus, in accordance with this paragraph and paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(
c
) of this section, B establishes a salvage value of $47,000 for the account for 1971. Assume that there is not sufficient basis for determining a salvage value for the account greater $52,000 (that is $60,000 minus the $8,000 reduction under sec. 167(f)). Since the salvage value of $47,000 established by B for the account is within the 10 percent range, it is reasonable. Salvage for the account will not be redetermined.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that B estimated a gross salvage value of $50,000 and establishes a salvage value of $42,000 for the account (that is, $50,000 minus the $8,000 reduction under section 167(f)). There is sufficient basis for determining an amount of salvage value greater than $50,000 (that is, $58,000 minus the $8,000 reduction under section 167(f)). The salvage value of $42,000 established by B for the account can be redetermined without regard to the limitation in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, since it is not within the 10 percent range. Upon audit of B's tax return for 1971 (a year in which the redetermination would affect the amount of depreciation allowable for the account), salvage value is determined to be $52,000 after taking into account the reduction under section 167(f). Salvage value for the account will be adjusted to $52,000.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that upon audit of B's tax
return for 1971 the examining officer determines the salvage value to be $58,000 (that is, $66,000 minus the $8,000 reduction under section 167(f)), and proposes to adjust salvage value for the account to $58,000 which will result in disallowing an amount of depreciation for the taxable year. B does not agree with the finding of the examining officer. After receipt of a “30-day letter,” B waives a district conference and initiates proceedings before the Appellate Division. In consideration of the case by the Appellate Division it is concluded that there is not sufficient basis for determining an amount of salvage value for the account in excess of $55,000 (that is, $63,000 minus the $8,000 reduction under section 167(f)). Since the salvage value of $47,000 established by B for the account is within the 10 percent range, it is reasonable. Salvage value for the account will not be redetermined.

# Example 4.
For 1971, taxpayer C elects to apply this section to factory building X which is in an item account of 1965, the year in which the building was acquired. The unadjusted basis of factory building X is $90,000. C estimated a gross salvage value for the account of $10,000. The property did not qualify under section 167(f)(2). Thus, C establishes a salvage value of $10,000 for the account for 1971. Assume that there is not sufficient basis for determining a salvage value for the account greater than $14,000. Since the salvage value of $10,000 established by C for the account is within the 10-percent range, it is reasonable. Salvage value for the account will not be redetermined.
(d)
Accounting for qualified property
—(1)
In general.
Qualified property for which the taxpayer elects to apply this section may be accounted for in any number of item or multiple asset accounts.
(2)
Retirements of qualified property
—(i)
In general.
The provisions of this subparagraph and § 1.167(a)-8 apply to retirements of qualified property to which the taxpayer elects to apply this section for the taxable year. See subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for special rule for normal retirements.
(ii)
Adjusted basis of assets retired.
In the case of a taxpayer who depreciates qualified property in a multiple-asset account conforming to the asset guideline class at a rate based on the class life in accordance with paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(
a
) of this section, § 1.167(a)-8(c) (relating to basis of assets retired) shall be applied by assuming that the class life is the average expected useful life of the assets in the account. See § 1.167(a)-8, generally, for the basis of assets retired.
(iii)
Definition of normal retirements.
Notwithstanding § 1.167(a)-8(b), the determination whether a retirement of qualified property is normal or abnormal shall be made in light of all the facts and circumstances, primarily with reference to the expected period of use of the asset in the taxpayer's business without regard to paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section. A retirement is not abnormal unless the taxpayer can show that the withdrawal of the asset was not due to a cause which would customarily be contemplated (in light of the taxpayer's practice and experience) in setting a depreciation rate for the assets without regard to paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section. Thus, for example, a retirement is normal if made within the range of years which would customarily be taken into account in setting such depreciation rate and if the asset has reached a condition at which, in the normal course of events, the taxpayer customarily retires similar assets from use in his business. A retirement may be abnormal if the asset is withdrawn at an earlier time or under other circumstances, as, for example, when the asset has been damaged by casualty or has lost its usefulness suddenly as the result of extraordinary obsolescence.
(3)
Special rules
—(i)
In general.
The provisions of this subparagraph shall apply to qualified property in a taxable year for which an election to apply this section is made.
(ii)
Repairs.
For the purpose of sections 162 and 263 and the regulations thereunder, whether an expenditure prolongs the life of an asset shall be determined by reference to the expected period of use of the asset in the taxpayer's business without regard to paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Sale and lease.
For the purpose of comparison with the term of a lease of such property, the remaining life of qualified property shall be determined by reference to the expected period of use of the asset in the taxpayer's business without regard to paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Expected period of use.
For the purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, the determination of
the expected period of use of an asset shall be made in light of all the facts and circumstances. The expected period of use of a particular asset will not necessarily coincide with the class life used for depreciation (or with the individual asset life for depreciation under the alternative method in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) (
b
) of this section for applying the class life). Thus, for example, if the question is whether an asset has been leased for a period less than, equal to or greater than its remaining life, the determination shall be based on the remaining expected period of use of the individual asset without regard to the fact that the asset is depreciated at a rate based on the class life in accordance with paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(
a
) of this section.
(5)
Leased property.
In the case of a lessor of qualified property, unless there is an asset guideline class in effect for such lessors, the asset guideline class for such property shall be determined by reference to the activity in which such property is primarily used by the lessee. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section for general rule for classification of qualified property according to primary use. However, in the case of an asset guideline class based upon the type of property (such as trucks or railroad cars), as distinguished from the activity in which used, the property shall be classified without regard to the activity of the lessee.
(e)
Election under this section
—(1)
Consent to change in method of accounting.
An election to apply this section for a taxable year ending after December 31, 1970, is a method of accounting but the consent of the Commissioner will be deemed granted to make an annual election.
(2)
Election for taxable years ending after December 31, 1976.
For taxable years ending after December 31, 1976, the election to apply this section for a taxable year shall be made by attaching to the income tax return a statement that an election under this section is being made. If the taxpayer does not file a timely return (taking into account extensions of time for filing) for the taxable year, the election shall be made at the time the taxpayer files his first return for the taxable year. The election may be made with an amended return only if such amended return is filed no later than the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for the taxable year. A taxpayer who makes an election under this subparagraph must maintain books and records reflecting the information described in paragraph (e)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
(3)
Election for taxable years ending on or before December 31, 1976.
(i) For taxable years ending on or before December 31, 1976, the election to apply this section for a taxable year may be made by filing Form 5006 with the income tax return for the taxable year. If the taxpayer does not file a timely return (taking into account extensions of time for filing) for the taxable year, the election shall be filed at the time the taxpayer files his first return for the taxable year. The election may be made with an amended return only if such amended return is filed no later than the later of (
a
) the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for the taxable year, or (
b
) November 5, 1973.
(ii) The election to apply this section for a taxable year ending on or before December 31, 1976, will be deemed to be made if the tax return (filed within the periods referred to in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section) contains information sufficient to establish the following:
(
a
) Each asset guideline class for which the election is intended to apply;
(
b
) The class life for each such asset guideline class and whether the class life is determined under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section;
(
c
) For each asset guideline class, as of the end of the taxable year of election, (
1
) the total unadjusted basis of all qualified property, (
2
) the aggregate of the reserves for depreciation of all accounts in the asset guideline class, and (
3
) the aggregate of the salvage value established for all accounts in the asset guideline class; and
(
d
) Whether the taxpayer is an electric or gas utility using a composite asset guideline class basis in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
If an election is deemed to be made under this subdivision (ii), the taxpayer will be deemed to have consented to apply all the provisions of this section.
(iii) A taxpayer to whom the election applies shall maintain books and records for each asset guideline class reasonably sufficient to identify the unadjusted basis, reserve for depreciation and salvage value established for each depreciation account in such asset guidelines class.
(f)
Depreciation for taxable years ending before January 1, 1971
—(1)
Adoption of Revenue Procedure 62-21
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a taxpayer may elect to be examined under the provisions of Revenue Procedure 62-21 for a taxable year ending before January 1, 1971, only in accordance with the rules of this paragraph. The election must specify:
(
a
) That the taxpayer makes such election and consents to, and agrees to apply, all the provisions of this paragraph;
(
b
) Each guideline class and taxable year for which the taxpayer elects to be examined under Revenue Procedure 62-21;
(
c
) The class life claimed for each such guideline class;
(
d
) The class life and the total amount of the depreciation for the guideline class claimed on the last income tax return for such taxable year filed prior to January 12, 1971 (or in case no income tax return was filed prior to January 12, 1971, on the first income tax return filed for such taxable year);
(
e
) The class life claimed and the total amount of depreciation for the guideline class under the election to apply Revenue Procedure 62-21, in accordance with this paragraph, for the taxable year; and
(
f
) If the class life or total amount of depreciation for the guideline class is different in (
d
) and (
e
) of this subdivision, a reasonable description of the computation of the class life in (
e
) of this subdivision, the amount of difference in tax liability resulting therefrom, and the amount of any refund or reduction in any deficiency in tax. The election shall be made in an amended tax return or claim for refund (or by a supplement to the tax return or claim) for the taxable year, and if the class life or total amount of depreciation for the guideline class is different in accordance with (
f
) of this subdivision, such difference shall be reflected in the amended tax return or claim for refund. Forms may be provided for making the election and submission of the information. In the case of an election made after issuance of such forms and more than 30 days after publication of notice thereof in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, the election may be made and the information submitted only in accordance with such forms. An election will not otherwise be invalid under this paragraph so long as there is substantial compliance, in good faith, with the requirements of this paragraph.
(ii)
Special rule.
The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to a guideline class in any taxable year for which the taxpayer has prior to January 12, 1971, adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 for such class. See subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for determination of adoption of Revenue Procedure 62-21 prior to January 12, 1971.
(iii)
Justification of class life claimed and limitations on refunds.
If the taxpayer elects for a taxable year to be examined under the provisions of Revenue Procedure 62-21 in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, any of the provisions of Revenue Procedure 62-21 may be applied to justify a class life claimed on the income tax return filed for such year or to offset an increase in tax liability for such year. Unless it meets the reserve ratio test, no class life will be accepted on audit which (after all other adjustments in tax liability for such year) results in a reduction (or further reduction) in the amount of tax liability shown on the income tax return (specified in subdivision (i)(
d
) of this subparagraph) for such taxable year, or results in an amount of loss carryback or carryover to any taxable year, but if it is justified under Revenue Procedure 62-21 and meets the reserve ratio test, a class life will be accepted on audit without regard to the foregoing limitations and, for example, may produce a refund or credit against tax. For example, if a class life of 9 years is otherwise
justified under Revenue Procedure 62-21 for 1969, but the taxpayer does not meet the reserve ratio test for 1969 using a test life of 9 years, a class life of 9 years (or any class life justified under Revenue Procedure 62-21) will be accepted on audit under Revenue Procedure 62-21 pursuant to an election in accordance with this paragraph provided it does not result in the reduction or further reduction in tax liability or in an amount of loss carryback or carryover as described in the preceding sentence. On the other hand, for example, if a class life of 10 years is justified under Revenue Procedure 62-21 for 1969 and the taxpayer meets the reserve ratio test for 1969 using a test life of 10 years, a class life of 10 years will be accepted on audit under Revenue Procedure 62-21 pursuant to an election in accordance with this paragraph even though it results in a reduction or further reduction in tax liability or in an amount of loss carryback or carryover as described above and produces a refund of tax. For purposes of this section, the term “audit” includes examination of claims for refund or credit against tax.
(iv)
Definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph, the determination whether the reserve ratio test is met shall be made in accordance with that portion of paragraph (b)(2) of this section which is by express reference therein made applicable to this paragraph. In addition, the guideline form of the reserve ratio test, as described in Revenue Procedure 65-13, may be applied. For purposes of this paragraph, references to Revenue Procedure 62-21 include all modifications, amendments, and supplements thereto as of January 11, 1971. The terms “class life” and “guideline class” have the same meaning as in Revenue Procedure 62-21.
(2)
Determination whether Revenue Procedure 62-21 adopted prior to January 12, 1971
—(i)
In general.
For the purposes of this paragraph, a taxpayer will be treated as having adopted prior to January 12, 1971, Revenue Procedure 62-21 for a guideline class for a taxable year ending before January 1, 1971, only if—
(
a
) For the guideline class and taxable year, the taxpayer adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 by expressly so indicating on the income tax return filed for such taxable year prior to January 12, 1971;
(
b
) For the guideline class and taxable year, the taxpayer adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 prior to January 12, 1971, by expressly so indicating in a proceeding before the Internal Revenue Service (such as upon examination of the income tax return for such taxable year) and there is reasonable evidence to that effect; or
(
c
) There is other reasonable evidence that prior to January 12, 1971, the taxpayer adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 for the guideline class and taxable year.
If not treated under (
b
) or (
c
) of this subdivision as having done so for the last taxable year ending before January 1, 1971, and if the taxpayer files his first income tax return for such taxable year after January 11, 1971, the taxpayer will be treated as having adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 prior to January 12, 1971, for a guideline class for such taxable year if he expressly so indicated on that return, or is treated under this subparagraph as having adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 prior to January 12, 1971, for that guideline class for the immediately preceding taxable year.
(ii)
Examples.
The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A, an individual who uses the calendar year as his taxable year, has property in Group Three, Class 16(a), of Revenue Procedure 62-21. On A's income tax return for 1968, filed prior to January 12, 1971, he adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 for the guideline class by so indicating under “Summary of Depreciation” in the appropriate schedule of Form 1040 for 1968. Under subdivision (i) (
a
) of this subparagraph, A is treated as having adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 for the guideline class for 1968 prior to January 12, 1971.

# Example 2.
Taxpayer B, an individual who uses the calendar year as his taxable year, has property in Group Two, Class 5, of Revenue Procedure 62-21. B filed timely income tax returns for 1966 through 1968 but did not adopt Revenue Procedures 62-21 on any of such returns. In 1969 upon audit of B's taxable years 1966 through 1968, B exercised his option to be examined under the provisions of Revenue Procedure 62-21. The Revenue Agent's report shows that B was examined under Revenue Procedure 62-21 for taxable years 1966 through 1968. B will be treated
under subdivision (ii)(
b
) of this subparagraph as having adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 for such years prior to January 12, 1971.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example (2) except that B did not upon examination by the Revenue Agent in 1969 exercise his option to be examined under Revenue Procedure 62-21. B has six accounts in the guideline class, Nos. 1 through 6. The Revenue Agent proposed to lengthen the depreciable lives on accounts Nos. 2 and 3 from 8 years to 12 years. In proceedings before the Appellate Division in 1970, B exercised his option to be examined under the provisions of Revenue Procedure 62-21. This is shown by correspondence between B and the Appellate Conferee as well as by other documents in the case before the Appellate Division. The case was settled on that basis before the Appellate Division without adjustment of the depreciable lives for B's accounts Nos. 2 and 3. B will be treated under subdivision (ii) (
b
) of this subparagraph as having adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 for taxable years 1966 through 1968 prior to January 12, 1971.

# Example 4.
Corporation X uses the calendar year as its taxable year and has assets in Group Two, Class 5, of Revenue Procedure 62-21. Beginning in 1964, corporation X used the guideline life of 10 years as the depreciable life for all assets in the guideline class. In 1967, corporation X's taxable years 1964 through 1966 were examined and corporation X exercised its option to be examined under the provisions of Revenue Procedure 62-21. Corporation X did not adopt Revenue Procedure 62-21 on any of its income tax returns, for the years 1964 through 1970. Corporation X has not been examined since 1967, but has continued to use the guideline life of 10 years for all property in the guideline class including additions since 1966. Corporation X will be treated under subdivision (ii) (
c
) and (
d
) of this subparagraph as having adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 prior to January 12, 1971, for taxable years 1964 through 1970.

# Example 5.
Corporation Y uses the calendar year as its taxable year and has asset in Group Two, Class 5, of Revenue Procedure 62-21. Since 1964, corporation Y has used various depreciable lives, based on the facts and circumstances, for different accounts in the guideline class. Corporation Y was examined in 1968 for taxable years 1965 through 1967. Corporation Y was also examined in 1970 for taxable years 1968 and 1969. Corporation Y did not exercise its option to be examined under the provisions of Revenue Procedure 62-21. Corporation Y has not adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 on any income tax return. For taxable years 1964 through 1970, corporation Y's class life (within the meaning of section 4, Part II, of Revenue Procedure 62-21) was between 12 and 14 years. In August of 1971, corporation Y filed amended income tax returns for 1968 and 1969, and an income tax return for 1970, using a depreciable life of 10 years (equal to the guideline life) for all assets in the guideline class. Corporation Y will not be treated as having adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 prior to January 12, 1971.

# Example 6.
Corporation Z uses the calendar year as its taxable year and has assets in group 2, class 5, of Revenue Procedure 62-21. Corporation Z adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 for this guideline class by expressly so indicating on its tax return for 1966, which was filed before January 12, 1971. Corporation Z computed its allowable depreciation for 1966 as if it adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 for this guideline class for its taxable years 1962 through 1965, although it had earlier filed its tax returns for those years without regard to Revenue Procedure 62-21. The depreciation thus claimed in 1966 was less than what would have been allowable if corporation Z first adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 in 1966. This was the result of certain accounts becoming fully depreciated through use of Revenue Procedure 62-21 in computing depreciation for 1962 through 1965. In addition, in deferred tax accounting procedures employed before January 12, 1971, for financial reporting purposes, corporation Z calculated its tax deferrals on the basis that it had adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 for the years 1962 through 1965. Corporation Z will be treated under subdivision (i) (
c
) of this subparagraph as having adopted Revenue Procedure 62-21 for taxable years 1962 through 1965 prior to January 12, 1971.

§ 1.167(a)-13T
Certain elections for intangible property (temporary).

[59 FR 11922, Mar. 15, 1994]
§ 1.167(a)-14
Treatment of certain intangible property excluded from section 197.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules for the amortization of certain intangibles that are excluded from section 197 (relating to the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles). These excluded intangibles are specifically described in § 1.197-2(c) (4), (6), (7), (11), and (13) and include certain computer software and certain other separately acquired rights, such as
rights to receive tangible property or services, patents and copyrights, certain mortgage servicing rights, and rights of fixed duration or amount. Intangibles for which an amortization amount is determined under section 167(f) and intangibles otherwise excluded from section 197 are amortizable only if they qualify as property subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167(a).
(b)
Computer software
—(1)
In general.
The amount of the deduction for computer software described in section 167(f)(1) and § 1.197-2(c)(4) is determined by amortizing the cost or other basis of the computer software using the straight line method described in § 1.167(b)-1 (except that its salvage value is treated as zero) and an amortization period of 36 months beginning on the first day of the month that the computer software is placed in service. Before determining the amortization deduction allowable under this paragraph (b), the cost or other basis of computer software that is section 179 property, as defined in section 179(d)(1)(A)(ii), must be reduced for any portion of the basis the taxpayer properly elects to treat as an expense under section 179. In addition, the cost or other basis of computer software that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and § 1.168(k)-1 or § 1.168(k)-2, as applicable, 50-percent bonus depreciation property under section 168(k)(4) or § 1.168(k)-1 or § , or qualified New York Liberty Zone property under section 1400L(b) or § 1.1400L(b)-1, must be reduced by the amount of the additional first year depreciation deduction allowed or allowable, whichever is greater, under section 168(k) or section 1400L(b) for the computer software. If costs for developing computer software that the taxpayer properly elects to defer under section 174(b) result in the development of property subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167, the rules of this paragraph (b) will apply to the unrecovered costs. In addition, this paragraph (b) applies to the cost of separately acquired computer software if the cost to acquire the software is separately stated and the cost is required to be capitalized under section 263(a).
(2)
Exceptions.
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to the cost of computer software properly and consistently taken into account under § 1.162-11. The cost of acquiring an interest in computer software that is included, without being separately stated, in the cost of the hardware or other tangible property is treated as part of the cost of the hardware or other tangible property that is capitalized and depreciated under other applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code.
(3)
Additional rules.
Rules similar to those in § 1.197-2 (f)(1)(iii), (f)(1)(iv), and (f)(2) (relating to the computation of amortization deductions and the treatment of contingent amounts) apply for purposes of this paragraph (b).
(c)
Certain interests or rights not acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business
—(1)
Certain rights to receive tangible property or services.
The amount of the deduction for a right (other than a right acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business) to receive tangible property or services under a contract or from a governmental unit (as specified in section 167(f)(2) and § 1.197-2(c)(6)) is determined as follows:
(i)
Amortization of fixed amounts.
The basis of a right to receive a fixed amount of tangible property or services is amortized for each taxable year by multiplying the basis of the right by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of tangible property or services received during the taxable year and the denominator of which is the total amount of tangible property or services received or to be received under the terms of the contract or governmental grant. For example, if a taxpayer acquires a favorable contract right to receive a fixed amount of raw materials during an unspecified period, the taxpayer must amortize the cost of acquiring the contract right by multiplying the total cost by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of raw materials received under the contract during the taxable year and the denominator of which is the total amount of raw materials received or to be received under the contract.
(ii)
Amortization of unspecified amount over fixed period.
The cost or other basis of a right to receive an unspecified amount of tangible property or services
over a fixed period is amortized ratably over the period of the right. (See paragraph (c)(3) of this section regarding renewals).
(iii)
Amortization in other cases.
[Reserved]
(2)
Rights of fixed duration or amount.
The amount of the deduction for a right (other than a right acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business) of fixed duration or amount received under a contract or granted by a governmental unit (specified in section 167(f)(2) and § 1.197-2(c)(13)) and not covered by paragraph (c)(1) of this section is determined as follows:
(i)
Rights to a fixed amount.
The basis of a right to a fixed amount is amortized for each taxable year by multiplying the basis by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount received during the taxable year and the denominator of which is the total amount received or to be received under the terms of the contract or governmental grant.
(ii)
Rights to an unspecified amount over fixed duration of less than 15 years.
The basis of a right to an unspecified amount over a fixed duration of less than 15 years is amortized ratably over the period of the right.
(3)
Application of renewals.
(i) For purposes of paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, the duration of a right under a contract (or granted by a governmental unit) includes any renewal period if, based on all of the facts and circumstances in existence at any time during the taxable year in which the right is acquired, the facts clearly indicate a reasonable expectancy of renewal.
(ii) The mere fact that a taxpayer will have the opportunity to renew a contract right or other right on the same terms as are available to others, in a competitive auction or similar process that is designed to reflect fair market value and in which the taxpayer is not contractually advantaged, will generally not be taken into account in determining the duration of such right provided that the bidding produces a fair market value price comparable to the price that would be obtained if the rights were purchased immediately after renewal from a person (other than the person granting the renewal) in an arm's-length transaction.
(iii) The cost of a renewal not included in the terms of the contract or governmental grant is treated as the acquisition of a separate intangible asset.
(4)
Patents and copyrights.
If the purchase price of an interest (other than an interest acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business) in a patent or copyright described in section 167(f)(2) and § 1.197-2(c)(7) is payable on at least an annual basis as either a fixed amount per use or a fixed percentage of the revenue derived from the use of the patent or copyright, the depreciation deduction for a taxable year is equal to the amount of the purchase price paid or incurred during the year. Otherwise, the basis of such patent or copyright (or an interest therein) is depreciated either ratably over its remaining useful life or under section 167(g) (income forecast method). If a patent or copyright becomes valueless in any year before its legal expiration, the adjusted basis may be deducted in that year.
(5)
Additional rules.
The period of amortization under paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this section begins when the intangible is placed in service, and rules similar to those in § 1.197-2(f)(2) apply for purposes of this paragraph (c).
(d)
Mortgage servicing rights
—(1)
In general.
The amount of the deduction for mortgage servicing rights described in section 167(f)(3) and § 1.197-2(c)(11) is determined by using the straight line method described in § 1.167(b)-1 (except that the salvage value is treated as zero) and an amortization period of 108 months beginning on the first day of the month that the rights are placed in service. Mortgage servicing rights are not depreciable to the extent the rights are stripped coupons under section 1286.
(2)
Treatment of rights acquired as a pool
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, all mortgage servicing rights acquired in the same transaction or in a series of related transactions are treated as a single asset (the pool) for purposes of determining the depreciation deduction under this paragraph (d) and any
gain or loss from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of the rights. Thus, if some (but not all) of the rights in a pool become worthless as a result of prepayments, no loss is recognized by reason of the prepayment and the adjusted basis of the pool is not affected by the unrecognized loss. Similarly, any amount realized from the sale or exchange of some (but not all) of the mortgage servicing rights is included in income and the adjusted basis of the pool is not affected by the realization.
(ii)
Multiple accounts.
If the taxpayer establishes multiple accounts within a pool at the time of its acquisition, gain or loss is recognized on the sale or exchange of all mortgage servicing rights within any such account.
(3)
Additional rules.
Rules similar to those in § 1.197-2(f)(1)(iii), (f)(1)(iv), and (f)(2) (relating to the computation of amortization deductions and the treatment of contingent amounts) apply for purposes of this paragraph (d).
(e)
Effective dates
—(1)
In general.
This section applies to property acquired after January 25, 2000, except that § 1.167(a)-14(c)(2) (depreciation of the cost of certain separately acquired rights) and so much of § 1.167(a)-14(c)(3) as relates to § 1.167(a)-14(c)(2) apply to property acquired after August 10, 1993 (or July 25, 1991, if a valid retroactive election has been made under § 1.197-1T).
(2)
Change in method of accounting.
See § 1.197-2(l)(4) for rules relating to changes in method of accounting for property to which § 1.167(a)-14 applies. However, see § 1.168(k)-1(g)(4) or 1.1400L(b)-1(g)(4) for rules relating to changes in method of accounting for computer software to which the third sentence in § 1.167(a)-14(b)(1) applies.
(3)
Qualified property, 50-percent bonus depreciation property, qualified New York Liberty Zone property, or section 179 property.
This section also applies to computer software that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) or qualified New York Liberty Zone property under section 1400L(b) acquired by a taxpayer after September 10, 2001, and to computer software that is 50-percent bonus depreciation property under section 168(k)(4) acquired by a taxpayer after May 5, 2003. This section also applies to computer software that is section 179 property placed in service by a taxpayer in a taxable year beginning after 2002. The language “or § 1.168(k)-2, as applicable,” in the third sentence in paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to computer software that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and placed in service by a taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that includes September 24, 2019. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply the language “or § 1.168(k)-2, as applicable,” in the third sentence in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for computer software that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer during taxable years ending on or after September 28, 2017. A taxpayer may rely on the language “or § 1.168(k)-2, as applicable,” in the third sentence in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in regulation project REG-104397-18 (2018-41 I.R.B. 558) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter) for computer software that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer during taxable years ending on or after September 28, 2017, and ending before the taxpayer's taxable year that includes September 24, 2019..

§ 1.167(b)-0
Methods of computing depreciation.
(a)
In general.
Any reasonable and consistently applied method of computing depreciation may be used or continued in use under section 167. Regardless of the method used in computing depreciation, deductions for depreciation shall not exceed such amounts as may be necessary to recover the unrecovered cost or other basis less salvage during the remaining useful life of the property. The reasonableness of any claim for depreciation shall be determined upon the basis of conditions known to exist at the end of the period for which the return is made. It is the responsibility of the taxpayer to establish the reasonableness of the deduction for depreciation
claimed. Generally, depreciation deductions so claimed will be changed only where there is a clear and convincing basis for a change.
(b)
Certain methods.
Methods previously found adequate to produce a reasonable allowance under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or prior revenue laws will, if used consistently by the taxpayer, continue to be acceptable under section 167(a). Examples of such methods which continue to be acceptable are the straight line method, the declining balance method with the rate limited to 150 percent of the applicable straight line rate, and under appropriate circumstances, the unit of production method. The methods described in section 167(b) and §§ 1.167(b)-1, 1.167(b)-2, 1.167(b)-3, and 1.167(b)-4 shall be deemed to produce a reasonable allowance for depreciation except as limited under section 167(c) and § 1.167(c)-1. See also § 1.167(e)-1 for rules relating to change in method of computing depreciation.
(c)
Application of methods.
In the case of item accounts, any method which results in a reasonable allowance for depreciation may be selected for each item of property, but such method must thereafter be applied consistently to that particular item. In the case of group, classified, or composite accounts, any method may be selected for each account. Such method must be applied to that particular account consistently thereafter but need not necessarily be applied to acquisitions of similar property in the same or subsequent years, provided such acquisitions are set up in separate accounts. See, however, § 1.167(e)-1 and section 446 and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to changes in the method of computing depreciation, and § 1.167(c)-1 for restriction on the use of certain methods. See also § 1.167(a)-7 for definition of account.
§ 1.167(b)-1
Straight line method.
(a)
In general.
Under the straight line method the cost or other basis of the property less its estimated salvage value is deductible in equal annual amounts over the period of the estimated useful life of the property. The allowance for depreciation for the taxable year is determined by dividing the adjusted basis of the property at the beginning of the taxable year, less salvage value, by the remaining useful life of the property at such time. For convenience, the allowance so determined may be reduced to a percentage or fraction. The straight line method may be used in determining a reasonable allowance for depreciation for any property which is subject to depreciation under section 167 and it shall be used in all cases where the taxpayer has not adopted a different acceptable method with respect to such property.
(b)
Illustrations.
The straight line method is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Under the straight line method items may be depreciated separately:
Year and item
Cost or other basis less salaries
Useful life (years)
Depreciation allowable
1954
1955
1956
1954:
Asset A
$1,600
4
1
$200
$400
$400
Asset B
12,000
40
1
150
300
300
1
In this example it is assumed that the assets were placed in service on July 1, 1954.

# Example 2.
In group, classified, or composite accounting, a number of assets with the same or different useful lives may be combined into one account, and a single rate of depreciation,
i.e.
, the group, classified, or composite rate used for the entire account. In the case of group accounts,
i.e.
, accounts containing assets which are similar in kind and which have approximately the same estimated useful lives, the group rate is determined from the average of the useful lives of the assets. In the case of classified or composite accounts, the classified or composite rate is generally computed by determining the amount of one year's depreciation for each item or each group of similar items, and by dividing the total depreciation thus obtained by the total cost or other basis of the assets. The average rate so obtained is to be used as long as subsequent additions, retirements, or replacements do not substantially alter the relative proportions of different types of assets in the account. An example of the computation of a classified or composite rate follows:
Cost or other basis
Estimated useful life (years)
Annual depreciation
$10,000
5
$2,000
10,000
15
667
20,000
2,667
Average rate is 13.33 percent ($2,667 ÷ $20,000) unadjusted for salvage. Assuming the estimated salvage value is 10 percent of the cost or other basis, the rate adjusted for salvage will be 13.33 percent minus 10 percent of 13.33 percent (13.33%−1.33%), or 12 percent.

# Example 3.
The use of the straight line method for group, classified, or composite accounts is illustrated by the following example: A taxpayer filing his returns on a calendar year basis maintains an asset account for which a group rate of 20 percent has been determined, before adjustment for salvage. Estimated salvage is determined to be 6
2/3
percent, resulting in an adjusted rate of 18.67 percent. During the years illustrated, the initial investment, additions, retirements, and salvage recoveries, which were determined not to change the composition of the group sufficiently to require a change in rate, were assumed to have been made as follows:
1954—Initial investment of $12,000.
1957—Retirement $2,000, salvage realized $200.
1958—Retirement $2,000, salvage realized $200.
1959—Retirement $4,000, salvage realized $400.
1959—Additions $10,000.
1960—Retirement $2,000, no salvage realized.
1961—Retirement $2,000, no salvage realized.

§ 1.167(b)-2
Declining balance method.
(a)
Application of method.
Under the declining balance method a uniform rate is applied each year to the unrecovered cost or other basis of the property. The unrecovered cost or other basis is the basis provided by section 167(g), adjusted for depreciation previously allowed or allowable, and for all other adjustments provided by section 1016 and other applicable provisions of law. The declining balance rate may be determined without resort to formula. Such rate determined under section 167(b)(2) shall not exceed twice the appropriate straight line rate computed without adjustment for salvage. While salvage is not taken into account in determining the annual allowances under this method, in no event shall an asset (or an account) be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value. However, see section 167(f) and § 1.167(f)-1 for rules which permit a reduction in the amount of salvage value to be taken into account for certain personal property acquired after October 16, 1962. Also, see section 167(c) and § 1.167(c)-1 for restrictions on the use of the declining balance method.
(b)
Illustrations.
The declining balance method is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A new asset having an estimated useful life of 20 years was purchased on January 1, 1954, for $1,000. The normal straight line rate (without adjustment for salvage) is 5 percent, and the declining balance rate at twice the normal straight line rate is 10 percent. The annual depreciation allowances for 1954, 1955, and 1956 are as follows:
Year
Basis
Declining balance rate (percent)
Depreciation allowance
1954
$1,000
10
$100
1955
900
10
90
1956
810
10
81

# Example 2.
A taxpayer filing his returns on a calendar year basis maintains a group account to which a 5 year life and a 40 percent declining balance rate are applicable. Original investment, additions, retirements, and salvage recoveries are the same as those set forth in example (3) of paragraph (b) of § 1.167(b)-1. Although salvage value is not taken into consideration in computing a declining balance rate, it must be recognized and accounted for when assets are retired.

Where separate depreciation accounts are maintained by year of acquisition and there is an unrecovered balance at the time of the last retirement, such unrecovered balance may be deducted as part of the depreciation allowance for the year of such retirement. Thus, if the taxpayer had kept separate depreciation accounts by year of acquisition and all the retirements shown in the example above were from 1954 acquisitions, depreciation would be computed on the 1954 and 1959 acquisitions as follows:

In the above example, the allowable depreciation on the 1954 acquisitions totals $11,200. This amount when increased by salvage realized in the amount of $800, equals the entire cost or other basis of the 1954 acquisitions ($12,000).
(c)
Change in estimated useful life.
In the declining balance method when a change is justified in the useful life estimated for an account, subsequent computations shall be made as though the revised useful life had been originally estimated. For example, assume that an account has an estimated useful life of ten years and that a declining balance rate of 20 percent is applicable. If, at the end of the sixth year, it is determined that the remaining useful life of the account is six years, computations shall be made as though the estimated useful life was originally determined as twelve years. Accordingly, the applicable depreciation rate will be 16
2/3
percent. This rate is thereafter applied to the unrecovered cost or other basis.

§ 1.167(b)-3
Sum of the years-digits method.
(a)
Applied to a single asset
—(1)
General rule.
Under the sum of the years-digits method annual allowances for depreciation are computed by applying changing fractions to the cost or other basis of the property reduced by estimated salvage. The numerator of the fraction changes each year to a number which corresponds to the remaining useful life of the asset (including the year for which the allowance is being computed), and the denominator which remains constant is the sum of all the
years digits corresponding to the estimated useful life of the asset. See section 167(c) and § 1.167(c)-1 for restrictions on the use of the sum of the years-digits method.
(i)
Illustrations.
Computation of depreciation allowances on a single asset under the sum of the years-digits method is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A new asset having an estimated useful life of five years was acquired on January 1, 1954, for $1,750. The estimated salvage is $250. For a taxpayer filing his returns on a calendar year basis, the annual depreciation allowances are as follows:
Year

1958
1,500
1/15

Unrecovered value (salvage)

The denominator of the fraction is the sum of the digits representing the years of useful life,
i.e.
, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, or 15.

# Example 2.
Assume in connection with an asset acquired in 1954 that three-fourths of a year's depreciation is allowable in that year. The following illustrates a reasonable method of allocating depreciation:

(ii)
Change in useful life.
Where in the case of a single asset, a change is justified in the useful life, subsequent computations shall be made as though the remaining useful life at the beginning of the taxable year of change were the useful life of a new asset acquired at such time and with a basis equal to the unrecovered cost or other basis of the asset at that time. For example, assume that a new asset with an estimated useful life of ten years is purchased in 1954. At the time of making out his return for 1959, the taxpayer finds that the asset has a remaining useful life of seven years from January 1, 1959. Depreciation for 1959 should then be computed as though 1959 were the first year of the life of an asset estimated to have a useful life of seven years, and the allowance for 1959 would be
7/28
of the unrecovered cost or other basis of the asset after adjustment for salvage.
(2)
Remaining life
—(i)
Application.
Under the sum of the years-digits method, annual allowances for depreciation may also be computed by applying changing fractions to the unrecovered cost or other basis of the asset reduced by estimated salvage. The numerator of the fraction changes each year to a number which corresponds to the remaining useful life of the asset (including the year for which the allowance is being computed), and the denominator changes each year to a number which represents the sum of the digits corresponding to the years of estimated remaining useful life of the asset. For decimal equivalents of such fractions, see Table I of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For example, a new asset with an estimated useful life of 10 years is purchased January 1, 1954, for $6,000. Assuming a salvage value of $500, the depreciation allowance for 1954 is $1,000 ($5,500 × 0.1818, the applicable rate from Table I). For 1955, the unrecovered balance is $4,500, and the remaining life is 9 years. The depreciation allowance for 1955 would then be $900 ($4,500 × 0.2000, the applicable rate from Table I).

# Note:
For determination of decimal equivalents of remaining lives falling between those shown in the above table, the taxpayer may use the next longest life shown in the table, interpolate from the table, or use the following formula from which the table was derived.
D
= 2
R
/ (
W
+ 2
F
)(
W
+ 1)
where:
D
= Decimal equivalent.
R
= Remaining life.
W
= Whole number of years in remaining life.
F
= Fractional part of a year in remaining life.
If the taxpayer desires to carry his calculations of decimal equivalents to a greater number of decimal places than is provided in the table, he may use the formula. The procedure adopted must be consistently followed thereafter.
(b)
Applied to group, classified, or composite accounts
—(1)
General rule.
The sum of the years-digits method may be applied to group, classified, or composite accounts in accordance with the plan described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph or in accordance with other plans as explained in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(2)
Remaining life plan.
The remaining life plan as applied to a single asset is described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. This plan may also be applied to group, classified, or composite accounts. Under this plan the allowance for depreciation is computed by applying changing fractions to the unrecovered cost or other basis of the account reduced by estimated salvage. The numerator of the fraction changes each year to a number which corresponds to the remaining useful life of the account (including the year for which the allowance is being computed), and the denominator changes each year to a number which represents the sum of the years digits corresponding to the years of estimated remaining useful life of the account. Decimal equivalents of such fractions can be obtained by use of Table I under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. The proper application of this method requires that the estimated remaining useful life of the account be determined each year. This determination, of course, may be made each year by analysis,
i.e.
, by determining the remaining lives for each of the components in the account, and averaging them. The estimated remaining life of any account, however, may also be determined arithmetically. For example, it may be computed by dividing the unrecovered cost or other basis of the account, as computed by straight line depreciation, by the gross cost or other basis of the account, and multiplying the result by the average life of the assets in the account. Salvage value is not a factor for the purpose of determining remaining life. Thus, if a group account with an average life of ten years had at January 1, 1958, a gross asset balance of $12,600 and a depreciation reserve computed on the straight line method of $9,450, the remaining life of the account at January 1, 1958, would be computed as follows:
$12,600−$9,450 ÷ $12,600 × 10 years equals 2.50 years.

# Example.
The use of the sum of the years-digits method with group, classified, or composite accounts under the remaining life plan is illustrated by the following example:
A calendar year taxpayer maintains a group account to which a five-year life is applicable. Original investment, additions, retirements, and salvage recoveries are the same as those set forth in example (3) of paragraph (b) of § 1.167(b)-1.

Other plans for application of the sum of the years-digits method.
Taxpayers who wish to use the sum of the years-digits method in computing depreciation for group, classified, or composite accounts in accordance with a sum of the years digits plan other than the remaining life plan described herein may do so only with the consent of the Commissioner. Request for permission to use plans other than that described shall be addressed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, D.C. 20224.
§ 1.167(b)-4
Other methods.
(a) Under section 167(b)(4) a taxpayer may use any consistent method of computing depreciation, such as the sinking fund method, provided depreciation allowances computed in accordance with such method do not result in accumulated allowances at the end of any taxable year greater than the total of the accumulated allowances which could have resulted from the use of the declining balance method described in section 167(b)(2). This limitation applies only during the first two-thirds of the useful life of the property. For example, an asset costing $1,000 having a useful life of six years may be depreciated under the declining balance method in accordance with § 1.167(b)-2, at a rate of 33
1/3
percent. During the first four years or
2/3
of its useful life, maximum depreciation allowances under the declining balance method would be as follows:
Current depreciation
Accumulated depreciation
Balance
Cost of asset
$1,000
First year
$333
$333
667
Second year
222
555
445
Third year
148
703
297
Fourth year
99
802
198
An annual allowance computed by any other method under section 167(b)(4) could not exceed $333 for the first year, and at the end of the second year the total allowances for the two years could not exceed $555. Likewise, the total allowances for the three years could not exceed $703 and for the four years could not exceed $802. This limitation would not apply in the fifth and sixth years. See section 167(c) and § 1.167(c)-1 for restriction on the use of certain methods.
(b) It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that a method of depreciation under section 167(b)(4) is both a reasonable and consistent method and that it does not produce depreciation allowances in excess of the amount permitted under the limitations provided in such section.
§ 1.167(c)-1
Limitations on methods of computing depreciation under section 167(b) (2), (3), and (4).
(a)
In general.
(1) Section 167(c) provides limitations on the use of the declining balance method described in section 167(b)(2), the sum of the years-digits method described in section 167(b)(3), and certain other methods authorized by section 167(b)(4). These methods are applicable only to tangible property having a useful life of three years or more. If construction, reconstruction, or erection by the taxpayer began before January 1, 1954, and was completed after December 31, 1953, these methods apply only to that portion of the basis of the property which is properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction, or erection after December 31, 1953. Property is considered as constructed, reconstructed, or erected by the taxpayer if the work is done for him in accordance with his specifications. The portion of the basis of such property attributable to construction, reconstruction, or erection after December 31, 1953, consists of all costs of the property allocable to the period after December 31, 1953, including the cost or other basis of materials entering into such work. It is not necessary that such materials be acquired after December 31, 1953, or that they be new in use. If construction or erection by the taxpayer began after December 31, 1953, the entire cost or other basis of such construction or erection qualifies for these methods of depreciation. In the case of reconstruction of property, these methods do not apply to any part of the adjusted basis of such property on December 31, 1953. For purposes of this section, construction, reconstruction, or erection by the taxpayer begins when physical work is
started on such construction, reconstruction, or erection.
(2) If the property was not constructed, reconstructed, or erected by the taxpayer, these methods apply only if it was acquired after December 31, 1953, and if the original use of the property commences with the taxpayer and commences after December 31, 1953. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, property shall be deemed to be acquired when reduced to physical possession, or control. The term “original use” means the first use to which the property is put, whether or not such use corresponds to the use of such property by the taxpayer. For example, a reconditioned or rebuilt machine acquired after December 31, 1953, will not be treated as being put to original use by the taxpayer even though it is put to a different use, nor will a horse acquired for breeding purposes be treated as being put to original use by the taxpayer if prior to the purchase the horse was used for racing purposes. See §§ 1.167(b)-2, 1.167 (b)-3, and 1.167(b)-4 for application of the various methods.
(3) Assets having an estimated average useful life of less than three years shall not be included in a group, classified, or composite account to which the methods described in §§ 1.167 (b)-2, 1.167(b)-3, and 1.167(b)-4 are applicable. However, an incidental retirement of an asset from such an account prior to the expiration of a useful life of three years will not prevent the application of these methods to such an account.
(4) See section 381(c)(6) and the regulations thereunder for rules covering the use of depreciation methods by acquiring corporations in the case of certain corporate acquisitions.
(5)
See
§§ 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-68 for provisions dealing with depreciation of property received by a member of an affiliated group from another member of the group during a consolidated return period.
(6) Except in the cases described in subparagraphs (4) and (5) of this paragraph, the methods of depreciation described in §§ 1.167(b)-2, 1.167(b-(3), and 1.167(b)-4 are not applicable to property in the hands of a distributee, vendee, transferee, donee, or grantee unless the original use of the property begins with such person and the conditions required by section 167(c) and this section are otherwise met. For example, these methods of depreciation may not be used by a corporation with respect to property which it acquires from an individual or partnership in exchange for its stock. Similarly, if an individual or partnership receives property in a distribution upon dissolution of a corporation, these methods of depreciation may not be used with respect to property so acquired by such individual or partnership. As a further example, these methods of depreciation may not be used by a partnership with respect to contributed property, nor by a partner with respect to partnership property distributed to him. Moreover, where a partnership is entitled to use these depreciation methods, and the optional adjustment to basis of partnership property provided by section 743 is applicable, (i) in the case of an increase in the adjusted basis of the partnership property under such section, the transferee partner with respect to whom such adjustment is applicable shall not be entitled to use such methods with respect to such increase, and (ii) in the case of a decrease in the adjusted basis of the partnership property under such section, the transferee partner with respect to whom such adjustment is applicable shall include in his income an amount equal to the portion of the depreciation deducted by the partnership which is attributable to such decrease.
(b)
Illustrations.
(1) The application of these methods to property constructed, reconstructed, or erected by the taxpayer after December 31, 1953, may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
If a building with a total cost of $100,000 is completed after December 31, 1953, and the portion attributable to construction after December 31, 1953, is determined by engineering estimates or by cost accounting records to be $30,000, the methods referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are applicable only to the $30,000 portion of the total.

# Example 2.
In 1954, a taxpayer has an old machine with an unrecovered cost of $1,000. If he contracts to have it reconditioned, or reconditions it himself, at a cost of an additional $5,000, only the $5,000 may be depreciated under the methods referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, whether or not the materials used for reconditioning are new in use.

# Example 3.
A taxpayer who acquired a building in 1940 makes major maintenance or repair expenditures in 1954 of a type which must be capitalized. For these expenditures the taxpayer may use a method of depreciation different from that used on the building (for example, the methods referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) only if he accounts for such expenditures separately from the account which contained the original building. In such case, the unadjusted basis on any parts replaced shall be removed from the asset account and shall be charged to the appropriate depreciation reserve account. In the alternative he may capitalize such expenditures by charging them to the depreciation reserve account for the building.
(2) The application of these methods to property which was not constructed, reconstructed, or erected by the taxpayer but which was acquired after December 31, 1953, may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A taxpayer contracted in 1953 to purchase a new machine which he acquired in 1954 and put into first use in that year. He may use the methods referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in recovering the cost of the new machine.

# Example 2.
A taxpayer instead of reconditioning his old machine buys a “factory reconditioned” machine in 1954 to replace it. He cannot apply the methods referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to any part of the cost of the reconditioned machine since he is not the first user of the machine.

# Example 3.
In 1954, a taxpayer buys a house for $20,000 which had been used as a personal residence and thus had not been subject to depreciation allowances. He makes a capital addition of $5,000 and rents the property to another. The taxpayer may use the methods referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, only with respect to the $5,000 cost of the addition.
(c)
Election to use methods.
Subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the methods of computing the allowance for depreciation specified in section 167(b) (2), (3), and (4) may be adopted without permission and no formal election is required. In order for a taxpayer to elect to use these methods for any property described in paragraph (a) of this section, he need only compute depreciation thereon under any of these methods for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1953, in which the property may first be depreciated by him. The election with respect to any property shall not be binding with respect to acquisitions of similar property in the same year or subsequent year which are set up in separate accounts. If a taxpayer has filed his return for a taxable year ending after December 31, 1953, for which the return is required to be filed on or before September 15, 1956, an election to compute the depreciation allowance under any of the methods specified in section 167 (b) or a change in such an election may be made in an amended return or claim for refund filed on or before September 15, 1956.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7244, 37 FR 28897, Dec. 30, 1972; T.D. 8560, 59 FR 41674, Aug. 15, 1994; T.D. 8597, 60 FR 36679, July 18, 1995; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106851, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.167(d)-1
Agreement as to useful life and rates of depreciation.
After August 16, 1954, a taxpayer may, for taxable years ending after December 31, 1953, enter into an agreement with respect to the estimated useful life, method and rate of depreciation and treatment of salvage of any property which is subject to the allowance for depreciation. An application for such agreement may be made to the district director for the internal revenue district in which the taxpayer's return is required to be filed. Such application shall be filed in quadruplicate and shall contain in such detail as may be practical the following information:
(a) The character and location of the property.
(b) The original cost or other basis and date of acquisition.
(c) Proper adjustments to the basis including depreciation accumulated to the first taxable year to be covered by the agreement.
(d) Estimated useful life and estimated salvage value.
(e) Method and rate of depreciation.
(f) Any other facts and circumstances pertinent to making a reasonable estimate of the useful life of the property and its salvage value.
The agreement must be in writing and must be signed by the taxpayer and by the district director. The agreement must be signed in quadruplicate, and two of the signed copies will be returned to the taxpayer. The agreement
shall set forth its effective date, the estimated remaining useful life, the estimated salvage value, and rate and method of depreciation of the property and the facts and circumstances taken into consideration in adoption of the agreement, and shall relate only to depreciation allowances for such property on and after the effective date of the agreement. Such an agreement shall be binding on both parties until such time as facts and circumstances which were not taken into account in making the agreement are shown to exist. The party wishing to modify or change the agreement shall have the responsibility of establishing the existence of such facts and circumstances. Any change in the useful life or rate specified in such agreement shall be effective only prospectively, that is, it shall be effective beginning with the taxable year in which notice of the intention to change, including facts and circumstances warranting the adjustment of useful life and rate, is sent by the party proposing the change to the other party and is sent by registered mail, if such notice is mailed before September 3, 1958, or is sent by certified mail or registered mail, if such notice is mailed after September 2, 1958. A copy of the agreement (and any modification thereof) shall be filed with the taxpayer's return for the first taxable year which is affected by the agreement (or any modification thereof). A signed copy should be retained with the permanent records of the taxpayer. For rules relating to changes in method of depreciation, see § 1.167(e)-1 and section 446 and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.167(e)-1
Change in method.
(a)
In general.
(1) Any change in the method of computing the depreciation allowances with respect to a particular account (other than a change in method permitted or required by reason of the operation of former section 167(j)(2) and § 1.167(j)-3(c)) is a change in method of accounting, and such a change will be permitted only with the consent of the Commissioner, except that certain changes to the straight line method of depreciation will be permitted without consent as provided in former section 167(e)(1), (2), and (3). Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a change in method of computing depreciation will be permitted only with respect to all the assets contained in a particular account as defined in § 1.167(a)-7. Any change in the percentage of the current straight line rate under the declining balance method, for example, from 200 percent of the straight line rate to any other percent of the straight line rate, or any change in the interest factor used in connection with a compound interest or sinking fund method, will constitute a change in method of depreciation. Any request for a change in method of depreciation shall be made in accordance with section 446(e) and the regulations under section 446(e). For rules covering the use of depreciation methods by acquiring corporations in the case of certain corporate acquisitions, see section 381(c)(6) and the regulations under section 381(c)(6).
(2) Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section apply to property for which depreciation is determined under section 167 (other than under section 168, section 1400I, section 1400L(c), under section 168 prior to its amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 2121), or under an additional first year depreciation deduction provision (for example, section 168(k), 1400L(b), or 1400N(d))) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(b)
Declining balance to straight line.
In the case of an account to which the method described in section 167(b)(2) is applicable, a taxpayer may change without the consent of the Commissioner from the declining balance method of depreciation to the straight line method at any time during the useful life of the property under the following conditions. Such a change may not be made if a provision prohibiting such a change is contained in an agreement under section 167(d). When the change is made, the unrecovered cost or other basis (less a reasonable estimate for salvage) shall be recovered through annual allowances over the estimated remaining useful life determined in accordance with the circumstances existing at the time. With respect to any account, this change will be permitted only if applied to all the assets in the account as defined in
§ 1.167(a)-7. If the method of depreciation described in section 167(b)(2) (the declining balance method of depreciation using a rate not exceeding 200 percent of the straight line rate) is an acceptable method of depreciation with respect to a particular account, the taxpayer may elect under this paragraph to change to the straight line method of depreciation even if with respect to that particular account the declining balance method is permitted under a provision other than section 167(b)(2). Thus, for example, in the case of section 1250 property to which section 167(j)(1) is applicable, section 167(b) does not apply, but the declining balance method of depreciation using 150 percent of the straight line rate is an acceptable method of depreciation under section 167(j)(1)(B). Accordingly, the taxpayer may elect under this paragraph to change to the straight line method of depreciation with respect to such property. Similarly, if the taxpayer acquired used property before July 25, 1969, and adopted the 150 percent declining balance method of depreciation permitted with respect to such property under § 1.167(b)-0(b), the taxpayer may elect under this paragraph to change to the straight line method of depreciation with respect to such property. The taxpayer shall furnish a statement with respect to the property which is the subject of the change showing the date of acquisition, cost or other basis, amounts recovered through depreciation and other allowances, the estimated salvage value, the character of the property, the remaining useful life of the property, and such other information as may be required. The statement shall be attached to the taxpayer's return for the taxable year in which the change is made. A change to the straight line method must be adhered to for the entire taxable year of the change and for all subsequent taxable years unless, with the consent of the Commissioner, a change to another method is permitted.
(c)
Change with respect to section 1245 property.
(1) In respect of his first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, a taxpayer may elect, without the consent of the Commissioner, to change the method of depreciation of section 1245 property (as defined in section 1245(a)(3)) from any declining balance method or sum of the years-digits method to the straight line method. With respect to any account (as defined in § 1.167(a)-7), this change may be made notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in an agreement under section 167(d), but such change shall constitute (as of the first day of such taxable year) a termination of such agreement as to all property in such account. With respect to any account, this change will be permitted only if applied to all the section 1245 property in the account. The election shall be made by a statement on, or attached to, the return for such taxable year filed on or before the last day prescribed by law, including any extensions thereof, for filing such return.
(2) When an election under this paragraph is made in respect of section 1245 property in an account, the unrecovered cost or other basis (less a reasonable estimate for salvage) of all the section 1245 property in the account shall be recovered through annual allowances over the estimated remaining useful life determined in accordance with the circumstances existing at that time. If there is other property in such account, the other property shall be placed in a separate account and depreciated by using the same method as was used before the change permitted by this paragraph, but the estimated useful life of such property shall be redetermined in accordance with § 1.167(b)-2, or 1.167(b)-3, whichever is applicable. The taxpayer shall maintain records which permit specific identification of the section 1245 property in the account with respect to which the election is made, and any other property in such account. The records shall also show for all the property in the account the date of acquisition, cost or other basis, amounts recovered through depreciation and other allowances, the estimated salvage value, the character of the property, and the remaining useful life of the property. A change to the straight line method under this paragraph must be adhered to for the entire taxable year of the change and for all subsequent taxable years unless, with the consent of the Commissioner, a change to another method is permitted.
(d)
Change with respect to section 1250 property.
(1) In respect of his first taxable year beginning after July 24, 1969, a taxpayer may elect, without the consent of the Commissioner, to change the method of depreciation of section 1250 property (as defined in section 1250(c)) from any declining balance method or sum of the years-digits method to the straight line method. With respect to any account (as defined in § 1.167(a)-7) this change may be made notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in an agreement under section 167(d), but such change will constitute (as of the first day of such taxable year) a termination of such agreement as to all property in such account. With respect to any account, this change will be permitted only if applied to all the section 1250 property in the account. The election shall be made by a statement on, or attached to, the return for such taxable year filed on or before the last day prescribed by law, including extensions thereof, for filing such return.
(2) When an election under this paragraph is made in respect of section 1250 property in an account, the unrecovered cost or other basis (less a reasonable estimate for salvage) of all the section 1250 property in the account shall be recovered through annual allowances over the estimated remaining useful life determined in accordance with the circumstances existing at that time. If there is other property in such account, the other property shall be placed in a separate account and depreciated by using the same method as was used before the change permitted by this paragraph, but the estimated useful life of such property shall be redetermined in accordance with § 1.167(b)-2 or § 1.167(b)-3, whichever is applicable. The taxpayer shall maintain records which permit specific identification of the section 1250 property in the account with respect to which the election is made and any other property in such account. The records shall also show for all the property in the account the date of the acquisition, cost or other basis, amounts recovered through depreciation and other allowances, the estimated salvage value, the character of the property, and the estimated remaining useful life of the property. A change to the straight line method under this paragraph must be adhered to for the entire taxable year of the change and for all subsequent taxable years unless, with the consent of the Commissioner, a change to another method is permitted.

§ 1.167(f)-1
Reduction of salvage value taken into account for certain personal property.
(a)
In general.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, and ending after October 16, 1962, a taxpayer may reduce the amount taken into account as salvage value in computing the allowance for depreciation under section 167(a) with respect to “personal property” as defined in section 167(f)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section. The reduction may be made in an amount which does not exceed 10 percent of the basis of the property for determining depreciation, as of the time as of which salvage value is required to be determined (or when salvage value is redetermined), taking into account all adjustments under section 1016 other than (1) the adjustment under section 1016(a)(2) for depreciation allowed or allowable to the taxpayer, and (2) the adjustment under section 1016(a)(19) for a credit earned by the taxpayer under section 38, to the extent such adjustment is reflected in the basis for depreciation. See paragraph (c) of § 1.167(a)-1 for the definition of salvage value, the time for making the determination, the redetermination of salvage value, and the general rules with respect to the treatment of salvage value. See also section 167(g) and § 1.167(g)-1 for basis for depreciation. A reduction of the amount taken into account as salvage value with respect to any property shall not be binding with
respect to other property. In no event shall an asset (or an account) be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value after taking into account the reduction in salvage value permitted by section 167(f) and this section.
(b)
Definitions and special rules.
The following definitions and special rules apply for purposes of section 167(f) and this section.
(1)
Personal property.
The term “personal property” shall include only depreciable—
(i) Tangible personal property (as defined in section 48 and the regulations thereunder) and
(ii) Intangible personal property
which has an estimated useful life (determined at the time of acquisition) of 3 years or more and which is acquired after October 16, 1962. Such term shall not include livestock. The term “livestock” includes horses, cattle, hogs, sheep, goats, and mink and other furbearing animals, irrespective of the use to which they are put or the purpose for which they are held. The original use of the property need not commence with the taxpayer so long as he acquired it after October 16, 1962; thus, the property may be new or used. For purposes of determining the estimated useful life, the provisions of paragraph (b) of § 1.167(a)-1 shall be applied. For rules determining when property is acquired, see subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. For purposes of determining the types of intangible personal property which are subject to the allowance for depreciation, see § 1.167(a)-3.
(2)
Acquired.
In determining whether property is acquired after October 16, 1962, property shall be deemed to be acquired when reduced to physical possession, or control. Property which has not been used in the taxpayer's trade or business or held for the production of income and which is thereafter converted by the taxpayer to such use shall be deemed to be acquired on the date of such conversion. In addition, property shall be deemed to be acquired if constructed, reconstructed, or erected by the taxpayer. If construction, reconstruction, or erection by the taxpayer began before October 17, 1962, and was completed after October 16, 1962, section 167(f) and this section apply only to that portion of the basis of the property which is properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction, or erection after October 16, 1962. Property is considered as constructed, reconstructed, or erected by the taxpayer if the work is done for him in accordance with his specifications. The portion of the basis of such property attributable to construction, reconstruction, or erection after October 16, 1962, consists of all costs of the property allocable to the period after October 16, 1962, including the cost or other basis of materials entering into such work. It is not necessary that such materials be acquired after October 16, 1962, or that they be new in use. If construction or erection by the taxpayer began after October 16, 1962, the entire cost or other basis of such construction or erection qualifies for the reduction provided for by section 167(f) and this section. In the case of reconstruction of property, section 167(f) and this section do not apply to any part of the adjusted basis of such property on October 16, 1962. For purposes of this section, construction, reconstruction, or erection by the taxpayer begins when physical work is started on such construction, reconstruction, or erection.
(c)
Illustrations.
The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A purchases a new asset for use in his business on January 1, 1963, for $10,000. The asset qualifies for the investment credit under section 38 and for the additional first-year depreciation allowance under section 179. A is entitled to an investment credit of $700 (7% × $10,000) and elects to take an additional first-year depreciation allowance of $2,000 (20% × $10,000). The basis for depreciation (determined in accordance with the provisions of section 167(g) and § 1.167(g)-1) is computed as follows:
Purchase price
$10,000
Less: Adjustment required for taxable years beginning before Jan. 1, 1964, under section 1016(a)(19), for the investment credit
$700
Adjustment required under section 1016(a)(2) for the additional first-year depreciation allowance
2,000
2,700
Basis for depreciation for the taxable year 1963
7,300
However, the basis of the property for determining depreciation as of the time as of which salvage value is required to be determined is $10,000, the purchase price of the property. A files his income tax returns on a calendar year basis and uses the straight line method of depreciation. A estimates that he will use the asset in his business for 10 years after which it will have a salvage value of $500, which is less than $1,000 (10% × $10,000, the basis of the property for determining depreciation as of the time as of which salvage value is required to be determined). For the taxable year 1963 A may deduct $730 as the depreciation allowance. As of January 1, 1964, the basis of the asset is increased by $700 in accordance with paragraph (d) of § 1.48-7. In computing his total depreciation allowance on the asset, A may reduce the amount taken into account as salvage value to zero and may claim depreciation deductions (including the additional first-year depreciation allowance) totaling $10,000. See paragraph (d) of § 1.48-7 for the computation of depreciation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, where there is an increase in basis of property subject to the investment credit.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that A in a subsequent taxable year redetermines the estimate of the useful life of the asset and at the same time also redetermines the estimate of salvage value. Assume also that at such time the only reductions reflected in the basis are for depreciation allowed or allowable. Accordingly, the reduction under section 167(f) and this section will be computed with regard to the purchase price and not the unrecovered basis for depreciation at the time of the redetermination.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that A estimates that the asset will have a salvage value of $1,200 at the end of its useful life. In computing his depreciation for the asset, A may reduce the amount to be taken into account as salvage value to $200 ($1,200−$1,000). Accordingly, A may claim depreciation deductions (including the additional first-year depreciation allowance) totaling $9,800,
i.e.
, the purchase price of the property ($10,000) less the amount taken into account as salvage value ($200).

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the taxpayer had taken into account salvage value of only $200 but that the estimated salvage value had actually been $700. The amount of salvage value taken into account by the taxpayer is permissible since the reduction of salvage value by $500 ($700−$200) would be within the limit provided for in section 167 (f),
i.e.
, $1,000 (10% × $10,000).

# Example 5.
On January 1, 1963, taxpayer B, a taxicab operator, traded his old taxicab plus cash for a new one, which had an estimated useful life of three years, in a transaction qualifying as a nontaxable exchange. The old taxicab had an adjusted basis of $2,500. B was allowed $3,000 for his old taxicab and paid $1,000 in cash. The basis of the new taxicab for determining depreciation (as determined under section 167(g) and § 1.167(g)-1) is the adjusted basis of the old taxicab at the time of trade-in ($2,500) plus the additional cash paid out ($1,000), or $3,500. In computing his depreciation allowance on the new taxicab, B may reduce the amount taken into account as salvage value by $350 (10% of $3,500).

# Example 6.
Taxpayer C purchases a new asset for use in his business on January 1, 1963, for $10,000. At the time of purchase, the asset has an estimated useful life of 10 years and an estimated salvage value of $1,500. C elects to compute his depreciation allowance for the asset by the declining balance method of depreciation, using a rate of 20% which is twice the normal straight line rate of 10% (without adjustment for salvage value). C files his income tax returns on a calendar year basis. In computing his depreciation allowance for the year 1966, C changes his method of determining the depreciation allowance for the asset from the declining balance method to the straight line method (in which salvage value is accounted for in determining the annual depreciation allowances) in accordance with the provisions of section 167(e) and paragraph (b) of § 1.167(e)-1. He also wishes to reduce the amount of salvage value taken into account in accordance with the provisions of section 167(f) and this section. At the close of the year 1966, the only reductions reflected in the basis of the asset are for depreciation allowances. Thus, C may reduce the amount of salvage value taken into account by $1,000 (10% × $10,000, the basis of the asset when it was acquired), and, therefore, will account for salvage value of only $500 in computing his depreciation allowance for the asset in 1966 and subsequent years.

# Example 7.
Taxpayer D purchases a station wagon for his personal use on January 1, 1962, for $4,500. On January 1, 1963, D converts the use of the station wagon to his business, and at that time it has an estimated useful life of 4 years, an estimated salvage value of $500, and a basis of $3,000 (as determined under section 167 (g) and § 1.167 (g)-1). Thus, for purposes of section 167 (f) and this section, D is deemed to have acquired the station wagon on January 1, 1963. D elects the straight line method of depreciation in computing the depreciation allowance for the station wagon and also wishes to reduce the amount of salvage value taken into account in accordance with the provisions of section 167(f) and this section. Accordingly, D may reduce the amount of salvage value taken into account by $300 (10% of $3,000). D files his income tax returns on a calendar year
basis. His depreciation allowance for the year 1963 would be computed as follows:
Basis for depreciation
$3,000
Less:
Salvage value
$500
Reduction permitted by section 167(f)
300
200
Amount to be depreciated over the useful life
2,800
D's depreciation allowance on the station wagon for the year 1963 would be $700 ($2,800 divided by 4, the remaining useful life).

§ 1.167(g)-1
Basis for depreciation.
The basis upon which the allowance for depreciation is to be computed with respect to any property shall be the adjusted basis provided in section 1011 for the purpose of determining gain on the sale or other disposition of such property. In the case of property which has not been used in the trade or business or held for the production of income and which is thereafter converted to such use, the fair market value on the date of such conversion, if less than the adjusted basis of the property at that time, is the basis for computing depreciation.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960. Redesignated, T.D. 6712, 29 FR 3653, Mar. 24, 1964]
§ 1.167(h)-1
Life tenants and beneficiaries of trusts and estates.
(a)
Life tenants.
In the case of property held by one person for life with remainder to another person, the deduction for depreciation shall be computed as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property so that he will be entitled to the deduction during his life, and thereafter the deduction, if any, shall be allowed to the remainderman.
(b)
Trusts.
If property is held in trust, the allowable deduction is to be apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the trustee on the basis of the trust income allocable to each, unless the governing instrument (or local law) requires or permits the trustee to maintain a reserve for depreciation in any amount. In the latter case, the deduction is first allocated to the trustee to the extent that income is set aside for a depreciation reserve, and any part of the deduction in excess of the income set aside for the reserve shall be apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the trustee on the basis of the trust income (in excess of the income set aside for the reserve) allocable to each. For example:
(1) If under the trust instrument or local law the income of a trust computed without regard to depreciation is to be distributed to a named beneficiary, the beneficiary is entitled to the deduction to the exclusion of the trustee.
(2) If under the trust instrument or local law the income of a trust is to be distributed to a named beneficiary, but the trustee is directed to maintain a reserve for depreciation in any amount, the deduction is allowed to the trustee (except to the extent that income set aside for the reserve is less than the allowable deduction). The same result would follow if the trustee sets aside income for a depreciation reserve pursuant to discretionary authority to do so in the governing instrument.
No effect shall be given to any allocation of the depreciation deduction which gives any beneficiary or the trustee a share of such deduction greater than his pro rata share of the trust income, irrespective of any provisions in the trust instrument except as otherwise provided in this paragraph when the trust instrument or local law requires or permits the trustee to maintain a reserve for depreciation.
(c)
Estates.
In the case of an estate the allowable deduction shall be apportioned between the estate and the heirs legatees, and devisees on the basis of income of the estate which is allocable to each.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960. Redesignated, T.D. 6712, 29 FR 3653, Mar. 24, 1964]
§ 1.167(i)-1
Depreciation of improvements in the case of mines, etc.
Property used in the trade or business or held for the production of income which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 611 shall be treated for all purposes of the Code as if it were property subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167. The preceding sentence
shall not limit the allowance for depreciation otherwise allowable under section 611.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960. Redesignated, T.D. 6712, 29 FR 3653, Mar. 24, 1964]
§ 1.167(l)-1
Limitations on reasonable allowance in case of property of certain public utilities.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
Section 167(l) in general provides limitations on the use of certain methods of computing a reasonable allowance for depreciation under section 167(a) with respect to “public utility property” (see paragraph (b) of this section) for all taxable years for which a Federal income tax return was not filed before August 1, 1969. The limitations are set forth in paragraph (c) of this section for “pre-1970 public utility property” and in paragraph (d) of this section for “post-1969 public utility property.” Under section 167(l), a taxpayer may always use a straight line method (or other “subsection (l) method” as defined in paragraph (f) of this section). In general, the use of a method of depreciation other than a subsection (l) method is not prohibited by section 167(l) for any taxpayer if the taxpayer uses a “normalization method of regulated accounting” (described in paragraph (h) of this section). In certain cases, the use of a method of depreciation other than a subsection (l) method is not prohibited by section 167(l) if the taxpayer used a “flow-through method of regulated accounting” described in paragraph (i) of this section) for its “July 1969 regulated accounting period” (described in paragraph (g) of this section) whether or not the taxpayer uses either a normalization or a flow-through method of regulated accounting after its July 1969 regulated accounting period. However, in no event may a method of depreciation other than a subsection (l) method be used in the case of pre-1970 public utility property unless such method of depreciation is the “applicable 1968 method” (within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section). The normalization requirements of section 167(l) with respect to public utility property defined in section 167(l)(3)(A) pertain only to the deferral of Federal income tax liability resulting from the use of an accelerated method of depreciation for computing the allowance for depreciation under section 167 and the use of straight line depreciation for computing tax expense and depreciation expense for purposes of establishing cost of services and for reflecting operating results in regulated books of account. Regulations under section 167(l) do not pertain to other book-tax timing differences with respect to State income taxes, F.I.C.A. taxes, construction costs, or any other taxes and items. The rules provided in paragraph (h)(6) of this section are to insure that the same time period is used to determine the deferred tax reserve amount resulting from the use of an accelerated method of depreciation for cost of service purposes and the reserve amount that may be excluded from the rate base or included in no-cost capital in determining such cost of services. The formula provided in paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of this section is to be used in conjunction with the method of accounting for the reserve for deferred taxes (otherwise proper under paragraph (h)(2) of this section) in accordance with the accounting requirements prescribed or approved, if applicable, by the regulatory body having jurisdiction over the taxpayer's regulated books of account. The formula provides a method to determine the period of time during which the taxpayer will be treated as having received amounts credited or charged to the reserve account so that the disallowance of earnings with respect to such amounts through rate base exclusion or treatment as no-cost capital will take into account the factor of time for which such amounts are held by the taxpayer. The formula serves to limit the amount of such disallowance.
(2)
Methods of depreciation.
For purposes of section 167(l), in the case of a declining balance method each different uniform rate applied to the unrecovered cost or other basis of the property is a different method of depreciation. For purposes of section 167(l), a change in a uniform rate of depreciation due to a change in the useful life of the property or a change in the taxpayer's unrecovered cost or other basis for the property is not a change in the method of depreciation. The use of
“guideline lives” or “class lives” for Federal income tax purposes and different lives on the taxpayer's regulated books of account is not treated for purposes of section 167(l) as a different method of depreciation. Further, the use of an unrecovered cost or other basis or salvage value for Federal income tax purposes different from the basis or salvage value used on the taxpayer's regulated books of account is not treated as a different method of depreciation.
(3)
Application of certain other provisions to public utility property.
For rules with respect to application of the investment credit to public utility property, see section 46(e). For rules with respect to the application of the class life asset depreciation range system, including the treatment of the use of “class lives” for Federal income tax purposes and different lives on the taxpayer's regulated books of account, see § 1.167(a)-11 and § 1.167(a)-12.
(4)
Effect on agreements under section 167(d).
If the taxpayer has entered into an agreement under section 167(d) as to any public utility property and such agreement requires the use of a method of depreciation prohibited by section 167(l), such agreement shall terminate as to such property. The termination, in accordance with this subparagraph, shall not affect any other property (whether or not public utility property) covered by the agreement.
(5)
Effect of change in method of depreciation.
If, because the method of depreciation used by the taxpayer with respect to public utility property is prohibited by section 167(l), the taxpayer changes to a method of depreciation not prohibited by section 167(l), then when the change is made the unrecovered cost or other basis shall be recovered through annual allowances over the estimated remaining useful life determined in accordance with the circumstances existing at that time.
(b)
Public utility property
—(1)
In general.
Under section 167(l)(3)(A), property is “public utility property” during any period in which it is used predominantly in a “section 167(l) public utility activity”. The term “section 167(l) public utility activity” means the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of—
(i) Electrical energy, water, or sewage disposal services,
(ii) Gas or steam through a local distribution system,
(iii) Telephone services,
(iv) Other communication services (whether or not telephone services) if furnished or sold by the Communications Satellite Corporation for purposes authorized by the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 (47 U.S.C. 701), or
(v) Transportation of gas or steam by pipeline,
if the rates for such furnishing or sale, as the case may be, are regulated,
i.e.
, have been established or approved by a regulatory body described in section 167(l)(3)(A). The term “regulatory body described in section 167(l)(3)(A)” means a State (including the District of Columbia) or political subdivision thereof, any agency or instrumentality of the United States, or a public service or public utility commission or other body of any State or political subdivision thereof similar to such a commission. The term “established or approved” includes the filing of a schedule of rates with a regulatory body which has the power to approve such rates, even though such body has taken no action on the filed schedule or generally leaves undisturbed rates filed by the taxpayer involved.
(2)
Classification of property.
If property is not used solely in a section 167(l) public utility activity, such property shall be public utility property if its predominant use is in a section 167(l) public utility activity. The predominant use of property for any period shall be determined by reference to the proper accounts to which expenditures for such property are chargeable under the system of regulated accounts required to be used for the period for which the determination is made and in accordance with the principles of § 1.46-3(g)(4) (relating to credit for investment in certain depreciable property). Thus, for example, for purposes of determining whether property is used predominantly in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of transportation of gas by pipeline, or furnishing or sale of gas through a local distribution system, or both, the rules prescribed in § 1.46-3(g)(4) apply,
except that accounts 365 through 371, inclusive (Transmission Plant), shall be added to the accounts enumerated in subdivision (i) of such paragraph (g)(4).
(c)
Pre-1970 public utility property
—(1)
Definition.
(i) Under section 167(l)(3)(B), the term “pre-1970 public utility property” means property which was public utility property at any time before January 1, 1970. If a taxpayer acquires pre-1970 public utility property, such property shall be pre-1970 public utility property in the hands of the taxpayer even though such property may have been acquired by the taxpayer in an arm's-length cash sale at fair market value or in a tax-free exchange. Thus, for example, if corporation X which is a member of the same controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a)) as corporation Y sells pre-1970 public utility property to Y, such property is pre-1970 public utility property in the hands of Y. The result would be the same if X and Y were not members of the same controlled group of corporations.
(ii) If the basis of public utility property acquired by the taxpayer in a transaction is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of any of the taxpayer's pre-1970 public utility property by reason of the application of any provision of the code, and if immediately after the transaction the adjusted basis of the property acquired is less than 200 percent of the adjusted basis of such pre-1970 public utility property immediately before the transaction, the property acquired is pre-1970 public utility property.
(2)
Methods of depreciation not prohibited.
Under section 167(l)(1), in the case of pre-1970 public utility property, the term “reasonable allowance” as used in section 167(a) means, for a taxable year for which a Federal income tax return was not filed before August 1, 1969, and in which such property is public utility property, an allowance (allowable without regard to section 167(l)) computed under—
(i) A subsection (l) method, or
(ii) The applicable 1968 method (other than a subsection (l) method) used by the taxpayer for such property, but only if—
(
a
) The taxpayer uses in respect of such taxable year a normalization method of regulated accounting for such property,
(
b
) The taxpayer used a flow-through method of regulated accounting for such property for its July 1969 regulated accounting period, or
(
c
) The taxpayer's first regulated accounting period with respect to such property is after the taxpayer's July 1969 regulated accounting period and the taxpayer used a flow-through method of regulated accounting for its July 1969 regulated accounting period for public utility property of the same kind (or if there is no property of the same kind, property of the most similar kind) most recently placed in service. See paragraph (e)(5) of this section for determination of same (or similar) kind.
(3)
Flow-through method of regulated accounting in certain cases.
See paragraph (e)(6) of this section for treatment of certain taxpayers with pending applications for change in method of accounting as being deemed to have used a flow-through method of regulated accounting for the July 1969 regulated accounting period.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X, a calendar-year taxpayer subject to the jurisdiction of a regulatory body described in section 167(l)(3)(A), used the straight line method of depreciation (a subsection (l) method) for all of its public utility property for which depreciation was allowable on its Federal income tax return for 1967 (the latest taxable year for which X, prior to August 1, 1969, filed a return). Assume that under paragraph (e) of this section, X's applicable 1968 method is a subsection (l) method with respect to all of its public utility property. Thus, with respect to its pre-1970 public utility property, X may only use a straight line method (or any other subsection (l) method) of depreciation for all taxable years after 1967.

# Example 2.
Corporation Y, a calendar-year taxpayer subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, is engaged exclusively in the transportation of gas by pipeline. On its Federal income tax return for 1967 (the latest taxable year for which Y, prior to August 1, 1969, filed a return), Y used the declining balance method of depreciation using a rate of 150 percent of the straightline
rate for all of its nonsection 1250 public utility property with respect to which depreciation was allowable. Assume that with respect to all of such property, Y's applicable 1968 method under paragraph (e) of this section is such 150 percent declining balance method. Assume that Y used a normalization method of regulated accounting for all relevant regulated accounting periods. If Y continues to use a normalization method of regulated accounting, Y may compute its reasonable allowance for purposes of section 167(a) using such 150 percent declining balance method for its nonsection 1250 pre-1970 public utility property for all taxable years beginning with 1968, provided the use of such method is allowable without regard to section 167(l). Y may also use a subsection (l) method for any of such pre-1970 public utility property for all taxable years beginning after 1967. However, because each different uniform rate applied to the basis of the property is a different method of depreciation, Y may not use a declining balance method of depreciation using a rate of twice the straight line rate for any of such pre-1970 public utility property for any taxable year beginning after 1967.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that with respect to all of its nonsection 1250 pre-1970 public utility property accounted for in its July 1969 regulated accounting period Y used a flow-through method of regulated accounting for such period. Assume further that such property is the property on the basis of which the applicable 1968 method is established for pre-1970 public utility property of the same kind, but having a first regulated accounting period after the taxpayer's July 1969 regulated accounting period. Beginning with 1968, with respect to such property Y may compute its reasonable allowance for purposes of section 167(a) using the declining balance method of depreciation and a rate of 150 percent of the straight line rate, whether it uses a normalization or flow-through method of regulated accounting after its July 1969 regulated accounting period, provided the use of such method is allowable without regard to section 167(l).
(d)
Post-1969 public utility property
—(1)
In general.
Under section 167(l)(3)(C), the term “post-1969 public utility property” means any public utility property which is not pre-1970 public utility property.
(2)
Methods of depreciation not prohibited.
Under section 167(l)(2), in the case of post-1969 public utility property, the term “reasonable allowance” as used in section 167(a) means, for a taxable year, an allowance (allowable without regard to section 167(l)) computed under—
(i) A subsection (l) method,
(ii) A method of depreciation otherwise allowable under section 167 if, with respect to the property, the taxpayer uses in respect of such taxable year a normalization method of regulated accounting, or
(iii) The taxpayer's applicable 1968 method (other than a subsection (l) method) with respect to the property in question, if the taxpayer used a flow-through method of regulated accounting for its July 1969 regulated accounting period for the property of the same (or similar) kind most recently placed in service, provided that the property in question is not property to which an election under section 167(l)(4)(A) applies. See § 1.167(l)(2) for rules with respect to an election under section 167(l)(4)(A). See paragraph (e)(5) of this section for definition of same (or similar) kind.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X is engaged exclusively in the trade or business of the transportation of gas by pipeline and is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission. With respect to all its public utility property, X's applicable 1968 method (as determined under paragraph (e) of this section) is the straight line method of depreciation. X may determine its reasonable allowance for depreciation under section 167(a) with respect to its post-1969 public utility property under a straight line method (or other subsection (l) method) or, if X uses a normalization method of regulated accounting, any other method of depreciation, provided that the use of such other method is allowable under section 167 without regard to section 167(l).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that with respect to all of X's post-1969 public utility property the applicable 1968 method (as determined under paragraph (e) of this section) is the declining balance method using a rate of 150 percent of the straight line rate. Assume further that all of X's pre-1970 public utility property was accounted for in its July 1969 regulated accounting period, and that X used a flow-through method of regulated accounting for such period. X may determine its reasonable allowance for depreciation under section 167 with respect to its post-1969 public utility property by using the straight line method of depreciation (or any other subsection (l)
method), by using any method otherwise allowable under section 167 (such as a declining balance method) if X uses a normalization method of regulated accounting, or, by using the declining balance method using a rate of 150 percent of the straight line rate, whether or not X uses a normalization or a flow-through method of regulated accounting.
(e)
Applicable 1968 method
—(1)
In general.
Under section 167(l)(3)(D), except as provided in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, the term “applicable 1968 method” means with respect to any public utility property—
(i) The method of depreciation properly used by the taxpayer in its Federal income tax return with respect to such property for the latest taxable year for which a return was filed before August 1, 1969,
(ii) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply, the method of depreciation properly used by the taxpayer in its Federal income tax return for the latest taxable year for which a return was filed before August 1, 1969, with respect to public utility property of the same kind (or if there is no property of the same kind, property of the most similar kind) most recently placed in service before the end of such latest taxable year, or
(iii) If neither subdivision (i) nor (ii) of this subparagraph applies, a subsection (l) method.
If, on or after August 1, 1969, the taxpayer files an amended return for the taxable year referred to in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, such amended return shall not be taken into consideration in determining the applicable 1968 method. The term “applicable 1968 method” if such new method results to any public utility property, for the year of change and subsequent years, a method of depreciation otherwise allowable under section 167 to which the taxpayer changes from an applicable 1968 method if such new method results in a lesser allowance for depreciation for such property under section 167 in the year of change and the taxpayer secures the Commissioner's consent to the change in accordance with the procedures of section 446(e) and § 1.446-1.
(2)
Placed in service.
For purposes of this section, property is placed in service on the date on which the period for depreciation begins under section 167. See, for example, § 1.167(a)-10(b) and § 1.167(a)-11(c)(2). If under an averaging convention property which is placed in service (as defined in § 1.46-3(d)(ii)) by the taxpayer on different dates is treated as placed in service on the same date, then for purposes of section 167(l) the property shall be treated as having been placed in service on the date the period for depreciation with respect to such property would begin under section 167 absent such averaging convention. Thus, for example, if, except for the fact that the averaging convention used assumes that all additions and retirements made during the first half of the year were made on the first day of the year, the period of depreciation for two items of public utility property would begin on January 10 and March 15, respectively, then for purposes of determining the property of the same (or similar) kind most recently placed in service, such items of property shall be treated as placed in service on January 10 and March 15, respectively.
(3)
Certain section 1250 property.
If a taxpayer is required under section 167(j) to use a method of depreciation other than its applicable 1968 method with respect to any section 1250 property, the term “applicable 1968 method” means the method of depreciation allowable under section 167(j) which is the most nearly comparable method to the applicable 1968 method determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. For example, if the applicable 1968 method on new section 1250 property is the declining balance method using 200 percent of the straight line rate, the most nearly comparable method allowable for new section 1250 property under section 167(j) would be the declining balance method using 150 percent of the straight line rate. If the applicable 1968 method determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is the sum of the years-digits method, the term “most nearly comparable method” refers to any method of depreciation allowable under section 167(j).
(4)
Applicable 1968 method in certain cases.
(i)(
a
) Under section 167(l)(3)(E), if the taxpayer evidenced within the time
and manner specified in (
b
) of this subdivision (i) the intent to use a method of depreciation under section 167 (other than its applicable 1968 method as determined under subparagraph (1) or (3) of this paragraph or a subsection (l) method) with respect to any public utility property, such method of depreciation shall be deemed to be the taxpayer's applicable 1968 method with respect to such public utility property and public utility property of the same (or most similar) kind subsequently placed in service.
(
b
) Under this subdivision (i), the intent to use a method of depreciation under section 167 is evidenced—
(
1
) By a timely application for permission for a change in method of accounting filed by the taxpayer before August 1, 1969, or
(
2
) By the use of such method of depreciation in the computation by the taxpayer of its tax expense for purposes of reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account for its July 1969 regulated accounting period, as established in the manner prescribed in paragraph (g)(1) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.
(ii)(
a
) If public utility property is acquired in a transaction in which its basis in the hands of the transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of any provision of the Code, or in a transfer (including any purchase for cash or in exchange) from a related person, then in the hands of the transferee the applicable 1968 method with respect to such property shall be determined by reference to the treatment in respect of such property in the hands of the transferor.
(
b
) For purposes of this subdivision (ii), the term “related person” means a person who is related to another person if either immediately before or after the transfer—
(
1
) The relationship between such persons would result in a disallowance of losses under section 267 (relating to disallowance of losses, etc., between related taxpayers) or section 707(b) (relating to losses disallowed, etc., between partners and controlled partnerships) and the regulations thereunder, or
(
2
) Such persons are members of the same controlled group of corporations, as defined in section 1563(a) (relating to definition of controlled group of corporations), except that “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for “at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1563(a) and the regulations thereunder.
(5)
Same or similar.
The classification of property as being of the same (or similar) kind shall be made by reference to the function of the public utility to which the primary use of the property relates. Property which performs the identical function in the identical manner shall be treated as property of the same kind. The determination that property is of a similar kind shall be made by reference to the proper account to which expenditures for the property are chargeable under the system of regulated accounts required to be used by the taxpayer for the period in which the property in question was acquired. Property, the expenditure for which is chargeable to the same account, is property of the most similar kind. Property, the expenditure for which is chargeable to an account for property which serves the same general function, is property of a similar kind. Thus, for example, if corporation X, a natural gas company, subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, had property properly chargeable to account 366 (relating to transmission plant structures and improvements) acquired an additional structure properly chargeable to account 366, under the uniform system of accounts prescribed for natural gas companies (class A and class B) by the Federal Power Commission, effective September 1, 1968, the addition would constitute property of the same kind if it performed the identical function in the identical manner. If, however, the addition did not perform the identical function in the identical manner, it would be property of the most similar kind.
(6)
Regulated method of accounting in certain cases.
Under section 167(l)(4)(B), if with respect to any pre-1970 public utility property the taxpayer filed a timely application for change in method of accounting referred to in subparagraph (4)(i)(
b
)(
1
) of this paragraph and
with respect to property of the same (or similar) kind most recently placed in service the taxpayer used a flow-through method of regulated accounting for its July 1969 regulated accounting period, then for purposes of section 167(l)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of this section the taxpayer shall be deemed to have used a flow-through method of regulated accounting with respect to such pre-1970 public utility property.
(7)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X is a calendar-year taxpayer. On its Federal income tax return for 1967 (the latest taxable year for which X, prior to August 1, 1969, filed a return) X used a straight line method of depreciation with respect to certain public utility property placed in service before 1965 and used the declining balance method of depreciation using 200 percent of the straight line rate (double declining balance) with respect to the same kind of public utility property placed in service after 1964. In 1968 and 1970, X placed in service additional public utility property of the same kind. The applicable 1968 method with respect to the above described public utility property is shown in the following chart:
Property held in 1970
Placed in service
Method on 1967 return
Applicable 1968 method
Group 1
Before 1965
Straight line
Straight line.
Group 2
After 1964 and before 1968
Double declining balance
Double declining balance.
Group 3
After 1967 and before 1969
Do.
Group 4
After 1968
Do.

# Example 2.
Corporation Y is a calendar-year taxpayer engaged exclusively in the trade or business of the furnishing of electrical energy. In 1954, Y placed in service hydroelectric generators and for all purposes Y has taken straight line depreciation with respect to such generators. In 1960, Y placed in service fossil fuel generators and for all purposes since 1960 has used the declining balance method of depreciation using a rate of 150 percent of the straight line rate (computed without reduction for salvage) with respect to such generators. After 1960 and before 1970 Y did not place in service any generators. In 1970, Y placed in service additional hydroelectric generators. The applicable 1968 method with respect to the hydroelectric generators placed in service in 1970 would be the straight line method because it was the method used by Y on its return for the latest taxable year for which Y filed a return before August 1, 1969, with respect to property of the same kind (
i.e.
, hydroelectric generators) most recently placed in service.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that the generators placed in service in 1970 were nuclear generators. The applicable 1968 method with respect to such generators is the declining balance method using a rate of 150 percent of the straight line rate because, with respect to property of the most similar kind (fossil fuel generators) most recently placed in service, Y used such declining balance method on its return for the latest taxable year for which it filed a return before August 1, 1969.
(f)
Subsection (l) method.
Under section 167(l)(3)(F), the term “subsection (l) method” means a reasonable and consistently applied ratable method of computing depreciation which is allowable under section 167(a), such as, for example, the straight line method or a unit of production method or machine-hour method. The term “subsection (l) method” does not include any declining balance method (regardless of the uniform rate applied), sum of the years-digits method, or method of depreciation which is allowable solely by reason of section 167(b)(4) or (j)(1)(C).
(g)
July 1969 regulated accounting period
—(1)
In general.
Under section 167(l)(3)(I), the term “July 1969 regulated accounting period” means the taxpayer's latest accounting period ending before August 1, 1969, for which the taxpayer regularly computed, before January 1, 1970, its tax expense for purposes of reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account. The computation by the taxpayer of such tax expense may be established by reference to the following:
(i) The most recent periodic report of a period ending before August 1, 1969, required by a regulatory body described in section 167(l)(3)(A) having jurisdiction over the taxpayer's regulated books of account which was filed with such body before January 1, 1970 (whether or not such body has jurisdiction over rates).
(ii) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply, the taxpayer's most recent report to its shareholders for a period ending before August 1, 1969, but only if such report was distributed to the shareholders before January 1, 1970, and if the taxpayer's stocks or securities are traded in an established securities market during
such period. For purposes of this subdivision, the term “established securities market” has the meaning assigned to such term in § 1.453-3(d)(4).
(iii) If subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph do not apply, entries made to the satisfaction of the district director before January 1, 1970, in its regulated books of account for its most recent accounting period ending before August 1, 1969.
(2)
July 1969 method of regulated accounting in certain acquisitions.
If public utility property is acquired in a transaction in which its basis in the hands of the transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of any provision of the Code, or in a transfer (including any purchase for cash or in exchange) from a related person, then in the hands of the transferee the method of regulated accounting for such property's July 1969 regulated accounting period shall be determined by reference to the treatment in respect of such property in the hands of the transferor. See paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section for definition of “related person”.
(3)
Determination date.
For purposes of section 167(l), any reference to a method of depreciation under section 167(a), or a method of regulated accounting, taken into account by the taxpayer in computing its tax expense for its July 1969 regulated accounting period shall be a reference to such tax expense as shown on the periodic report or report to shareholders to which subparagraph (1) (i) or (ii) of this paragraph applies or the entries made on the taxpayer's regulated books of account to which subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph applies. Thus, for example, assume that regulatory body A having jurisdiction over public utility property with respect to X's regulated books of account requires X to reflect its tax expense in such books using the same method of depreciation which regulatory body B uses for determining X's cost of service for ratemaking purposes. If in 1971, in the course of approving a rate change for X, B retroactively determines X's cost of service for ratemaking purposes for X's July 1969 regulated accounting period using a method of depreciation different from the method reflected in X's regulated books of account as of January 1, 1970, the method of depreciation used by X for its July 1969 regulated accounting period would be determined without reference to the method retroactively used by B in 1971.
(h)
Normalization method of accounting
—(1)
In general.
(i) Under section 167(l), a taxpayer uses a normalization method of regulated accounting with respect to public utility property—
(
a
) If the same method of depreciation (whether or not a subsection (l) method) is used to compute both its tax expense and its depreciation expense for purposes of establishing cost of service for ratemaking purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account, and
(
b
) If to compute its allowance for depreciation under section 167 it uses a method of depreciation other than the method it used for purposes described in (
a
) of this subdivision, the taxpayer makes adjustments consistent with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to a reserve to reflect the total amount of the deferral of Federal income tax liability resulting from the use with respect to all of its public utility property of such different methods of depreciation.
(ii) In the case of a taxpayer described in section 167(l) (1) (B) or (2) (C), the reference in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be a reference only to such taxpayer's “qualified public utility property”. See § 1.167(l)-2(b) for definition of “qualified public utility property”.
(iii) Except as provided in this subparagraph, the amount of Federal income tax liability deferred as a result of the use of different method of depreciation under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is the excess (computed without regard to credits) of the amount the tax liability would have been had a subsection (l) method been used over the amount of the actual tax liability. Such amount shall be taken into account for the taxable year in which such different methods of depreciation are used. If, however, in respect of any taxable year the use of a method of depreciation other than a subsection (l) method for purposes of determining the taxpayer's reasonable allowance
under section 167(a) results in a net operating loss carryover (as determined under section 172) to a year succeeding such taxable year which would not have arisen (or an increase in such carryover which would not have arisen) had the taxpayer determined his reasonable allowance under section 167(a) using a subsection (l) method, then the amount and time of the deferral of tax liability shall be taken into account in such appropriate time and manner as is satisfactory to the district director.
(2)
Adjustments to reserve.
(i) The taxpayer must credit the amount of deferred Federal income tax determined under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph for any taxable year to a reserve for deferred taxes, a depreciation reserve, or other reserve account. The taxpayer need not establish a separate reserve account for such amount but the amount of deferred tax determined under subparagraph (1) (i) of this paragraph must be accounted for in such a manner so as to be readily identifiable. With respect to any account, the aggregate amount allocable to deferred tax under section 167(l) shall not be reduced except to reflect the amount for any taxable year by which Federal income taxes are greater by reason of the prior use of different methods of depreciation under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph. An additional exception is that the aggregate amount allocable to deferred tax under section 167(l) may be properly adjusted to reflect asset retirements or the expiration of the period for depreciation used in determining the allowance for depreciation under section 167(a).
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X is exclusively engaged in the transportation of gas by pipeline subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission. With respect to its post-1969 public utility property, X is entitled under section 167(l)(2)(B) to use a method of depreciation other than a subsection (l) method if it uses a normalization method of regulated accounting. With respect to such property, X has not made any election under § 1.167(a)-11 (relating to depreciation based on class lives and asset depreciation ranges). In 1972, X places in service public utility property with an unadjusted basis of $2 million, and an estimated useful life of 20 years. X uses the declining balance method of depreciation with a rate twice the straight line rate. If X uses a normalization method of regulated accounting, the amount of depreciation allowable under section 167(a) with respect to such property for 1972 computed under the double declining balance method would be $200,000. X computes its tax expense and depreciation expense for purposes of determining its cost of service for rate-making purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account using the straight line method of depreciation (a subsection (l) method). A depreciation allowance computed in this manner is $100,000. The excess of the depreciation allowance determined under the double declining balance method ($200,000) over the depreciation expense computed using the straight line method ($100,000) is $100,000. Thus, assuming a tax rate of 48 percent, X used a normalization method of regulated accounting for 1972 with respect to property placed in service that year if for 1972 it added to a reserve $48,000 as taxes deferred as a result of the use by X of a method of depreciation for Federal income tax purposes different from that used for establishing its cost of service for ratemaking purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that X elects to apply § 1.167(a)-11 with respect to all eligible property placed in service in 1972. Assume further that all property X placed in service in 1972 is eligible property. One hudnred percent of the asset guideline period for such property is 22 years and the asset depreciation range is from 17.5 years to 26.5 years. X uses the double declining balance method of depreciation, selects an asset depreciation period of 17.5 years, and applies the half-year convention (described in § 1.167(a)-11(c)(2)(iii)). In 1972, the depreciation allowable under section 167(a) with respect to property placed in service in 1972 is $114,285 (determined without regard to the normalization requirements in § 1.167(a)-11(b)(6) and in section 167(l)). X computes its tax expense for purposes of determining its cost of service for ratemaking purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account using the straight line method of depreciation (a subsection (l) method), an estimated useful life of 22 years (that is, 100 percent of the asset guideline period), and the half-year convention. A depreciation allowance computed in this manner is $45,454. Assuming a tax rate of 48 percent, the amount that X must add to a reserve for 1972 with respect to property placed in service that year in order to qualify as using a normalization method of regulated accounting under section 167(l) (3) (G) is $27,429 and the amount in order to satisfy the normalization requirements of § 1.167(a)-11(b)(6) is $5,610. X determined such amounts as follows:
(1) Depreciation allowance on tax return (determined without regard to section 167(l) and § 1.167(a)-11(b) (6))
$114,285
(2) Line (1), recomputed using a straight line method
57,142
(3) Difference in depreciation allowance attributable to different methods (line (1) minus line (2))
$57,143
(4) Amount to add to reserve under this paragraph (48 percent of line (3))
27,429
(5) Amount in line (2)
$57,142
(6) Line (5), recomputed by using an estimated useful life of 22 years and the half-year convention
45,454
(7) Difference in depreciation allowance attributable to difference in depreciation periods
$11,688
(8) Amount to add to reserve under § 1.167(a)-11(b) (6) (ii) (48 percent of line (7))
5,610
If, for its depreciation expense for purposes of determining its cost of service for ratemaking purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account, X had used a period in excess of the asset guideline period of 22 years, the total amount in lines (4) and (8) in this example would not be changed.

# Example 3.
Corporation Y, a calendar-year taxpayer which is engaged in furnishing electrical energy, made the election provided by section 167(l) (4) (a) with respect to its “qualified public utility property” (as defined in § 1.167(l)-2(b)). In 1971, Y placed in service qualified public utility property which had an adjusted basis of $2 million, estimated useful life of 20 years, and no salvage value. With respect to property of the same kind most recently placed in service, Y used a flow-through method of regulated accounting for its July 1969 regulated accounting period and the applicable 1968 method is the declining balance method of depreciation using 200 percent of the straight line rate. The amount of depreciation allowable under the double declining balance method with respect to the qualified public utility property would be $200,000. Y computes its tax expense and depreciation expense for purposes of determining its cost of service for ratemaking purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account using the straight line method of depreciation. A depreciation allowance with respect to the qualified public utility property determined in this manner is $100,000. The excess of the depreciation allowance determined under the double declining balance method ($200,000) over the depreciation expense computed using the straight line method ($100,000) is $100,000. Thus, assuming a tax rate of 48 percent, Y used a normalization method of regulated accounting for 1971 if for 1971 it added to a reserve $48,000 as tax deferred as a result of the use by Y of a method of depreciation for Federal income tax purposes with respect to its qualified public utility property which method was different from that used for establishing its cost of service for ratemaking purposes and for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account for such property.

# Example 4.
Corporation Z, exclusively engaged in a public utility activity did not use a flow-through method of regulated accounting for its July 1969 regulated accounting period. In 1971, a regulatory body having jurisdiction over all of Z's property issued an order applicable to all years beginning with 1968 which provided, in effect, that Z use an accelerated method of depreciation for purposes of section 167 and for determining its tax expenses for purposes of reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account. The order further provided that Z normalize 50 percent of the tax deferral resulting from the use of the accelerated method of depreciation and that Z flow-through 50 percent of the tax deferral resulting therefrom. Under section 167(l), the method of accounting provided in the order would not be a normalization method of regulated accounting because Z would not be permitted to normalize 100 percent of the tax deferral resulting from the use of an accelerated method of depreciation. Thus, with respect to its public utility property for purposes of section 167, Z may only use a subsection (l) method of depreciation.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in example (4) except that the order of the regulatory body provided, in effect, that Z normalize 100 percent of the tax deferral with respect to 50 percent of its public utility property and flow-through the tax savings with respect to the other 50 percent of its property. Because the effect of such an order would allow Z to flow-through a portion of the tax savings resulting from the use of an accelerated method of depreciation, Z would not be using a normalization method of regulated accounting with respect to any of its properties. Thus, with respect to its public utility property for purposes of section 167, Z may only use a subsection (l) method of depreciation.
(3)
Establishing compliance with normalization requirements in respect of operating books of account.
The taxpayer may establish compliance with the requirement in subparagraph (l)(i) of this paragraph in respect of reflecting operating results, and adjustments to a reserve, in its operating books of account by reference to the following:
(i) The most recent periodic report for a period beginning before the end of the taxable year, required by a regulatory body described in section 167(l)(3)(A) having jurisdiction over the taxpayer's regulated operating books
of account which was filed with such body before the due date (determined with regard to extensions) of the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for such taxable year (whether or not such body has jurisdiction over rates).
(ii) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply, the taxpayer's most recent report to its shareholders for the taxable year but only if (
a
) such report was distributed to the shareholders before the due date (determined with regard to extensions) of the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the taxable year and (
b
) the taxpayer's stocks or securities are traded in an established securities market during such taxable year. For purposes of this subdivision, the term “established securities market” has the meaning assigned to such term in § 1.453-3(d)(4).
(iii) If neither subdivision (i) nor (ii) of this subparagraph applies, entries made to the satisfaction of the district director before the due date (determined with regard to extensions) of the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the taxable year in its regulated books of account for its most recent period beginning before the end of such taxable year.
(4)
Establishing compliance with normalization requirements in computing cost of service for ratemaking purposes.
(i) In the case of a taxpayer which used a flow-through method of regulated accounting for its July 1969 regulated accounting period or thereafter, with respect to all or a portion of its pre-1970 public utility property, if a regulatory body having jurisdiction to establish the rates of such taxpayer as to such property (or a court which has jurisdiction over such body) issues an order of general application (or an order of specific application to the taxpayer) which states that such regulatory body (or court) will permit a class of taxpayers of which such taxpayer is a member (or such taxpayer) to use the normalization method of regulated accounting to establish cost of service for ratemaking purposes with respect to all or a portion of its public utility property, the taxpayer will be presumed to be using the same method of depreciation to compute both its tax expense and its depreciation expense for purposes of establishing its cost of service for ratemaking purposes with respect to the public utility property to which such order applies. In the event that such order is in any way conditional, the preceding sentence shall not apply until all of the conditions contained in such order which are applicable to the taxpayer have been fulfilled. The taxpayer shall establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or his delegate that such conditions have been fulfilled.
(ii) In the case of a taxpayer which did not use the flow-through method of regulated accounting for its July 1969 regulated accounting period or thereafter (including a taxpayer which used a subsection (l) method of depreciation to compute its allowance for depreciation under section 167(a) and to compute its tax expense for purposes of reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account), with respect to any of its public utility property, it will be presumed that such taxpayer is using the same method of depreciation to compute both its tax expense and its depreciation expense for purposes of establishing its cost of service for ratemaking purposes with respect to its post-1969 public utility property. The presumption described in the preceding sentence shall not apply in any case where there is (
a
) an expression of intent (regardless of the manner in which such expression of intent is indicated) by the regulatory body (or bodies), having jurisdiction to establish the rates of such taxpayer, which indicates that the policy of such regulatory body is in any way inconsistent with the use of the normalization method of regulated accounting by such taxpayer or by a class of taxpayers of which such taxpayer is a member, or (
b
) a decision by a court having jurisdiction over such regulatory body which decision is in any way inconsistent with the use of the normalization method of regulated accounting by such taxpayer or a class of taxpayers of which such taxpayer is a member. The presumption shall be applicable on January 1, 1970, and shall, unless rebutted, be effective until an inconsistent expression of intent is indicated by such regulatory body or by such court. An example of
such an inconsistent expression of intent is the case of a regulatory body which has, after the July 1969 regulated accounting period and before January 1, 1970, directed public utilities subject to its ratemaking jurisdiction to use a flow-through method of regulated accounting, or has issued an order of general application which states that such agency will direct a class of public utilities of which the taxpayer is a member to use a flow-through method of regulated accounting. The presumption described in this subdivision may be rebutted by evidence that the flow-through method of regulated accounting is being used by the taxpayer with respect to such property.
(iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X is a calendar-year taxpayer and its “applicable 1968 method” is a straight line method of depreciation. Effective January 1, 1970, X began collecting rates which were based on a sum of the years-digits method of depreciation and a normalization method of regulated accounting which rates had been approved by a regulatory body having jurisdiction over X. On October 1, 1971, a court of proper jurisdiction annulled the rate order prospectively, which annulment was not appealed, on the basis that the regulatory body had abused its discretion by determining the rates on the basis of a normalization method of regulated accounting. As there was no inconsistent expression of intent during 1970 or prior to the due date of X's return for 1970, X's use of the sum of the years-digits method of depreciation for purposes of section 167 on such return was proper. For 1971, the presumption is in effect through September 30. During 1971, X may use the sum of the years-digits method of depreciation for purposes of section 167 from January 1 through September 30, 1971. After September 30, 1971, and for taxable years after 1971, X must use a straight line method of depreciation until the inconsistent court decision is no longer in effect.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that pursuant to the order of annulment, X was required to refund the portion of the rates attributable to the use of the normalization method of regulated accounting. As there was no inconsistent expression of intent during 1970 or prior to the due date of X's return for 1970, X has the benefit of the presumption with respect to its use of the sum of the years-digits method of depreciation for purposes of section 167, but because of the retroactive nature of the rate order X must file an amended return for 1970 using a straight line method of depreciation. As the inconsistent decision by the court was handed down prior to the due date of X's Federal income tax return for 1971, for 1971 and thereafter the presumption of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph does not apply. X must file its Federal income tax returns for such years using a straight line method of depreciation.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that the annulment order was stayed pending appeal of the decision to a court of proper appellate jurisdiction, X has the benefit of the presumption as described in example (2) for the year 1970, but for 1971 and thereafter the presumption of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph does not apply. Further, X must file an amended return for 1970 using a straight line method of depreciation and for 1971 and thereafter X must file its returns using a straight line method of depreciation unless X and the district director have consented in writing to extend the time for assessment of tax for 1970 and thereafter with respect to the issue of normalization method of regulated accounting for as long as may be necessary to allow for resolution of the appeal with respect to the annulment of the rate order.
(5)
Change in method of regulated accounting.
The taxpayer shall notify the district director of a change in its method of regulated accounting, an order by a regulatory body or court that such method be changed, or an interim or final rate determination by a regulatory body which determination is inconsistent with the method of regulated accounting used by the taxpayer immediately prior to the effective date of such rate determination. Such notification shall be made within 90 days of the date that the change in method, the order, or the determination is effective. In the case of a change in the method of regulated accounting, the taxpayer shall recompute its tax liability for any affected taxable year and such recomputation shall be made in the form of an amended return where necessary unless the taxpayer and the district director have consented in writing to extend the time for assessment of tax with respect to the issue of normalization method of regulated accounting.
(6)
Exclusion of normalization reserve from rate base.
(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a taxpayer does not use a normalization method of regulated accounting if, for ratemaking purposes,
the amount of the reserve for deferred taxes under section 167(l) which is excluded from the base to which the taxpayer's rate of return is applied, or which is treated as no-cost capital in those rate cases in which the rate of return is based upon the cost of capital, exceeds the amount of such reserve for deferred taxes for the period used in determining the taxpayer's tax expense in computing cost of service in such ratemaking.
(ii) For the purpose of determining the maximum amount of the reserve to be excluded from the rate base (or to be included as no-cost capital) under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, if solely an historical period is used to determine depreciation for Federal income tax expense for ratemaking purposes, then the amount of the reserve account for the period is the amount of the reserve (determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) at the end of the historical period. If solely a future period is used for such determination, the amount of the reserve account for the period is the amount of the reserve at the beginning of the period and a pro rata portion of the amount of any projected increase to be credited or decrease to be charged to the account during such period. If such determination is made by reference both to an historical portion and to a future portion of a period, the amount of the reserve account for the period is the amount of the reserve at the end of the historical portion of the period and a pro rata portion of the amount of any projected increase to be credited or decrease to be charged to the account during the future portion of the period. The pro rata portion of any increase to be credited or decrease to be charged during a future period (or the future portion of a part-historical and part-future period) shall be determined by multiplying any such increase or decrease by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the period at the time such increase or decrease is to be accrued, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the period (or future portion).
(iii) The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply in the case of a final determination of a rate case entered on or before May 31, 1973. For this purpose, a determination is final if all rights to request a review, a rehearing, or a redetermination by the regulatory body which makes such determination have been exhausted or have lapsed. The provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall not apply in the case of a rate case filed prior to June 7, 1974 for which a rate order is entered by a regulatory body having jurisdiction to establish the rates of the taxpayer prior to September 5, 1974, whether or not such order is final, appealable, or subject to further review or reconsideration.
(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X is exclusively engaged in the transportation of gas by pipeline subject to the jurisdiction of the Z Power Commission. With respect to its post-1969 public utility property, X is entitled under section 167(l)(2)(B) to use a method of depreciation other than a subsection (l) method if it uses a normalization method of regulated accounting. With respect to X the Z Power Commission for purposes of establishing cost of service uses a recent consecutive 12-month period ending not more than 4 months prior to the date of filing a rate case adjusted for certain known changes occurring within a 9-month period subsequent to the base period. X's rate case is filed on January 1, 1975. The year 1974 is the recorded test period for X's rate case and is the period used in determining X's tax expense in computing cost of service. The rates are contemplated to be in effect for the years 1975, 1976, and 1977. The adjustments for known changes relate only to wages and salaries. X's rate base at the end of 1974 is $145,000,000. The amount of the reserve for deferred taxes under section 167(l) at the end of 1974 is $1,300,000, and the reserve is projected to be $4,400,000 at the end of 1975, $6,500,000 at the end of 1976, and $9,800,000 at the end of 1977. X does not use a normalization method of regulated accounting if the Z Power Commission excludes more than $1,300,000 from the rate base to which X's rate of return is applied. Similarly, X does not use a normalization method of regulated accounting if, instead of the above, the Z Power Commission, in determining X's rate of return which is applied to the rate base, assigns to no-cost capital an amount that represents the reserve account for deferred tax that is greater than $1,300,000.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the adjustments for known changes in cost of service made by
the Z Power Commission include an additional depreciation expense that reflects the installation of new equipment put into service on January 1, 1975. Assume further that the reserve for deferred taxes under section 167(1) at the end of 1974 is $1,300,000 and that the monthly net increases for the first 9 months of 1975 are projected to be:
January 1-31
$310,000
February 1-28
300,000
March 1-31
300,000
April 1-30
280,000
May 1-31
270,000
June 1-30
260,000
July 1-31
260,000
August 1-31
250,000
September 1-30
240,000
$2,470,000
For its regulated books of account X accrues such increases as of the last day of the month but as a matter of convenience credits increases or charges decreases to the reserve account on the 15th day of the month following the whole month for which such increase or decrease is accrued. The maximum amount that may be excluded from the rate base is $2,470,879 (the amount in the reserve at the end of the historical portion of the period ($1,300,000) and a pro rata portion of the amount of any projected increase for the future portion of the period to be credited to the reserve ($1,170,879)). Such pro rata portion is computed (without regard to the date such increase will actually be posted to the account) as follows:
$310,000 × 243/273 =
$275,934
300,000 × 215/273 =
236,264
300,000 × 184/273 =
202,198
280,000 × 154/273 =
157,949
270,000 × 123/273 =
121,648
260,000 × 93/273 =
88,571
260,000 × 62/273 =
59,048
250,000 × 31/273 =
28,388
240,000 × 1/273=
879
$1,170,879

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that for purposes of establishing cost of service the Z Power Commission uses a future test year (1975). The rates are contemplated to be in effect for 1975, 1976, and 1977. Assume further that plant additions, depreciation expense, and taxes are projected to the end of 1975 and that the reserve for deferred taxes under section 167(l) is $1,300,000 for 1974 and is projected to be $4,400,000 at the end of 1975. Assume also that the Z Power Commission applies the rate of return to X's 1974 rate base of $145,000,000. X and the Z Power Commission through negotiation arrive at the level of approved rates. X uses a normalization method of regulated accounting only if the settlement agreement, the rate order, or record of the proceedings of the Z Power Commission indicates that the Z Power Commission did not exclude an amount representing the reserve for deferred taxes from X's rate base ($145,000,000) greater than $1,300,000 plus a pro rata portion of the projected increases and decreases that are to be credited or charged to the reserve account for 1975. Assume that for 1975 quarterly net increases are projected to be:
1st quarter
$910,000
2nd quarter
810,000
3rd quarter
750,000
4th quarter
630,000
Total
$3,100,000
For its regulated books of account X will accrue such increases as of the last day of the quarter but as a matter of convenience will credit increases or charge decreases to the reserve account on the 15th day of the month following the last month of the quarter for which such increase or decrease will be accrued. The maximum amount that may be excluded from the rate base is $2,591,480 (the amount of the reserve at the beginning of the period ($1,300,000) plus a pro rata portion ($1,291,480) of the $3,100,000 projected increase to be credited to the reserve during the period). Such portion is computed (without regard to the date such increase will actually be posted to the account) as follows:
$910,000 × 276/365=
$688,110
810,000 × 185/365=
410,548
750,000 × 93/365=
191,096
630,000 × 1/365=
1,726
$1,291,480
(i)
Flow-through method of regulated accounting.
Under section 167(l)(3)(H), a taxpayer uses a flow-through method of regulated accounting with respect to public utility property if it uses the same method of depreciation (other than a subsection (l) method) to compute its allowance for depreciation under section 167 and to compute its tax expense for purposes of reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account unless such method is the same method used by the taxpayer to determine its depreciation expense for purposes of reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the method of depreciation used by a taxpayer with respect to public utility property for purposes of determining cost of service for ratemaking purposes or rate base for ratemaking purposes shall not be considered in determining whether the taxpayer used a flow-through method of regulated accounting. A taxpayer may establish use of a flow-through method of regulated accounting in the same manner that
compliance with normalization requirements in respect of operating books of account may be established under paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
[T.D. 7315, 39 FR 20195, June 7, 1974]
§ 1.167(l)-2
Public utility property; election as to post-1969 property representing growth in capacity.
(a)
In general.
Section 167(l)(2) prescribes the methods of depreciation which may be used by a taxpayer with respect to its post-1969 public utility property. Under section 167(l)(2) (A) and (B) the taxpayer may use a subsection (l) method of depreciation (as defined in section 167(l)(3)(F)) or any other method of depreciation which is otherwise allowable under section 167 if, in conjunction with the use of such other method, such taxpayer uses the normalization method of accounting (as defined in section 167(l)(3)(G)). Paragraph (2)(C) of section 167(l) permits a taxpayer which used the flow-through method of accounting for its July 1969 accounting period (as these terms are defined in section 167(l)(3) (H) and (I), respectively) to use its applicable 1968 method of depreciation with respect to certain property. Section 167(l)(3)(D) describes the term “applicable 1968 method”. Accordingly, a regulatory agency is not precluded by section 167(l) from requiring such a taxpayer subject to its jurisdiction to continue to use the flow-through method of accounting unless the taxpayer makes the election pursuant to section 167(l)(4)(A) and this section. Whether or not the election is made, if such a regulatory agency permits the taxpayer to change from the flow-through method of accounting, subsection (l)(2) (A) or (B) would apply and such taxpayer could, subject to the provisions of section 167(e) and the regulations thereunder (relating to change in method), use a subsection (l) method of depreciation or, if the taxpayer uses the normalization method of accounting, any other method of depreciation otherwise allowable under section 167.
(1)
Election.
Under subparagraph (A) of section 167(l)(4), if the taxpayer so elects, the provisions of paragraph (2)(C) of section 167(l) shall not apply to its qualified public utility property (as such term is described in paragraph (b) of this section). In such case the taxpayer making the election shall use a method of depreciation prescribed by section 167(l)(2) (A) or (B) with respect to such property.
(2)
Property to which election shall apply.
(i) Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph the election provided by section 167(l)(4)(A) shall apply to all of the qualified public utility property of the taxpayer.
(ii) In the event that the taxpayer wishes the election provided by section 167(l)(4)(A) to apply to only a portion of its qualified public utility property, it must clearly identify the property to be subject to the election in the statement of election described in paragraph (e) of this section. Where all property which performs a certain function is included within the election, the election shall apply to all future acquisitions of qualified public utility property which perform the same function. Where only certain property within a functional group of property is included within the election, the election shall apply only to property which is of the same kind as the included property.
(iii) The provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation
A,
an electric utility company, wishes to have the election provided by section 167(l)(4)(A) apply only with respect to its production plant. A statement that the election shall apply only with respect to production plant will be sufficient to include within the election all of the taxpayer's qualified production plant of any kind. All public utility property of the taxpayer other than production plant will not be subject to the election.

# Example 2.
Corporation
B,
an electric utility company, wishes to have the election provided by section 167(l)(4)(A) apply only with respect to nuclear production plant. A statement which clearly indicates that only nuclear production plant will be included in the election will be sufficient to exclude from the election all public utility property other than nuclear production plant.
(b)
Qualified public utility property
—(1)
Definition.
For purposes of this section the term “qualified public utility property” means post-1969 public utility property to which section 167(l)(2)(C) applies, or would apply if the election described in section 167(l)(4)(A) had not
been made, to the extent that such property constitutes property which increases the productive or operational capacity of the taxpayer with respect to the goods or services described in section 167(l)(3)(A) and does not represent the replacement of existing capacity. In the event that particular assets which are post-1969 public utility property both replace existing public utility property and increase the productive or operational capacity of the taxpayer, only that portion of each such asset which is properly allocable, pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (3)(v) of this paragraph or paragraph (c)(2) of this section (as the case may be), to increasing the productive or operational capacity of the taxpayer shall be qualified public utility property.
(2)
Limitation on use of formula method.
A taxpayer which makes the election with respect to all of its post-1969 public utility property may determine the amount of its qualified public utility property by using the formula method described in paragraph (c) of this section or, where the taxpayer so chooses, it may use any other method based on engineering data which is satisfactory to the Commissioner. A taxpayer which chooses to include only a portion of its post-1969 public utility property in the election described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall, in a manner satisfactory to the Commissioner and consistent with the provisions of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, use a method based on engineering data. If a taxpayer uses the formula method described in paragraph (c) of this section, it must continue to use such method with respect to additions made in subsequent taxable years. The taxpayer may change from an engineering method to the formula method described in paragraph (c) of this section by filing a statement described in paragraph (h) of this section if it could have used such formula method for the prior taxable year.
(3)
Measuring capacity under an engineering method in the case of a general election.
(i) The provisions of this subparagraph apply in the case of an election made with respect to all of the post-1969 public utility property of the taxpayer.
(ii) A taxpayer which uses a method based on engineering data to determine the portion of its additions for a taxable year which constitutes qualified public utility property shall make such determination with reference to its “adjusted capacity” as of the first day of the taxable year during which such additions are placed in service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “adjusted capacity” means the taxpayer's capacity as of January 1, 1970, adjusted upward in the manner described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for each taxable year ending after December 31, 1969, and before the first day of the taxable year during which the additions described in the preceding sentence are placed in service.
(iii) The adjustment described in this subdivision for each taxable year shall be equal to the number of units of capacity by which additions for the taxable year of public utility property with respect to which the election had been made exceed the number of units of capacity of retirements for such taxable year of public utility property with respect to which the flow-through method of accounting was being used at the time of their retirement. If for any taxable year the computation in the preceding sentence results in a negative amount, such negative amount shall be taken into account as a reduction in the amount of the adjustment (computed without regard to this sentence) in succeeding taxable years.
(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following table which assumes that the taxpayer's adjusted capacity as of January 1, 1970, was 5,000 units:

Column 6 minus column 5.
(v) The qualified portion of the basis for depreciation (as defined in section 167(g)) of each asset or group of assets (if group or composite accounting is used by the taxpayer) subject to the election shall be determined using the following ratio:
Qualified portion of basis of asset ÷ Total basis of asset = Units of qualified additions computed in column 7 on chart ÷ Units of capacity of additions computed in column 2 on chart.
(c)
Formula method of determining amount of property subject to election
—(1)
In general.
The following formula method may be used to determine the amount of qualified public utility property:
Step 1.
Find the total cost (within the meaning of section 1012) to the taxpayer of additions during the taxable year of all post-1969 public utility property with respect to which section 167(l)(2)(C) would apply if the election had not been made.
Step 2.
Aggregate the cost (within the meaning of section 1012) to the taxpayer of all retirements during the taxable year of public utility property with respect to which the flow-through method of accounting was being used at the time of their retirement.
Step 3.
Subtract the figure reached in step 2 from the figure reached in step 1.
In the event that the figure reached in step 2 exceeds the figure reached in step 1 such excess shall be carried forward to the next taxable year and shall be aggregated with the cost (within the meaning of section 1012) to the taxpayer of all retirements referred to in step 2 for such next taxable year.
(2)
Allocation of bases.
The amount of qualified public utility property as determined in accordance with the formula method described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be allocated to the basis for depreciation (as defined in section 167(g)) of each asset or group of assets (if group or composite accounting is used by the taxpayer) subject to the election using the following ratio:
Amount of qualified additions computed in step 3 ÷ Amount of total additions computed in step 1 = Qualified portion of basis of asset ÷ Total basis of asset.
(d)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation
A,
a telephone company subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, elected, pursuant to the provisions of section 167(l)(4)(A) and this section, with respect to all of its qualified post-1969 public utility property to have the provisions of paragraph (2) (C) of section 167(l) not apply. In 1971 the Corporation added new underground cable with a cost (within the meaning of section 1012) to it of $4 million to its underground cable account. In the same year it retired public utility property with a cost (within the meaning of section 1012) to Corporation
A
of $1.5 million. The flow-through method of accounting was being used with respect to all of the retired property at the time of retirement. Using the formula method described in paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of qualified underground cable would be determined as follows:
Million
Step 1.
Aggregate cost of flow-through additions
$4.0
Step 2.
Cost of all flow-through retirements
1.5
Step 3.
Figure reached in step 1 less figure reached in step 2
2.5
The amount of qualified public utility property to which section 167(l)(2)(C) will not apply is $2.5 million. Pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount of qualified public utility property would be allocated to the basis for depreciation (as defined in section 167(g)) of an asset with a total basis for depreciation of $2 million as follows:
$2.5 million (figure in step 3)/$4 million (figure in step 1) = Qualified portion of basis of asset/$2 million Qualified portion of basis of asset = $1.25 million.

# Example 2.
In 1972 Corporation
A
(the corporation described in example (1)) added underground cable with a cost (within the meaning of section 1012) to it of $1 million. In the same year the cost (within the meaning of section 1012) to the corporation of retirements of public utility property with respect to which the flow-through method of accounting was being used was $3 million. There were no other additions or retirements. The amount of qualified public utility property would be determined as follows:
Million
Step 1.
Aggregate cost of flow-through additions
$1.0
Step 2.
Cost of all flow-through retirements

Since retirements of flow-through public utility property for the year 1972 exceeded additions made during such year, the excess retirements, $2.0 million, must be carried forward to be aggregated with retirements for 1973.

# Example 3.
Corporation
B,
a gas pipeline company subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, made the election provided by section 167(l)(4)(A) and this section with respect to all of its post-1969 public utility property. Corporation
B
chose to use an engineering data method of determining which property was subject to the election provided by this section. In 1970, the corporation replaced a portion of its pipeline with respect to which the flow-through method of accounting was being used at the time of its retirement which had a peak capacity on January 1, 1970, of 100,000 thousand cubic feet (M c.f.) per day at a pressure of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute (p.s.i.a.) with pipe with a capacity of 125,000 M c.f. per day at 14.73 p.s.i.a. Assuming that there were no other additions or retirements, using an engineering data method one-fifth of the new pipeline would be property subject to the election of this section effective for its taxable year beginning on January 1, 1971.

# Example 4.
In 1970 Corporation
C
(with the same characteristics as the corporation described in example (3)) extended its pipeline 5 miles further than it extended on January 1, 1970. Assuming that there were no other additions or retirements, the entire extension would be property subject to the election provided by this section effective for its taxable year beginning on January 1, 1971.

# Example 5.
As a result of a change of service areas between two corporations, in 1970 Corporation
D
(with the same characteristics as the corporation described in example (3)) retired a pipeline running north and south and replaced it with a pipeline of equal length and capacity running east and west. No part of the pipeline running east and west is property subject to the election.
(e)
Manner of making election.
The election described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made by filing, in duplicate, with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, D.C. 20224, Attention, T:I:E, a statement of such election.
(f)
Content of statement.
The statement described in paragraph (e) of this section shall indicate that an election is being made under section 167(l) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and it shall contain the following information:
(1) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer,
(2) Whether the taxpayer will use the formula method of determining the amount of its qualified public utility property described in paragraph (c) of this section, or an engineering method, and
(3) Where the taxpayer wishes to include only a portion of its public utility property in the election pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a description sufficient to clearly identify the property to be included.
(g)
Time for making election.
The election permitted by this section shall be made by filing the statement described in paragraph (e) of this section not later than Monday, June 29, 1970.
(h)
Change of method of determining amount of qualified property.
Where a taxpayer which has elected pursuant to the provisions of section 167(l)(4)(A) wishes to change, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, from an engineering data method of determining which of its property is qualified public utility property to the formula method described in paragraph (c) of this section, it may do so by filing a statement to that effect at the time that it files its income tax return, with the district director or director of the regional service center, with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed.
(i)
Revocability of election.
An election made under section 167(l) shall be irrevocable.
(j)
Effective date.
The election prescribed by section 167(l)(4)(A) and this section shall be effective for taxable
years beginning after December 31, 1970.

§ 1.167(l)-3
Multiple regulation, asset acquisitions, reorganizations, etc.
(a)
Property not entirely subject to jurisdiction of one regulatory body
—(1)
In general.
If a taxpayer which uses a method of depreciation other than a subsection (l) method of depreciation is required by a regulatory body having jurisdiction over less than all of its property to use, or not to use, a method of regulated accounting (
i.e.
, normalization or flow-through), such taxpayer shall be considered as using, or not using, such method of regulated accounting only with respect to property subject to the jurisdiction of such regulatory body. In the case of property which is contained in a multiple asset account, the provisions of § 1.167(a)-7(c) and § 1.167 (a)-11(c)(1)(iv) apply to prohibit depreciating a single account by two or more different methods.
(2)
Jurisdiction of regulatory body.
For purposes of this paragraph, a regulatory body is considered to have jurisdiction over property of a taxpayer if expenses with respect to the property are included in cost of service as determined by the regulatory body for ratemaking purposes or for reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account. For example, if regulatory body A, having jurisdiction over 60 percent of an item of X corporation's public utility property, required X to use the flow-through method of regulated accounting in circumstances which would bar X from using a method of depreciation under section 167(a) other than a subsection (l) method, and if regulatory body B, having jurisdiction over the remaining 40 percent of such item of property does not so require X to use the flow-through method of regulated accounting (or if the remaining 40 percent is not subject to the jurisdiction of any regulatory body), then with respect to 60 percent of the adjusted basis of the property X is prohibited from using a method of depreciation for purposes of section 167(a) other than a subsection (1) method. If in such example, A, having jurisdiction over 60 percent of X's public utility property, had jurisdiction over 100 percent of a particular generator, then with respect to the generator X would be prohibited from using a method of depreciation other than a subsection (l) method.
(3)
Public utility property subject to more than one regulatory body.
If a regulatory body having jurisdiction over public utility property with respect to the taxpayer's regulated books of account requires the taxpayer to reflect its tax expense in such books in the manner used by the regulatory body having jurisdiction over the public utility property for purposes of determining the taxpayer's cost of service for ratemaking purposes, the rules of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph shall apply.
(b)
Leasing transactions
—(1)
Leased property.
Public utility property as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1.167(l)-1 includes property which is leased by a taxpayer where the leasing of such property is part of the lessor's section 167(l) public utility activity. Thus, such leased property qualifies as public utility property even though the predominant use of such property by the lessee is in other than a section 167(l) public utility activity. Further, leased property qualifies as public utility property under section 167(l) even though the leasing is not part of the lessor's public utility activity if the predominant use of such property by the lessee or any sublessee is in a section 167(l) public utility activity. However, the limitations of section 167(l) apply to a taxpayer only if such taxpayer is subject to the jurisdiction of a regulatory body described in a section 167(l)(3)(A). For example, if a financial institution purchases property which it then leases to a lessee which uses such property predominantly in a section 167(l) public utility activity, the property qualifies as public utility property. However, because the financial institution's rates for leasing the property are not subject to the jurisdiction of a regulatory body described in section 167(l)(3)(A), the provisions of section 167(l) do not apply to the depreciation deductions taken with respect to
the property by the financial institution. For possible application of section 167(l) to the lessee, see subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(2)
Certain rental payments.
Under section 167(l)(5), if a taxpayer leases property which is public utility property and the regulatory body having jurisdiction over such property for purposes of determining the taxpayer's operating results in its regulated books of account or for ratemaking purposes allows only an amount of such lessee's expenses with respect to the lease which is less than the amount which the taxpayer deducts for purposes of its Federal income tax liability, then a portion of the difference between such amounts shall not be allowed as a deduction by the taxpayer for purposes of its Federal income tax liability in such manner and time as the Commissioner or his delegate may determine consistent with the principles of § 1.167(l)-1 and this section applicable as to when a method of depreciation other than a subsection (1) method may be used for purposes of section 167(a).
(c)
Certain partnership arrangements.
Under section 167(l)(5), if property held by a partnership is not public utility property in the hands of the partnership but would be public utility property if an election was made under section 761 to be excluded from partnership treatment, then section 167(l) shall be applied by treating the partners as directly owning the property in proportion to their partnership interests.
(d)
Cross reference.
See § 1.167(l)-1(c)(1) for treatment of certain property as “pre-1970 public utility property” and § 1.167(l)-1(e)(4)(ii) for applicable 1968 method in the case of property acquired in certain transactions.

(a)
Application of section 167(l) to certain property subject to asset depreciation range system.

(ii) The provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section do not apply to any taxpayer who did not use the RRB method of depreciation under section 167 as of December 31, 1980. In such case, RRB replacement property placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1980, shall be treated as other 5-year recovery property under section 168.
(2)
RRB replacement property placed in service after December 31, 1984.
RRB replacement property placed in service
after December 31, 1984, is treated as other 5-year recovery property under section 168.
(3)
RRB replacement property defined.
RRB replacement property, for purposes of section 168, means replacement track material (including rail, ties, other track material, and ballast) installed by a railroad (including a railroad switching or terminal company) if—
(i) The replacement is made pursuant to a scheduled program for replacement.
(ii) The replacement is made pursuant to observations by maintenance-of-way personnel of specific track material needing replacement.
(iii) The replacement is made pursuant to the detection by a rail-test car of specific track material needing replacement, or
(iv) The replacement is made as a result of a casualty.
Replacements made as a result of a casualty shall be RRB replacement property only to the extent that, in the case of each casualty, the replacement cost with respect to the replacement track material exceeds $50,000.
(4)
Recovery of adjusted basis of RRB property as of December 31, 1980.
The taxpayer shall recover the adjusted basis of RRB property (as defined in section 168(g)(6)) as of December 31, 1980, over a period of not less than 5 years and not more than 50 years, using a rate of recovery consistent with any method described in section 167(b), including the method described in section 167(b)(2), switching to the method described in section 167(b)(3) at a time to maximize the deduction. For purposes of determining the recovery allowance under this subparagraph, salvage value shall be disregarded and, in the case of a taxpayer that depreciated RRB property placed in service before January 1, 1981, using the RRB method consistently for all periods after February 28, 1913, the adjusted basis of RRB property is the adjusted basis for purposes of determining the deduction for retirements under the RRB method, with no adjustment for depreciation sustained prior to March 1, 1913.
(5)
RRB property (which is not RRB replacement property) placed in service after December 31, 1980.
Property placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1980, which is not RRB replacement property and which, under the taxpayer's method of depreciation as of December 31, 1980, would have been depreciated by the taxpayer under the RRB method, is treated as other property under section 168.
(b)-(f) [Reserved]
[T.D. 8116, 51 FR 46619, Dec. 24, 1986]
§ 1.168(a)-1
Modified accelerated cost recovery system.
(a) Section 168 determines the depreciation allowance for tangible property that is of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167(a) and that is placed in service after December 31, 1986 (or after July 31, 1986, if the taxpayer made an election under section 203(a)(1)(B) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986; 100 Stat. 2143). Except for property excluded from the application of section 168 as a result of section 168(f) or as a result of a transitional rule, the provisions of section 168 are mandatory for all eligible property. The allowance for depreciation under section 168 constitutes the amount of depreciation allowable under section 167(a). The determination of whether tangible property is property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation is made under section 167 and the regulations under section 167.
(b) This section is applicable on and after February 27, 2004.

[T.D. 8444, 57 FR 48981, Oct. 29, 1992]
§ 1.168(d)-1
Applicable conventions—half-year and mid-quarter conventions.
(a)
In general.
Under section 168(d), the half-year convention applies to depreciable property (other than certain real property described in section 168(d)(2)) placed in service during a taxable year, unless the mid-quarter convention applies to the property. Under section 168(d)(3)(A), the mid-quarter convention applies to depreciable property (other than certain real property described in section 168(d)(2)) placed in service during a taxable year if the aggregate basis of property placed in service during the last three months of the taxable year exceeds 40 percent of the aggregate basis of property placed in service during the taxable year (“the 40-percent test”). Thus, if the depreciable property is placed in service during a taxable year that consists of three months or less, the mid-quarter convention applies to the property. Under section 168(d)(3)(b)(i), the depreciable basis of nonresidential real property, residential rental property, and any railroad grading or tunnel bore is disregarded in applying the 40-percent test. For rules regarding property that is placed in service and disposed of in the same taxable year, see paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For the definition of “aggregate basis of property,” see paragraph (b)(4) if this section.
(b)
Additional rules for determining whether the mid-quarter convention applies and for applying the applicable convention
—(1)
Property described in section 168(f).
In determining whether the 40-percent test is testified for a taxable year, the depreciable basis of property described in section 168(f) (property to which section 168 does not apply) is not taken into account.
(2)
Listed property.
The depreciable basis of listed property (as defined in section 280F(d)(4) and the regulations thereunder) placed in service during a taxable year is taken into account (unless otherwise excluded) in applying the 40-percent test.
(3)
Property placed in service and disposed of in the same taxable year.
(i) Under section 168(d)(3)(B)(ii), the depreciable basis of property placed in service and disposed of in the same taxable year is not taken into account in determining whether the 40-percent test is satisfied. However, the depreciable basis of property placed in service, disposed of, subsequently reacquired, and again placed in service, by the taxpayer in the same taxable year must be taken into account in applying the 40-percent test, but the basis of the property is only taken into account on the later of the dates that the property is placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year. Further, see §§ 1.168(i)-6(c)(4)(v)(B) and 1.168(i)-6(f) for rules relating to property placed in service and exchanged or involuntarily converted during the same taxable year.
(ii) The applicable convention, as determined under this section, applies to all depreciable property (except nonresidential real property, residential rental property, and any railroad grading or tunnel bore) placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year, excluding property placed in service and disposed of in the same taxable
year. However, see §§ 1.168(i)-6(c)(4)(v)(A) and 1.168(i)-6(f) for rules relating to MACRS property that has a basis determined under section 1031(d) or section 1033(b). No depreciation deduction is allowed for property placed in service and disposed of during the same taxable year. However, see § 1.168(k)-1(f)(1) for rules relating to qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property, and § 1.1400L(b)-1(f)(1) for rules relating to qualified New York Liberty Zone property, that is placed in service by the taxpayer in the same taxable year in which either a partnership is terminated as a result of a technical termination under section 708(b)(1)(B) or the property is transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7). Further, see § 1.168(k)-2(g)(1) for rules relating to qualified property under section 168(k), as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Public Law 115-97 (131 Stat. 2054 (December 22, 2017)), that is placed in service by the taxpayer in the same taxable year in which either a partnership is terminated as a result of a technical termination under section 708(b)(1)(B) or the property is transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7).
(4)
Aggregate basis of property.
For purposes of the 40-percent test, the term “aggregate basis of property” means the sum of the depreciable bases of all items of depreciable property that are taken into account in applying the 40-percent test. “Depreciable basis” means the basis of depreciable property for purposes of determining gain under sections 1011 through 1024. The depreciable basis for the taxable year the property is placed in service reflects the reduction in basis for—
(i) Any portion of the basis the taxpayer properly elects to treat as an expense under section 179;
(ii) Any adjustment to basis under section 48(q); and
(iii) The percentage of the taxpayer's use of the property for the taxable year other than in the taxpayer's trade or business (or for the production of income), but is determined before any reduction for depreciation under section 167(a) for that taxable year.
(5)
Special rules for affiliated groups
—(i) In the case of a consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1(h)), all members of the group that are included on the consolidated return are treated as one taxpayer for purposes of applying the 40-percent test. Thus, the depreciable bases of all property placed in service by members of a consolidated group during a consolidated return year are taken into account (unless otherwise excluded) in applying the 40-percent test to determine whether the mid-quarter convention applies to property placed in service by the members during the consolidated return year. The 40-percent test is applied separately to the depreciable bases of property placed in service by any member of an affiliated group that is not included in a consolidated return of the taxable year in which the property is placed in service.
(ii) In the case of a corporation formed by a member or members of a consolidated group and that is itself a member of the consolidated group (“newly-formed subsidiary”), the depreciable bases of property placed in service by the newly-formed subsidiary in the consolidated return year in which it is formed is included with the depreciable bases of property placed in service during the consolidated return year by the other members of the consolidated group in applying the 40-percent test. If depreciable property is placed in service by a newly-formed subsidiary during the consolidated return year in which it was formed, the newly-formed subsidiary is considered as being in existence for the entire consolidated return year for purposes of applying the applicable convention to determine when the recovery period begins.
(iii) The provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
Assume a member of a consolidated group that files its return on a calendar-year basis forms a subsidiary on August 1. The subsidiary places depreciable property in service on August 5. If the mid-quarter convention applies to property placed in service by the members of the consolidated group (including the newly-formed subsidiary), the property placed in service by the subsidiary on August 5 is deemed placed in service on the mid-point of the third quarter of the consolidated return year (
i.e.,
August 15). If the mid-quarter convention does
not apply, the property is deemed placed in service on the mid-point of the consolidated return year (
i.e.,
July 1).
(iv) In the case of a corporation that joins or leaves a consolidated group, the depreciable bases of property placed in service by the corporation joining or leaving the group during the portion of the consolidated return year that the corporation is a member of the consolidated group is included with the depreciable bases of property placed in service during the consolidated return year by the other members in applying the 40-percent test. The depreciable bases of property placed in service by the joining or leaving member in the taxable year before it joins or after it leaves the consolidated group is not taken into account by the consolidated group in applying the 40-percent test for the consolidated return year. If a corporation leaves a consolidated group and joins another consolidated group, each consolidated group takes into account, in applying the 40-percent test, the depreciable bases of property placed in service by the corporation while a member of the group.
(v) The provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
Assume Corporations A and B file a consolidated return on a calendar-year basis. Corporation C, also a calendar-year taxpayer, enters the consolidated group on July 1 and is included on the consolidated return for that taxable year. The depreciable bases of property placed in service by C during the period of July 1 to December 31 is included with the depreciable bases of property placed in service by A and B during the entire consolidated return year in applying the 40-percent test. The depreciable bases of property placed in service by C from January 1 to June 30 is not taken into account by the consolidated group in applying the 40-percent test. If C was a member of another consolidated group during the period from January 1 to June 30, that consolidated group would include the depreciable bases of property placed in service by C during that period.
(vi) A corporation that joins or leaves a consolidated group during a consolidated year is considered as being a member of the consolidated group for the entire consolidated return year for purposes of applying the applicable convention to determine when the recovery period begins for depreciable property placed in service by the corporation during the portion of the consolidated return year that the corporation is a member of the group.
(vii) If depreciable property is placed in service by a corporation in the taxable year ending immediately before it joins a consolidated group or beginning immediately after it leaves a consolidated group, the applicable convention is applied to the property under either the full taxable year rules or the short taxable year rules, as applicable.
(viii) The provisions of paragraphs (d)(5)(vi) and (vii) of this section are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
Assume that on July 1, C, a calendar-return corporation, joins a consolidated group that files a return on a calendar-year basis. The short taxable year rules apply to C for the period of January 1 to June 30. However, in applying the applicable convention to determine when the recovery period begins for depreciable property placed in service for the period of July 1 to December 31, C is considered as being a member of the consolidated group for the entire consolidated return year. Thus, if the half-year convention applies to depreciable property placed in service by the consolidated group (taking into account the depreciable bases of property placed in service by C after June 30), the property is deemed placed in service on the mid-point of the consolidated return year (
i.e.,
July 1, if the group did not have a short taxable year).
(ix) In the case of a transfer of depreciable property between members of a consolidated group, the following special rules apply for purposes of applying the 40-percent test. Property that is placed in service by one member of a consolidated group and transferred to another member of the same group is considered as placed in service on the date that it is placed in service by the transferor member, and the date it is placed in service by the transferee member is disregarded. In the case of multiple transfers of property between members of a consolidated group, the property is considered as placed in service on the date that the first member places the property in service, and the dates it is placed in service by
other members are disregarded. The depreciable basis of the transferred property that is taken into account in applying the 40-percent test is the depreciable basis of the property in the hands of the transferor member (as determined under paragraph (b)(4) of this section), or, in the case of multiple transfers of property between members, the depreciable basis in the hands of the first member that placed the property in service.
(x) The provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(ix) of this section are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
Assume the ABC consolidated group files its return on a calendar-year basis. A, a member of the consolidated group, purchases depreciable property costing $50,000 and places the property in service on January 5, 1991. On December 1, 1991, the property is transferred for $75,000 to B, another member of the consolidated group. In applying the 40-percent test to the members of the consolidated group for 1991, the property is considered as placed in service on January 5, the date that A placed the property in service, and the depreciable basis of the property that is taken into account is $50,000.
(6)
Special rule for partnerships and S corporations.
In the case of property placed in service by a partnership or an S corporation, the 40-percent test is generally applied at the partnership or corporate level. However, if a partnership or an S corporation is formed or availed of for the principal purpose of either avoiding the application of the mid-quarter convention or having the mid-quarter convention apply where it otherwise would not, the 40-percent test is applied at the partner, shareholder, or other appropriate level.
(7)
Certain nonrecognition transaction
—(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, if depreciable property is transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B)(i) (other than in a transaction between members of a consolidated group) in the same taxable year that the property is placed in service by the transferor, the 40-percent test is applied by treating the transferred property as placed in service by the transferee on the date of transfer. Thus, if the aggregate basis of property (including the transferred property) placed in service by the transferee during the last three months of its taxable year exceeds 40 percent of the aggregate basis of property (including the transferred property) placed in service by the transferee during the taxable year, the mid-quarter convention applies to the transferee's depreciable property, including the transferred property. The depreciable basis of the transferred property is not taken into account by the transferor in applying the 40-percent test for the taxable year that the transferor placed the property in service.
(ii) In applying the applicable convention to determine when the recovery period for the transferred property begins, the date on which the transferor placed the property in service must be used. Thus, for example, if the mid-quarter convention applies, the recovery period for the transferred property begins on the mid-point of the quarter of the taxable year that the transferor placed the property in service. If the transferor placed the transferred property in service in a short taxable year, then for purposes of applying the applicable convention and allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee, the transferor is treated as having a full 12-month taxable year commencing on the first day of the short taxable year. The depreciation deduction for the transferor's taxable year in which the property was placed in service is allocated between the transferor and the transferee based on the number of months in the transferor's taxable year that each party held the property in service. For purposes of allocating the depreciation deduction, the transferor takes into account the month in which the property was placed in service but does not take into account the month in which the property was transferred. The transferee is allocated the remaining portion of the depreciation deduction for the transferor's taxable year in which the property was transferred. For the remainder of the transferee's current taxable year (if the transferee has a different taxable year than the transferor) and for subsequent taxable years, the depreciation deduction for the transferee is calculated by allocating to the transferee's taxable year the depreciation attributable to
each recovery year, or portion thereof, that falls within the transferee's taxable year. However, see § 1.168(k)-2(g)(1)(iii) for a special rule regarding the allocation of the additional first year depreciation deduction in the case of certain contributions of property to a partnership under section 721.
(iii) If the applicable convention for the transferred property has not been determined by the time the transferor files its income tax return for the year of transfer because the transferee's taxable year has not ended, the transferor may use either the mid-quarter or the half-year convention in determining the depreciation deduction for the property. However, the transferor must specify on the depreciation form filed for the taxable year that the applicable convention has not been determined for the property. If the transferee determines that a different convention applies to the transferred property, the transferor should redetermine the depreciation deduction on the property, and, within the period of limitation, should file an amended income tax return for the taxable year and pay any additional tax due plus interest.
(iv) The provisions of the paragraph (b)(7) are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
(i) During 1991, C, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases satellite equipment costing $100,000, and computer equipment costing $15,000. The satellite equipment is placed in service in January, and the computer equipment in February. On October 1, C transfers the computer equipment to Z Partnership in a transaction described in section 721. During 1991, Z, a calendar-year partnership, purchases 30 office desks for a total of $15,000. The desks are placed in service in June. These are the only items of depreciable property placed in service by C and Z during 1991.
(ii) In applying the 40-percent test, because C transferred the computer equipment in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B)(i) in the same taxable year that C placed it in service, the computer equipment is treated as placed in service by the transferee, Z, on the date of transfer, October 1. The 40-percent test is satisfied with respect to Z, because the computer equipment is placed in service during the last three months of Z's taxable year and its basis ($15,000) exceeds 40 percent of the aggregate basis of property placed in service by Z during the taxable year (desks and computer equipment with an aggregate basis of $30,000).
(iii) In applying the mid-quarter convention to determine when the computer equipment is deemed to be placed in service, the date on which C placed the property in service is used. Accordingly, because C placed the computer equipment in service during the first quarter of its taxable year, the computer equipment is deemed placed in service on February 15, 1991, the mid-point of the first quarter of C's taxable year. The depreciation deduction allowable for C's 1991 taxable year, $5,250 ($15,000 × 40 percent × 10.
5/12
), is allocated between C and Z based on the number of months in C's taxable year that C and Z held the property in service. Thus, because the property was in service for 11 months during C's 1991 taxable year and C held it for 8 of those 11 months, C is allocated $3,818 (
8/11
× $5,250). Z is allocated $1,432, the remaining
3/11
of the $5,250 depreciation deduction for C's 1991 taxable year. For 1992, Z's depreciation deduction for the computer equipment is $3,900, the sum of the remaining 1.5 months of depreciation deduction for the first recovery year and 10.5 months of depreciation deduction for the second recovery year (($15,000 × 40 percent × 1.
5/12
) + ($9,000 × 40 [percent × 10.
5/12
)).
(c)
Disposition of property subject to the half-year or mid-quarter convention
—(1)
In general.
If depreciable property is subject to the half-year (or mid-quarter) convention in the taxable year in which it is placed in service, it also is subject to the half-year (or mid-quarter) convention in the taxable year in which it is disposed of.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
In October 1991, B, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and places in service a light general purpose truck costing $10,000. B does not elect to expense any part of the cost of the truck, and this is the only item of depreciable property placed in service by B during 1991. The 40-percent test is satisfied and the mid-quarter convention applies, because the truck is placed in service during the last three months of the taxable year and no other assets are placed in service in that year. In April 1993 (prior to the end of the truck's recovery period), B sells the truck. The mid-quarter convention applies in determining the depreciation deduction for the truck in 1993, the year of disposition.
(d)
Effective dates
—(1)
In general.
This section applies to depreciable property placed in service in taxable years ending after January 30, 1991. For depreciable property placed in service after
December 31, 1986, in taxable years ending on or before January 30, 1991, a taxpayer may use a method other than the method provided in this section in applying the 40-percent test and the applicable convention, provided the method is reasonable and is consistently applied to the taxpayer's property.
(2)
Qualified property, 50-percent bonus depreciation property, or qualified New York Liberty Zone property.
This section also applies to qualified property under section 168(k)(2) or qualified New York Liberty Zone property under section 1400L(b) acquired by a taxpayer after September 10, 2001, and to 50-percent bonus depreciation property under section 168(k)(4) acquired by a taxpayer after May 5, 2003. The last sentences in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(7)(ii) of this section apply to qualified property under section 168(k)(2) placed in service by a taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that includes September 24, 2019. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply the last sentences in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(7)(ii) of this section to qualified property under section 168(k)(2) acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer during taxable years ending on or after September 28, 2017. A taxpayer may rely on the last sentences in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(7)(ii) of this section in regulation project REG-104397-18 (2018-41 I.R.B. 558) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter) for qualified property under section 168(k)(2) acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer during taxable years ending on or after September 28, 2017, and ending before the taxpayer's taxable year that includes September 24, 2019.
(3)
Like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions.
The last sentence in paragraph (b)(3)(i) and the second sentence in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section apply to exchanges to which section 1031 applies, and involuntary conversions to which section 1033 applies, of MACRS property for which the time of disposition and the time of replacement both occur after February 27, 2004.
[T.D. 8444, 57 FR 48981, Oct. 29, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9091, 68 FR 52991, Sept. 8, 2003; T.D. 9115, 69 FR 9533, Mar. 1, 2004; T.D. 9283, 71 FR 51737, Aug. 31, 2006; T.D. 9314, 72 FR 9248, Mar. 1, 2007; T.D. 9874, 84 FR 50127, Sept. 24, 2019]
§ 1.168(h)-1
Like-kind exchanges involving tax-exempt use property.
(a)
Scope.
(1) This section applies with respect to a direct or indirect transfer of property among related persons, including transfers made through a qualified intermediary (as defined in § 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)) or other unrelated person, (a transfer) if—
(i) Section 1031 applies to any party to the transfer or to any related transaction; and
(ii) A principal purpose of the transfer or any related transaction is to avoid or limit the application of the alternative depreciation system (within the meaning of section 168(g)).
(2) For purposes of this section, a person is related to another person if they bear a relationship specified in section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1).
(b)
Allowable depreciation deduction for property subject to this section
—(1)
In general.
Property (tainted property) transferred directly or indirectly to a taxpayer by a related person (related party) as part of, or in connection with, a transaction in which the related party receives tax-exempt use property (related tax-exempt use property) will, if the tainted property is subject to an allowance for depreciation, be treated in the same manner as the related tax-exempt use property for purposes of determining the allowable depreciation deduction under section 167(a). Under this paragraph (b), the tainted property is depreciated by the taxpayer over the remaining recovery period of, and using the same depreciation method and convention as that of, the related tax-exempt use property.
(2)
Limitations
—(i)
Taxpayer's basis in related tax-exempt use property.
The rules of this paragraph (b) apply only with respect to so much of the taxpayer's basis in the tainted property as does not exceed the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the related tax-exempt use
property prior to the transfer. Any excess of the taxpayer's basis in the tainted property over its adjusted basis in the related tax-exempt use property prior to the transfer is treated as property to which this section does not apply. This paragraph (b)(2)(i) does not apply if the related tax-exempt use property is not acquired from the taxpayer (e.g., if the taxpayer acquires the tainted property for cash but section 1031 nevertheless applies to the related party because the transfer involves a qualified intermediary).
(ii)
Application of section 168(i)(7).
This section does not apply to so much of the taxpayer's basis in the tainted property as is subject to section 168(i)(7).
(c)
Related tax-exempt use property.
(1) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, related tax-exempt use property includes—
(i) Property that is tax-exempt use property (as defined in section 168(h)) at the time of the transfer; and
(ii) Property that does not become tax-exempt use property until after the transfer if, at the time of the transfer, it was intended that the property become tax-exempt use property.
(2) For purposes of determining the remaining recovery period of the related tax-exempt use property in the circumstances described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the related tax-exempt use property will be treated as having, prior to the transfer, a lease term equal to the term of any lease that causes such property to become tax-exempt use property.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section. The examples do not address common law doctrines or other authorities that may apply to recharacterize or alter the effects of the transactions described therein. Unless otherwise indicated, parties to the transactions are not related to one another.

# Example 1.
(i) X owns all of the stock of two subsidiaries, B and Z. X, B and Z do not file a consolidated federal income tax return. On May 5, 1995, B purchases an aircraft (
FA
) for $1 million and leases it to a foreign airline whose income is not subject to United States taxation and which is a tax-exempt entity as defined in section 168(h)(2). On the same date, Z owns an aircraft (
DA
) with a fair market value of $1 million, which has been, and continues to be, leased to an airline that is a United States taxpayer. Z's adjusted basis in DA is $0. The next day, at a time when each aircraft is still worth $1 million, B transfers FA to Z (subject to the lease to the foreign airline) in exchange for DA (subject to the lease to the airline that is a United States taxpayer). Z realizes gain of $1 million on the exchange, but that gain is not recognized pursuant to section 1031(a) because the exchange is of like-kind properties. Assume that a principal purpose of the transfer of DA to B or of FA to Z is to avoid the application of the alternative depreciation system. Following the exchange, Z has a $0 basis in FA pursuant to section 1031(d). B has a $1 million basis in DA.
(ii) B has acquired property from Z, a related person; Z's gain is not recognized pursuant to section 1031(a); Z has received tax-exempt use property as part of the transaction; and a principal purpose of the transfer of DA to B or of FA to Z is to avoid the application of the alternative depreciation system. Accordingly, the transaction is within the scope of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, B must recover its $1 million basis in DA over the remaining recovery period of, and using the same depreciation method and convention as that of, FA, the related tax-exempt use property.
(iii) If FA did not become tax-exempt use property until after the exchange, it would still be related tax-exempt use property and paragraph (b) of this section would apply if, at the time of the exchange, it was intended that FA become tax-exempt use property.

# Example 2.
(i) X owns all of the stock of two subsidiaries, B and Z. X, B and Z do not file a consolidated federal income tax return. B and Z each own identical aircraft. B's aircraft (
FA
) is leased to a tax-exempt entity as defined in section 168(h)(2) and has a fair market value of $1 million and an adjusted basis of $500,000. Z's aircraft (
DA
) is leased to a United States taxpayer and has a fair market value of $1 million and an adjusted basis of $10,000. On May 1, 1995, B and Z exchange aircraft, subject to their respective leases. B realizes gain of $500,000 and Z realizes gain of $990,000, but neither person recognizes gain because of the operation of section 1031(a). Moreover, assume that a principal purpose of the transfer of DA to B or of FA to Z is to avoid the application of the alternative depreciation system.
(ii) As in
Example 1,
B has acquired property from Z, a related person; Z's gain is not recognized pursuant to section 1031(a); Z has received tax-exempt use property as part of the transaction; and a principal purpose of the transfer of DA to B or of FA to Z is to avoid the application of the alternative depreciation system. Thus, the transaction is within the scope of this section even though B has held tax-exempt use property for a period of time and, during that time, has used
the alternative depreciation system with respect to such property. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, B, which has a substituted basis determined pursuant to section 1031(d) of $500,000 in DA, must depreciate the aircraft over the remaining recovery period of FA, using the same depreciation method and convention. Z holds tax-exempt use property with a basis of $10,000, which must be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2,
except that B and Z are members of an affiliated group that files a consolidated federal income tax return. Of B's $500,000 basis in DA, $10,000 is subject to section 168(i)(7) and therefore not subject to this section. The remaining $490,000 of basis is subject to this section. But see § 1.1502-80(f) making section 1031 inapplicable to intercompany transactions occurring in consolidated return years beginning on or after July 12, 1995.
(e)
Effective date.
This section applies to transfers made on or after April 20, 1995.

(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(1)
Unadjusted depreciable basis
has the same meaning given such term in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3).
(2)
Unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account
is the sum of the unadjusted depreciable bases of all assets included in the general asset account.
(3)
Adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account
is the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account less the adjustments to basis described in section 1016(a)(2) and (3).

Building
has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.48-1(e)(1).
(5)
Expensed cost
is the amount of any allowable credit or deduction treated as a deduction allowable for depreciation or amortization for purposes of section 1245 (for example, a credit allowable under section 30 or a deduction allowable under section 179, section 179A, or section 190). Expensed cost does not include any additional first year depreciation deduction.
(6)
Mass assets
is a mass or group of individual items of depreciable assets—
(i) That are not necessarily homogenous;
(ii) Each of which is minor in value relative to the total value of the mass or group;

—(1)
Assets eligible for general asset accounts
—(i)
General rules.
Assets that are subject to either the general depreciation system of section 168(a) or the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) may be accounted for in one or more general asset accounts. An asset is included in a general asset account only to the extent of the asset's unadjusted depreciable basis. However, an asset is not to be included in a general asset account if the asset is used both in a trade or business or for the production of income and in a personal activity at any time during the taxable year in which the asset is placed in service by the taxpayer or if the asset is placed in service and disposed of during the same taxable year.
(ii)
Special rules for assets generating foreign source income.
(A) Assets that generate foreign source income, both United States and foreign source income, or combined gross income of a foreign sales corporation (as defined in former section 922), domestic international sales corporation (as defined in section 992(a)), or possession corporation (as defined in section 936) and its related supplier may be included in a general asset account if the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section are satisfied. If, however, the inclusion of these assets in a general asset account results in a substantial distortion of income, the Commissioner may disregard the general asset account election and make any reallocations of income or expense necessary to clearly reflect income.
(B) A general asset account shall be treated as a single asset for purposes of applying the rules in § 1.861-9T(g)(3) (relating to allocation and apportionment of interest expense under the asset
method). A general asset account that generates income in more than one grouping of income (statutory and residual) is a multiple category asset (as defined in § 1.861-9T(g)(3)(ii)), and the income yield from the general asset account must be determined by applying the rules for multiple category assets as if the general asset account were a single asset.
(2)
Grouping assets in general asset accounts
—(i)
General rules.
If a taxpayer makes the election under paragraph (l) of this section, assets that are subject to the election are grouped into one or more general asset accounts. Assets that are eligible to be grouped into a single general asset account may be divided into more than one general asset account. Each general asset account must include only assets that—
(A) Have the same applicable depreciation method;
(B) Have the same applicable recovery period;
(C) Have the same applicable convention; and
(D) Are placed in service by the taxpayer in the same taxable year.
(ii)
Special rules.
In addition to the general rules in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the following rules apply when establishing general asset accounts—
(A) Assets subject to the mid-quarter convention may only be grouped into a general asset account with assets that are placed in service in the same quarter of the taxable year;
(B) Assets subject to the mid-month convention may only be grouped into a general asset account with assets that are placed in service in the same month of the taxable year;
(C) Passenger automobiles for which the depreciation allowance is limited under section 280F(a) must be grouped into a separate general asset account;
(D) Assets not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction, including assets for which the taxpayer elected not to deduct the additional first year depreciation, provided by, for example, section 168(k), section 168(l), section 168(m), section 168(n), section 1400L(b), or section 1400N(d), must be grouped into a separate general asset account;
(E) Assets eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction may only be grouped into a general asset account with assets for which the taxpayer claimed the same percentage of the additional first year depreciation (for example, 30 percent, 50 percent, or 100 percent);
(F) Except for passenger automobiles described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, listed property (as defined in section 280F(d)(4)) must be grouped into a separate general asset account;
(G) Assets for which the depreciation allowance for the placed-in-service year is not determined by using an optional depreciation table (for further guidance, see section 8 of Rev. Proc. 87-57, 1987-2 CB 687, 693 (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter)) must be grouped into a separate general asset account;
(H) Mass assets that are or will be subject to paragraph (j)(2)(i)(D) of this section (disposed of or converted mass asset is identified by a mortality dispersion table) must be grouped into a separate general asset account; and
(I) Assets subject to paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section (change in use results in a shorter recovery period or a more accelerated depreciation method) for which the depreciation allowance for the year of change (as defined in § 1.168(i)-4(a)) is not determined by using an optional depreciation table must be grouped into a separate general asset account.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c):

# Example 1.
In 2014, J, a proprietorship with a calendar year-end, purchases and places in service one item of equipment that costs $550,000. This equipment is section 179 property and also is 5-year property under section 168(e). On its Federal tax return for 2014, J makes an election under section 179 to expense $25,000 of the equipment's cost and makes an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include the equipment in a general asset account. As a result, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the equipment is $525,000. In accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, J must include only $525,000 of the equipment's cost in the general asset account.

# Example 2.
In 2014, K, a proprietorship with a calendar year-end, purchases and places in service 100 items of equipment. All of these items are 5-year property under section
168(e), are not listed property, and are not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction. On its Federal tax return for 2014, K does not make an election under section 179 to expense the cost of any of the 100 items of equipment and does make an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include the 100 items of equipment in a general asset account. K depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2014 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. In accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, K includes all of the 100 items of equipment in one general asset account.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that K decides not to include all of the 100 items of equipment in one general asset account. Instead and in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, K establishes 100 general asset accounts and includes one item of equipment in each general asset account.

# Example 4.
L, a calendar-year corporation, is a wholesale distributer. In 2014, L places in service the following properties for use in its wholesale distribution business: Computers, automobiles, and forklifts. On its Federal tax return for 2014, L does not make an election under section 179 to expense the cost of any of these items of equipment and does make an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include all of these items of equipment in a general asset account. All of these items are 5-year property under section 168(e) and are not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction. The computers are listed property, and the automobiles are listed property and are subject to section 280F(a). L depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2014 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. Although the computers, automobiles, and forklifts are 5-year property, L cannot include all of them in one general asset account because the computers and automobiles are listed property. Further, even though the computers and automobiles are listed property, L cannot include them in one general asset account because the automobiles also are subject to section 280F(a). In accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, L establishes three general asset accounts: One for the computers, one for the automobiles, and one for the forklifts.

# Example 5.
M, a fiscal-year corporation with a taxable year ending June 30, purchases and places in service ten items of new equipment in October 2014, and purchases and places in service five other items of new equipment in February 2015. On its Federal tax return for the taxable year ending June 30, 2015, M does not make an election under section 179 to expense the cost of any of these items of equipment and does make an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include all of these items of equipment in a general asset account. All of these items of equipment are 7-year property under section 168(e), are not listed property, and are property described in section 168(k)(2)(B). All of the ten items of equipment placed in service in October 2014 are eligible for the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction provided by section 168(k)(1). All of the five items of equipment placed in service in February 2015 are not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction. M depreciates its 7-year property placed in service for the taxable year ending June 30, 2015, using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 7-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. Although the 15 items of equipment are depreciated using the same depreciation method, recovery period, and convention, M cannot include all of them in one general asset account because some of items of equipment are not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction. In accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, M establishes two general asset accounts: one for the ten items of equipment eligible for the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction and one for the five items of equipment not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction.
(d)
Determination of depreciation allowance
—(1)
In general.
Depreciation allowances are determined for each general asset account. The depreciation allowances must be recorded in a depreciation reserve account for each general asset account. The allowance for depreciation under this section constitutes the amount of depreciation allowable under section 167(a).
(2)
Assets in general asset account are eligible for additional first year depreciation deduction.
If all the assets in a general asset account are eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction, the taxpayer first must determine the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the general asset account for the placed-in-service year and then must determine the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for the general asset account for the placed-in-service year and any subsequent taxable year. The allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the general asset account for the placed-in-service
year is determined by multiplying the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account by the additional first year depreciation deduction percentage applicable to the assets in the account (for example, 30 percent, 50 percent, or 100 percent). The remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account then is depreciated using the applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention for the assets in the account.
(3)
No assets in general asset account are eligible for additional first year depreciation deduction.
If none of the assets in a general asset account are eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction, the taxpayer must determine the allowable depreciation deduction for the general asset account for the placed-in-service year and any subsequent taxable year by using the applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention for the assets in the account.
(4)
Special rule for passenger automobiles.
For purposes of applying section 280F(a), the depreciation allowance for a general asset account established for passenger automobiles is limited for each taxable year to the amount prescribed in section 280F(a) multiplied by the excess of the number of automobiles originally included in the account over the number of automobiles disposed of during the taxable year or in any prior taxable year in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (disposition of an asset in a qualifying disposition), paragraph (e)(3)(iv) (transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)), paragraph (e)(3)(v) (transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033), paragraph (e)(3)(vi) (technical termination of a partnership), paragraph (e)(3)(vii) (anti-abuse rule), paragraph (g) (assets subject to recapture), or paragraph (h)(1) (conversion to any personal use) of this section.
(e)
Dispositions from a general asset account
—(1)
Scope and definition
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (e) provides rules applicable to dispositions of assets included in a general asset account. For purposes of this paragraph (e), an asset in a general asset account is disposed of when ownership of the asset is transferred or when the asset is permanently withdrawn from use either in the taxpayer's trade or business or in the production of income. A disposition includes the sale, exchange, retirement, physical abandonment, or destruction of an asset. A disposition also occurs when an asset is transferred to a supplies, scrap, or similar account, or when a portion of an asset is disposed of as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. If a structural component, or a portion thereof, of a building is disposed of in a disposition described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a disposition also includes the disposition of such structural component or such portion thereof.
(ii)
Disposition of a portion of an asset.
For purposes of applying paragraph (e) of this section, a disposition includes a disposition of a portion of an asset in a general asset account as a result of a casualty event described in section 165, a disposition of a portion of an asset in a general asset account for which gain, determined without regard to section 1245 or section 1250, is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 or section 1033, a transfer of a portion of an asset in a general asset account in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B), a sale of a portion of an asset in a general asset account, or a disposition of a portion of an asset in a general asset account in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(vii)(B) of this section. For other transactions, a disposition includes a disposition of a portion of an asset in a general asset account only if the taxpayer makes the election under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section to terminate the general asset account in which that disposed portion is included or makes the election under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section for that disposed portion.
(2)
General rules for a disposition
—(i)
No immediate recovery of basis.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, immediately before a disposition of any asset in a general asset account or a disposition of a portion of such asset as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the asset or the portion of the asset, as applicable, is treated as having an adjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(4)) of zero for purposes of section 1011. Therefore, no loss is realized upon the disposition of an asset from the
general asset account or upon the disposition of a portion of such asset as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. Similarly, where an asset or a portion of an asset, as applicable, is disposed of by transfer to a supplies, scrap, or similar account, the basis of the asset or the portion of the asset, as applicable, in the supplies, scrap, or similar account will be zero.
(ii)
Treatment of amount realized.
Any amount realized on a disposition is recognized as ordinary income, notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), to the extent the sum of the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account and any expensed cost (as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section) for assets in the account exceeds any amounts previously recognized as ordinary income upon the disposition of other assets in the account or upon the disposition of portions of such assets as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. The recognition and character of any excess amount realized are determined under other applicable provisions of the Code other than sections 1245 and 1250 or provisions of the Code that treat gain on a disposition as subject to section 1245 or section 1250.
(iii)
Effect of disposition on a general asset account.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the unadjusted depreciable basis and the depreciation reserve of the general asset account are not affected as a result of a disposition of an asset from the general asset account or of a disposition of a portion of such asset as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
(iv)
Coordination with nonrecognition provisions.
For purposes of determining the basis of an asset or a portion of an asset, as applicable, acquired in a transaction, other than a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) (pertaining to transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)), paragraph (e)(3)(v) (pertaining to transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033), and paragraph (e)(3)(vi) (pertaining to technical terminations of partnerships) of this section, to which a nonrecognition section of the Code applies, determined without regard to this section, the amount of ordinary income recognized under this paragraph (e)(2) is treated as the amount of gain recognized on the disposition.
(v)
Manner of disposition.
The manner of disposition (for example, normal retirement, abnormal retirement, ordinary retirement, or extraordinary retirement) is not taken into account in determining whether a disposition occurs or gain or loss is recognized.
(vi)
Disposition by transfer to a supplies account.
If a taxpayer made an election under § 1.162-3(d) to treat the cost of any rotable spare part, temporary spare part, or standby emergency spare part (as defined in § 1.162-3(c)) as a capital expenditure subject to the allowance for depreciation and also made an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include that rotable, temporary, or standby emergency spare part in a general asset account, the taxpayer can dispose of the rotable, temporary, or standby emergency spare part by transferring it to a supplies account only if the taxpayer has obtained the consent of the Commissioner to revoke the § 1.162-3(d) election. If a taxpayer made an election under § 1.162-3T(d) to treat the cost of any material and supply (as defined in § 1.162-3T(c)(1)) as a capital expenditure subject to the allowance for depreciation and also made an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include that material and supply in a general asset account, the taxpayer can dispose of the material and supply by transferring it to a supplies account only if the taxpayer has obtained the consent of the Commissioner to revoke the § 1.162-3T(d) election. See § 1.162-3(d)(3) for the procedures for revoking a § 1.162-3(d) or a § 1.162-3T(d) election.
(vii)
Leasehold improvements.
The rules of paragraph (e) of this section also apply to—
(A) A lessor of leased property that made an improvement to that property for the lessee of the property, has a depreciable basis in the improvement, made an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include the improvement in a general asset account, and disposes of the improvement, or disposes of a portion of the improvement as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of
this section, before or upon the termination of the lease with the lessee. See section 168(i)(8)(B); and
(B) A lessee of leased property that made an improvement to that property, has a depreciable basis in the improvement, made an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include the improvement in a general asset account, and disposes of the improvement, or disposes of a portion of the improvement as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, before or upon the termination of the lease.
(viii)
Determination of asset disposed of
—(A)
General rules.
For purposes of applying paragraph (e) of this section to the disposition of an asset in a general asset account, instead of the disposition of the general asset account, the facts and circumstances of each disposition are considered in determining what is the appropriate asset disposed of. The asset for disposition purposes may not consist of items placed in service by the taxpayer on different dates, without taking into account the applicable convention. For purposes of determining what is the appropriate asset disposed of, the unit of property determination under § 1.263(a)-3(e) or in published guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin under section 263(a) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) and the distinct asset determination under § 1.1031(a)-3(a)(4) do not apply.
(B)
Special rules.
In addition to the general rules in paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(A) of this section, the following rules apply for purposes of applying paragraph (e) of this section to the disposition of an asset in a general asset account instead of the disposition of the general asset account:
(
1
) Each building, including its structural components, is the asset, except as provided in § 1.1250-1(a)(2)(ii) or in paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(B)(
2
) or (
4
) of this section.
(
2
) If a building has two or more condominium or cooperative units, each condominium or cooperative unit, including its structural components, is the asset, except as provided in § 1.1250-1(a)(2)(ii) or in paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(B)(
4
) of this section.
(
3
) If a taxpayer properly includes an item in one of the asset classes 00.11 through 00.4 of Rev. Proc. 87-56 (1987-2 CB 674) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) or properly classifies an item in one of the categories under section 168(e)(3), except for a category that includes buildings or structural components (for example, retail motor fuels outlet, qualified leasehold improvement property, qualified restaurant property, and qualified retail improvement property), each item is the asset, provided that paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(B)(
4
) of this section does not apply to the item. For example, each desk is the asset, each computer is the asset, and each qualified smart electric meter is the asset.
(
4
) If the taxpayer places in service an improvement or addition to an asset after the taxpayer placed the asset in service, the improvement or addition and, if applicable, its structural components are a separate asset.
(ix)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(2):

# Example 1.
A, a calendar-year partnership, maintains one general asset account for one office building that cost $10 million. A discovers a leak in the roof of the building and decides to replace the entire roof. The roof is a structural component of the building. In accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the office building, including its structural components, is the asset for disposition purposes. The retirement of the replaced roof is not a disposition of a portion of an asset as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. Thus, the retirement of the replaced roof is not a disposition under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. As a result, A continues to depreciate the $10 million cost of the general asset account. If A must capitalize the amount paid for the replacement roof pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3, the replacement roof is a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(B)(
4
) of this section and for depreciation purposes pursuant to section 168(i)(6).

# Example 2.
B, a calendar-year commercial airline company, maintains one general asset account for five aircraft that cost a total of $500 million. These aircraft are described in asset class 45.0 of Rev. Proc. 87-56. B replaces the existing engines on one of the aircraft with new engines. Assume each aircraft is a unit of property as determined under § 1.263(a)-3(e)(3) and each engine of an aircraft is a major component or substantial structural part of the aircraft as determined under § 1.263(a)-3(k)(6). Assume also that B treats each aircraft as the asset for disposition purposes in accordance with paragraph
(e)(2)(viii) of this section. The retirement of the replaced engines is not a disposition of a portion of an asset as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. Thus, the retirement of the replaced engines is not a disposition under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. As a result, B continues to depreciate the $500 million cost of the general asset account. If B must capitalize the amount paid for the replacement engines pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3, the replacement engines are a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(B)(
4
) of this section and for depreciation purposes pursuant to section 168(i)(6).

# Example 3.
(i) R, a calendar-year corporation, maintains one general asset account for ten machines. The machines cost a total of $10,000 and are placed in service in June 2014. Of the ten machines, one machine costs $8,200 and nine machines cost a total of $1,800. Assume R depreciates this general asset account using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and a half-year convention. R does not make a section 179 election for any of the machines, and all of the machines are not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction. As of January 1, 2015, the depreciation reserve of the account is $2,000 ($10,000 × 20%).
(ii) On February 8, 2015, R sells the machine that cost $8,200 to an unrelated party for $9,000. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, this machine has an adjusted depreciable basis of zero.
(iii) On its 2015 tax return, R recognizes the amount realized of $9,000 as ordinary income because such amount does not exceed the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account ($10,000), plus any expensed cost for assets in the account ($0), less amounts previously recognized as ordinary income ($0). Moreover, the unadjusted depreciable basis and depreciation reserve of the account are not affected by the disposition of the machine. Thus, the depreciation allowance for the account in 2015 is $3,200 ($10,000 × 32%).

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3.
In addition, on June 4, 2016, R sells seven machines to an unrelated party for a total of $1,100. In accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, these machines have an adjusted depreciable basis of zero.
(ii) On its 2016 tax return, R recognizes $1,000 as ordinary income (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $10,000, plus the expensed cost of $0, less the amount of $9,000 previously recognized as ordinary income). The recognition and character of the excess amount realized of $100 ($1,100−$1,000) are determined under applicable provisions of the Code other than section 1245 (such as section 1231). Moreover, the unadjusted depreciable basis and depreciation reserve of the account are not affected by the disposition of the machines. Thus, the depreciation allowance for the account in 2016 is $1,920 ($10,000 × 19.2%).
(3)
Special rules
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (e)(3) provides the rules for terminating general asset account treatment upon certain dispositions. While the rules under paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section are optional rules, the rules under paragraphs (e)(3)(iv), (v), (vi), and (vii) of this section are mandatory rules. A taxpayer elects to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section by reporting the gain, loss, or other deduction on the taxpayer's timely filed original Federal tax return, including extensions, for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. However, if the loss is on account of the demolition of a structure to which section 280B and § 1.280B-1 apply, a taxpayer elects to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section by ending depreciation for the structure at the time of the disposition of the structure, taking into account the convention applicable to the general asset account in which the demolished structure was included, and reporting the amount of depreciation for that structure for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs on the taxpayer's timely filed original Federal tax return, including extensions, for that taxable year. A taxpayer may revoke the election to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section only by filing a request for a private letter ruling and obtaining the Commissioner's consent to revoke the election. The Commissioner may grant a request to revoke this election if the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and the revocation will not prejudice the interests of the Government. See generally § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. The election to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section may not be made or revoked through the filing of an application for change in accounting method. For purposes of applying paragraphs (e)(3)(iii) through (vii) of this section, see paragraph (j) of this section for identifying an asset disposed of and its unadjusted depreciable basis. Solely for purposes of applying paragraphs (e)(3)(iii),
(e)(3)(iv)(C), (e)(3)(v)(B), and (e)(3)(vii) of this section, the term
asset
is:
(A) The asset as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of this section; or
(B) The portion of such asset that is disposed of in a disposition described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Disposition of all assets remaining in a general asset account
—(A)
Optional termination of a general asset account.
Upon the disposition of all of the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset in a general asset account, a taxpayer may apply this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) to recover the adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account rather than having paragraph (e)(2) of this section apply. Under this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), the general asset account terminates and the amount of gain or loss for the general asset account is determined under section 1001(a) by taking into account the adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account at the time of the disposition, as determined under the applicable convention for the general asset account. Whether and to what extent gain or loss is recognized is determined under other applicable provisions of the Code, including section 280B and § 1.280B-1. The character of the gain or loss is determined under other applicable provisions of the Code, except that the amount of gain subject to section 1245 is limited to the excess of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the general asset account, including any expensed cost, over any amounts previously recognized as ordinary income under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and the amount of gain subject to section 1250 is limited to the excess of the additional depreciation allowed or allowable for the general asset account, over any amounts previously recognized as ordinary income under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(B)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii):

# Example 1.
(i) T, a calendar-year corporation, maintains a general asset account for 1,000 calculators. The calculators cost a total of $60,000 and are placed in service in 2014. Assume T depreciates this general asset account using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and a half-year convention. T does not make a section 179 election for any of the calculators, and all of the calculators are not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction. In 2015, T sells 200 of the calculators to an unrelated party for a total of $10,000 and recognizes the $10,000 as ordinary income in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(ii) On March 26, 2016, T sells the remaining calculators in the general asset account to an unrelated party for $35,000. T elects to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. As a result, the account terminates and gain or loss is determined for the account.
(iii) On the date of disposition, the adjusted depreciable basis of the account is $23,040 (unadjusted depreciable basis of $60,000 less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $36,960). Thus, in 2016, T recognizes gain of $11,960 (amount realized of $35,000 less the adjusted depreciable basis of $23,040). The gain of $11,960 is subject to section 1245 to the extent of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the account, plus the expensed cost for assets in the account, less the amounts previously recognized as ordinary income ($36,960 + $0 − $10,000 = $26,960). As a result, the entire gain of $11,960 is subject to section 1245.

# Example 2.
(i) J, a calendar-year corporation, maintains a general asset account for one item of equipment. This equipment costs $2,000 and is placed in service in 2014. Assume J depreciates this general asset account using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and a half-year convention. J does not make a section 179 election for the equipment, and it is not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction. In June 2016, J sells the equipment to an unrelated party for $1,000. J elects to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. As a result, the account terminates and gain or loss is determined for the account.
(ii) On the date of disposition, the adjusted depreciable basis of the account is $768 (unadjusted depreciable basis of $2,000 less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $1,232). Thus, in 2016, J recognizes gain of $232 (amount realized of $1,000 less the adjusted depreciable basis of $768). The gain of $232 is subject to section 1245 to the extent of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the account, plus the expensed cost for assets in the account, less the amounts previously recognized as ordinary income ($1,232 + $0 − $0 = $1,232).As a result, the entire gain of $232 is subject to section 1245.
(iii)
Disposition of an asset in a qualifying disposition
—(A)
Optional determination of the amount of gain, loss, or
other deduction.
In the case of a qualifying disposition (described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section) of an asset, a taxpayer may elect to apply this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) rather than having paragraph (e)(2) of this section apply. Under this paragraph (e)(3)(iii), general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as of the first day of the taxable year in which the qualifying disposition occurs, and the amount of gain, loss, or other deduction for the asset is determined under § 1.168(i)-8 by taking into account the asset's adjusted depreciable basis at the time of the disposition. The adjusted depreciable basis of the asset at the time of the disposition, as determined under the applicable convention for the general asset account in which the asset was included, equals the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset less the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset. The allowable depreciation is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the asset was included and by including the portion of the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the general asset account that is attributable to the asset disposed of. Whether and to what extent gain, loss, or other deduction is recognized is determined under other applicable provisions of the Code, including section 280B and § 1.280B-1. The character of the gain, loss, or other deduction is determined under other applicable provisions of the Code, except that the amount of gain subject to section 1245 or section 1250 is limited to the lesser of—
(
1
) The depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset, including any expensed cost or, in the case of section 1250 property, the additional depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset; or
(
2
) The excess of—
(
i
) The original unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account plus, in the case of section 1245 property originally included in the general asset account, any expensed cost; over
(
ii
) The cumulative amounts of gain previously recognized as ordinary income under either paragraph (e)(2) of this section or section 1245 or section 1250.
(B)
Qualifying dispositions.
A
qualifying disposition
is a disposition that does not involve all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset remaining in a general asset account and that is—
(
1
) A direct result of a fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft;
(
2
) A charitable contribution for which a deduction is allowable under section 170;
(
3
) A direct result of a cessation, termination, or disposition of a business, manufacturing or other income producing process, operation, facility, plant, or other unit, other than by transfer to a supplies, scrap, or similar account; or
(
4
) A transaction, other than a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) (pertaining to transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)), paragraph (e)(3)(v) (pertaining to transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033), paragraph (e)(3)(vi) (pertaining to technical terminations of partnerships), or paragraph (e)(3)(vii) (anti-abuse rule) of this section, to which a nonrecognition section of the Internal Revenue Code applies (determined without regard to this section).
(C)
Effect of a qualifying disposition on a general asset account.
If the taxpayer elects to apply this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) to a qualifying disposition of an asset, then—
(
1
) The asset is removed from the general asset account as of the first day of the taxable year in which the qualifying disposition occurs. For that taxable year, the taxpayer accounts for the asset in a single asset account in accordance with the rules under § 1.168(i)-7(b);
(
2
) The unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account is reduced by the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset as of the first day of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs;
(
3
) The depreciation reserve of the general asset account is reduced by the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset as of the end of
the taxable year immediately preceding the year of disposition. The allowable depreciation is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the asset was included and by including the portion of the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the general asset account that is attributable to the asset disposed of; and
(
4
) For purposes of determining the amount of gain realized on subsequent dispositions that is subject to ordinary income treatment under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of any expensed cost with respect to the asset is disregarded.
(D)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii):

# Example 1.
(i) Z, a calendar-year corporation, maintains one general asset account for 12 machines. Each machine costs $15,000 and is placed in service in 2014. Of the 12 machines, nine machines that cost a total of $135,000 are used in Z's Kentucky plant, and three machines that cost a total of $45,000 are used in Z's Ohio plant. Assume Z depreciates this general asset account using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. Z does not make a section 179 election for any of the machines, and all of the machines are not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction. As of December 31, 2015, the depreciation reserve for the account is $93,600.
(ii) On May 27, 2016, Z sells its entire manufacturing plant in Ohio to an unrelated party. The sales proceeds allocated to each of the three machines at the Ohio plant is $5,000. This transaction is a qualifying disposition under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section, and Z elects to apply paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
(iii) For Z's 2016 return, the depreciation allowance for the account is computed as follows. As of December 31, 2015, the depreciation allowed or allowable for the three machines at the Ohio plant is $23,400. Thus, as of January 1, 2016, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the account is reduced from $180,000 to $135,000 ($180,000 less the unadjusted depreciable basis of $45,000 for the three machines), and, as of December 31, 2015, the depreciation reserve of the account is decreased from $93,600 to $70,200 ($93,600 less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $23,400 for the three machines as of December 31, 2015). Consequently, the depreciation allowance for the account in 2016 is $25,920 ($135,000 × 19.2%).
(iv) For Z's 2016 return, gain or loss for each of the three machines at the Ohio plant is determined as follows. The depreciation allowed or allowable in 2016 for each machine is $1,440 (($15,000 × 19.2%)/2). Thus, the adjusted depreciable basis of each machine under section 1011 is $5,760 (the adjusted depreciable basis of $7,200 removed from the account less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $1,440 in 2016). As a result, the loss recognized in 2016 for each machine is $760 ($5,000 − $5,760), which is subject to section 1231.

# Example 2.
(i) A, a calendar-year partnership, maintains one general asset account for one office building that cost $20 million and was placed in service in July 2011. A depreciates this general asset account using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the straight-line method, a 39-year recovery period, and the mid-month convention. As of January 1, 2014, the depreciation reserve for the account is $1,261,000.
(ii) In May 2014, a tornado occurs where the building is located and damages the roof of the building. A decides to replace the entire roof. The roof is replaced in June 2014. The roof is a structural component of the building. Because the roof was damaged as a result of a casualty event described in section 165, the partial disposition rule provided under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section applies to the roof. Although the office building, including its structural components, is the asset for disposition purposes, the partial disposition rule provides that the retirement of the replaced roof is a disposition under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. This retirement is a qualifying disposition under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, and A elects to apply paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section for the retirement of the damaged roof.
(iii) Of the $20 million cost of the office building, assume $1 million is the cost of the retired roof.
(iv) For A's 2014 return, the depreciation allowance for the account is computed as follows. As of December 31, 2013, the depreciation allowed or allowable for the retired roof is $63,050. Thus, as of January 1, 2014, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the account is reduced from $20,000,000 to $19,000,000 ($20,000,000 less the unadjusted depreciable basis of $1,000,000 for the retired roof), and the depreciation reserve of the account is decreased from $1,261,000 to $1,197,950 ($1,261,000 less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $63,050 for the retired roof as of December 31, 2013). Consequently, the depreciation allowance for the account in 2014 is $487,160 ($19,000,000 × 2.564%).
(v) For A's 2014 return, gain or loss for the retired roof is determined as follows. The depreciation allowed or allowable in 2014 for the retired roof is $11,752 (($1,000,000 × 2.564%) × 5.5/12). Thus, the adjusted depreciable basis of the retired roof under section 1011 is $925,198 (the adjusted depreciable basis of $936,950 removed from the account less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $11,752 in 2014). As a result, the loss recognized in 2014 for the retired roof is $925,198, which is subject to section 1231.
(vi) If A must capitalize the amount paid for the replacement roof under § 1.263(a)-3, the replacement roof is a separate asset for depreciation purposes pursuant to section 168(i)(6). If A includes the replacement roof in a general asset account, the replacement roof is a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(B)(
4
) of this section. If A includes the replacement roof in a single asset account or a multiple asset account under § 1.168(i)-7, the replacement roof is a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to § 1.168(i)-8(c)(4)(ii)(D).
(iv)
Transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)
—(A)
In general.
If a taxpayer transfers one or more assets, or a portion of such asset, in a general asset account in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B) (pertaining to treatment of transferees in certain nonrecognition transactions), the taxpayer (the transferor) and the transferee must apply this paragraph (e)(3)(iv) to the asset or the portion of such asset, instead of applying paragraph (e)(2), (e)(3)(ii), or (e)(3)(iii) of this section. The transferee is bound by the transferor's election under paragraph (l) of this section for the portion of the transferee's basis in the asset or the portion of such asset that does not exceed the transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account or the asset or the portion of such asset, as applicable, as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(
2
) or (C)(
2
) of this section, as applicable.
(B)
All assets remaining in general asset account are transferred.
If a taxpayer transfers all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset in a general asset account in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B)—
(
1
) The taxpayer (the transferor) must terminate the general asset account on the date of the transfer. The allowable depreciation deduction for the general asset account for the transferor's taxable year in which the section 168(i)(7)(B) transaction occurs is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account. This allowable depreciation deduction is allocated between the transferor and the transferee on a monthly basis. This allocation is made in accordance with the rules in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(7)(ii) for allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee;
(
2
) The transferee must establish a new general asset account for all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, in the taxable year in which the section 168(i)(7)(B) transaction occurs for the portion of its basis in the assets that does not exceed the transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account in which all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, were included. The transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of this general asset account is equal to the adjusted depreciable basis of that account as of the beginning of the transferor's taxable year in which the transaction occurs, decreased by the amount of depreciation allocable to the transferor for the year of the transfer, as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section. The transferee is treated as the transferor for purposes of computing the allowable depreciation deduction for the new general asset account under section 168. The new general asset account must be established in accordance with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section, except that the unadjusted depreciable bases of all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, and the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, including the amount of depreciation for the transferred assets that is allocable to the transferor for the year of the transfer, are included in the newly established general asset account. Consequently, this general asset account in the year of the transfer will have a beginning balance for both the unadjusted depreciable basis and the depreciation reserve of the general asset account; and
(
3
) For purposes of section 168 and this section, the transferee treats the portion of its basis in the assets that exceeds the transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account in which all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, were included, as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section, as a separate asset that the transferee placed in service on the date of the transfer. The transferee accounts for this asset under § 1.168(i)-7 or may make an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include the asset in a general asset account.
(C)
Not all assets remaining in general asset account are transferred.
If a taxpayer transfers an asset in a general asset account in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B) and if paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section does not apply to this asset—
(
1
) The taxpayer (the transferor) must remove the transferred asset from the general asset account in which the asset is included, as of the first day of the taxable year in which the section 168(i)(7)(B) transaction occurs. In addition, the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
) through (
4
) of this section must be made. The allowable depreciation deduction for the asset for the transferor's taxable year in which the section 168(i)(7)(B) transaction occurs is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the asset was included. This allowable depreciation deduction is allocated between the transferor and the transferee on a monthly basis. This allocation is made in accordance with the rules in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(7)(ii) for allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee;
(
2
) The transferee must establish a new general asset account for the asset in the taxable year in which the section 168(i)(7)(B) transaction occurs for the portion of its basis in the asset that does not exceed the transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of the asset. The transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of this asset is equal to the adjusted depreciable basis of the asset as of the beginning of the transferor's taxable year in which the transaction occurs, decreased by the amount of depreciation allocable to the transferor for the year of the transfer, as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(C)(
1
) of this section. The transferee is treated as the transferor for purposes of computing the allowable depreciation deduction for the new general asset account under section 168. The new general asset account must be established in accordance with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section, except that the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset, and the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset, including the amount of depreciation for the transferred asset that is allocable to the transferor for the year of the transfer, are included in the newly established general asset account. Consequently, this general asset account in the year of the transfer will have a beginning balance for both the unadjusted depreciable basis and the depreciation reserve of the general asset account; and
(
3
) For purposes of section 168 and this section, the transferee treats the portion of its basis in the asset that exceeds the transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of the asset, as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(C)(
2
) of this section, as a separate asset that the transferee placed in service on the date of the transfer. The transferee accounts for this asset under § 1.168(i)-7 or may make an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include the asset in a general asset account.
(v)
Transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033
—(A)
Like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion of all assets remaining in a general asset account.
If all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset in a general asset account are transferred by a taxpayer in a like-kind exchange (as defined under § 1.168-6(b)(11)) or in an involuntary conversion (as defined under § 1.168-6(b)(12)), the taxpayer must apply this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(A) instead of applying paragraph (e)(2), (e)(3)(ii), or (e)(3)(iii) of this section. Under this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(A), the general asset account terminates as of the first day of the year of disposition (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(5)) and—
(
1
) The amount of gain or loss for the general asset account is determined under section 1001(a) by taking into account the adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account at the time of disposition (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(3)). The depreciation allowance for the general asset account in the year of disposition is determined in the same manner as the depreciation allowance for the relinquished MACRS property (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(2)) in the year of disposition is determined under § 1.168(i)-6. The recognition and character of gain or loss are determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, notwithstanding that paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is an optional rule; and
(
2
) The adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account at the time of disposition is treated as the adjusted depreciable basis of the relinquished MACRS property.
(B)
Like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion of less than all assets remaining in a general asset account.
If an asset in a general asset account is transferred by a taxpayer in a like-kind exchange or in an involuntary conversion and if paragraph (e)(3)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to this asset, the taxpayer must apply this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) instead of applying paragraph (e)(2), (e)(3)(ii), or (e)(3)(iii) of this section. Under this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B), general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as of the first day of the year of disposition (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(5)), and—
(
1
) The amount of gain or loss for the asset is determined by taking into account the asset's adjusted depreciable basis at the time of disposition (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(3)). The adjusted depreciable basis of the asset at the time of disposition equals the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset less the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset. The allowable depreciation is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the asset was included and by including the portion of the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the general asset account that is attributable to the relinquished asset. The depreciation allowance for the asset in the year of disposition is determined in the same manner as the depreciation allowance for the relinquished MACRS property (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(2)) in the year of disposition is determined under § 1.168(i)-6. The recognition and character of the gain or loss are determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, notwithstanding that paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section is an optional rule; and
(
2
) As of the first day of the year of disposition, the taxpayer must remove the relinquished asset from the general asset account and make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
) through (
4
) of this section.
(vi)
Technical termination of a partnership.
In the case of a technical termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B), the terminated partnership must apply this paragraph (e)(3)(vi) instead of applying paragraph (e)(2), (e)(3)(ii), or (e)(3)(iii) of this section. Under this paragraph (e)(3)(vi), all of the terminated partnership's general asset accounts terminate as of the date of its termination under section 708(b)(1)(B). The terminated partnership computes the allowable depreciation deduction for each of its general asset accounts for the taxable year in which the technical termination occurs by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account. The new partnership is not bound by the terminated partnership's election under paragraph (l) of this section.
(vii)
Anti-abuse rule
—(A)
In general.
If an asset in a general asset account is disposed of by a taxpayer in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(vii)(B) of this section, general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as of the first day of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. Consequently, the taxpayer must determine the amount of gain, loss, or other deduction attributable to the disposition in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, notwithstanding that paragraph
(e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is an optional rule, and must make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section.
(B)
Abusive transactions.
A transaction is described in this paragraph (e)(3)(vii)(B) if the transaction is not described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv), (e)(3)(v), or (e)(3)(vi) of this section, and if the transaction is entered into, or made, with a principal purpose of achieving a tax benefit or result that would not be available absent an election under this section. Examples of these types of transactions include—
(
1
) A transaction entered into with a principal purpose of shifting income or deductions among taxpayers in a manner that would not be possible absent an election under this section to take advantage of differing effective tax rates among the taxpayers; or
(
2
) An election made under this section with a principal purpose of disposing of an asset from a general asset account to utilize an expiring net operating loss or credit if the transaction is not a bona fide disposition. The fact that a taxpayer with a net operating loss carryover or a credit carryover transfers an asset to a related person or transfers an asset pursuant to an arrangement where the asset continues to be used or is available for use by the taxpayer pursuant to a lease or otherwise indicates, absent strong evidence to the contrary, that the transaction is described in this paragraph (e)(3)(vii)(B).
(f)
Assets generating foreign source income
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (f) provides the rules for determining the source of any income, gain, or loss recognized, and the appropriate section 904(d) separate limitation category or categories for any foreign source income, gain, or loss recognized on a disposition (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of an asset in a general asset account that consists of assets generating both United States and foreign source income. These rules apply only to a disposition to which paragraph (e)(2) (general disposition rules), paragraph (e)(3)(ii) (disposition of all assets remaining in a general asset account), paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (disposition of an asset in a qualifying disposition), paragraph (e)(3)(v) (transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033), or paragraph (e)(3)(vii) (anti-abuse rule) of this section applies. Solely for purposes of applying this paragraph (f), the term
asset
is:
(i) The asset as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of this section; or
(ii) The portion of such asset that is disposed of in a disposition described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
(2)
Source of ordinary income, gain, or loss
—(i)
Source determined by allocation and apportionment of depreciation allowed.
The amount of any ordinary income, gain, or loss that is recognized on the disposition of an asset in a general asset account must be apportioned between United States and foreign sources based on the allocation and apportionment of the—
(A) Depreciation allowed for the general asset account as of the end of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs if paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies to the disposition;
(B) Depreciation allowed for the general asset account as of the time of disposition if the taxpayer applies paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section to the disposition of all assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, in the general asset account, or if all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, in the general asset account are disposed of in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(A) of this section; or
(C) Depreciation allowed for the asset disposed of for only the taxable year in which the disposition occurs if the taxpayer applies paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section to the disposition of the asset in a qualifying disposition, if the asset is disposed of in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) of this section (like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion), or if the asset is disposed of in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(vii) of this section (anti-abuse rule).
(ii)
Formula for determining foreign source income, gain, or loss.
The amount of ordinary income, gain, or loss recognized on the disposition that shall be treated as foreign source income, gain, or loss must be determined under the formula in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii). For purposes of this formula, the allowed
depreciation deductions are determined for the applicable time period provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. The formula is:
Foreign Source Income, Gain, or Loss from The Disposition of an Asset
=
Total Ordinary Income, Gain, or Loss from the Disposition of an Asset
X
Allowed Depreciation Deductions Allocated and Apportioned to Foreign Source Income/Total Allowed Depreciation Deductions for the General Asset Account or for the Asset Disposed of (as applicable).
(3)
Section 904(d) separate categories.
If the assets in the general asset account generate foreign source income in more than one separate category under section 904(d)(1) or another section of the Code (for example, income treated as foreign source income under section 904(g)(10)), or under a United States income tax treaty that requires the foreign tax credit limitation to be determined separately for specified types of income, the amount of foreign source income, gain, or loss from the disposition of an asset, as determined under the formula in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, must be allocated and apportioned to the applicable separate category or categories under the formula in this paragraph (f)(3). For purposes of this formula, the allowed depreciation deductions are determined for the applicable time period provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. The formula is:
Foreign Source Income, Gain, or Loss in a Separate Category
=
Foreign Source Income, Gain, or Loss from The Disposition of an Asset
X
Allowed Depreciation Deductions Allocated and Apportioned to a Separate Category/Total Allowed Depreciation Deductions and Apportioned to Foreign Source Income.
(g)
Assets subject to recapture.
If the basis of an asset in a general asset account is increased as a result of the recapture of any allowable credit or deduction (for example, the basis adjustment for the recapture amount under section 30(e)(5), 50(c)(2), 168(l)(6), 168(n)(4), 179(d)(10), 179A(e)(4), or 1400N(d)(5)), general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as of the first day of the taxable year in which the recapture event occurs. Consequently, the taxpayer must remove the asset from the general asset account as of that day and must make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
) through (
4
) of this section.

An asset in a general asset account becomes ineligible for general asset account treatment if a taxpayer uses the asset in any personal activity during a taxable year. Upon a conversion to any personal use, the taxpayer must remove the asset from the general asset account as of the first day of the taxable year in which the change in use occurs (the year of change) and must make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
) through (
4
) of this section.
(2)
Change in use results in a different recovery period and/or depreciation method
—(i)
No effect on general asset account election.
A change in the use described in § 1.168(i)-4(d) (change in use results
in a different recovery period or depreciation method) of an asset in a general asset account shall not cause or permit the revocation of the election made under this section.
(ii)
Asset is removed from the general asset account.
Upon a change in the use described in § 1.168(i)-4(d), the taxpayer must remove the asset from the general asset account as of the first day of the year of change (as defined in § 1.168(i)-4(a)) and must make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
2
) through (
4
) of this section. If, however, the result of the change in use is described in § 1.168(i)-4(d)(3) (change in use results in a shorter recovery period or a more accelerated depreciation method) and the taxpayer elects to treat the asset as though the change in use had not occurred pursuant to § 1.168(i)-4(d)(3)(ii), no adjustment is made to the general asset account upon the change in use.
(iii)
New general asset account is established
—(A)
Change in use results in a shorter recovery period or a more accelerated depreciation method.
If the result of the change in use is described in § 1.168(i)-4(d)(3) (change in use results in a shorter recovery period or a more accelerated depreciation method) and adjustments to the general asset account are made pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, the taxpayer must establish a new general asset account for the asset in the year of change in accordance with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section, except that the adjusted depreciable basis of the asset as of the first day of the year of change is included in the general asset account. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention are determined under § 1.168(i)-4(d)(3)(i).
(B)
Change in use results in a longer recovery period or a slower depreciation method.
If the result of the change in use is described in § 1.168(i)-4(d)(4) (change in use results in a longer recovery period or a slower depreciation method), the taxpayer must establish a separate general asset account for the asset in the year of change in accordance with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section, except that the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset, and the greater of the depreciation of the asset allowed or allowable in accordance with section 1016(a)(2), as of the first day of the year of change are included in the newly established general asset account. Consequently, this general asset account as of the first day of the year of change will have a beginning balance for both the unadjusted depreciable basis and the depreciation reserve of the general asset account. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention are determined under § 1.168(i)-4(d)(4)(ii).
(i)
Redetermination of basis.
If, after the placed-in-service year, the unadjusted depreciable basis of an asset in a general asset account is redetermined due to a transaction other than that described in paragraph (g) of this section (for example, due to contingent purchase price or discharge of indebtedness), the taxpayer's election under paragraph (l) of this section for the asset also applies to the increase or decrease in basis resulting from the redetermination. For the taxable year in which the increase or decrease in basis occurs, the taxpayer must establish a new general asset account for the amount of the increase or decrease in basis in accordance with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the applicable recovery period for the increase or decrease in basis is the recovery period of the asset remaining as of the beginning of the taxable year in which the increase or decrease in basis occurs, the applicable depreciation method and applicable convention for the increase or decrease in basis are the same depreciation method and convention applicable to the asset that applies for the taxable year in which the increase or decrease in basis occurs, and the increase or decrease in basis is deemed to be placed in service in the same taxable year as the asset.
(j)
Identification of disposed or converted asset
—(1)
In general.
The rules of this paragraph (j) apply when an asset in a general asset account is disposed
of or converted in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (disposition of an asset in a qualifying disposition), paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) (transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)), paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) (transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033), paragraph (e)(3)(vii) (anti-abuse rule), paragraph (g) (assets subject to recapture), or paragraph (h)(1) (conversion to any personal use) of this section.
(2)
Identifying which asset is disposed of or converted
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of identifying which asset in a general asset account is disposed of or converted, a taxpayer must identify the disposed of or converted asset by using—
(A) The specific identification method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the taxpayer can determine the particular taxable year in which the disposed of or converted asset was placed in service by the taxpayer;
(B) A first-in, first-out method of accounting if the taxpayer can readily determine from its records the total dispositions of assets with the same recovery period during the taxable year but the taxpayer cannot readily determine from its records the unadjusted depreciable basis of the disposed of or converted asset. Under this method of accounting, the taxpayer identifies the general asset account with the earliest placed-in-service year that has the same recovery period as the disposed of or converted asset and that has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition or conversion, and the taxpayer treats the disposed of or converted asset as being from that general asset account. To determine which general asset account has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition or conversion, the taxpayer reduces the number of assets originally included in the account by the number of assets disposed of or converted in any prior taxable year in a transaction to which this paragraph (j) applies;
(C) A modified first-in, first-out method of accounting if the taxpayer can readily determine from its records the total dispositions of assets with the same recovery period during the taxable year and the unadjusted depreciable basis of the disposed of or converted asset. Under this method of accounting, the taxpayer identifies the general asset account with the earliest placed-in-service year that has the same recovery period as the disposed of or converted asset and that has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition or conversion with the same unadjusted depreciable basis as the disposed of or converted asset, and the taxpayer treats the disposed of or converted asset as being from that general asset account. To determine which general asset account has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition or conversion, the taxpayer reduces the number of assets originally included in the account by the number of assets disposed of or converted in any prior taxable year in a transaction to which this paragraph (j) applies;
(D) A mortality dispersion table if the asset is a mass asset accounted for in a separate general asset account in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(H) of this section and if the taxpayer can readily determine from its records the total dispositions of assets with the same recovery period during the taxable year. The mortality dispersion table must be based upon an acceptable sampling of the taxpayer's actual disposition and conversion experience for mass assets or other acceptable statistical or engineering techniques. To use a mortality dispersion table, the taxpayer must adopt recordkeeping practices consistent with the taxpayer's prior practices and consonant with good accounting and engineering practices; or
(E) Any other method as the Secretary may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) on or after September 19, 2013. See paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section regarding the last-in, first-out method of accounting.
(ii)
Disposition of a portion of an asset.
If a taxpayer disposes of a portion of an asset and paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section applies to that disposition, the taxpayer may identify the asset by using any applicable method provided in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, after taking into account paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Last-in, first-out method of accounting.
For purposes of paragraph (j)(2) of this section, a last-in, first-out method of accounting may not be used. Examples of a last-in, first-out method of accounting include the taxpayer identifying the general asset account with the most recent placed-in-service year that has the same recovery period as the disposed of or converted asset and that has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition or conversion, and the taxpayer treating the disposed of or converted asset as being from that general asset account, or the taxpayer treating the disposed portion of an asset as being from the general asset account with the most recent placed-in-service year that has assets that are the same as the asset of which the disposed portion is a part.
(3)
Basis of disposed of or converted asset.
(i) Solely for purposes of this paragraph (j)(3), the term
asset
is the asset as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of this section or the portion of such asset that is disposed of in a disposition described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. After identifying which asset in a general asset account is disposed of or converted, the taxpayer must determine the unadjusted depreciable basis of, and the depreciation allowed or allowable for, the disposed of or converted asset. If it is impracticable from the taxpayer's records to determine the unadjusted depreciable basis of the disposed of or converted asset, the taxpayer may use any reasonable method that is consistently applied to all assets in the same general asset account for purposes of determining the unadjusted depreciable basis of the disposed of or converted asset in that general asset account. Examples of a reasonable method include, but are not limited to, the following:
(A) If the replacement asset is a restoration (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(k)), and is not a betterment (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(j)) or an adaptation to a new or different use (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(l)), discounting the cost of the replacement asset to its placed-in-service year cost using the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods or its successor, the Producer Price Index for Final Demand, or any other index designated by guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) for purposes of this paragraph (j)(3);
(B) A pro rata allocation of the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account based on the replacement cost of the disposed asset and the replacement cost of all of the assets in the general asset account; and
(C) A study allocating the cost of the asset to its individual components.
(ii) The depreciation allowable for the disposed of or converted asset is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the disposed of or converted asset was included and by including the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the disposed of or converted asset.
(k)
Effect of adjustments on prior dispositions.
The adjustments to a general asset account under paragraph (e)(3)(iii), (e)(3)(iv), (e)(3)(v), (e)(3)(vii), (g), or (h) of this section have no effect on the recognition and character of prior dispositions subject to paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(l)
Election
—(1)
Irrevocable election.
If a taxpayer makes an election under this paragraph (l), the taxpayer consents to, and agrees to apply, all of the provisions of this section to the assets included in a general asset account. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A), (e)(3), (g), or (h) of this section or except as otherwise expressly provided by other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), an election made under this section is irrevocable and will be binding on the taxpayer for computing taxable income for the taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years. An election under this paragraph (l) is made separately by each person owning an asset to which this section applies (for example, by each member of a consolidated group, at the partnership level and not by the partner separately, or at the S corporation level and not by the shareholder separately).
(l)(2)
Time for making election.
