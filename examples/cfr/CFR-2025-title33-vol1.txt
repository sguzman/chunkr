# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 1.05-5
Marine Safety and Security Council.
The Marine Safety and Security Council, composed of senior Coast Guard officials, acts as policy advisor to the Commandant and is the focal point of the Coast Guard regulatory system. The Marine Safety and Security Council provides oversight, review, and guidance for all Coast Guard regulatory activity.
[CGD 95-057, 60 FR 34148, June 30, 1995, as amended by USCG-2003-15404, 68 FR 37740, June 25, 2003]
§ 1.05-10
Regulatory process overview.
(a) Most rules of local applicability are issued by District Commanders, Captains of the Port, and District Bridge Managers while rules of wider applicability are issued by senior Coast Guard officials at Coast Guard Headquarters. For both significant rulemaking (defined by Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review) and non-significant rulemaking, other than those areas delegated to District Commanders, Captains of the Port, and District Bridge Managers the regulatory process begins when an office chief with program responsibilities identifies a possible need for a new regulation or for changes to an existing regulation. The need may arise due to statutory changes, or be based on internal review or public input. Early public involvement is strongly encouraged.
(b) After a tentative significant regulatory approach is developed, a significant regulatory project proposal is submitted to the Marine Safety and Security Council for approval. The proposal describes the scope of the proposed regulation, alternatives considered, and potential cost and benefits, including possible environmental impacts. All significant regulatory projects require Marine Safety and Security Council approval.
(c) Significant rulemaking documents must also be approved by the Commandant of the Coast Guard.
(d) If the project is approved, the necessary documents are drafted, including documents to be published in the
Federal Register.
These may include regulatory evaluations, environmental
analyses, requests for comments, announcements of public meetings, notices of proposed rulemakings, and final rules.
[CGD 95-057, 60 FR 34148, June 30, 1995, as amended by USCG-2003-14505, 68 FR 9534, Feb. 28, 2003; USCG-2003-15404, 68 FR 37740, June 25, 2003; USCG-2008-0179, 73 FR 35001, June 19, 2008; USCG-2013-0397, 78 FR 39170, July 1, 2013]
§ 1.05-15
Public participation.
The Coast Guard considers public participation essential to effective rulemaking, and encourages the public to participate in its rulemaking process. Coast Guard policy is to provide opportunities for public participation early in potential rulemaking projects. Generally, the Coast Guard will solicit public input by publishing a notice of public meeting or request for comments in the
Federal Register.
Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, Supplemental Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, and Interim Rules will usually provide 90 days, or more if possible, after publication for submission of comments. This time period is intended to allow interested persons the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process through the submission of written data and views. However, certain cases and circumstances may make it necessary to provide a shorter comment period. Public meetings may also be held to provide an opportunity for oral presentations. The Coast Guard will consider the comments received and, in subsequent rulemaking documents, will incorporate a concise general statement of the comments received and identify changes from a proposed rule based on the comments.
§ 1.05-20
Petitions for rulemaking.
(a) Any member of the public may petition the Coast Guard to undertake a rulemaking action. There is no prescribed form for a petition for rulemaking, but the document should provide some supporting information as to why the petitioner believes the proposed rulemaking is necessary and the document should clearly indicate that it is a petition for rulemaking. Petitions should be addressed to the Office of Regulations and Administrative Law (CG-LRA), U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7213, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7213.
(b) The petitioner will be notified of the Coast Guard's decision whether to initiate a rulemaking or not. If the Coast Guard decides not to pursue a rulemaking, the petitioner will be notified of the reasons why. If the Coast Guard decides to initiate rulemaking, it will follow the procedure outlined in this subpart. The Coast Guard may publish a notice acknowledging receipt of a petition for rulemaking in the
Federal Register.
(c) Any petition for rulemaking and any reply to the petition will be kept in a public docket open for inspection.
[CGD 95-057, 60 FR 34148, June 30, 1995, as amended by USCG-2003-15404, 68 FR 37740, June 25, 2003; USCG-2008-0179, 73 FR 35001, June 19, 2008; USCG-2014-0410, 79 FR 38427, July 7, 2014; USCG-2018-0533, 85 FR 8172, Feb. 13, 2020]
§ 1.05-25
Public docket.
(a) The Coast Guard maintains an electronic public docket for each petition for rulemaking and each Coast Guard rulemaking project and notice published in the
Federal Register.
Each rulemaking docket contains copies of every rulemaking document published for the project, public comments received, summaries of public meetings or hearings, regulatory assessments, and other publicly-available information. Members of the public may inspect the public docket and copy any documents in the docket. Public dockets for Coast Guard rulemakings are available electronically at
https://www.regulations.gov.
To access a rulemaking, enter the docket number associated with the rulemaking or notice in the “Search” box and click “Go

(b) The public dockets for Coast Guard rulemaking activity initiated by Coast Guard District Commanders are available for public inspection at the appropriate Coast Guard District office or online at
http://www.regulations.gov.
Paragraph (a) of this section describes how to access and view these documents.
(c) The public dockets for Coast Guard rulemaking activity initiated by Captains of the Port are available for
inspection at the appropriate Captains of the Port Office or online at
http://www.regulations.gov.

§ 1.05-30
Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM).
An advance notice of proposed rulemaking may be used to alert the affected public about a new regulatory project, or when the Coast Guard needs more information about what form proposed regulations should take, the actual need for a regulation, the cost of a proposal, or any other information. The ANPRM may solicit general information or ask the public to respond to specific questions.
§ 1.05-35
Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).
Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553, an NPRM is generally published in the
Federal Register
for Coast Guard rulemakings. The NPRM normally contains a preamble statement in sufficient detail to explain the proposal, its background, basis, and purpose, and the various issues involved. It also contains a discussion of any comments received in response to prior notices, a citation of legal authority for the rule, and the text of the proposed rule.
§ 1.05-40
Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM).
An SNPRM may be issued if a proposed rule has been substantially changed from the original notice of proposed rulemaking. The supplemental notice advises the public of the revised proposal and provides an opportunity for additional comment. To give the public a reasonable opportunity to become reacquainted with a rulemaking, a supplemental notice may also be issued if considerable time has elapsed since publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking. An SNPRM contains the same type of information generally included in an NPRM.
§ 1.05-45
Interim rule.
(a) An interim rule may be issued when it is in the public interest to promulgate an effective rule while keeping the rulemaking open for further refinement. For example, an interim rule may be issued in instances when normal procedures for notice and comment prior to issuing an effective rule are not required, minor changes to the final rule may be necessary after the interim rule has been in place for some time, or the interim rule only implements portions of a proposed rule, while other portions of the proposed rule are still under development.
(b) An interim rule will be published in the
Federal Register
with an effective date that will generally be at least 30 days after the date of publication. After the effective date, an interim rule is enforceable and is codified in the next annual revision of the appropriate title of the Code of Federal Regulations.
§ 1.05-50
Final rule.
When notice and comment procedures have been used, and after all comments received have been considered, a final rule is issued. A final rule document contains a preamble that responds to significant comments received and includes a discussion of changes made from the proposed or interim rule, a citation of legal authority, and the text of the rule. In some instances, a final rule may be issued without prior notice and comment.
[USCG-2018-0533, 85 FR 8172, Feb. 13, 2020]
§ 1.05-55
Direct final rule.
(a) A direct final rule may be issued to allow noncontroversial rules that are unlikely to result in adverse public comment to become effective more quickly.
(b) A direct final rule will be published in the
Federal Register
with an effective date that is generally at least 90 days after the date of publication.
(c) The public will usually be given at least 60 days from the date of publication in which to submit comments or notice of intent to submit comments.
(d) If no adverse comment or notice of intent to submit an adverse comment is received within the specified period, the Coast Guard will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
to confirm that the rule will go into effect as scheduled.
(e) If the Coast Guard receives a written adverse comment or a written notice of intent to submit an adverse comment, the Coast Guard will publish a notice in the final rule section of the
Federal Register
to announce withdrawal of the direct final rule. If an adverse comment clearly applies to only part of a rule, and it is possible to remove that part without affecting the remaining portions, the Coast Guard may adopt as final those parts of the rule on which no adverse comment was received. Any part of a rule that is the subject of an adverse comment will be withdrawn. If the Coast Guard decides to proceed with a rulemaking following receipt of an adverse comment, a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) will be published unless an exception to the Administrative Procedure Act requirements for notice and comment applies.
(f) A comment is considered adverse if the comment explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including a challenge to the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or unacceptable without a change.
[CGD 94-105, 60 FR 49224, Sept. 22, 1995]
§ 1.05-60
Negotiated rulemaking.
(a) The Coast Guard may establish a negotiated rulemaking committee under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 and the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. App. 2) when it is in the public interest.
(b) Generally, the Coast Guard will consider negotiated rulemaking when:
(1) There is a need for a rule;
(2) There are a limited number of representatives for identifiable parties affected by the rule;
(3) There is a reasonable chance that balanced representation can be reached in the negotiated rulemaking committee and that the committee members will negotiate in good faith;
(4) There is a likelihood of a committee consensus in a fixed time period;
(5) The negotiated rulemaking process will not unreasonably delay the rule;
(6) The Coast Guard has resources to do negotiated rulemaking; and
(7) The Coast Guard can use the consensus of the committee in formulating the NPRM and final rule.

§ 1.07-10
Reporting and investigation.
(a) Any person may report an apparent violation of any law, regulation, or order that is enforced by the Coast Guard to any Coast Guard facility. When a report of an apparent violation has been received, or when an apparent violation has been detected by any Coast Guard personnel, the matter is investigated or evaluated by Coast Guard personnel. Once an apparent violation has been investigated or evaluated, a report of the investigation may be sent to the District Commander or other designated official in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section or a Notice of Violation under § 1.07-11 may be given to the party by an issuing officer.
(b) Reports of any investigation conducted by the Coast Guard or received from any other agency which indicate that a violation may have occurred may be forwarded to a District Commander or other designated official for further action. This is normally the District Commander of the District in which the violation is believed to have occurred, or the District in which the reporting unit or agency is found. The report is reviewed to determine if there is sufficient evidence to establish a
prima facie
case. If there is insufficient evidence, the case is either returned for further investigation or closed if further action is unwarranted. The case is closed in situations in which the investigation has established that a violation did not occur, the violator is unknown, or there is little likelihood of discovering additional relevant facts. If it is determined that a

§ 1.07-20
Initiation of action.
(a) When a case is received for action, the Hearing Officer makes a preliminary examination of the material submitted. If, on the basis of the preliminary examination, the Hearing Officer determines that there is insufficient evidence to proceed, or that there is any other reason which would make penalty action inappropriate, the Hearing Officer returns the case to the District Commander with a written statement of the reason. The District Commander may close the case or cause a further investigation of the alleged violation to be made with a view toward resubmittal of the case to the Hearing Officer.

A hearing must be requested in writing; the request must specify the issues which are in dispute. Failure to specify a nonjurisdictional issue will preclude its consideration.
(b) The right to a hearing is waived if the party does not submit the request to the Hearing Officer within 30 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation. At the discretion of the Hearing Officer, a hearing may be granted if the party submits a late request.
(c) The Hearing Officer must promptly schedule all hearings which are requested. The Hearing Officer shall grant any delays or continuances which may be necessary or desirable in the interest of fairly resolving the case.
(d) A party who has requested a hearing may amend the specification of the issues in dispute at any time up to 10 days before the scheduled date of the hearing. Issues raised later than 10 days before the scheduled hearing may be presented only at the discretion of the Hearing Officer.

§ 1.07-30
Disclosure of evidence.
The alleged violator may, upon request, receive a free copy of all the written evidence in the case file, except material that would disclose or lead to the disclosure of the identity of
a confidential informant. Other evidence or material, such as blueprints, sound or video tapes, oil samples, and photographs may be examined in the Hearing Officer's offices. The Hearing Officer may provide for examination or testing of evidence at other locations if there are adequate safeguards to prevent loss or tampering.
§ 1.07-35
Request for confidential treatment.
(a) In addition to information treated as confidential under § 1.07-30, a request for confidential treatment of a document or portion thereof may be made by the person supplying the information on the basis that the information is:
(1) Confidential financial information, trade secrets, or other material exempt from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);
(2) Required to be held in confidence by 18 U.S.C. 1905; or
(3) Otherwise exempt by law from disclosure.
(b) The person desiring confidential treatment must submit the request to the Hearing Officer in writing and state the reasons justifying nondisclosure. Failure to make a timely request may result in a document being considered as nonconfidential and subject to release.
(c) Confidential material is not considered by the Hearing Officer in reaching a decision unless:
(1) It has been furnished by a party, or
(2) It has been furnished pursuant to a subpoena.
[CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by USCG-2002-12471, 67 FR 41331, June 18, 2002]

[CGD 87-008a, 52 FR 17554, May 11, 1987]
§ 1.07-50
Witnesses.
A party may present the testimony of any witness either through a personal appearance or through a written statement. The party may request the assistance of the Hearing Officer in obtaining the personal appearance of a witness. The request must be in writing and state the reasons why a written statement would be inadequate, the issue or issues to which the testimony would be relevant, and the substance of the expected testimony. If the Hearing Officer determines that the personal appearance of the witness may materially aid in the decision on the case, the Hearing Officer seeks to obtain the witness' appearance. Because many statutes prescribing civil penalties do not provide subpoena power, there may be cases where a witness cannot be required to attend. In such a case, the Hearing Officer may move the hearing to the witness' location, accept a written statement, or accept a stipulation in lieu of testimony. If none of these procedures is practical, the Hearing Officer shall proceed on the basis of the evidence before him.
[CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by USCG-2002-12471, 67 FR 41331, June 18, 2002]
§ 1.07-55
Hearing procedures.
(a) The Hearing Officer must conduct a fair and impartial proceeding in which the party is given a full opportunity to be heard. At the outset of the hearing, the Hearing Officer insures that the party is aware of the nature of the proceeding and of the alleged violation, and of the provisions of the law or regulation allegedly violated.
(b) The material in the case file pertinent to the issues to be determined
by the Hearing Officer is presented. The party has the right to examine, and to respond to or rebut, this material. The party may offer any facts, statements, explanations, documents, sworn or unsworn testimony, or other exculpatory items which bear on appropriate issues, or which may be relevant to the size of an appropriate penalty. The Hearing Officer may require the authentication of any written exhibit or statement.
(c) At the close of the party's presentation of evidence, the Hearing Officer may allow the introduction of rebuttal evidence. The Hearing Officer may allow the party to respond to any such evidence submitted.
(d) In receiving evidence, the Hearing Officer is not bound by strict rules of evidence. In evaluating the evidence presented, the Hearing Officer must give due consideration to the reliability and relevance of each item of evidence.
(e) The Hearing Officer may take notice of matters which are subject to a high degree of indisputability and are commonly known in the community or are ascertainable from readily available sources of known accuracy. Prior to taking notice of a matter, the Hearing Officer gives the party an opportunity to show why notice should not be taken. In any case in which notice is taken, the Hearing Officer places a written statement of the matters as to which notice was taken in the record, with the basis for such notice, including a statement that the party consented to notice being taken or a summary of the party's objections.
(f) After the evidence in the case has been presented, the party may present argument on the issues in the case. The party may also request an opportunity to submit a written statement for consideration by the Hearing Officer and for further review. The Hearing Officer shall allow a reasonable time for submission of the statement and shall specify the date by which it must be received. If the statement is not received within the time prescribed, or within the limits of any extension of time granted by the Hearing Officer, the Hearing Officer renders his decision in the case.
§ 1.07-60
Records.
(a) A verbatim transcript will not normally be prepared. The Hearing Officer prepares notes on the material and points raised by the party, in sufficient detail to permit a full and fair review and resolution of the case, should it be appealed.
(b) A party may, at its own expense, cause a verbatim transcript to be made. If a verbatim transcript is made, the party shall submit two copies to the Hearing Officer not later than the time of filing an administrative appeal. The Hearing Officer includes them in the record.
[CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by USCG-2002-12471, 67 FR 41331, June 18, 2002]
§ 1.07-65
Hearing Officer's decisions.
(a) The Hearing Officer issues a written decision. Any decision to assess a penalty is based upon substantial evidence in the record. If the Hearing Officer finds that there is not substantial evidence in the record establishing the alleged violation or some other violation of which the party had full and fair notice, the Hearing Officer shall dismiss the case and remand it to the District Commander. A dismissal is without prejudice to the District Commander's right to refile the case and have it reheard if additional evidence is obtained. A dismissal following a rehearing is final and with prejudice.
(b) If the Hearing Officer assesses a penalty, the Hearing Officer's decision contains a statement advising the party of the right to an administrative appeal. The party is advised that failure to submit an appeal within the prescribed time will bar its consideration and that failure to appeal on the basis of a particular issue will constitute a waiver of that issue in any subsequent proceeding.
[CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by CGD 85-001A, 51 FR 19329, May 29, 1986]

Right to appeal.
(a) Any appeal from the decision of the Hearing Officer must be submitted by a party within 30 days from the date of receipt of the decision. The appeal
and any supporting brief must be submitted to the Hearing Officer. The only issues which will be considered on appeal are those issues specified in the appeal which were properly raised before the Hearing Officer and jurisdictional questions.
(b) The failure to file an appeal within the prescribed time limit results in the action of the Hearing Officer becoming the final agency action in the case.
§ 1.07-75
Action on appeals.
(a) Upon receipt, the Hearing Officer provides a copy of the appeal and any supporting brief to the District Commander who referred the case. Any comments which the District Commander desires to submit must be received by the Hearing Officer within 30 days. The Hearing Officer includes the District Commander's comments, or not later than 30 days after receipt of the appeal if no comments are submitted by the District Commander, the Hearing Officer forwards all materials in the case to the Commandant.
(b) The Commandant issues a written decision in each case and furnishes copies to the party, the District Commander, and the Hearing Officer, The Commandant may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision, or remand the case for new or additional proceedings. In the absence of a remand, the decision of the Commandant on appeal shall be final. In addition to the actions which may be taken by the Commandant on appeal, the Commandant may also remit, mitigate or suspend the assessment in whole or in part. Upon the taking of remission, mitigation, or suspension action, the Commandant will inform the party of the action and any conditions placed on the action.

(c) The District Commander may file comments in opposition to the petition. If comments are filed, a copy is provided the party.
(d) A petition to reopen is considered by the Hearing Officer unless an appeal has been filed, in which case the petition is considered by the Commandant.
(e) The decision on the petition is decided on the basis of the record, the petition, and the comments in opposition, if any. The petition is granted only when newly found evidence is described which has a direct and material bearing on the issues and when a valid explanation is provided as to why the evidence was not and could not have been, in the exercise of due diligence, produced at the hearing. The decision is rendered in writing.
(f) Following a denial of a petition to reopen, the party is given 30 days to file an appeal if one has not already been filed, or to amend an appeal which has already been filed.
[CGD 78-82, 43 FR 54186, Nov. 20, 1978, as amended by CGD 87-008a, 52 FR 17555, May 11, 1987]

§ 1.26-15
Sales of nonexcess personal property and services.
(a)
Authority.
The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, section 901(b), authorizes the Coast Guard to sell apparatus or equipment manufactured by or in use in the Coast Guard, which is not readily procurable in the open market. The provisions of Title 14, U.S. Code, section 654 (Pub. L. 86-159 approved Aug. 14, 1959), authorize the Coast Guard to sell supplies and furnish services to public and commercial vessels, and other watercraft. 49 U.S.C. 44502(d) authorizes the Coast Guard to provide for assistance, the sale of fuel, oil, equipment, and supplies, to an aircraft when necessary to allow the aircraft to continue to the nearest private airport.
(b)
Charges established by District Commander.
The charges for supplies and services which may be normally expected to be furnished to persons, corporations, companies, vessels, and other watercraft, and non-Federal aircraft will vary between various geographical regions depending on local circumstances. The District Commander is hereby delegated authority to prescribe and he shall establish, in advance wherever practicable, the charges to be imposed and collected in various areas under his jurisdiction, which will be in accordance with the applicable general minimum terms and conditions in the laws and this section. In those cases where the charges have not been established in advance, the matter shall be priced on an individual basis, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances regarding the situation. The list(s) of charges established by the District Commander shall be available for reading and copying at the office of the issuing District Commander, which list(s) will be up-dated and reissued when necessary.
(c)
Sales to vessels and other watercraft.
(1) The charges imposed for services are intended to permit repayment of costs involved in those instances where supplies and services are furnished to meet the necessities of the circumstances, and such vessels or watercraft are not within the scope of those distress services performed by the Coast Guard.
(2) Charges for sales of supplies and/or furnishing of services are considered appropriate when the furnishing of food, fuel, general stores, or repairs to the vessel or its equipage are primarily for the convenience of the owner, master, or crew, and furnished at his or their request. It is not intended and the Coast Guard does not procure and stock equipment and supplies except as provided for in current instructions issued by competent authority.
(3) Supplies provided and services performed will be of a limited nature consistent with the situation and within the capabilities of the Coast Guard unit concerned; provided this will not be in competition with commercial enterprise when such facilities are available and deemed adequate. It is not intended to permit the operators of vessels or watercraft to take advantage of the Government by demanding free supplies or services. Determination as to whether charges will be made is dependent upon the circumstances involved in each instance. The responsibility to make this determination rests with the District Commander who may delegate it to his subordinates.
(4) The minimum charge for any supplies or services furnished to a vessel or other watercraft shall be $10. The prices for fuels and materials which may be sold will be at Coast Guard cost plus 20 percent or, if readily determinable, at the commercial price in the immediate operating area, whichever is higher. The charges for services furnished a vessel or watercraft will be an average cost equal to the full price, plus taxes, that a boat owner would pay a local commercial concern for such services.
(5) The sales of supplies and services will be documented and will set forth
the name, type, and identifying number of the vessel or watercraft receiving supplies or services; name and address of vessel's owner; and conditions under which it was determined to make a sale to the vessel or watercraft. Wherever possible, payment shall be obtained at the time supplies and services are furnished.
(d)
Sales of equipment not readily procurable on the open market.
Charges imposed for sales of apparatus and equipment manufactured by or in use in the Coast Guard which, in the opinion of the Commandant (CG-9), is not readily procurable in the open market, are subject to the following conditions:

(2) The apparatus or equipment is not classified for security reasons or is not dangerous to the public health and safety; and,
(3) The authorized buyers of this apparatus or equipment are foreign, State, or municipal governments or governmental units thereof; parties required to maintain private aids to navigation; contractors engaged on public works; and in other cases in which, in the judgment of the Commandant (FS), the public interest may be served; and,
(4) The approved sales will be at prices determined by the Commandant (CG-9), which will include an overhead charge not to exceed 25 percent of acquisition cost.
(e)
Sales to and storage of non-Federal aircraft.
(1) Activities having the necessary supplies and facilities are authorized to furnish fuel, oil, equipment, supplies, mechanical services, temporary storage, or other assistance to any aircraft operated by State, municipal, or private enterprise in emergency cases. Complete engines, airplane wings, or other major items of equipment shall not be furnished without prior authority from the Commandant.
(2) Aircraft damaged to the extent that major repairs are required may be given emergency storage at the request of the pilot, provided the necessary facilities are available. No such aircraft will be given a major or minor overhaul. Damaged aircraft may be stored in its original damaged condition. If aircraft requires extensive repairs, such as would include the replacing of major parts and such major parts cannot be made available or supplied within a reasonable length of time by the operator of such aircraft, then the aircraft must be removed from the Coast Guard reservation by the operator without delay.
(3) The Government will not assume any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred by such aircraft while on a Coast Guard reservation and the owner shall be required to remove the aircraft from the reservation at the earliest practicable date.
(4) Storage charges for such aircraft on a Coast Guard reservation shall be as follows:
(i) For the first 6 working days, no charge;
(ii) For each calendar day thereafter, $3 for a single motor plane and $5 for a dual or multiengine plane.
(5) In the absence of any information to the contrary regarding a particular item or material, the price at which the item is carried in stock, or on the Plant Property Record (book price) will be regarded as the fair market value.
(6) When materials or services or both materials and services are furnished an aircraft, a deposit equal to the estimated value of such services and materials as will be required shall be obtained in advance of the rendition of the services and issuance of the materials.
(7) The charges for mechanical services rendered (other than in connection with the arrival, refueling, and departure of airplanes) shall be an hourly charge for labor, with a minimum of 1 hour, which shall be the equivalent to the schedule of wage rates for civilian
personnel for the district (i.e., machinists, helpers, etc.), regardless of whether the services are performed by enlisted or civilian personnel.

(b)
Diplomatic transactions.
Sales of Coast Guard material under reimbursable aid will be by direction of the Commandant (CG-9) and as approved by the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations.

For example, the definition of “inland waters” in the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 (33 U.S.C. 2003(o)) would control the interpretation of inland
navigation rules created under that Act and the “inland waters” definition in 46 CFR 10.107 would control regulations in 46 CFR part 10. Also, in various laws administered and enforced by the Coast Guard, the terms “State” and “United States” are defined to include some or all of the territories and possessions of the United States. The definitions in §§ 2.36 and 2.38 should be considered as supplementary to these statutory definitions and not as interpretive of them.

# Subpart 3.01—General Provisions
§ 3.01-1
General description.
(a) The Coast Guard's general organization for the performance of its assigned functions and duties consists of the Commandant, assisted by the Headquarters staff, two Area Offices to act as intermediate echelons of operational command, and District and Sector Offices to provide regional direction and coordination. Area, District, and Sector offices operate within defined geographical areas of the United States, its territories, and possessions, including portions of the high seas adjacent thereto. They are established by the Commandant and their areas of responsibility are described in this part.
(b)(1) The two Coast Guard Areas are the Atlantic Area and the Pacific Area. A Coast Guard Area Commander is in command of a Coast Guard Area. The Atlantic Area Office is collocated with the Fifth Coast Guard District Office. The Pacific Area Office is collocated with the Eleventh Coast Guard District Office. Area Commanders are responsible for determining when operational matters require the coordination of forces and facilities of more than one district.
(2) For search and rescue (SAR) mission execution in the Atlantic Area, Districts may execute SAR missions to the full extent of the Area's Search and Rescue Region (SRR). Under this plan, Districts in the Atlantic Area will assume SAR Coordinator responsibilities and will act as SAR Mission Coordinator for any case prosecuted within their expanded regions. The exact coordinates of Atlantic Area's SRR can be found in the United States National Search and Rescue Supplement to the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual.
(c) A Coast Guard District Commander is in command of a Coast Guard District and the District Commander's office may be referred to as a Coast Guard District Office. The District Commander's duties are described in § 1.01-1 of this subchapter.
(d)(1) A Coast Guard Sector Commander is in command of a Coast Guard Sector and the Sector Commander's office is referred to as a Coast Guard Sector Office. The Sector Commander is responsible for all Coast Guard missions within the sector's area of responsibility. Unless otherwise specified, the Sector Commander's authorities include Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator, Federal Maritime Security Coordinator, Federal On-Scene Coordinator, and, in most Sectors, Officer in Charge Marine Inspection (OCMI) and Captain of the Port (COTP). In his or her capacities as OCMI and COTP, the Sector Commander is responsible for a Marine Inspection Zone and COTP Zone.
(2) In some Sectors, a Marine Safety Unit (MSU) retains OCMI and COTP authority over a designated portion of the Sector's area of responsibility. In such cases, OCMI and COTP authority is exercised by the MSU Commander, not the Sector Commander. The appeal of a COTP order or OCMI matter is routed from the MSU Commander through the Sector Commander and then to the District Commander.
(3) A specified sector exercises Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator (SMC) authority over a designated portion of an encompassing sector's area of responsibility. In such cases, SMC authority is exercised by the encompassed sector, not the encompassing sector. The encompassing sector retains all other authorities (as listed in 33 CFR 3.01-1(d)(1)) over the designated area.
(e) An OCMI is in command of a Marine Inspection Zone and his or her office may be referred to as a Coast Guard Marine Inspection Office. The OCMI's duties are described in § 1.01-20 of this subchapter.
(f) A COTP is in command of a COTP Zone and his or her office may be referred to as a COTP Office. The COTP's duties are described in § 1.01-30 of this subchapter.
(g) Each COTP Zone and each Marine Inspection Zone described in this part also includes the United States territorial seas adjacent to the described
area or zone for the purpose of enforcing or acting pursuant to a statute effective in the United States territorial seas. Each COTP Zone and each Marine Inspection Zone described in this part also includes the contiguous zone adjacent to the area or zone for the purpose of enforcing or acting pursuant to a statute effective in the contiguous zone, as defined in § 2.28 of this subchapter. Each COTP Zone and each Marine Inspection Zone described in this part also includes the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) adjacent to the area for the purpose of enforcing or acting pursuant to a statute effective in the EEZ, as defined in § 2.30 of this subchapter.
(h) Geographic descriptions used in this part are based upon boundaries and points located using the WGS 1984 world grid system. When referenced, the outermost extent of the U.S. EEZ is the line of demarcation produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) using the NAD 1983 coordinate system and projected to the WGS 1984 grid system. Both coordinate systems are geocentric and similar such that they are Global Positioning System (GPS) compatible throughout the area of concern. Resolution is based upon ddmmss readings to tenths of a second. This corresponds to a positional precision of about ±2 meters. Decimal degrees to 5 decimal places correspond to a positional precision of about ±1 meter. State boundaries used to determine points for descriptions of jurisdictional limits were based upon the National Transportation Atlas Database 2003 produced by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This data set was produced at a scale of 1:100,000 and theoretically results in a nationwide locational accuracy of about ±50 meters of true position.

§ 13.01-1
General.

[CGFR 68-134, 33 FR 18932, Dec. 19, 1968, as amended by USCG-2020-0304, 85 FR 58276, Sept. 18, 2020]
§ 13.01-5
Gold and Silver Lifesaving Medals.
Lifesaving Medals may be awarded to any person who rescues or endeavors to rescue any other person from drowning, shipwreck or other peril of the
water. In order for a person to be eligible for a Lifesaving Medal the rescue or attempted rescue must take place in waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place outside such waters, one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the United States or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United States. If such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold. If such rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of gold but evidences the exercise of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver. Lifesaving Medals may be awarded posthumously.
§ 13.01-10
Gold and silver bars.
No person shall receive more than one Gold Lifesaving Medal and one Silver Lifesaving Medal; but any person who has received or may hereafter receive a Gold or Silver Lifesaving Medal and who again performs an act which would entitle him to receive another medal of the same class, may be awarded, in lieu of a second medal of the same class, a gold or silver bar, as the case may be, to be worn with the medal already bestowed, and for every such additional act, an additional bar may be awarded. Gold and silver bars may be awarded posthumously.
§ 13.01-15
Applications and recommendations.
(a) All administrative details pertaining to the award of Lifesaving Medals are under the jurisdiction of the Commandant. Applications and recommendations for the award of a Lifesaving Medal may be filed by or in behalf of the person making or attempting a rescue under circumstances contemplated by the regulations in this subpart. Applications or recommendations for award of medals or requests for information pertaining thereto should be addressed to the Commander of the Coast Guard District, hereinafter called the District Commander, where the incident took place. (See part 3 of this subchapter for descriptions of Coast Guard Districts.)

(b) Completed applications must include:
(1) Satisfactory evidence of the services performed, in the form of affidavits, made by eyewitnesses of good repute and standing testifying of their own knowledge. The opinion of witnesses that the person for whom an award is sought imperiled his or her own life or made signal exertions is not sufficient but the affidavits must set forth in detail all facts and occurrences tending to show clearly in what manner and to what extent life was risked or signal exertions made so that the Commandant may judge for himself as to the degree of merit involved.
(2) The precise locality of the rescue or attempted rescue, whether from waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or if the rescue or attempted rescue is outside such waters, whether one or the other of the parties is a citizen of the United States, or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United States, shall be stated. The date, time of day, nature of the weather, condition of the water, the names of all persons present when practicable, the names of all persons rendering assistance, and all pertinent circumstances and data, showing the precise nature and degree of risk involved, should be stated.
(c) Recommendations must include:
(1) As much of the information indicated in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section which is available to the person making the recommendation.

further, or (ii) to complete the application for submission to the Commandant for his final determination.
(d) Either the Commandant or the District Commander may, without any application or recommendation, of his own motion, order an informal investigation into such an incident under Administrative Investigations Manual, COMDTINST M5830.1A (2007).
(e) Affidavits required by this subpart shall be made before an officer duly authorized to administer oaths and if taken before an officer without an official seal, his official character must be certified by the proper officer of a court of record, under the seal thereof, unless the oath be taken before an officer of the Armed Forces authorized to administer oaths under the provisions of Article 136, UCMJ (10 U.S.C. 936).
(f) Cognizant District Commanders shall act upon all applications and recommendations submitted to them from whatever source and shall:
(1) Forward completed applications with his recommendations to the Commandant for his consideration and determination; or,
(2) Inform the applicant or the person submitting the recommendation that he considers such application or recommendation incomplete together with the reasons therefor and that a period of 90 days will be allowed for additional evidence to be provided upon the expiration of which he will file the application or recommendation without further action.
(g) Whenever the cognizant District Commander shall deem such action necessary, he may require that the aforementioned affidavits shall be accompanied by a certificate showing the affiants to be credible persons, certified by some U.S. Officer, such as a judge or clerk of a U.S. Court, district attorney, collector of customs, postmaster, or officer of the Armed Forces. If the affiant is a citizen or resident of a foreign country and if the affidavit is executed in such foreign country, the credibility certificate may be executed by an officer of such foreign country, who occupies an official position similar to the aforementioned U.S. officers.
(h) The decision of the Commandant on all applications, recommendations, and investigations for the Gold or Silver Lifesaving Medals shall be final.

Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the application shall be in writing. The application shall be delivered to the Coast Guard District Commander or to his designated representative at the port or place where the vessel is located. In the case of a vessel in any port or place of the Canal Zone or in any foreign port or place, the application shall be made to the designated representative of the Commandant at such port or place, or if the Coast Guard has not established facilities in such port or place, to the nearest designated representative of the Commandant at a port or place where such facilities have been established. Every application shall contain a statement of the particular provisions of law with respect to which waiver of compliance is requested, a certification that the waiver of compliance with such laws with respect to the vessel involved is necessary in the interest of national defense and, an outline of the facts upon which such certification is based. The Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative or the designated representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) shall promptly examine every application for the purpose of determining whether the necessity for prompt action is such as to require that the waiver be made effective by him without reference to the Commandant. In any case in which it appears to the Coast Guard officer concerned that reference of the application to the Commandant for action would not delay the sailing of the vessel or otherwise be contrary to the interest of national defense, the application shall be so referred. In all other cases such Coast Guard officer shall give immediate consideration to the application and if he reaches the conclusion that the urgency of the situation outweighs the marine hazard involved, then such waiver shall be made effective in regard to such vessel to the extent and under the circumstances specified by him.
(c) The Coast Guard officer making such a waiver effective pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall immediately prepare, in triplicate, an order setting forth the name of the vessel involved, the laws (also regulations, if any) with respect to which the waiver is effective, the extent to which compliance with such laws (also regulations, if any) is waived, and the period for which the waiver shall be effective. If practicable, one copy of this order shall be delivered to the master of the vessel involved before such vessel sails. In any case where the order is not delivered to the master, it shall be delivered to the owner, operator, or
agent of the vessel without delay. One copy of the order shall be transmitted to the Commandant and the remaining copy kept on file.
(d) In any case of extreme urgency the application for a waiver may be made orally and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative or the designated representative of the Commandant, as the case may be) reaches the conclusion referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, the waiver shall be made effective without further delay, subject to the condition that the application be reduced to writing and delivered within such period after the date of the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the waiver effective shall specify in the order.
(e) No penalty shall be imposed because of failure to comply with any provision of law (or regulation, if any), the waiver of which has been made effective pursuant to the requirements in this section.

(3) The extent to which compliance with such laws and/or regulations is waived; and

In any case where the waiver order is not delivered to the master, it shall be delivered to the owner, operator, or agent of the vessel without delay. One copy of the waiver order shall be delivered to the Commander, Military Sealift Command, or his duly designated representative, who submitted the application. One copy of the waiver order shall be transmitted to the Commandant (CG-CVC) and the remaining copy kept on file.
(e) In any case of extreme urgency, the application for a waiver order may be made orally and if the Coast Guard District Commander (or his designated representative, or the designated representative of the Commandant, or the Commandant, as the case may be), determines that the conditions in this section have been met, the waiver order shall be made effective without further delay, subject to the condition that the application be reduced to writing and delivered within such period after the date of the oral request as the Coast Guard officer making the waiver effective shall specify in the confirming written waiver order.
(f) No penalty shall be imposed because of failure to comply with any provision of law and/or regulation, the waiver of which has been made effective pursuant to the requirements of this section.

(b) The ALJ may issue a subpoena directing a witness to testify by telephonic conference call. The subpoena in any such instance issues under the procedures in § 20.608.
§ 20.708
Witnesses' fees.
(a) Each witness summoned in an administrative proceeding shall receive the same fees and mileage as a witness in a District Court of the United States.
(b) The party or interested person who calls a witness is responsible for all fees and mileage due under paragraph (a) of this section.
§ 20.709
Closing of the record.
(a) When the ALJ closes the hearing, he or she shall also close the record of the proceeding, as described in § 20.903, unless he or she directs otherwise. Even after the ALJ closes it, he or she may reopen it.
(b) The ALJ may correct the transcript of the hearing by appropriate order.
§ 20.710
Proposed findings, closing arguments, and briefs.
(a) Before the ALJ closes the hearing, he or she may hear oral argument so far as he or she deems appropriate.
(b) Before the ALJ decides the case, and upon terms he or she finds reasonable, any party may file a brief, proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, or both. Any party may waive this right. If all parties waive it, then the ALJ may issue an oral order at the close of the hearing.
(c) Any oral argument, brief, or proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law form part of the record of the proceeding, as described in § 20.903.

# Subpart H—Evidence
§ 20.801
General.
Any party may present his or her case or defense by oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence; submit rebuttal evidence; and conduct any cross-examination that may be necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
§ 20.802
Admissibility of evidence.
(a) The ALJ may admit any relevant oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence, unless privileged. Relevant evidence is evidence tending to make the existence of any material fact more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.
(b) The ALJ may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice, by confusion of the issues, or by reasonable concern for undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
§ 20.803
Hearsay evidence.
Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings governed by this part. The ALJ may consider the fact that evidence is hearsay when determining its probative value.
§ 20.804
Objections and offers of proof.
(a) Any party objecting to the admission or exclusion of evidence shall concisely state the grounds. A ruling on every objection must appear in the record. No party may raise an objection to the admission or exclusion of evidence on appeal unless he or she raised it before the ALJ.
(b) Whenever evidence is objected to, the party offering it may make an offer of proof, which must appear in the record.
§ 20.805
Proprietary information.
(a) The ALJ may limit introduction of evidence or issue such protective or other orders as in his or her judgment are consistent with the object of preventing undue disclosure of proprietary matters, including, among others, ones of a commercial nature.
(b) When the ALJ determines that information in a document containing proprietary matters should be made available to another party, the ALJ may direct the party possessing the document to prepare a non-proprietary summary or extract of it. The summary or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record.
(c) If the ALJ determines that a non-proprietary summary or extract is inadequate and that proprietary matters must form part of the record to avert prejudice to a party, the ALJ may so advise the parties and arrange access to the evidence for a party or representative.
§ 20.806
Official notice.
The ALJ may take official notice of such matters as could courts, or of other facts within the specialized knowledge of the Coast Guard as an expert body. When all or part of a decision rests on the official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, the decision must state as much; and any party, upon timely request, shall receive an opportunity to rebut the fact.
§ 20.807
Exhibits and documents.
(a) Each exhibit must be numbered and marked for identification by the party offering it. The original of each exhibit so marked, whether or not offered or admitted into evidence, must be filed and retained in the record of the proceeding, unless the ALJ permits the substitution of a copy. The party introducing each exhibit so marked shall supply a copy of the exhibit to the ALJ and to every party to the proceeding.
(b) Unless the ALJ directs otherwise, each party who would offer an exhibit upon direct examination shall make it available to every other party for inspection 15 days or more before the hearing. The ALJ will deem admitted the authenticity of each exhibit submitted before the hearing unless a party either files written objection and serves it on all parties or shows good cause for failure to do both.
(c) In class II civil penalty proceedings under 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(6), each exhibit introduced by an interested person must be marked, and filed and retained in the record of the proceeding, unless the ALJ permits the substitution of a copy. The interested person shall supply a copy of the exhibit to the ALJ and to every party to the proceeding. The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section apply to any interested person who would offer an exhibit upon direct examination.
§ 20.808
Written testimony.
The ALJ may enter into the record the written testimony of a witness. The witness shall be, or have been, available for oral cross-examination. The statement must be sworn to, or affirmed, under penalty of perjury.
§ 20.809
Stipulations.
Any party or interested person may stipulate, in writing, at any stage of the proceeding, or orally at the hearing, to any pertinent fact or other matter fairly susceptible of stipulation. A stipulation binds all parties to it.

# Subpart I—Decisions
§ 20.901
Summary decisions.
(a) Any party may move for a summary decision in all or any part of the proceeding on the grounds that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law. The party must file the motion no later than 15 days before the date fixed for the hearing and may include supporting affidavits with the motion. Any other party, 10 days or less after service of a motion for summary decision, may serve opposing affidavits or countermove for summary decision. The ALJ may set the matter for argument and call for the submission of briefs.
(b) The ALJ may grant the motion if the filed affidavits, the filed documents, the material obtained by discovery or otherwise, or matters officially noted show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that a
party is entitled to a summary decision as a matter of law.
(c) Each affidavit must set forth such matters as would be admissible in evidence and must show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit. Once a party has moved for summary decision and supported his or her motion as provided in this section, no party opposing the motion may rest upon the mere allegations or denials of facts contained in his or her own pleadings. The response to the motion, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this section, must provide a specific basis to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact for the hearing.
(d) If it appears from the affidavit of a party opposing the motion that this party cannot, for reasons stated, present by affidavit matters essential to justify his or her opposition, the ALJ may deny the motion for summary decision, may order a continuance to enable the obtaining of information, or may make such other order as is just.
(e) No denial of all or any part of a motion for summary decision is subject to interlocutory appeal.
§ 20.902
Decisions of the ALJ.
(a) After closing the record of the proceeding, the ALJ shall prepare a decision containing—
(1) A finding on each material issue of fact and conclusion of law, and the basis for each finding;
(2) The disposition of the case, including any appropriate order;
(3) The date upon which the decision will become effective;
(4) A statement of further right to appeal; and,
(5) If no hearing was held, a statement of the right of any interested person to petition the Commandant to set aside the decision.
(b) The decision of the ALJ must rest upon a consideration of the whole record of the proceedings.
(c) The ALJ may, upon motion of any party or in his or her own discretion, render the initial decision from the bench (orally) at the close of the hearing and prepare and serve a written order on the parties or their authorized representatives. In rendering his or her decision from the bench, the ALJ shall state the issues in the case and make clear, on the record, his or her findings of fact and conclusions of law.
(d) If the ALJ renders the initial decision orally, and if a party asks for a copy, the Hearing Docket Clerk shall furnish a copy excerpted from the transcript of the record. The date of the decision is the date of the oral rendering of the decision by the ALJ.
§ 20.903
Records of proceedings.
(a) The transcript of testimony at the hearing, all exhibits received into evidence, any items marked as exhibits and not received into evidence, all motions, all applications, all requests, and all rulings constitute the official record of a proceeding. This record also includes any motions or other matters regarding the disqualification of the ALJ.
(b) Any person may examine the record of a proceeding at the U. S. Coast Guard Administrative Law Judge Docketing Center; Room 412; 40 S. Gay Street; Baltimore, MD 21201-4022. Any person may obtain a copy of part or all of the record after payment of reasonable costs for duplicating it in accordance with 49 CFR part 7.
§ 20.904
Reopening.
(a) To the extent permitted by law, the ALJ may, for good cause shown in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, reopen the record of a proceeding to take added evidence.
(b) Any party may move to reopen the record of a proceeding 30 days or less after the closing of the record.
(1) Each motion to reopen the record must clearly set forth the facts that the movant would try to prove and the grounds for reopening the record.
(2) Any party who does not respond to any motion to reopen the record waives any objection to the motion.
(c) The ALJ may reopen the record of a proceeding if he or she believes that any change in fact or law, or that the public interest, warrants reopening it.
(d) The filing of a motion to reopen the record of a proceeding does not affect any period for appeals specified in subpart J of this part, except that the filing of such a motion tolls the running of whatever time remains in the
period for appeals until either the ALJ acts on the motion or the party filing it withdraws it.
(e)(1) At any time, a party may file a petition to reopen with the Docketing Center for the ALJ to rescind any order suspending or revoking a merchant mariner's license, certificate of registry, credential, or endorsement document if—
(i) The order rests on a conviction—
(A) For violation of a dangerous-drug law;
(B) Of an offense that would prevent the issuance or renewal of the license, certificate, credential, or endorsement document; or
(C) Of an offense described in subparagraph 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the National Driver Register Act of 1982 (23 U.S.C. 401, note); and
(ii) The respondent submits a specific order of court to the effect that the conviction has been unconditionally set aside for all purposes.
(2) The ALJ, however, may not rescind his or her order on account of any law that provides for a subsequent conditional setting-aside, modification, or expunging of the order of court, by way of granting clemency or other relief after the conviction has become final, without regard to whether punishment was imposed.
(f) Three years or less after an S
R proceeding has resulted in revocation of a credential, endorsement, license, certificate, or document, the respondent may file a motion for reopening of the proceeding to modify the order of revocation with the ALJ Docketing Center.
(1) Any motion to reopen the record must clearly state why the basis for the order of revocation is no longer valid and how the issuance of a new merchant mariner credential with appropriate endorsement is compatible with the requirement of good discipline and safety at sea.
(2) Any party who does not respond to any petition to reopen the record waives any objection to the motion.
[CGD 98-3472, 64 FR 28062, May 24, 1999, as amended by USCG-2006-24371, 74 FR 11211, Mar. 16, 2009]

# Subpart M—Supplementary Evidentiary Rules for Suspension and Revocation Hearings
§ 20.1301
Purpose.
This subpart contains evidentiary rules that apply only in certain circumstances in S
R proceedings. They supplement, not supplant, the evidentiary rules in subpart H.
§ 20.1303
Authentication and certification of extracts from shipping articles, logbooks, and the like.
(a) The investigating officer, the Coast Guard representative, any other commissioned officer of the Coast
Guard, or any official custodian of extracts from shipping articles, logbooks, or records in the custody of the Coast Guard may authenticate and certify the extracts.
(b) Authentication and certification must include a statement that the person acting has seen the original, compared the copy with it, and found the copy to be a true one. This person shall sign his or her name and identify himself or herself by rank or title and by duty station.
§ 20.1305
Admissibility and weight of entries from logbooks.
(a) Any entry in any official logbook of a vessel concerning an offense enumerated in 46 U.S.C. 11501, made in substantial compliance with the procedural requirements of 46 U.S.C. 11502, is admissible in evidence and constitutes
prima facie
evidence of the facts recited.
(b) Any entry in any such logbook made in substantial compliance with the procedural requirements of 46 U.S.C. 11502 may receive added weight from the ALJ.
§ 20.1307
Use of judgments of conviction.
(a) A judgment of conviction by a Federal court is conclusive in any S
R proceeding under this part concerning any act or offense described in 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704 when the act or offense is the same as in the Federal conviction.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no judgment of conviction by a State court is conclusive in any S
R proceeding under this part concerning any act or offense described in 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704, even when an act or offense forming the basis of the charge in the proceeding is the same as in the State conviction. But the judgment is admissible in evidence and constitutes substantial evidence adverse to the respondent.
(c) A judgment of conviction by a Federal or State court for a violation is conclusive in the proceeding if an S
R proceeding alleges conviction for—
(1) A violation of a dangerous-drug law;
(2) An offense that would prevent the issuance or renewal of a merchant mariner's license, merchant mariner credential, certificate of registry, or document; or
(3) An offense described in subparagraph 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the National Driver Register Act of 1982 (23 U.S.C.S. 401, note).
(d) If the respondent participates in the scheme of a State for the expungement of convictions, and if he or she pleads
guilty
or
no contest
or, by order of the trial court, has to attend classes, contribute time or money, receive treatment, submit to any manner of probation or supervision, or forgo appeal of the finding of the trial court, the Coast Guard regards him or her, for the purposes of 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704, as having received a conviction. The Coast Guard does not consider the conviction expunged without proof that the expungement is due to the conviction's having been in error.
(e) No respondent may challenge the jurisdiction of a Federal or State court in any proceeding under 46 U.S.C. 7703 or 7704.
[CGD 98-3472, 64 FR 28062, May 24, 1999, as amended by USCG-2006-24371, 74 FR 11211, Mar. 16, 2009]

(b) The prior disciplinary record of the respondent is admissible when offered by the Coast Guard representative to impeach the credibility of evidence offered by the respondent.
(c) The use of a judgment of conviction is permissible on the terms prescribed by § 20.1307.
§ 20.1311
Admissions by respondent.
No person may testify regarding admissions made by the respondent during an investigation under 46 CFR part 4, except to impeach the credibility of evidence offered by the respondent.
§ 20.1313
Medical examination of respondents.
In any proceeding in which the physical or mental condition of the respondent is relevant, the ALJ may order him or her to undergo a medical examination. Any examination ordered by the ALJ is conducted, at Federal expense, by a physician designated by the ALJ. If the respondent fails or refuses to undergo any such examination, the failure or refusal receives due weight and may be sufficient for the ALJ to infer that the results would have been adverse to the respondent.
§ 20.1315
Submission of prior records and evidence in aggravation or mitigation.
(a) The prior disciplinary record of the respondent comprises the following items less than 10 years old:
(1) Any written warning issued by the Coast Guard and not contested by the respondent.
(2) Final agency action by the Coast Guard on any S
R proceeding in which a sanction or consent order was entered.
(3) Any agreement for voluntary surrender entered into by the respondent.
(4) Any final judgment of conviction in Federal or State courts.
(5) Final agency action by the Coast Guard resulting in the imposition against the respondent of any civil penalty or warning in a proceeding administered by the Coast Guard under this title.
(6) Any official commendatory information concerning the respondent of which the Coast Guard representative is aware. The Coast Guard representative may offer evidence and argument in aggravation of any charge proved. The respondent may offer evidence of, and argument on, prior maritime service, including both the record introduced by the Coast Guard representative and any commendatory evidence.
(b) The respondent may offer evidence and argument in mitigation of any charge proved.

§ 25.107
Who may present claims.
(a) General rules:
(1) A claim for property loss or damage may be presented by anyone having an interest in the property, including an insurer or other subrogee, unless the interest is barred under § 25.109(a).
(2) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the person injured.
(3) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or administrator of the decedent's estate, or any other person legally entitled to assert such a claim under local law. The claimant's status must be stated in the claim.
(4) A claim for medical, hospital, or burial expenses may be presented by any person who by reason of family relationship has, in fact, incurred the expenses.
(b) A joint claim must be presented in the names of and signed by, the joint claimants, and the settlement must be made payable to the joint claimants.
(c) A claim may be presented by a duly authorized agent, legal representative or survivor, if it is presented in the name of the claimant. If the claim is not signed by the claimant, the agent, legal representative, or survivor shall indicate their title or legal capacity and provide evidence of their authority to present the claim.
(d) Where the same claimant has a claim for damage to or loss of property and a claim for personal injury or a claim based on death arising out of the same incident, they must be combined in one claim.
§ 25.109
Insurance and other subrogated claims.
(a) The claims of an insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) for damages arising out of the same incident constitute a single claim. The total award of combined claims may not exceed the monetary jurisdiction of the settlement authority. If the total award of the combined claims exceeds, or is expected to exceed, a settlement authority's limits, the settlement authority is not permitted to consider either, and the claim file will be forwarded to an appropriate settlement authority.
(b) An insured (subrogor) and an insurer (subrogee) may file a claim jointly or separately. If the insurer has fully reimbursed the insured, payment will only be made to the insurer. If separate claims are filed, the settlement will be made payable to each claimant to the extent of that claimant's undisputed interest. If joint claims are filed, the settlement will be sent to the insurer.
(c) Each claimant shall include with a claim, a written disclosure concerning insurance coverage including:
(1) The names and addresses of all insurers;
(2) The kind and amount of insurance;
(3) The policy number;
(4) Whether a claim has been or will be presented to an insurer, and, if so, the amount of that claim; and whether the insurer has paid the claim in whole or in part, or has indicated payment will be made.
(d) Each subrogee shall substantiate an interest or right to file a claim by
appropriate documentary evidence and shall support the claim as to liability and measure of damages in the same manner as required of any other claimant. Documentary evidence of payment to a subrogor does not constitute evidence of liability of the United States or conclusive evidence of the amount of damages. The settlement authority makes an independent determination on the issues of fact and law based upon the evidence of record.
(e) An insurance or other subrogated claim is not payable under Subpart E, F, or G of this part.
§ 25.111
Action by claimant.
(a)

(a) For each particular lost item, evidence of its value such as a bill of sale and a written appraisal, or two written appraisals, from separate disinterested dealers or brokers, market quotations, commercial catalogs, or other evidence of the price at which like property can be obtained in the community. The settlement authority may waive these requirements when circumstances warrant. The cost of any appraisal may be included as an element of damage if not deductible from any bill submitted to claimant.
(b) For each particular damaged item which can be economically repaired, evidence of cost of repairs such as a receipted bill and one estimate, or two estimates, from separate disinterested repairmen. The settlement authority may waive these requirements when circumstances warrant. The cost of any estimate may be included as an element of damage if not deductible from any repair bill submitted to claimant.
(c) For any claim which may result in payment in excess of $20,000.00, a survey or appraisal shall be performed as soon as practicable after the damage accrues, and, unless waived in writing, shall be performed jointly with a government representative.
(d) If the item is so severely damaged that it cannot be economically repaired or used, it shall be treated as a lost item.
(e) If a claim includes loss of earnings or use during repairs to the damaged property, the following must also be furnished and supported by competent evidence:

(f) For each item which is lost, actual or constructive, proof of ownership.
§ 25.121
Effect of other payments to claimant.
The total amount to which the claimant may be entitled is normally computed as follows:
(a) The total amount of the loss, damage, or personal injury suffered for which the United States is liable, less any payment the claimant has received from the following sources:
(1) The military member or civilian employee who caused the incident;
(2) The military member's or civilian employee's insurer; and
(3) Any joint tort-feasor or insurer.
(b) No deduction is generally made for any payment the claimant has received by way of voluntary contributions, such as donations of charitable organizations.
§ 25.123
Settlement and notice to claimant.
(a) If the settlement authority determines that the full amount claimed should be paid, the settlement authority forwards the claim to the disbursing officer for payment. If the time involved in settling the claim has been extensive, the settlement authority notifies the claimant.
(b) If the settlement authority determines that less than the full amount claimed should be paid, the settlement authority:
(1) Notifies the claimant in writing of the proposed settlement.
(2) Obtains from the claimant written acceptance and release for payment of the claim in the reduced amount.
(3) Advises the claimant, in the event claimant does not desire to accept the offer, to reply within 45 days giving reasons for rejection.
(4) Except upon a showing of good cause for delay in accepting a proposed settlement within 45 days, treats the non-acceptance as a rejection. Rejection by a claimant of an offer of settlement renders the offer void.
(5) If a claimant rejects a proposed settlement or fails to reply within 45 days, the settlement authority may make further efforts to settle the claim. When the settlement authority determines that further efforts to settle the claim are not warranted, the settlement authority notifies the claimant in writing by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, that the claim has been denied because the amount claimed is excessive.
(c) If the claim is denied, the settlement authority notifies the claimant in writing by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
§ 25.125

§ 25.127
Reconsideration.
(a) The settlement authority may reconsider a claim upon the authority's own initiative or upon request of the claimant or someone acting on the claimant's behalf.
(b) A request for reconsideration must be in writing and include the legal or factual grounds for the relief requested.
(c) Following any investigation or other action deemed necessary for reconsideration of the original action, the settlement authority reconsiders the claim and if warranted attempts to settle it. When further settlement efforts appear unwarranted, the settlement authority notifies the claimant in writing by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, that the relief requested is denied.
(d) For the effect of reconsideration under the Federal Tort Claims Act see 28 CFR Part 14.
§ 25.129
Acceptance of offer of settlement.
Claimant's acceptance of an offer of settlement is a complete release of any claim against the United States and against the military or civilian personnel of the Coast Guard whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.
§ 25.131
Delegation of authority.

# Subpart 49.01—General Provisions
§ 49.01-1
Applicability.
The Commandant of the Coast Guard is hereby designated and is authorized to appoint, in his discretion, the person or persons who may receive active-duty pay and allowances, amounts due for accumulated or accrued leave, or any retired or retainer pay, otherwise payable to personnel on the active or retired list of the Coast Guard and Coast Guard Reserve, entitled to Federal pay either on the active or any retired list of said service, who, in the opinion of competent medical authority, have been determined to be mentally incapable of managing their own affairs, and for whom no legal committee, guardian, or other representative has been appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 49.01-5
Requests for appointment of trustee.
Requests for the appointment of a person or persons to receive moneys due personnel believed to be mentally incapable of managing their own affairs shall be submitted to the Commandant of the Coast Guard:
(a) By any person or persons who believe, because of relationship, they should be appointed to receive payments on behalf of the alleged incompetent;
(b) By the Commanding Officer of the alleged incompetent if the latter is on active duty;
(c) By the Commanding Officer of any Armed Forces hospital in which the mentally incompetent is undergoing treatment;
(d) By the head of any veterans' hospital, or other public or private institution in which the alleged incompetent is undergoing treatment;
(e) By any other person or organization acting for and in the best interests of the alleged mentally incompetent.
§ 49.01-10
Determination of incompetency.
After examining the legitimacy, substance, and sufficiency of the application, the Commandant shall either (a) direct the Commanding Officer of the alleged mentally incompetent, (b) the Commanding Officer of the Coast Guard unit to which such incompetent may be conveniently referred, or (c) request the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service to convene or appoint, at the Public Health Hospital or facility, where the alleged incompetent is receiving treatment or to which his case may be conveniently referred, a board of not less than three qualified medical officers, one of whom shall be specially qualified in the treatment of mental disorders, to determine whether the alleged incompetent is capable of managing his own affairs. The record of proceedings, and the findings of the board shall, after action by the Convening or Appointive Authority thereon, be forwarded to the Commandant.

# Subpart 49.05—Trustee
§ 49.05-1
Appointment of trustee.
Upon receipt of a finding by a board convened or appointed in accordance with § 49.01-10, that the alleged incompetent is mentally incapable of managing his own affairs, the Commandant may appoint a suitable person or persons, not under legal disability so to
act, as trustee or trustees to receive in behalf of the incompetent all amounts due the incompetent from such sources set forth in § 49.01-1, and to use said funds in the best interests of the incompetent.
§ 49.05-5
Bonding of trustee.
The trustee or trustees appointed to receive moneys in behalf of incompetent personnel shall furnish a bond in all cases when the amounts to be received may be expected to exceed $1,000, and in such other cases when deemed appropriate by the Commandant. The bond so required and furnished shall have as surety a company approved by the Federal Government, and shall be in such amount as is required by the Commandant. Such bonds shall be continued in effect for the life of trusteeship and expenses in connection with the furnishing and renewal of such bonds may be paid out of sums due the incompetent.
§ 49.05-10
Affidavits required.
The trustee or trustees appointed to receive moneys due incompetent personnel shall, prior to the payment of any such moneys, execute and file with the Commandant an affidavit or affidavits saying and deposing that any moneys henceforth received by virtue of such appointment shall be applied solely to the use and benefit of the incompetent and that no fee, commission, or charge shall be demanded, or in any manner accepted, for any service or services rendered in connection with such appointment as trustee or trustees.

# Subpart 49.10—Reports and Moneys
§ 49.10-1
Reports required.
The trustee or trustees so appointed shall submit reports annually, or at such other times as the Commandant may designate. The report shall show a statement of the conditions of the trust account at the time of the submission of the report, including all funds received on behalf of the incompetent; all expenditures made in behalf of the incompetent, accompanied by receipts or vouchers covering such expenditures; and a receipt indicating that the surety bond required by § 49.05-5 has been renewed. When the trustee is the spouse or adult dependent of the incompetent, receipts or vouchers need not be filed for expenditures made for living expenses. If the trustee or trustees fail to report promptly and properly at the end of any annual period or at such other times as the Commandant desires, the Commandant may, in his discretion, cause payment to such trustee or trustees to cease, and may, if deemed advisable, appoint another person or persons not under legal disability so to act, to receive future payments of moneys due the incompetent for the use and benefit of the incompetent.
§ 49.10-5
Payment of moneys due.
Upon the appointment of a trustee or trustees to receive moneys due an incompetent, the authorized certifying officer having custody of that person's pay record shall be advised. After such notification, payments of moneys due the incompetent may be made by the appropriate officer in accordance with procedure prescribed by the Commandant. All such payments so made, however, shall be made to the designated trustee or trustees.
§ 49.10-10
Cessation of payments.
(a) Payments of amounts due incompetent personnel shall cease to be paid to the trustee or trustees upon receipt of notification by the authorized certifying officer of the occurrence of any of the following:
(1) Death of the incompetent;
(2) Death or disability of the trustee or trustees appointed;
(3) Receipt of notice that a committee, guardian, or other legal representative has been appointed for the incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction;
(4) Failure of the trustee or trustees to render the reports required by § 49.10-1;
(5) That there is probable cause to believe that moneys received on behalf of the incompetent have been, or are being, improperly used;
(6) A finding by a board of medical officers that the heretofore incompetent is mentally capable of managing his own affairs;
(7) That the Commandant deems it to be in the best interest of the incompetent.
(b) In the event of termination of payments under paragraphs (a)(2), (4), (5), or (7) of this section, the Commandant may, if deemed appropriate, appoint a successor trustee or trustees. The successor trustee or trustees, so appointed, shall comply with the provisions of the regulations and instructions in this part issued thereunder, and do all acts in the manner required of the original trustee or trustees.
§ 49.10-15
Final accounting by trustee.
The trustee or trustees, when payments, hereunder are terminated, shall file a final account with the said Commandant. Thereupon, the trustee or trustees will be discharged and the surety released. In event of death or disability of the trustee, the final accounting will be filed by his legal representative.

# Subpart 49.15—Additional Instructions
§ 49.15-1
Implementing instructions.
The Commandant is hereby authorized to issue such instructions not in conflict with the regulations in this part as may be necessary from time to time to give full force and effect thereto.

# Source:
CGD 81-104, 50 FR 41495, Oct. 11, 1985, unless otherwise noted.
§ 51.1
Basis and purpose.
This part establishes the procedures for review of administrative discharges from the Coast Guard by a Discharge Review Board (DRB) or by the Secretary of the Department, and for the compilation of the record of the DRB determination, made available for public inspection, copying and distribution through the Armed Forces Discharge Review/Correction Board Reading Room.
§ 51.2
Authority.
(a) The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to establish a Discharge Review Board (DRB) to review the discharge of a former member of the United States Coast Guard under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1553. This part prescribes the establishment and outlines the procedures of the Coast Guard Discharge Review Board. The Secretary retains the authority to review and take final action on the DRB's findings in the following cases:
(1) Those cases in which a minority of the board requests that their written opinion be forwarded to the Secretary for consideration;
(2) Those cases selected by the Commandant to inform the Secretary of aspects of the board's functions which may be of interest to the Secretary;
(3) Any case in which the Secretary demonstrates an interest;
(4) Any case which the President of the board believes is of significant interest to the Secretary.
(b) The Commandant of the Coast Guard is delegated the authority to:
(1) Appoint members to serve on the Discharge Review Board;
(2) Appoint alternates to serve on the DRB in the event that a regularly appointed member is unavailable;
(3) Designate a member as the President of the DRB; and
(4) Review and take final action on all DRB decisions which are not reviewed by the Secretary.
[CGD 81-104, 50 FR 41495, Oct. 11, 1985, as amended by CGD 97-023, 62 FR 33362, June 19, 1997; USCG-2003-14505, 68 FR 9535, Feb. 28, 2003]
§ 51.3
Applicability and scope.
The provisions of this part apply to the United States Coast Guard including reserve-components and all former members who have been discharged within 15 years of the date upon which application for review is received by the DRB. A former member may apply to the DRB for a change in the character of, and/or the reason for, the discharge. The Coast Guard DRB review is generally applicable only to administrative discharges, however, the DRB may review the discharge of a former member by sentence of a court-martial for the purpose of clemency. A petition for clemency will not be considered by the DRB unless the applicant has exhausted all appellate remedies. Upon a petition for clemency, the DRB shall consider only the equity of the discharge awarded.
§ 51.4
Definitions.
Applicant.
A former member of the Coast Guard who has been discharged from the service but excluding those discharged by sentence of a court-martial, except as provided in § 51.3. If the former member is deceased or incompetent, the term “applicant” includes the surviving spouse, next-of-kin, or legal representative who is acting on behalf of the former member.
Counsel.
An individual or agency designated by the applicant who agrees to represent the applicant in a case before the DRB. It includes, but is not limited to: A lawyer who is a member of the bar of a federal court or of the highest court of a state; an accredited representative designated by an organization recognized by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs; a representative from a state agency concerned with veterans affairs; or a representative from private organizations or local government agencies.
Discharge.
Any formal separation of a member from the Coast Guard which is not termed “honorable”, including dismissals and “dropping from the rolls”. This term also includes the assignment of a separation program designator, separation authority, the stated reason for the discharge, and the characterization of service.
Discharge Review.
The process by which the reason for separation, the procedures followed in accomplishing separation, and the characterization of service are evaluated. This includes determinations made under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3103(e)(2).
Discharge Review Board.
A board consisting of five members of the U.S. Coast Guard, appointed by the Commandant of the Coast Guard and vested with the authority to review the discharge of a former member. The board is empowered to change a discharge or issue a new discharge to reflect its findings, subject to review by the Commandant or the Secretary.
Hearing.
A proceeding which, upon request of the applicant, is utilized in the discharge review process enabling the applicant and/or the applicant's representative to appear before the DRB and present evidence.
President.
An officer of the United States Coast Guard appointed by the Commandant as President to preside over the DRB. The President will convene the board and may also serve as a member. If the President does not serve as a member of the DRB, the President shall designate a presiding officer for the board to serve as President.
[CGD 81-104, 50 FR 41495, Oct. 11, 1985, as amended by CGD 96-026, 61 FR 33663, June 28, 1996]
§ 51.5
Objective of review.
The objective of the discharge review is to examine the propriety and equity of the applicant's discharge and to effect changes if necessary. The DRB will utilize its discretion to reach a fair and just resolution of the applicant's claim.
The standards of review and the underlying factors which aid in determining whether the standards are met shall be historically consistent with criteria for determining honorable service. No factors shall be established which require automatic change, or denial of change, in a discharge.
§ 51.6
Propriety standard of review.
A discharge is deemed to be proper except that:
(a) A discharge may be improper if an error of fact, law, procedure, or discretion was associated with the discharge at the time of issuance which prejudiced the rights of the applicant.
(b) A discharge may be improper if there has been a change in policy by the Coast Guard made expressly retroactive to the type of discharge under consideration.
§ 51.7
Equity standard of review.
(a) A discharge is presumed to be equitable and will not be changed under this section unless the applicant submits evidence sufficient to establish, to the satisfaction of the DRB that:
(1) The policies and procedures under which the applicant was discharged differ in material respects from policies and procedures currently applicable on a service-wide basis to discharges of that type, provided that current policies or procedures represent a substantial enhancement of the rights afforded a party in such proceedings, and there is substantial doubt that the applicant would have received the same discharge if relevant current policies and procedures had been available to the applicant at the time of the discharge proceedings under consideration; or
(2) At the time of issuance, the discharge was inconsistent with standards of discipline in the Coast Guard; or
(3) The applicant's military record and other evidence presented to the DRB, viewed in conjunction with the factors listed in § 51.8 and the regulations under which the applicant was discharged, do not fairly justify the type of discharge received.
(b) If the applicant was discharged with a characterized discharge before June 15, 1983, a change from the characterized discharge to an uncharacterized discharge will not be considered under the provisions of (a)(1) of this section unless specifically requested by the applicant. A determination that a discharge is inequitable according to the provisions of (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section shall entitle the applicant to a discharge of a type to which the applicant was entitled at the time the original discharge was issued.
§ 51.8
Relevant considerations.
In determining the equity and propriety of a former member's discharge, the DRB shall consider all relevant evidence presented by the applicant. The DRB review will include, but is not limited to, consideration of the following factors:
(a) The quality of the applicant's service. In determining the quality of the applicant's service, the DRB may consider the applicant's dates and periods of service; rate or rank achieved; marks and evaluations received; awards, decorations and letters of commendation; acts of merit; combat service and wounds received; promotions and demotions; prior military service and type of discharge; records of unauthorized absence; records of non-judicial punishment; convictions by court-martial; records of conviction by civil authorities while a member of the Coast Guard; and any other relevant information respecting the applicant which is brought to the board's attention.
(b) The applicant's capability to serve. In determining the applicant's capability to serve, the DRB considers such factors as the applicant's age and education; qualification for reenlistment; capability to adjust to military service; and family or personal problems.
(c) Any evidence of arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory actions by individuals in authority over the applicant.
(d) Any other information respecting the applicant considered by the DRB to be relevant and material to the review of the applicant's discharge.
§ 51.9
Discharge review procedures.
(a)
Preliminary.
Prior to a review, applicants or their representatives may obtain copies of military records by
submitting a Standard Form 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, to the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), 9799 Page Boulevard, St. Louis, MO. 72132. The request to the NPRC should be submitted prior to submitting the application for review, so that relevant information from the record can be included with the application.
(b)
Initiation of review.
Review may be initiated by an applicant or by the DRB. The applicant may apply for DRB review of discharge by submitting DD Form 293, Application for Review of Discharge or Separation from the Armed Forces of the United States, along with any other statements, affidavits or documentation desired by the applicant. The application must be received by the DRB within fifteen (15) years of the date of the discharge. The application form can be obtained, along with explanatory matter, from Commandant (CG-12), Attn: Personnel Management Directorate, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7907, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7907, any regional VA office, or by writing to the Armed Forces Review/Correction Board Reading Room, Pentagon Concourse, Washington, DC 20310.
(c)
Notice.
(1) The DRB will provide notification advising the former member of—
(i) Receipt of the applicant's request;
(ii) The right to appear before the board in person or by counsel; and
(iii) The date of review.
If the former member is deceased, written notice of DRB review will be sent to the surviving spouse, next of kin or legal representative of the former member. If the review is initiated by the DRB, notification will be sent to the last known address of the former member.
(2) Prior to the initiation of the decision process, the DRB will notify the former member of the date by which requests to examine the documents to be considered by the board must be received. This notice will also state the date by which a request for a hearing must be made and the deadline for filing responses to the board.
(3) An applicant who requests a hearing will be notified of the time and place of the hearing. All expenses incurred by the applicant in DRB proceedings and hearings are the sole responsibility of the applicant and are not obligations of the U.S. Coast Guard or the Department of Transportation. If the applicant fails to appear, except as provided in § 51.9(f), the DRB will review the discharge and reach a decision based upon the evidence of record.
(d)
Withdrawal of application.
An applicant may withdraw an application without prejudice at any time before the scheduled review. An application which is withdrawn will not stay the running of the 15 year statutory limitation imposed on the authority of the DRB to review the discharge.
(e) The DRB will consider the records and other data submitted by the applicant. The DRB may consider other probative evidence provided that all materials relied on by the DRB, except classified documents, are made available to the applicant and applicant's representative prior to the hearing date (or review date if no hearing is requested). The DRB shall not consider a classified document in the review of a discharge unless a summary of, or extract from, the document (deleting all reference to sources of information and other matters, the disclosure of which would, in the opinion of the classifying authority, be detrimental to the security interests of the United States) is made available to the applicant.

(c) The Deputy Chair of the Board exercises the functions prescribed by these regulations and such other duties as may be assigned by the Chair.
[OST Doc. No. 2002-13439, 68 FR 9886, Mar. 3, 2003, as amended by USCG-2003-15404, 68 FR 37740, June 25, 2003]
§ 52.12
Function.
The function of the Board is to consider all applications properly before it, together with all pertinent military records and any submission received from the Coast Guard or other Government office under subpart E, to determine:
(a) Whether an error has been made in the applicant's Coast Guard military record, whether the applicant has suffered an error or injustice as the result of an omission or commission in his or her record, or whether the applicant has suffered some manifest injustice in the treatment accorded him or her; and
(b) Whether the Board finds it necessary to change a military record to correct an error or remove an injustice.
§ 52.13
Jurisdiction.
(a) The Board has jurisdiction to review and determine all matters properly brought before it, consistent with existing law and such directives as may be issued by the Secretary.
(b) No application shall be considered by the Board until the applicant has exhausted all effective administrative remedies afforded under existing law or regulations, and such legal remedies as the Board may determine are practical, appropriate, and available to the applicant.

# Subpart C—General Provisions Regarding Applications
§ 52.21
General requirements.
(a) An application for correction of a Coast Guard record shall be submitted on DD Form 149 (Application for Correction of Military or Naval Record) or an exact copy thereof, and shall be addressed to: DHS Office of the General Counsel, Board for Correction of Military Records, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE, Stop 0485, Washington, DC 20528-0485. Forms and explanatory material may be obtained from the Chair of the Board.
(b) The application shall be signed by the person alleging error or injustice in his or her military record, except that an application may be signed by a family member or legal representative with respect to the record of a deceased, incapacitated, or missing person. The family member or legal representative must submit proof of his or her proper interest with the application.
(c) No application shall be docketed or processed until it is complete. An application for relief is complete when all of the following have been received by the Board:
(1) A signed DD Form 149, providing all necessary responses, including a specific allegation of error or injustice, accompanied by substantial evidence or information in support of such allegation;
(2) The military records of the applicant; and
(3) Any applicable military and Department of Veterans Affairs medical records.
(d) It is the applicant's responsibility to include his or her correct mailing address on the DD Form 149 and to inform the Chair in writing of any subsequent change of address until the Board or the Secretary takes final action on the application.
(e) Briefs in support of applications must be assembled in a manner that
permits easy reproduction and may not exceed twenty-five double-spaced typewritten pages in a type size with no more than twelve characters per inch. This limitation does not apply to supporting documentary evidence. In complex cases, the Chair may waive this limitation.
[OST Doc. No. 2002-13439, 68 FR 9886, Mar. 3, 2003, as amended by USCG-2014-0410, 79 FR 38431, July 7, 2014; USCG-2019-0929, 84 FR 68343, Dec. 16, 2019]
§ 52.22
Time limit for filing application.
An application for correction of a record must be filed within three years after the applicant discovered or reasonably should have discovered the alleged error or injustice. If an application is untimely, the applicant shall set forth reasons in the application why it is in the interest of justice for the Board to consider the application. An untimely application shall be denied unless the Board finds that sufficient evidence has been presented to warrant a finding that it would be in the interest of justice to excuse the failure to file timely.
§ 52.23
Counsel.
(a) Applicants may be represented by counsel at their own expense. Applicants whose cases are processed under the Whistleblower Protection Act and who are granted a hearing by the Board may be entitled to representation by a Coast Guard law specialist. 10 U.S.C. 1034(f)(3)(A).
(b) As used in this part, the term “counsel” includes attorneys who are members in good standing of any bar; accredited representatives of veterans' organizations recognized by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 5902; and other persons who, in the opinion of the Chair, are competent to represent the applicant for correction. Whenever the term “applicant” is used in these rules, except in § 52.21(c), the term shall mean an applicant or his or her counsel.
§ 52.24
Evidence and burden of proof.
(a) It is the responsibility of the applicant to procure and submit with his or her application such evidence, including official records, as the applicant desires to present in support of his or her case. All such evidence should be submitted with the applicant's DD Form 149 in accordance with § 52.21(c)(1). Evidence submitted by an applicant after an application has been filed and docketed shall be considered late and its acceptance is subject to the provisions in § 52.26(a)(4) and (c).
(b) The Board begins its consideration of each case presuming administrative regularity on the part of Coast Guard and other Government officials. The applicant has the burden of proving the existence of an error or injustice by the preponderance of the evidence.
§ 52.25
Access to official records.
The applicant shall have such access to official records or to any information pertaining to the applicant which is in the custody of the Coast Guard as is provided in 49 CFR parts 7 and 10.
§ 52.26
Right to timely decision; effect of requests for extensions, changes in requests for relief, and late submissions of evidence.
(a) Each applicant has a right to have final action taken on his or her application within 10 months after all the elements of a complete application, as defined in § 52.21(c), have been received by the Board, unless the applicant:
(1) Submits a written request, which is granted by the Chair, for an extension of a specific duration to seek counsel or additional evidence;

(3) Submits a signed statement that is determined by the Chair to significantly amend the applicant's request for relief after the application has been docketed;
(4) Submits significant new evidence, as determined by the Chair, after the application has been docketed; or
(5) Is found by the Chair to have unreasonably delayed responding to a request for further information or evidence.
(b) If the applicant requests an extension in accordance with paragraphs
(a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section or unreasonably delays responding to a request for further information or evidence in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, he or she shall have a right to have final action taken on the application for correction within 10 months of the application's completion plus all periods of extension granted to the applicant by the Chair and all periods of unreasonable delay.
(c) If the applicant significantly amends his or her request for relief or submits significant new evidence after the application has been docketed, in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section, the application shall be considered newly complete as of the date the amended request for relief or new evidence is received, in which case the applicant shall have a right to have final action taken on the application within 10 months of the date the Board receives the amended request for relief or significant new evidence.
§ 52.27
Withdrawal of application.
The Chair may, at his or her discretion, permit the applicant to withdraw his or her application at any time before final action is taken under § 52.64. Any further consideration by the Board of the issues raised in the withdrawn application shall occur only upon the filing of a new application.
§ 52.28
Stay of proceedings.
An application to the Board for correction of a military record does not operate as a stay of any proceeding or administrative action taken with respect to or affecting the applicant.

# Subpart D—Consideration of Application and Administrative Closure
§ 52.31
Consideration of application.
Each application shall be reviewed by the Chair to determine whether it meets the requirements of § 52.21 before it is docketed. The Chair shall decide in appropriate cases whether to grant a hearing or to recommend disposition on the merits without a hearing.
§ 52.32
Administrative closure.
(a) The Chair may administratively close a case after it has been docketed and at any time prior to its consideration by the Board if the Chair determines that:
(1) The application was erroneously docketed because the application did not meet the criteria under § 52.21;
(2) Effective relief cannot be granted by the Board;
(3) The Board does not have jurisdiction to determine the issues presented or the applicant has not exhausted an available administrative remedy, as required under § 52.13(b); or
(4) The Coast Guard has granted effective relief satisfactory to the applicant.
(b) Administrative closure does not constitute a denial of relief. Applicants who believe their cases should not have been administratively closed by the Chair may resubmit their applications with a request for further consideration and a statement explaining why the applicant believes his or her case should be docketed and considered by the Board. A request for further consideration shall be regarded as a new application for the purposes of §§ 52.21 and 52.26.

The Chair may, in his or her discretion, grant the Coast Guard an extension of the time provided for submitting the advisory opinion.
(d) The Board shall promptly send a copy of each submission made by the Coast Guard under this section to the applicant involved, subject to the limitations in §§ 52.42(c) and 52.43(c).

(e) Advisory opinions submitted by the Coast Guard and briefs submitted by applicants in response to the advisory opinions of the Coast Guard must be assembled in a manner that permits easy reproduction and may not exceed fifteen double-spaced typewritten pages in a type size with no more than twelve characters per inch. This limitation does not apply to supporting documentary evidence. In complex cases, the Chair may waive this limitation.
§ 52.43
Requests for further information; submissions of classified, privileged, and sensitive information.
(a) The Chair or the Board may ask the applicant to submit additional information not included in the application or response to the advisory opinion.
(b) The Chair or the Board may ask the Coast Guard or other Government office to submit any information, including reports of investigations, that the Chair or the Board deems relevant to an applicant's case.

The Board shall forward only this redacted copy to the applicant.

# Subpart F—Hearings

(c) Following the receipt of all evidence, the Chair shall cause to be prepared and shall submit to the Board for its consideration a draft decision containing proposed findings and conclusions and a proposed order.

Only a copy of the information provided by the Coast Guard or other Government office for release to the applicant in accordance with § 52.43(c) shall be retained in the permanent record of proceedings after final action is taken.
§ 52.64
Final action.
(a) The Board, provided that it acts unanimously, may take final action on behalf of the Secretary, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1552, as follows:
(1) The Board may deny an application for the correction of military records.
(2) Unless the Coast Guard, in submitting its views pursuant to § 52.42(b), identifies and describes a significant issue of Coast Guard policy challenged in the application, the Board may approve an application for the correction of military records in any of the following categories:

After taking final action, the Secretary shall send any such statement and the record of proceedings to the Board for disposition.
§ 52.65
Orders.
(a) The Board shall issue such orders or directives as may be necessary to carry out a final action.
(b) The Board may ask the Coast Guard to submit a written report to the Board specifying the action taken and the date thereof with respect to any final action.
(c) Unless doing so is likely to nullify the relief granted, copies of the final decision shall be placed in the military record of the applicant.
§ 52.66
Notification.
After final action is taken under § 52.64, the Board shall send a copy of the final decision to the applicant. The applicant may inspect the permanent record of proceedings at Board offices.
§ 52.67
Reconsideration.
(a) Reconsideration of an application for correction of a military record shall occur if an applicant requests it and the request meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section.
(1) An applicant presents evidence or information that was not previously considered by the Board and that could result in a determination other than that originally made. Such new evidence or information may only be considered if it could not have been presented to the Board prior to its original determination if the applicant had exercised reasonable diligence; or
(2) An applicant presents evidence or information that the Board, or the Secretary as the case may be, committed legal or factual error in the original determination that could have resulted in a determination other than that originally made.
(b) The Chair shall docket a request for reconsideration of a final decision if it meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. If neither of these requirements is met, the Chair shall not docket such request.
(c) The Board shall consider each application for reconsideration that has been docketed. None of the Board members who served on the Board that considered an applicant's original application for correction shall serve on the Board that decides the applicant's application upon reconsideration.
(d) Action by the Board on a docketed application for reconsideration is subject to §§ 52.26 and 52.64(b).
(e) An applicant's request for reconsideration must be filed within two years after the issuance of a final decision, except as otherwise required by law. If the Chair dockets an applicant's request for reconsideration, the two-year requirement may be waived if the Board finds that it would be in the interest of justice to consider the request despite its untimeliness.

# Subpart H—Payment of Claims and Implementation of Orders
§ 52.71
Authority to pay.
(a) The Coast Guard is authorized to pay the claims of any person as the result of any action heretofore or hereafter taken under 10 U.S.C. 1552.

# Subpart A—General
§ 62.1
Purpose.
(a) The Coast Guard administers the U.S. Aids to Navigation System. The system consists of Federal aids to navigation operated by the Coast Guard, aids to navigation operated by the other armed services, and private aids to navigation operated by other persons.
(b)(1) This part describes the general characteristics of the U.S. Aids to Navigation System, and the details, policies and procedures employed by the Coast Guard in establishing, maintaining, operating, changing or discontinuing Federal aids to navigation. Regulations concerning the marking of wrecks, structures, and other obstructions are found in 33 CFR part 64. Regulations concerning private aids are found in 33 CFR part 66. Regulations concerning the marking of artificial islands and structures which are erected on or over the seabed and subsoil of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States or its possessions are found in 33 CFR part 67. Regulations concerning the marking of bridges are found in 33 CFR part 118. Regulations concerning aids to navigation at deepwater ports are found in subchapter NN of this chapter.
(2) The regulations found in 33 CFR subpart 66.10 expire on December 31, 2003, at which time the provisions of this part will apply.
(c) The Coast Guard maintains systems of marine aids to navigation consisting of visual, audible, and electronic signals which are designed to assist the prudent mariner in the process of navigation. The aids to navigation system is not intended to identify every shoal or obstruction to navigation which exists in the navigable waters of the United States, but rather provides for reasonable marking of marine features as resources permit. The primary objective of the aids to navigation system is to mark navigable channels and waterways, obstructions
adjacent to these waterways, and obstructions in areas of general navigation which may not be anticipated. Other waters, even if navigable, are generally not marked.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 48608, Nov. 24, 1989; CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33573, June 19, 1998]
§ 62.3
Definition of terms.
Certain terms as used in this subchapter are defined as follows:
(a)
Aid to Navigation.
The term aid to navigation means any device external to a vessel or aircraft intended to assist a navigator to determine position or safe course, or to warn of dangers or obstructions to navigation.
(b)
Commerce.
The term commerce, in addition to general, national and international trade and commerce of the United States, includes trade and travel by seasonal passenger craft (marine and air), yachts, houseboats, fishing boats, motor boats, and other craft, whether or not operated for hire or profit.
(c)
Commandant.
The term Commandant means the Commandant of the Coast Guard.
(d)
District Commander.
The term District Commander means the commander of a Coast Guard District. Coast Guard Districts are listed in Part 3 of this chapter.
(e)
Corps of Engineers.
The term Corps of Engineers means the Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army.
(f)
Person.
The term person imparts both singular or plural, as the case demands, and includes any Federal Agency, State, Territory, possession, or public subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, and any corporation, company, association, club, or other instrumentality.
(g)
Navigable waters of the United States.
The term navigable waters of the United States is defined in § 2.36(a) of this chapter.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by USCG-2001-9044, 68 FR 42601, July 18, 2003]
§ 62.5
Marking of marine parades and regattas.
(a) The Coast Guard may establish aids to navigation to mark marine parades and regattas which are regulated by the Coast Guard for the purpose of protecting life and property, or to assist in the observance and enforcement of special regulations. For marine parade and regatta regulations, see Part 100 of this chapter.
(b) [Reserved]

# Subpart B—The U.S. Aids to Navigation System
§ 62.21
General.
(a) The navigable waters of the United States and non-navigable State waters after December 31, 2003, are marked to assist navigation using the U.S. Aids to Navigation System, a system consistent with the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) Maritime Buoyage System. The IALA Maritime Buoyage System is followed by most of the world's maritime nations and will improve maritime safety by encouraging conformity in buoyage systems worldwide. IALA buoyage is divided into two regions made up of Region A and Region B. All navigable waters of the United States follow IALA Region B, except U.S. possessions west of the International Date Line and south of 10 degrees north latitude, which follow IALA Region A. Lateral aids to navigation in Region A vary from those described throughout this Subpart. Non-lateral aids to navigation are the same as those used in Region B. See § 62.25. Appropriate nautical charts and publications should be consulted to determine whether the Region A or Region B marking schemes are in effect for a given area.
(b) The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use with nautical charts. Nautical charts portray the physical features of the marine environment, including soundings and other submarine features, landmarks, and other aids necessary for the proper navigation of a vessel. This crucial information cannot be obtained from other sources, even ones such as topographic maps, aeronautical charts, or atlases. The exact meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear to the mariner unless the appropriate chart is consulted, as the chart illustrates the relationship of the individual aid to
navigation to channel limits, obstructions, hazards to navigation, and to the total aids to navigation system.
(c) The navigator should maintain and consult suitable publications and instruments for navigation depending on the vessel's requirements. This shipboard equipment is separate from the aids to navigation system, but is often essential to its use. The following publications are available from the U.S. Government to assist the navigator:

(4) The Notice to Mariners is a national publication, similar to the Local Notice to Mariners, published by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The notices may be viewed on the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's Web site at
http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal.
This publication provides oceangoing vessels significant information on national and international navigation and safety.
(5) The mariner should also listen to Coast Guard Broadcast Notices to Mariners. These broadcasts update the Local Notice to Mariners with more timely information. Mariners should monitor VHF-FM channel 16 to locate Coast Guard Marine Information Broadcasts.
(d) The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is primarily a lateral system which employs a simple arrangement of colors, shapes, numbers, and light characteristics to mark the limits of navigable routes. This lateral system is supplemented by nonlateral aids to navigation where appropriate.
(e) Generally, lateral aids to navigation indicate on which side of a vessel an aid to navigation should be passed when the vessel is proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Normally, the Conventional Direction of Buoyage is the direction in which a vessel enters navigable channels from seaward and proceeds towards the head of navigation. In the absence of a route leading from seaward, the Conventional Direction of Buoyage generally follows a clockwise direction around land masses. For example, proceeding southerly along the Atlantic Coast, from Florida to Texas along the Gulf Coast, and northerly along the Pacific Coast are considered as proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. In some instances, this direction must be arbitrarily assigned. Where doubt exists, the mariner should consult charts and other nautical publications.
(f) Although aids to navigation are maintained to a reasonable degree of reliability, the rigors of the marine environment and various equipment failures do cause discrepancies on occasion.
(g) The Coast Guard makes reasonable efforts to inform the navigator of known discrepancies, and to correct them within a reasonable period of time, depending upon resources available. Occasionally, a temporary aid to navigation, which provides different but similar service, is deployed until permanent repairs can be made to the original aid. Notification of such temporary changes is made through the notice to mariners system.
(h) Mariners should exercise caution when using private aids to navigation because private aids are often established to serve the needs of specific users rather than general navigation and their purpose may not be obvious to casual users; and, discrepancies to private aids are often detected, reported, and corrected less promptly than discrepancies to Coast Guard aids to navigation.

§ 62.23
Beacons and buoys.
(a) Aids to navigation are placed on shore or on marine sites to assist a navigator to determine his position or safe course. They may mark limits of navigable channels, or warn of dangers or obstructions to navigation. The primary components of the U.S. Aids to Navigation System are beacons and buoys.
(b) Beacons are aids to navigation structures which are permanently fixed to the earth's surface. They range from large lighthouses to small, single-pile structures and may be located on land or in the water. Lighted beacons are called lights; unlighted beacons are called daybeacons.
(1) Beacons exhibit a daymark. For small structures these are colored geometric shapes which make an aid to navigation readily visible and easily identifiable against background conditions. Generally, the daymark conveys to the mariner, during daylight hours, the same significance as does the aid's light or reflector at night. The daymark of large lighthouses and towers, however, consists of the structure itself. As a result, these daymarks do not infer lateral significance.
(2) Vessels should not pass beacons close aboard due to the danger of collision with rip-rap or structure foundations, or the obstruction or danger that the aid marks.
(c) Buoys are floating aids to navigation used extensively throughout U.S. waters. They are moored to the seabed by sinkers with chain or other moorings of various lengths.
(1) The daymark of a buoy is the color and shape of the buoy and, if so equipped, of the topmark.
(i) Can buoys have a cylindrical shape.
(ii) Nun buoys have a tapered, conical shape.
(iii) Pillar buoys have a wide cylindrical base supporting a narrower superstructure. They may be surmounted by colored shapes called topmarks.
(iv) Spherical buoys have a round shape.
(2) Mariners attempting to pass a buoy close aboard risk collision with a yawing buoy, the buoy's mooring, or with the obstruction which the buoy marks.
(3) Mariners should not rely on buoys alone for determining their positions due to factors limiting their reliability. Prudent mariners will use bearings or angles from beacons or other landmarks, soundings, and various methods of electronic navigation. Buoys vary in reliability because:
(i) Buoy positions represented on nautical charts are approximate positions only, due to practical limitations in positioning and maintaining buoys and their sinkers in precise geographical locations.
(ii) Buoy moorings vary in length. The mooring lengths define a “watch circle”, and buoys can be expected to move within this circle. Actual watch circles do not coincide with the dots or circles representing them on charts.
(iii) Buoy positions are normally verified during periodic maintenance visits. Between visits, environmental conditions, including atmospheric and sea conditions, and seabed slope and composition, may shift buoys off their charted positions. Also buoys may be dragged off station, sunk, or capsized by a collision with a vessel.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987; CGD 86-031, 52 FR 46351, Dec. 5, 1987]
§ 62.25
Lateral marks.
(a) Lateral marks define the port and starboard sides of a route to be followed. They may be either beacons or buoys.
(b) Sidemarks are lateral marks which advise the mariner to stay to
one side of the mark. Their most frequent use is to mark the sides of channels; however, they may be used individually to mark obstructions outside of clearly defined channels. Sidemarks are not always placed directly on a channel edge and may be positioned outside the channel as indicated on charts and nautical publications.
(1) Port hand marks indicate the left side of channels when proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Beacons have green square daymarks, while buoys are green can or pillar buoys.
(2) Starboard hand marks indicate the right side of channels when proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Beacons have red triangular daymarks, while buoys are red nun or pillar buoys.
(c) Preferred channel marks indicate channel junctions or bifurcations and may also mark wrecks or obstructions which the mariner, after consulting a chart to ascertain the location of the obstruction relative to the aid, may pass on either side. Preferred channel marks have red and green horizontal bands with the color of the topmost band indicating the preferred channel. If the topmost band is green, the mark serves as a port hand mark for vessels following the preferred channel proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, and as a starboard hand mark for the other channel. Beacons would have square daymarks, while buoys would be can or pillar buoys. If the topmost band is red, the mark serves as a starboard hand mark for vessels following the preferred channel proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, and a port hand mark for the other channel. Beacons would have triangular daymarks, while buoys would be nun or pillar buoys.
(d) The above color schemes apply to IALA Region B. Marks located in the IALA Region A exhibit reversed color significance: port hand marks will be red when following the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, and starboard hand marks will be green. The meaning of daymark and buoy shapes is identical in both regions.
(e) Certain marks on the Intracoastal Waterway may exhibit reversed lateral significance. See § 62.49.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 48608, Nov. 24, 1989]
§ 62.27
Safe water marks.
Safe water marks indicate that there is navigable water all around the mark. They are often used to indicate fairways or midchannels, or the seaward end of channels. Safe water marks are colored with red and white vertical stripes. Beacons have an octagonal daymark; red and white buoys are spherical or display a red spherical topmark.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 48608, Nov. 24, 1989]
§ 62.29
Isolated danger marks.
Isolated danger marks indicate an isolated danger which may be passed on all sides. As these marks are erected or moored on or near dangers, they should not be approached closely without special caution. These marks are colored black with one or more broad horizontal red bands and are equipped with a topmark of two black spheres, one above the other.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 48608, Nov. 24, 1989]
§ 62.31
Special marks.
Special marks are not primarily intended to assist safe navigation, but to indicate special areas or features referred to in charts or other nautical publications. They may be used, for example, to mark anchorages, cable or pipeline areas, traffic separation schemes, military exercise zones, ocean data acquisition systems, etc. Special marks are colored solid yellow.
§ 62.32
Inland waters obstruction mark.
(a) On inland waters designated by the Commandant as State waters in accordance with § 66.05-5 of this chapter and on non-navigable internal waters of a State which have no defined head of navigation, a buoy showing alternate vertical black and white stripes
may be used to indicate to a vessel operator that an obstruction to navigation extends from the nearest shore to the buoy.
(b) The black and white buoy's meaning is “do not pass between the buoy and the shore”. The number of white and black stripes is discretionary, provided that the white stripes are twice the width of the black stripes. Prior to December 31, 2003, this aid shall not be used on a waterway which has a red and white striped obstruction marker defined in § 66.10-15(e)(3) of this chapter, unless all obstruction markers are replaced.
[CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33573, June 19, 1998]
§ 62.33
Information and regulatory marks.
(a) Information and Regulatory Marks are used to alert the mariner to various warnings or regulatory matters. These marks have orange geometric shapes against a white background. The meanings associated with the orange shapes are as follows:
(1) A vertical open-faced diamond signifies danger.
(2) A vertical diamond shape having a cross centered within indicates that vessels are excluded from the marked area.
(3) A circular shape indicates that certain operating restrictions are in effect within the marked area.
(4) A square or rectangular shape will contain directions or instructions lettered within the shape.
(b) When a buoy is used as an information or regulatory mark it shall be white with two horizontal orange bands placed completely around the buoy circumference. One band shall be near the top of the buoy body, with a second band placed just above the waterline of the buoy so that both bands are clearly visible.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33573, June 19, 1998]
§ 62.35
Mooring buoys.
Mooring Buoys are white with a blue horizontal band. This distinctive color scheme is recommended to facilitate identification and to avoid confusion with aids to navigation.
§ 62.37
Lighthouses.
Lighthouses are prominent beacons of varying size, color, and appearance employed to mark headlands, landfalls, harbor entrances, channel edges, hazards, and other features. While normally identified by their distinctive appearance, some lighthouses display diamond shaped, checkered daymarks to facilitate recognition.
§ 62.41
Ranges.
Ranges are aids to navigation systems employing dual beacons which, when the structures appear to be in line, assist the mariner in maintaining a safe course. The appropriate nautical chart must be consulted when using ranges to determine whether the range marks the centerline of the navigable channel and also to ascertain what section of the range may be safety traversed. Ranges are generally, but not always, lighted, and display rectangular daymarks of various colors.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987; CGD 86-031, 52 FR 46351, Dec. 5, 1987]
§ 62.43
Numbers and letters.
(a) All solid red and solid green aids are numbered, with red aids bearing even numbers and green aids bearing odd numbers. The numbers for each increase in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Numbers are kept in approximately sequence on both sides of the channel by omitting numbers where necessary.
(b) Only sidemarks are numbered. However, aids other than those mentioned above may be lettered to assist in their identification, or to indicate their purpose. Sidemarks may carry letters in addition to numbers to identify the first aid to navigation in a waterway, or when new aids to navigation are added to channels with previously completed numerical sequences. Letters on sidemarks will follow alphabetical order from seaward and proceeding toward the Conventional Direction of Buoyage and will be added to numbers as suffixes.
(c) Aids to navigation may be fitted with light-reflecting material to increase their visibility in darkness. The colors of this material may convey the
same significance as the aid except that letters and numbers may be white.
(d) Exceptions to the provisions of this section will be found on the Western Rivers System. See § 62.51.
(e) The guidelines for the display of numbers and letters on aids to navigation are identical for both Region A and Region B; red aids to navigation display even numbers, and green aids display odd numbers.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 48608, Nov. 24, 1989]
§ 62.45
Light characteristics.
(a) Lights on aids to navigation are differentiated by color and rhythm. Lighthouses and range lights may display distinctive light characteristics to facilitate recognition. No special significance should be attached to the color or rhythm of such lights. Other lighted aids to navigation employ light characteristics to convey additional information.
(b) When proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage, aids to navigation, if lighted, display light characteristics as follows:
(1) Green lights mark port (left) sides of channels and locations of wrecks or obstructions which are to be passed by keeping these lights on the port (left) hand of a vessel. Green lights are also used on Preferred Channel Marks where the topmost band is green.
(2) Red lights mark starboard (right) sides of channels and locations of wrecks or obstructions which are to be passed by keeping these lights on the starboard (right) hand of a vessel. Red lights are also used on Preferred Channel Marks where the topmost band is red.
(3) Certain lights marking the Intracoastal Waterway may display reversed lateral significance. See § 62.49.
(c) Yellow lights have no lateral significance. Except on the Western Rivers, see § 62.51, white lights have no lateral significance. The purpose of aids exhibiting white or yellow lights may be determined by their shape, color, letters or numbers, and the light rhythm employed.
(d) Light rhythms, except as noted in § 62.51 for the Western Rivers, are employed as follows:
(1) Aids with lateral significance display regularly flashing or regularly occulting light rhythms. Ordinarily, flashing lights (frequency not exceeding 30 flashes per minute) will be used.
(2) Preferred Channel Marks display a composite group flashing light rhythm (groups of two flashes followed by one flash).
(3) Safe Water Marks display a white Morse Code “A” rhythm (short-long flash).
(4) Isolated Danger Marks display a white group flashing two.
(5) Special Marks display yellow lights with fixed or slow flashing rhythm preferred.
(6) Mooring Buoys and Information and Regulatory Marks display white lights of various rhythms.
(7) For situations where lights require a distinct cautionary significance, as at sharp turns, sudden channel constrictions, wrecks, or obstructions, a quick flashing light rhythm (60 flashes per minute) may be used.
(e) Occasionally lights use sectors to mark shoals or warn mariners of other dangers. Lights so equipped show one color from most directions and a different color or colors over definite arcs of the horizon as indicated on the appropriate nautical chart. These sectors provide approximate bearing information since the observer should note a change of color as the boundary between the sectors is crossed. As sector bearings are not precise, they should be considered a warning only and not used to determine exact bearing to the light.
(f) Aids to navigation may be fitted with light-reflecting material to increase their visibility in darkness. Green or red reflective material is used only on marks which, if lighted, would exhibit a light of that color. Yellow reflective material is used on special marks and on Intracoastal Waterway marks. No significance is attached to white reflective material.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR 48608, Nov. 24, 1989; CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33573, June 19, 1998]
§ 62.47
Sound signals.
(a) Often sound signals are located on or adjacent to aids to navigation. When
visual signals are obscured, sound signals warn mariners of the proximity of danger.
(1) Sound signals are distinguished by their tone and phase characteristics.
(i) Tones are determined by the devices producing the sound (i.e., diaphones, diaphragm horns, reed horns, sirens, whistles, bells and gongs).
(ii) Phase characteristics are defined by the signal's sound pattern, i.e., the number of blasts and silent periods per minute and their durations. Sound signals emanating from fixed structures generally produce a specific number of blasts and silent periods each minute when operating. Buoy sound signals are generally actuated by the motion of the sea and therefore do not emit a regular signal characteristic.
(2) Where no live watch is maintained, sound signals are normally operated continuously. However, some are equipped with fog detectors which activate sound signals when visibility falls below a predetermined limit.
(b) Mariners should not rely solely on sound signals to determine their positions for the following reasons:
(1) Distance cannot be accurately determined by sound intensity.
(2) Occasionally sound signals may not be heard in areas close to their location.
(3) Signals may not sound in cases where fog exists close to, but not at, the location of the sound signal.
(4) As buoy signals are generally activated by sea motion, they may produce no signals when seas are calm.
(5) As previously noted, buoy positions are not always reliable. Therefore their sound signals cannot be assumed to be emanating from a fixed position.
§ 62.49
Intracoastal Waterway identification.
(a) In addition to the conventional signals, aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to distinguish them from aids marking other waters.
(1) Yellow triangles indicate that aids to navigation so marked should be passed keeping them on the starboard (right) hand of a vessel, regardless of the aid's number, color, or light color.
(2) Yellow squares indicate that aids to navigation so marked should be passed keeping them on the port (left) hand of a vessel, regardless of the aid's number, color, or light color.
(3) A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information, but simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.
(b) The above guidelines apply for vessels traversing the Intracoastal Waterway in a southerly direction on the Atlantic Coast, in a westerly direction on the Okeechobee Waterway, or in a westerly direction along the Gulf Coast.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987; CGD 86-031, 52 FR 46351, Dec. 5, 1987]
§ 62.51
Western Rivers Marking System.
(a) A variation of the standard U.S. aids to navigation system described above is employed on the Mississippi River and tributaries above Baton Rouge, LA and on certain other rivers which flow toward the Gulf of America.
(b) The Western Rivers System varies from the standard U.S. system as follows:
(1) Buoys are not numbered.
(2) Numbers on beacons do not have odd/even lateral significance but, rather, indicate mileage from a fixed point (normally the river mouth).
(3) Diamond-shaped non-lateral dayboards, checkered red-and-white or green-and-white, similar to those used in the U.S. Aids to Navigation System, as appropriate, are used as crossing dayboards where the river channel crosses from one bank to the other.
(4) Lights on green buoys and on beacons with green daymarks show a single flash which may be green or white.
(5) Lights on red buoys and on beacons with red daymarks show a double flash [Group Flashing (2)] which may be red or white.
(6) Isolated danger marks are not used.
[CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD-94-091, 61 FR 27782, June 3, 1996; USCG-2001-9286, 66 FR 33640, June 25, 2001]
§ 62.52
Automatic Identification System Aids to Navigation (AIS AtoN).
(a) Aids to Navigation (AtoN) may be enhanced by the use of an automatic identification system (AIS). AIS is a maritime navigation safety communications protocol standardized by the International Telecommunication Union and adopted by the International Maritime Organization for the broadcast or exchange of navigation information between vessels, aircraft, and shore stations. AIS AtoN can autonomously and at fixed intervals broadcast the name, position, dimensions, type, characteristics and status from or concerning an aid to navigation.
(b) AIS AtoN can be either physical (fitted to the AtoN), synthetic (physically fitted somewhere other than to the AtoN) or virtual (physically nonexistent, but capable of being portrayed on AIS-capable displays).
(c) AIS AtoN can also be used to broadcast both laterally (
e.g.,
Port Hand Mark) and non-laterally significant marine safety information (
e.g.,
environmental data, tidal information, and navigation warnings).
[USCG-2005-21869, 80 FR 5329, Jan. 30, 2015, as amended by USCG-2021-0348, 87 FR 3223, Jan. 21, 2022]
§ 62.53
Racons.
(a) Aids to navigation may be enhanced by the use of radar beacons (racons). Racons, when triggered by a radar signal, will transmit a coded reply to the interrogating radar. This reply serves to identify the aid station by exhibiting a series of dots and dashes which appear on the radar display in a line emanating radially from just beyond the echo of the aid station. Although racons may be used on both laterally significant and non-laterally significant aids alike, the racon signal itself is for identification purposes only, and therefore carries no lateral significance.
(b) Racons are also used as bridge marks to mark the best point of passage.
§ 62.54
Ownership identification.
Ownership identification on private or state aids to navigation is permitted so long as it does not change or hinder an understanding of the meaning of the aid to navigation.

Subpart C [Reserved]

# Subpart D—Public Participation in the Aids to Navigation System
§ 62.63
Recommendations.
(a) The public may recommend changes to existing aids to navigation, request new aids or the discontinuation of existing aids, and report aids no longer necessary for maritime safety. These recommendations should be sent to the appropriate District Commander.
(b) Recommendations, requests and reports should be documented with as much information as possible to justify the proposed action. Desirable information includes:
(1) Nature of the vessels which transit the area(s) in the question, including type, displacement, draft, and number of passengers and crew.
(2) Where practicable, the kinds of navigating devices used aboard such vessels (e.g, magnetic or gyro compasses, radio direction finders, radar, loran, and searchlights).
(3) A chartlet or sketch describing the actual or proposed location of the aid(s), and a description of the action requested or recommended.
§ 62.65
Procedure for reporting defects and discrepancies.
(a) Mariners should notify the nearest Coast Guard facility immediately of any observed aids to navigation defects or discrepancies.
(b) The Coast Guard cannot monitor the many thousands of aids in the U.S. Aids to Navigation System simultaneously and continuously. As a result, it is not possible to maintain every aid operating properly and on its charted position at all times. Marine safety will be enhanced if persons finding aids missing, sunk, capsized, damaged, off station, or showing characteristics other than those advertised in the Light List, or other publication, promptly inform the Coast Guard. When making the report to the Coast
Guard the mariner should consult the Light List to ensure the correct geographical information is used due to the similarity of names and geographical areas.
(c) Procedures for reporting defects and discrepancies:
(1)
Radio messages
should be prefixed “Coast Guard” and transmitted directly to a Government shore radio station listed in Chapter three of Radio Navigation Aids Publication, 117, for relay to the relevant District Commander.
(2) Telephone, e-mail, or facsimile messages may also be used to advise the nearest Coast Guard unit of defects or discrepancies in aids to navigation.

All such agreements shall reserve to the District Commander the right to inspect the State aids to navigation without prior notice to the State. They shall stipulate that State aids to navigation will conform to the Uniform State Waterway marking System or to the U.S. Aids to Navigation System and that the State Administrator will modify or remove State aids to navigation without expense to the United States when so directed by the District Commander, subject to the right of appeal on the part of the State Administrator to the Commandant.
(b) A Coast Guard-State agreement shall become effective when both parties have signed the agreements. In lieu of the procedure prescribed in § 66.01-5, the agreement shall constitute blanket approval by the Commandant, of the State aids to navigation, including regulatory markers, established or to be established in State waters for private aids to navigation designated or to be designated by the Commandant.
(c) In addition to the matters set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, Coast Guard-State agreements shall cover the following points, together
with such other matters as the parties find it desirable to include:
(1) A description, in sufficient detail for publication in Notices to Mariners, of all aids to navigations under State jurisdiction in navigable waters of the United States in existence prior to the effective date of the agreement which have not been previously approved under procedures of § 66.01-5.
(2) Procedures for use by the State administrator to notify the District Commander of changes made in State aids to navigation, as required by § 66.05-25.
(3) If prior to December 21, 2003, specification of the marking system to be used, whether the U.S. Aids to Navigation System or the Uniform State Waterway Marking System.

# Subpart 66.10—Uniform State Waterway Marking System
§ 66.10-1
General.
(a) The Uniform State Waterway Marking System's (USWMS) aids to navigation provisions for marking channels and obstructions (see § 66.10-15) may be used in those navigable waters of the U.S. that have been designated as state waters for private aids to navigation and in those internal waters that are non-navigable waters of the U.S. All other provisions for the use of regulatory markers and other aids to navigation must be in accordance with United States Aid to Navigation System, described in part 62 of this subchapter.
(b) Until December 31, 2003, the Uniform State Waterway Marking System's (USWMS) aids to navigation provisions for marking channels and obstructions may be used in those navigable waters of the U.S. that have been designated as state waters for private aids to navigation and in those internal waters that are non-navigable waters of the U.S. All other provisions for the use of regulatory markers and other aids to navigation shall be in accordance with United States Aid to Navigation System, described in part 62 of this subchapter.
(c) The USATONS may be used in all U.S. waters under state jurisdiction, including non-navigable state waters.
[CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33574, June 19, 1998, as amended by USCG-2012-0306, 77 FR 37312, June 21, 2012]
§§ 66.10-5—66.10-10
[Reserved]
§ 66.10-15
Aids to navigation.
(a) USWMS aids to navigation may have lateral or cardinal meaning.
(b) On a well defined channel including a river or other relatively narrow natural or improved waterway, an aid to navigation shall normally be a solid colored buoy. A buoy which marks the
left side of the channel viewed looking upstream or toward the head of navigation shall be colored all black. A buoy which marks the right side of the channel viewed looking upstream or toward the head of navigation shall be colored all red. On a well defined channel, solid colored buoys shall be established in pairs, one on each side of the navigable channel which they mark, and opposite each other to inform the user that the channel lies between the buoys and that the user should pass between the buoys.
(c) On an irregularly defined channel, solid colored buoys may be used singly in staggered fashion on alternate sides of the channel provided they are spaced at sufficiently close intervals to inform the user that the channel lies between the buoys and that the user should pass between the buoys.
(d) Where there is no well-defined channel or when a body of water is obstructed by objects whose nature or location is such that the obstruction can be approached by a vessel from more than one direction, supplemental aids to navigation having cardinal meaning (i.e., pertaining to the cardinal points of the compass, north, east, south, and west) may be used. The use of an aid to navigation having cardinal meaning is discretionary provided that the use of such a marker is limited to wholly State owned waters and the State waters for private aids to navigation as defined and described in this part.
(e) Aids to navigation conforming to the cardinal system shall consist of three distinctly colored buoys.
(1) A white buoy with a red top may be used to indicate to a vessel operator that the operator must pass to the south or west of the buoy.
(2) A white buoy with a black top may be used to indicate to a vessel operator that the operator must pass to the north or east of the buoy.
(3) In addition, a buoy showing alternate vertical red and white stripes may be used to indicate to a vessel operator that an obstruction to navigation extends from the nearest shore to the buoy and that the operator must not pass between the buoy and shore. The number of white and red stripes is discretionary, provided that the white stripes are twice the width of the red stripes.
[CGFR 66-32, 31 FR 10321, July 30, 1966, as amended by CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33574, June 19, 1998; USCG-2001-10714, 69 FR 24982, May 5, 2004]
§ 66.10-35
Navigation lights.
A red light shall only be used on a solid colored red buoy. A green light shall only be used on a solid colored black or a solid colored green buoy. White lights shall be used for all other buoys. When a light is used on a cardinal system buoy or a vertically striped white and red buoy, it shall always be quick flashing.

# Subpart 67.01—General Requirements
§ 67.01-1
Scope.
(a) The regulations in this part prescribe the obstruction lights and sound signals to be operated as privately maintained maritime aids to navigation on the artificial islands and structures which are erected on or over the seabed and subsoil of the Outer Continental Shelf and in the waters under the jurisdiction of the United States, for the purpose of exploring for, developing, removing and transporting resources therefrom.
(b) Subpart 66.01 in Part 66 of this subchapter shall be applicable to all private aids to navigation erected on or over the Outer Continental Shelf in the same manner and to the same extent as they are applicable to private aids to navigation established, erected, or maintained in the waters under the jurisdiction of the United States.
§ 67.01-5
Definitions.
(a)
Structures.
The term “structures” as used in this part shall include all fixed structures, temporary or permanent, for which a Corps of Engineers' permit is issued. It shall include, but is not necessarily limited to, all drilling platforms, Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs) when attached to the bottom, production platforms, quarters platforms, pipe line riser platforms, manifold platforms, loading platforms, boat landings, caissons, well protective structures, tank battery barges submerged on station, drilling barges submerged on location, breakwater barges submerged on location, artificial islands and all other piles, pile clusters, pipes, or structures erected in the waters.
(b)
Class “A”, “B”, or “C” structures.
The term “Class A, B, or C structures” refers to the classification assigned to structures erected in areas in which corresponding requirements for marking are prescribed.
(c)
Line of demarcation.
The term “line of demarcation” means the dividing line used administratively to distinguish between the areas in which structures shall conform to Class “A” and Class “B” or “C” requirements.
(d)
Outer Continental Shelf.
The term “Outer Continental Shelf” means all submerged lands lying seaward and outside the area of lands beneath navigable waters as defined in the Submerged Lands Act (sec. 2, 67 Stat. 29, 43 U. S. C. 1301), and of which the subsoil and seabed appertain to the United States and are subject to its jurisdiction and control.

[USCG-2001-10714, 69 FR 24983, May 5, 2004]
§ 67.01-15
Classification of structures.
(a)
When will structures be assigned to a Class?
The District Commander will assign structures to Class A, B, or C as part of processing an application for a permit to establish and operate lights and sound signals.
(b)
In general, where will the different classes of structures be located?
Specific criteria in paragraph (c) of this section may create exceptions, but, in general, structures the farthest from shore are likely to be assigned to Class A and required to have obstruction lights and sound signals that can be detected from the farthest distance. Structures closest to shore are likely to be assigned to Class C and, while subject to requirements to ensure that they are also detectable from a safe distance away, will be required to have the least powerful obstruction lights or sound signals. The location and standards for Class B structures will generally be in between Class A and C structures.
(c)
What criteria will be used to classify structures?
When assigning a structure to a class, the District Commander will take into consideration whether a line of demarcation has been prescribed, and matters concerning, but not necessarily limited to, the dimensions of the structure and the depth of water in which it is located, the proximity of the structure to vessel routes, the nature and amount of vessel traffic, and the effect of background lighting.
(1) If a line of demarcation has been prescribed, the District Commander will assign those structures seaward of the line of demarcation to Class A. He or she will assign all structures shoreward of the line of demarcation to either Class B or Class C, unless the District Commander determines under § 67.05-25 that the structure should be assigned to Class A because of the structure's proximity to a navigable channel, fairway or line of demarcation.
(2) If a line of demarcation has not been prescribed, the District Commander will assign a structure to Class A, B, or C as he or she deems appropriate.
[USCG-2001-10714, 69 FR 24983, May 5, 2004]
§ 67.01-20
Prescribing lines of demarcation.
The District Commander sends recommendations for establishing or changing lines of demarcation to the Commandant. For the purposes of this part, when the Commandant approves of additions to or changes in prescribed lines of demarcation, such additions or changes will be published in the
Federal Register
and will become effective on the date specified in that publication.
[USCG-2001-10714, 69 FR 24983, May 5, 2004]
§ 67.01-30
Equivalents.
The use of alternate equipment, apparatus, or installation arrangements specified in this part may be permitted
by the District Commander to such extent and under such conditions as will result in achieving a degree of safety or compliance with these regulations equivalent to or above the minimum requirements set forth in this part.

# Subpart 67.05—General Requirements for Lights
§ 67.05-1
Arrangement of obstruction lights.
(a) Structures having a maximum horizontal dimension of 30 feet or less on any one side, or in diameter, shall be required to have one obstruction light visible for 360°.
(b) Structures having a maximum horizontal dimension of over 30 feet, but not in excess of 50 feet, on any one side, or in diameter, shall be required to have two obstruction lights installed on diagonally opposite corners, 180° apart, or as prescribed by the District Commander, each light to have a 360° lens.
(c) Structures having a horizontal dimension of over 50 feet on any one side, or in diameter, shall be required to have an obstruction light on each corner, or 90° apart in the case of circular structures, or as prescribed by the District Commander, each light to have a 360° lens.
(d) Where the overall dimensions of a structure require the installation of two or more obstruction lights, the lights shall all be mounted on the same horizontal plane within the limitations of height specified in § 67.20-5, § 67.25-5, or § 67.30-5, as applicable.
(e) Lesser structures and piles, pile clusters or flare templates, etc., will not normally be required to be marked by obstruction lights, when they are located within 100 yards of a Class “A”, “B” or “C” structure marked by established obstruction lights, but they shall be marked with red or white retro-reflective material, installed as prescribed by the District Commander.
(f) All obstruction lights shall be installed in a manner which will permit at least one of them to be carried in sight of the mariner, regardless of the angle of approach, until the mariner is within 50 feet of the structure, visibility permitting.
[CGFR 58-17, 23 FR 3377, May 20, 1958, as amended by USCG-2001-10714, 69 FR 24983, May 5, 2004]
§ 67.05-5
Multiple obstruction lights.
When more than one obstruction light is required by this part to mark a structure, all such lights shall be operated to flash in unison.
§ 67.05-10
Characteristics of obstruction lights.
All obstruction lights required by this part shall be powered from a reliable power source, including auxiliary power sources as necessary. They shall display a quick-flash characteristic of approximately 60 flashes per minute, unless prescribed otherwise in the permit issued by the District Commander. Their color shall be white when marking Class “A” and “B” structures, and either white or red, as prescribed by the District Commander, when marking Class “C” structures. In determining whether white or red lights shall be authorized, the District Commander shall take into consideration matters concerning, but not necessarily limited to, the dimensions of the structure and the depth of water in which it is located; the proximity of the structure to vessel routes; the nature and amount of vessel traffic; and the effect of background lighting.
§ 67.05-15
Operating periods of obstruction lights.
Obstruction lights shall be displayed at all times between the hours of sunset and sunrise, local time, commencing at the time the construction of a structure is begun. During construction and until such time as a platform capable of supporting the obstruction lights is completed, the fixed lights on an attending vessel shall be used. In addition, when lights are in use for general illumination to facilitate the construction or operation of a structure, and can be seen from any angle of approach at a distance equal to that prescribed for the obstruction
lights for the class of structure, the actual operation of obstruction lights also will not be required.
[CGFR 58-34, 23 FR 7701, Oct. 4, 1958]
§ 67.05-20
Minimum lighting requirements.
The obstruction lighting requirements prescribed in this part are the minimum requirements only and shall not preclude the maintainer from making application for authorization to establish more lights, or lights of greater intensity than required to be visible at the distances prescribed:
Provided,
That the prescribed characteristics of color and flash duration are adhered to.
§ 67.05-25
Special lighting requirements.
Whenever a structure is erected in a position on or adjacent to the edges of navigable channels and fairways, or lines of demarcation, the District Commander is authorized to require the structure to be marked by the lights which in his judgment are necessary for the safety of marine commerce, and without regard to the fact that the structure may be located in an area in which either Class “B” or Class “C” requirements are otherwise applicable. The requirements for the lights in any of these cases, shall not exceed those established for structures in the Class “A” areas.

Lines of demarcation.
The two lines of demarcation described in this section are for administrative purposes to distinguish between the areas in which structures shall be subject to Class “A”, “B” or “C” requirements. The primary line of demarcation delimits the areas to the seaward of which Class “A” requirements are imposed. The secondary line of demarcation delimits the areas to the shoreward of which Class “C” requirements are imposed. In those areas where no secondary line of demarcation is prescribed, the structures shoreward of the primary line of demarcation are considered to be Class “C” structures. Class “B” requirements are imposed on the structures in the areas between the two lines of demarcation.

§ 74.01-10
Charges invoiced to owner for marking sunken wrecks and other obstructions to navigation.
Charges for the establishment, maintenance, and replacement by the Coast Guard of an aid, either permanent or temporary, to mark a sunken wreck or other obstruction to navigation are calculated to recover the Coast Guard costs involved in, or associated with, the marking process. These charges will be invoiced to the owner of the obstruction. Charges for the removal of aids to navigation established by the Coast Guard will be invoiced to the owner unless the District Engineer requests the continued marking of the obstruction. All charges will be assessed in accordance with Subpart 74.20 of this part.

Deposit of payment in special account.
Whenever an aid to navigation or other property belonging to the Coast Guard is damaged or destroyed by a private person, such person shall pay to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard the cost of repair or replacement of such property. The Coast Guard will accept and deposit such payment in a special account in the Treasury for payment therefrom of the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged property. Funds collected in excess of the cost to make repairs or replacements shall be refunded.

§ 76.01-1
Sale of equipment not readily procurable.
The Commandant is authorized to sell aids to navigation apparatus or equipment to foreign, state, or municipal governments or departments thereof; parties required to maintain private aids to navigation to mark wrecks, piers, or other obstructions; contractors engaged on public works; and in other cases in which in the judgment of the Commandant the public interest may be served:
Provided:
(a) Such equipment has not been reported by the Coast Guard to the General Services Administration as excess (if the equipment has been reported to the General Services Administration as excess, the Commandant will submit the request to that administration for further action); and
(b) Such equipment is not readily procurable in the open market. Requests to purchase such apparatus or equipment shall give sufficient reasons why the article or articles cannot be readily procured in the open market. If the Commandant considers that an article can be readily procured in the open market the prospective purchaser will be so informed, and given the names of dealers or manufacturers. Sales shall be invoiced at cost plus 25 percent for overhead. Proceeds of such sales shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the current appropriation for operating expenses, Coast Guard.
§ 76.01-5
Sale of condemned equipment.
When any condemned supplies, materials, or equipment cannot be profitably used in work of the Coast Guard, they will be disposed of under appropriate regulations of the General Services Administration. Applications for purchase of such materials may be submitted to the Commandant who will process them for further action under the applicable regulations.

Nothing in this part shall be construed to affect the regulations concerning the transfer of supplies, materials, equipment, or land between other Federal agencies.

# SUBCHAPTER D—INTERNATIONAL NAVIGATION RULES

# Special Note—Application of the 72 COLREGS to territories and possessions.
a. Article III of the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisons at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), done at London, October 20, 1972, as rectified by Proces-Verbal of December 1, 1973, provides that a party may notify the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO, formerly Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization or IMCO) that it extends the application of the Convention to territory for which it is responsible for international relations. Since it is the intention of the United States that the 72 COLREGS apply to all U.S. territories and possessions to the same extent that the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1960 (60 COLREGS) (16 USC 794, TIAS 5813) previously applied, the United States has given notice to the Secretary-General that the provisions of the 1972 COLREGS are applicable on July 15, 1977, to the following territories and possessions for which the United States is responsible for international relations:
Puerto Rico
Guam
The Canal Zone
The Virgin Islands of the United States
American Samoa
Midway Island
Wake Island
Johnston Island
Palmyra Island
Kingman Reef
Howland Island
Baker Island
Jarvis Island
Navassa Island
b. In accordance with Article III, other parties to the Convention have notified the Secretary-General that application of 72 COLREGS is extended. These parties with their territorial extensions are listed in Table 1.
Table 1. Territorial Extensions of Other Parties to 72 COLREGS
Party to convention
Territories to which 72 COLREGS are extended
United Kingdom
Hong Kong.
Because earlier formulations of the COLREGS were not elaborated as treaties, they came into force by the almost simultaneous enactment of domestic legislation by the majority of maritime nations. The COLREGS were judicially considered as being customary international law, that is to say international law based upon the consensus of maritime nations rather than upon an express instrument. Because 72 COLREGS was elaborated as a treaty, and under usual treaty practice only parties are bound, there may be a period of time after the 72 COLREGS come into force during which the ships of a nation not party to 72 COLREGS might not be considered as being bound to comply with the convention. While it is most likely that the 72 COLREGS will rapidly achieve the status of customary international law, thereby obviating any concern on the part of the mariner as to whether a particular nation is a party, it does not necessarily follow that the courts in all nations will apply 72 COLREGS to the vessels of a non-party nation. In the absence of changes in their domestic law there may be certain nations that will feel compelled to continue 60 COLREGS in force, despite the coming into force of 72 COLREGS.
The following nations are Contracting Parties for which 72 COLREGS will apply upon the Convention's entry into force:
Algeria
Bahamas
Belgium
Brazil
Bulgaria
Canada
Denmark
Finland
France
German Democratic Republic
Germany, Federal Republic

§ 81.1
Definitions.
As used in this part:
72 COLREGS
refers to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, done at London, October 20, 1972, as rectified by the Proces-Verbal of December 1, 1973, as amended.
A vessel of special construction or purpose
means a vessel designed or modified to perform a special function and whose arrangement is thereby made relatively inflexible.
Interference with the special function of the vessel
occurs when installation or use of lights, shapes, or sound-signaling appliances under 72 COLREGS prevents or significantly hinders the operation in which the vessel is usually engaged.
[CGD 77-136, 47 FR 13799, Apr. 1, 1982]
§ 81.3
General.
Vessels of special construction or purpose which cannot fully comply with the light, shape, and sound signal provisions of 72 COLREGS without interfering with their special function may instead meet alternative requirements. The Chief of the Prevention Division in each Coast Guard District Office makes this determination and requires that alternative compliance be as close as possible with the 72 COLREGS. These regulations set out the procedure by which a vessel may be certified for alternative compliance. The information collection and recordkeeping requirements in §§ 81.5 and 81.18 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control No. 1625-0019.
[CGD 77-136, 47 FR 13799, Apr. 1, 1982, as amended by USCG-2006-25150, 71 FR 39208, July 12, 2006; USCG-2018-0874, 84 FR 30878, June 28, 2019]

§ 82.3
Pushing vessel and vessel being pushed: Composite unit.
Rule 24(b) of the 72 COLREGS states that when a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit, they are regarded as a power-driven vessel and must exhibit the lights under Rule 23. A “composite unit” is interpreted to be a pushing vessel that is rigidly connected by mechanical means to a vessel being pushed so they react to sea and swell as one vessel. “Mechanical means” does not include the following:
(a) Lines.
(b) Hawsers.
(c) Wires.
(d) Chains.

Lights for moored vessels.
For the purposes of Rule 30 of the 72 COLREGS, a
vessel at anchor
includes a barge made fast to one or more mooring buoys or other similar device attached to the sea or river floor. Such a barge may be lighted as a vessel at anchor in accordance with Rule 30, or
may be lighted on the corners in accordance with 33 CFR 83.30(h) through (l).

§ 83.01
Application (Rule 1).
(a) These Rules apply to all vessels upon the inland waters of the United States, and to vessels of the United States on the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes to the extent that there is no conflict with Canadian law.
(b)(i) These Rules constitute special rules made by an appropriate authority within the meaning of Rule 1(b) of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, including annexes currently in force for the United States (“International Regulations”).
(ii) All vessels complying with the construction and equipment requirements of the International Regulations are considered to be in compliance with these Rules.
(c) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Secretary of the Navy with respect to additional station or signal lights and shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or by the Secretary with respect to additional station or signal lights and shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights and shapes or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape, or signal authorized elsewhere under these Rules. Notice of such special rules shall be published in the
Federal Register
and, after the effective date specified in such notice, they shall
have effect as if they were a part of these Rules.
(d) Traffic separation schemes may be established for the purpose of these Rules. Vessel traffic service regulations may be in effect in certain areas.
(e) Whenever the Secretary determines that a vessel or class of vessels of special construction or purpose cannot comply fully with the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to the number, position, range, or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signaling appliances, the vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to the number, position, range, or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signaling appliances, as the Secretary shall have determined to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules. The Secretary may issue a certificate of alternative compliance for a vessel or class of vessels specifying the closest possible compliance with these Rules. The Secretary of the Navy shall make these determinations and issue certificates of alternative compliance for vessels of the Navy.
(f) The Secretary may accept a certificate of alternative compliance issued by a contracting party to the International Regulations if it determines that the alternative compliance standards of the contracting party are substantially the same as those of the United States.
(g) The operator of each self-propelled vessel 12 meters or more in length shall carry, on board and maintain for ready reference, a copy of these Rules.
[USCG-2012-0102, 79 FR 37912, July 2, 2014, as amended by USCG-2022-0071, 87 FR 54390, Sept. 6, 2022]

# Subpart B—Steering and Sailing Rules

# Conduct of Vessels in Any Condition of Visibility
§ 83.04
Application (Rule 4).
Rules 4 through 10 (§§ 83.04 through 83.10) apply in any condition of visibility.
§ 83.05
Look-out (Rule 5).
Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.
§ 83.06
Safe speed (Rule 6).
Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions. In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account:
(a) By all vessels:
(i) The state of visibility;
(ii) The traffic density including concentration of fishing vessels or any other vessels;
(iii) The maneuverability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions;
(iv) At night, the presence of background light such as from shore lights or from back scatter of her own lights;
(v) The state of wind, sea, and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards;
(vi) The draft in relation to the available depth of water.
(b) Additionally, by vessels with operational radar:
(i) The characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment;
(ii) Any constraints imposed by the radar range scale in use;
(iii) The effect on radar detection of the sea state, weather, and other sources of interference;
(iv) The possibility that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may not be detected by radar at an adequate range;
(v) The number, location, and movement of vessels detected by radar;
(vi) The more exact assessment of the visibility that may be possible when radar is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the vicinity.

§ 83.07
Risk of collision (Rule 7).
(a) Every vessel shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision exists. If there is any doubt such risk shall be deemed to exist.
(b) Proper use shall be made of radar equipment if fitted and operational, including long-range scanning to obtain early warning of risk of collision and radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects.
(c) Assumptions shall not be made on the basis of scanty information, especially scanty radar information.
(d) In determining if risk of collision exists the following considerations shall be among those taken into account:
(i) Such risk shall be deemed to exist if the compass bearing of an approaching vessel does not appreciably change.
(ii) Such risk may sometimes exist even when an appreciable bearing change is evident, particularly when approaching a very large vessel or a tow or when approaching a vessel at close range.
§ 83.08
Action to avoid collision (Rule 8).
(a) Any action taken to avoid collision shall be taken in accordance with the Rules of this subpart (Rules 4-19) (§§ 83.04 through 83.19) and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.
(b) Any alteration of course and/or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small alterations of course and/or speed should be avoided.
(c) If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.
(d) Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.
(e) If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping or reversing her means of propulsion.
(f)(i) A vessel which, by any of these Rules, is required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel shall, when required by the circumstances of the case, take early action to allow sufficient sea room for the safe passage of the other vessel.
(ii) A vessel required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel is not relieved of this obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by the Rules of Subpart B (Rules 4-19).
(iii) A vessel the passage of which is not to be impeded remains fully obliged to comply with the Rules of Subpart B (Rules 4-19) when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision.
§ 83.09
Narrow channels (Rule 9).
(a)(i) A vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or fairway shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel or fairway which lies on
her starboard side as is safe and practicable.

The vessel proceeding upbound against the current shall hold as necessary to permit safe passing.
(b) A vessel of less than 20 meters in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the passage of a vessel that can safely navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.
(c) A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway.
(d) A vessel must not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such channel or fairway. The latter vessel must use the signal prescribed in Rule 34(d) (§ 83.34(d)) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel.
(e)(i) In a narrow channel or fairway when overtaking, the power-driven vessel intending to overtake another power-driven vessel shall indicate her intention by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c) (§ 83.34(c)) and take steps to permit safe passing. The power-driven vessel being overtaken, if in agreement, shall sound the same signal and may, if specifically agreed to, take steps to permit safe passing. If in doubt she shall sound the signal prescribed in Rule 34(d) (§ 83.34(d)).
(ii) This Rule does not relieve the overtaking vessel of her obligation under Rule 13 (§ 83.13).
(f) A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall navigate with particular alertness and caution and shall sound the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(e) (§ 83.34(e)).
(g) Any vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid anchoring in a narrow channel.

# Conduct of Vessels in Sight of One Another
§ 83.11
Application (Rule 11).
Rules 11 through 18 (§§ 83.11 through 83.18) apply to vessels in sight of one another.
§ 83.12
Sailing vessels (Rule 12).
(a) When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other as follows:
(i) When each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other.
(ii) When both have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward.
(iii) If a vessel with the wind on the port side sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on the port or on the starboard side, she shall keep out of the way of the other.
(b) For the purpose of this Rule, the windward side shall be deemed to be the side opposite to that on which the mainsail is carried or, in the case of a square-rigged vessel, the side opposite to that on which the largest fore-and-aft sail is carried.
§ 83.13
Overtaking (Rule 13).
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in Rules 4 through 18 (§§ 83.04 through 83.18), any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.
(b) A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another vessel from a direction more than 22.5 degrees abaft her beam; that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel she is overtaking, that at night she would be able to see only the sternlight of that vessel but neither of her sidelights.
(c) When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether she is overtaking another, she shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly.
(d) Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.
§ 83.14
Head-on situation (Rule 14).
(a) Unless otherwise agreed, when two power-driven vessels are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision each shall alter her course to starboard so that each shall pass on the port side of the other.
(b) Such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead and by night she could see the masthead lights of the other in a line or nearly in a line and/or both sidelights and by day she observes the corresponding aspect of the other vessel.
(c) When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether such a situation exists she shall assume that it does exist and act accordingly.
(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this Rule, a power-driven vessel operating on the Great Lakes, Western Rivers, or waters specified by the Secretary, and proceeding downbound with a following current shall have the right-of-way over an upbound vessel, shall propose the manner of passage, and shall initiate the maneuvering signals prescribed by Rule 34(a)(i) (§ 83.34(a)(i)), as appropriate.
§ 83.15
Crossing situation (Rule 15).
(a) When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this Rule, on the Great Lakes, Western Rivers, or water specified by the Secretary, a power-driven vessel crossing a river shall keep out of the way of a power-driven vessel ascending or descending the river.
§ 83.16
Action by give-way vessel (Rule 16).
Every vessel which is directed to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, so far as possible, take early and substantial action to keep well clear.
§ 83.17
Action by stand-on vessel (Rule 17).
(a)(i) Where one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed.
(ii) The latter vessel may, however, take action to avoid collision by her maneuver alone, as soon as it becomes apparent to her that the vessel required to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action in compliance with these Rules.
(b) When, from any cause, the vessel required to keep her course and speed finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give-way vessel alone, she shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision.
(c) A power-driven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in accordance with paragraph (a)(ii) of this Rule to avoid collision with another power-driven vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side.
(d) This Rule does not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligation to keep out of the way.
§ 83.18
Responsibilities between vessels (Rule 18).
Except where Rules 9, 10, and 13 (§§ 83.09, 83.10, and 83.13) otherwise require:

If so, she shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible the following shall be avoided:
(i) An alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken;
(ii) An alteration of course toward a vessel abeam or abaft the beam.
(e) Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of her beam the fog signal of another vessel, or which cannot avoid a close-quarters situation with another vessel forward of her beam, shall reduce her speed to the minimum at which she can be kept on course. She shall if necessary take all her way off and, in any event, navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over.

§ 86.01
Whistles.
(a)
Frequencies and range of audibility.
The fundamental frequency of the signal shall lie within the range 70-700 Hz. The range of audibility of the signal from a whistle shall be determined by those frequencies, which may include the fundamental and/or one or more higher frequencies, which lie within the range 180-700 Hz (±1%) for a vessel of 20 meters or more in length, or 180-2100 Hz (±1%) for a vessel of less than 20 meters in length and which provide the sound pressure levels specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Limits of fundamental frequencies.
To ensure a wide variety of whistle characteristics, the fundamental frequency of a whistle shall be between the following limits:
(i) 70-200 Hz, for a vessel 200 meters or more in length.
(ii) 130-350 Hz, for a vessel 75 meters but less than 200 meters in length.
(iii) 250-700 Hz, for a vessel less than 75 meters in length.
(c)
Sound signal intensity and range of audibility.
A whistle fitted in a vessel shall provide, in the direction of maximum intensity of the whistle and at a distance of 1 meter from it, a sound pressure level in at least one
1/3
rd-octave band within the range of frequencies 180-700 Hz (±1%) for a vessel of 20 meters or more in length, or 180-2100 Hz (±1%) for a vessel of less than 20 meters in length, of not less than the appropriate figure given in Table 86.01(c) of this section. The range of audibility in Table 86.01(c) is the approximate range at which a whistle may be heard on its forward axis with 90% probability in conditions of still air on board a vessel having average background noise level at the listening posts (taken to be 68 dB in the octave band centered on 250 Hz and 63 dB in the octave band centered on 500 Hz). It is shown for information purposes only. In practice, the range at which a whistle may be heard is extremely variable and depends critically on weather conditions; the values given can be regarded as typical but under conditions of strong wind or high ambient noise level at the listening post the range may be reduced.

(d)
Directional properties.
The sound pressure level of a directional whistle shall be not more than 4 dB below the sound pressure level, specified in paragraph (c) of this section, in any direction in the horizontal plane within ±45 degrees of the forward axis. The sound pressure level of the whistle in any other direction in the horizontal plane shall not be more than 10 dB less than the sound pressure level specified for the forward axis, so that the range of audibility in any direction will be at least half the range required on the forward axis. The sound pressure level shall be measured in that one
1/3
rd
-octave band which determines the audibility range.
(e)
Positioning of whistles.
(i) When a directional whistle is to be used as the only whistle on the vessel and is permanently installed, it shall be installed with its forward axis directed forward.
(ii) A whistle shall be placed as high as practicable on a vessel, in order to reduce interception of the emitted sound by obstructions and also to minimize hearing damage risk to personnel. The sound pressure level of the vessel's own signal at listening posts shall not exceed 110 dB(A) and so far as practicable should not exceed 100 dB(A).
(f)
Fitting of more than one whistle.
If whistles are fitted at a distance apart of more than 100 meters, they shall not be sounded simultaneously.
(g)
Combined whistle systems.
(i) A combined whistle system is a number of whistles (sound emitting sources) operated together. For the purposes of the Rules of Subchapter E a combined whistle system is to be regarded as a single whistle.
(ii) The whistles of a combined system shall:
(1) Be located at a distance apart of not more than 100 meters;
(2) Be sounded simultaneously;
(3) Each have a fundamental frequency different from those of the others by at least 10 Hz; and
(4) Have a tonal characteristic appropriate for the length of vessel which shall be evidenced by at least two-thirds of the whistles in the combined system having fundamental frequencies falling within the limits prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, or if there are only two whistles in the combined system, by the higher fundamental frequency falling within the limits prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.

# Note to paragraph (
g

# ):
If, due to the presence of obstructions, the sound field of a single whistle or of one of the whistles referred to in paragraph (f) of this section is likely to have a zone of greatly reduced signal level, a combined whistle system should be fitted so as to overcome this reduction.
(h)
Towing vessel whistles.
A power-driven vessel normally engaged in pushing ahead or towing alongside may, at all times, use a whistle whose characteristic falls within the limits prescribed by paragraph (b) of this section for the longest customary composite length of the vessel and its tow.
§ 86.02
Bell or gong.
(a)
Intensity of signal.
A bell or gong, or other device having similar sound characteristics shall produce a sound pressure level of not less than 110 dB at 1 meter.
(b)
Construction.
Bells and gongs shall be made of corrosion-resistant material and designed to give clear tone.
The diameter of the mouth of the bell shall be not less than 300 mm for vessels of 20 meters or more in length. Where practicable, a power-driven bell striker is recommended to ensure constant force but manual operation shall be possible. The mass of the striker shall be not less than 3 percent of the mass of the bell.

§ 89.1
Definitions.
As used in this subpart:
Inland Rules
refers to the Inland Navigation Rules contained in the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-591) and the technical annexes established under that act.
A vessel of special construction or purpose
means a vessel designed or modified to perform a special function and whose arrangement is thereby made relatively inflexible.
Interference with the special function of the vessel
occurs when installation or use of lights, shapes, or sound-signaling appliances under the Inland Rules prevents or significantly hinders the operation in which the vessel is usually engaged.
[CGD 80-157, 47 FR 13801, Apr. 1, 1982, as amended by CGD 83-028, 49 FR 33876, Aug. 27, 1984]
§ 89.3
General.
Vessels of special construction or purpose which cannot fully comply
with the light, shape, and sound signal provisions of the Inland Rules without interfering with their special function may instead meet alternative requirements.

Purpose.
This part contains the interpretative rules for the Inland Rules. These interpretative rules are intended as a guide to assist the public and promote compliance with the Inland Rules.
§ 90.3
Pushing vessel and vessel being pushed: Composite unit.
Rule 24(b) of the Inland Rules states that when a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit, they are regarded as a power-driven vessel and must exhibit the lights prescribed in Rule 23. A “composite unit” is interpreted to be the combination of a pushing vessel and a vessel being push ahead that are rigidly connected by mechanical means so they react to sea and swell as one vessel. Mechanical means does not include lines, wires, hawsers, or chains.
§ 90.5
Lights for moored vessels.
A
vessel at anchor
includes a vessel made fast to one or more mooring buoys or other similar device attached to the ocean floor. Such vessels may be lighted as a vessel at anchor in accordance with Rule 30, or may be lighted on the corners in accordance with 33 CFR 88.30(h) through (l).

§ 96.470
How does the Coast Guard terminate an organization's authorization?
At least every 12 months, the Coast Guard evaluates organizations authorized under this subpart. If an organization fails to maintain acceptable standards, the Coast Guard may terminate that organization's authorization, remove the organization from the Commandant's list of recognized organizations, and further evaluate the organization's recognition under 46 CFR part 8.
§ 96.480
What is the status of a certificate if the issuing organization has its authority terminated?
Any certificate issued by an organization authorized by the Coast Guard whose authorization is later terminated remains valid until—
(a) Its original expiration date,
(b) The date of the next periodic audit required to maintain the certificate's validity, or
(c) Whichever of paragraphs (a) or (b) occurs first.
§ 96.490
What further obligations exist for an organization if the Coast Guard terminates its authorization?
The written agreement by which an organization receives authorization from the Coast Guard places it under certain obligations if the Coast Guard revokes that authorization. The organization agrees to send written notice of its termination to all responsible persons, companies and vessels that have received certificates from the organization. In that notice, the organization must include—
(a) A written statement explaining why the organization's authorization was terminated by the Coast Guard;
