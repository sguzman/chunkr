(2) Section 3402(j) and this section are not applicable with respect to wages paid to the employee that are subject to withholding under § 31.3402(g)-1(a)(2). Section 3402(j) and this section are not applicable with respect to noncash wages paid to a retail commission salesman for services performed by him in a capacity other than as such a salesman. Such sections are not applicable with respect to noncash wages paid by an employer to an employee for services performed as a retail commission salesman if the employer ordinarily pays the employee remuneration other than by way of cash commissions for such services. Thus, noncash remuneration may not be disregarded in computing the amount to be deducted and withheld in a case where the employee, for services performed as a retail commission salesman, is paid both a salary and cash commissions on sales, or is ordinarily paid in something other than cash (stocks, bonds, or other forms of property) notwithstanding that the amount of remuneration paid to the employee is measured by sales.
(b)
Retail commission salesman.
For purposes of section 3402(j) and this section, the term “retail commission salesman” includes an employee who is engaged in the solicitation of orders at retail, that is, from the ultimate consumer, for merchandise or other products offered for sale by his employer. The term does not include an employee salesman engaged in the solicitation on behalf of his employer of orders from wholesalers, retailers, or others, for merchandise for resale. However, if the salesman solicits orders for more than one principal, he is not excluded from the term solely because he solicits orders from wholesalers or retailers on behalf of one or more principals. In such case the salesman may be a retail commission salesman with respect to services performed for one or more principals and not with respect to services performed for his other principals.
(c)
Noncash remuneration.
The term “noncash remuneration” includes remuneration paid in any medium other than cash, such as goods or commodities, stocks, bonds, or other forms of property. The term does not include checks or other monetary media of exchange.
(d)
Cross reference.
For provisions relating to records required to be kept and statements which must be furnished an employee with respect to wage payments, see sections 6001 and 6051 and the regulations thereunder in Subpart G of this part.

§ 31.3402(k)-1
Special rule for tips.
(a)
Withholding of income tax in respect of tips
—(1)
In general.
Subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an employer is required to deduct and withhold from each of his employees tax in respect of those tips received by the employee which constitute wages. (For provisions relating to the treatment of tips as wages, see §§ 3401(a)(16) and 3401(f).) The employer shall make the withholding by deducting or causing to be deducted the amount of the tax from wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer or other funds turned over by the employee to the employer (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section). For purposes of this section the terms “wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer” means, with respect to a payment of wages, an amount equal to wages as defined in section 3401(a) except that tips and noncash remuneration which are wages are not included, less the sum of—
(i) The tax under section 3101 required to be collected by the employer in respect of wages as defined in section 3121(a) (exclusive of tips);
(ii) The tax under section 3402 required to be collected by the employer in respect of wages as defined in section 3401(a) (exclusive of tips); and
(iii) The amount of taxes imposed on the remuneration of an employee withheld by the employer pursuant to State and local law (including amounts withheld under an agreement between the employer and the employee pursuant to such law) except that the amount of
taxes taken into account in this subdivision shall not include any amount attributable to tips.
(2)
Limitations.
An employer is required to deduct and withhold the tax on tips which constitute wages only in respect of those tips which are reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a). The employer is responsible for the collection of the tax on tips reported to him only to the extent that the emloyer can, during the period beginning at the time the written statement is submitted to him and ending at the close of the calendar year in which the statement was submitted, collect the tax by deducting it or causing it to be deducted as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(3)
Furnishing of funds to employer.
If the amount of the tax in respect of tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished pursuant to section 6053(a) exceeds the wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer from which the employer is required to withhold the tax in respect of such tips, the employee may furnish to the employer, within the period specified in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, an amount of money equal to the amount of such excess.
(b)
Less than $20 of tips.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, if an employee furnishes to his employer a written statement—
(1) Covering a period of less than 1 month, and
(2) The statement is furnished to the employer prior to the close of the 10th day of the month following the month in which the tips were actually received by the employee, and
(3) The aggregate amount of tips reported in the statement and in all other statements previously furnished by the employee covering periods within the same month is less than $20, and such statements, collectively, do not cover the entire month,
the employer may deduct amounts equivalent to the tax on such tips from wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer or other funds turned over by the employee to the employer. For provisions relating to the repayment to an employee, or other disposition, of amounts deducted from an employee's remuneration in excess of the correct amount of tax, see § 31.6413(a)-1. (As to the exclusion from wages of tips of less than $20, see § 31.3401(a)(16)-1.)
(c)
Priority of tax collection
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a payment of wages (exclusive of tips), the employer shall deduct or cause to be deducted in the following order:
(i) The tax under section 3101 and the tax under section 3402 with respect to such payment of wages.
(ii) Any tax under section 3101 which, at the time of payment of the wages, the employer is required to collect—
(
a
) In respect of tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a), or
(
b
) By reason of the employer's election to make collection of the tax under section 3101 in respect of tips on an estimated basis,
but which has not been collected by the employer and which cannot be deducted from funds turned over by the employee to the employer for such purpose. (See § 31.3102-3, relating to collection of, and liability for, employee tax on tips.)
(iii) Any tax under section 3402 which, at the time of the payment of the wages, the employer is required to collect—
(
a
) In respect of tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a), or
(
b
) By reason of the employer's election to make collection of the tax under section 3402 in respect of tips on an estimated basis,
but which has not been collected by the employer and which cannot be deducted from funds turned over by the employee to the employer for such purpose. For provisions relating to the witholding of tax on the basis of average estimated tips, see paragraph (b) of § 31.3402(h)(1)-1.
(2)
Examples.
The application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples
(The amounts used in the following examples are intended for illustrative purposes and do not necessarily reflect currently effective rates or amounts.):

# Example 1.
W is a waiter employed by R restaurant. W's principal remuneration for his services is in the form of tips received from patrons of R; however, he also receives a salary from R of $40 per week, which is paid to him every Friday. W is a member of a labor union which has a contract with R pursuant to which R is to collect dues for the union by withholding from the wages of its employees at the rate of $1 per week. In addition to the taxes required to be withheld under the Internal Revenue Code, W's wages are subject to withholding of a state income tax imposed upon both his regular wage and his tips received and reported to R.
On Monday of a given week W furnishes a written statement to R pursuant to section 6053(a) in which he reports the receipt of $160 in tips. The $40 wage to be paid to W on Friday of the same week is subject to the following items of withholding:
Taxes with respect to regular wage
Taxes with respect to tips

$1.76
$7.04

28.30
33.95
State income tax
1.20
4.80
6.00
Union dues
1.00
Total
49.75
W does not turn over any funds to R. R should satisfy the taxes imposed by sections 3101 and 3402 out of W's $40 wage as follows: The taxes imposed with respect to the regular wage (a total of $74l) should be satisfied first. The taxes imposed with respect to tips are to be withheld only out of “wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer” as that phrase is defined in §§ 31.3102-3(a)(1) and 31.3402(k)-1(a)(1). The amount of such wages under the control of employer in this example is $31.39, or $40, less the amounts applied in satisfaction of the Federal and State withholding taxes imposed with respect to the regular $40 wage ($8.61). This $31.39 is applied first in satisfaction of the tax under section 3101 with respect to tips ($7.04) in the balance of $24.35 is applied in partial satisfaction of the withholding of income tax at source under section 3402 with respect to tips. The amount of the tax with respect to tips under section 3402 which remains unsatisfied ($3.95) should be withheld from wages under the control of the employer the following week.

# Example 2.
During the week following the week dealt with in example 1, W furnishes a written statement to R pursuant to withholding:

As in example 1, the amount of “wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer” is $31.39. This amount is applied first in satisfaction of the tax under section 3101 with respect to tips ($5.72) and the balance is applied in partial satisfaction of the withholding of income tax at source under section 3402 with respect to tips (a total of $26.25), including that portion of the amount required to be withheld from the prior week's wages which remained unsatisfied. The amount of the tax with respect to tips under section 3402 which remains unsatisfied ($0.58) should be withheld from wages under the control of the employer the following week.
[T.D. 7001, 34 FR 1002, Jan. 23, 1969, as amended by T.D. 7053, 35 FR 11628, July 21, 1970]
§ 31.3402(l)-1
Determination and disclosure of marital or filing status.
(a)
In general.
An employer shall apply the applicable percentage method or wage bracket method withholding tables corresponding to the marital status or filing status that the employee selects on a valid withholding allowance certificate as set forth in forms, instructions, publications, and other guidance prescribed by the Commissioner.
(b)
Employee's filing status.
An employee will be treated as single unless the employee selects head of household or married filing jointly filing status on a valid withholding allowance certificate. Employees may select a filing status other than single, subject to the following conditions:
(1) The employee may select head of household filing status on the employee's withholding allowance certificate only if the employee reasonably expects to be eligible to claim head of
household filing status under section 2(b) and § 1.2-2(b) of this chapter on the employee's income tax return.
(2) The employee may select married filing jointly filing status on the employee's withholding allowance certificate only if paragraph (d) of this section applies to the employee and the employee reasonably expects to file jointly a single return of income under subtitle A of the Code with the employee's spouse. If an employee is married and expects to file a separate return from the employee's spouse, the employee must select single or married filing separately filing status on the employee's withholding allowance certificate.
(c)
Change in filing status
—(1)
In general.
Unless paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies, the employee must within 10 days furnish the employer with a new withholding allowance certificate if the employee's filing status changes—
(i) From married filing jointly (or qualifying widow(er)) to head of household, married filing separately, or single; or
(ii) From head of household to married filing separately or single.
(2)
Exception.
If the employee's filing status changes in the manner described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, but the total effect of the changes together with other changes affecting the employee's anticipated tax liability under subtitle A does not result in an amount of tax to be deducted and withheld from the employee's wages for the taxable year that is less than the employee's anticipated tax liability under subtitle A, the employee is not required to furnish a new withholding allowance certificate within 10 days. However, the employee must furnish a new withholding allowance certificate to take effect the following calendar year by the later of December 1 of the calendar year in which the employee's filing status changes, or within 10 days of such change.
(d)
Determination of marital status.
For the purposes of section 3402(l)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section, paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall be applied in determining whether an employee is a single person or a married person:
(1) An employee shall on any day be considered as a single person and not married if—
(i) The employee is legally separated from the employee's spouse under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance; or
(ii) Either the employee or the employee's spouse is, or on any preceding day within the same calendar year was, a nonresident alien unless the employee has made or reasonably expects to make an election under section 6013(g) in the time and manner prescribed in § 1.6013-6(a)(4) of this chapter.
(2) An employee shall on any day be considered as a married person if paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not apply and—
(i) The employee is married within the meaning of § 301.7701-18(b) of this chapter on the day the withholding allowance certificate is furnished;
(ii) The employee's spouse died during the employee's taxable year; or
(iii) The employee's spouse died during one of the two taxable years immediately preceding the current taxable year and, on the basis of facts existing at the beginning of such day, the employee reasonably expects, at the close of the taxable year, to be a surviving spouse as defined in section 2 and § 1.2-2(a) of this chapter. The employee must reasonably expect to file an income tax return claiming qualifying widow(er) status.
(e)
Applicability date.
The provisions of this section apply on and after October 6, 2020. Taxpayers may choose to apply paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) this section on or after January 1, 2020 and before October 6, 2020. For rules that apply before October 6, 2020, see 26 CFR part 31, revised as of April 1, 2020.

§ 31.3402(m)-1
Additional withholding allowance.
(a)
In general.
In determining the withholding allowance or additional reductions in withholding under section 3402(m) on employee withholding allowance certificates furnished to the employer to be effective on or after January 1, 2020, employees may take into account the estimated tax deductions described in paragraph (b) of this

(2) Estimated deductions described in section 62(a), except for—
(i) Any deduction described in section 62(a)(1);

successor
) or Publication 505 (or successor), and the employee is not an employee whose employer must withhold for that employee pursuant to a notice under § 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g)(2);
(2) The credit for tax withheld at source for nonresident aliens and foreign corporations under section 33; and
(3) Any credit to the extent that the employee has filed or expects to file any IRS form claiming such credit other than the employee's United States Individual Income Tax Return (Form 1040).
(d)
Estimated tax payments.
Employees may take into account estimated tax payments only if—
(1) The employee's employer is not obligated to withhold on the employee's wages pursuant to a notice under § 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g)(2);
(2) The amount claimed has been paid with the payment voucher from Form 1040-ES (or was otherwise designated by the taxpayer as a payment of estimated tax) or is planned to be made with respect to nonwage items but only if the planned amount does not decrease withholding below the pro-rata share of chapter 1 tax attributable to wages as determined under forms, instructions, publications, and other guidance prescribed by the Commissioner;
(3) The employee uses the Tax Withholding Estimator (or successor) or Publication 505 (or successor) and enters the amount claimed pursuant to the instructions in the Tax Withholding Estimator (or successor) or Publication 505 (or successor); and
(4) In using the Tax Withholding Estimator (or successor) or Publication 505 (or successor), the employee includes all items of nonwage income the Tax Withholding Estimator (or successor) or Publication 505 (or successor) prompts or instructs the employee to enter or include.
(e)
Definitions and special rules
—(1)
Estimated.
The term “estimated” as used in this section to modify the terms “deduction,” “deductions,” “credits,” “losses,” and “amount of decrease” means with respect to an employee the aggregate dollar amount of a particular item that the employee reasonably expects will be allowable to the employee on the employee's income tax return for the estimation year under the section of the Code specified for each item. In no event shall that amount exceed the sum of:
(i) The amount shown for that particular item on the income tax return that the employee has filed for the taxable year preceding the estimation year (or, if such return has not yet been filed, then the income tax return that the employee filed for the taxable year preceding such year), which amount the employee also reasonably expects to show on the income tax return for the estimation year; plus
(ii) The determinable additional amounts (as defined in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section) for each item for the estimation year.
(iii) The determinable additional amounts are amounts that are not included in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section and that are demonstrably attributable to identifiable events during the estimation year or the preceding year. Amounts are demonstrably attributable to identifiable events if they relate to payments already made during the estimation year, to binding obligations to make payments (including the payment of taxes) during the year, and to other transactions or occurrences, the implementation of which has begun and is verifiable at the time the employee furnishes a withholding allowance certificate. The estimation year is the taxable year including the day on which the employee furnishes the withholding allowance certificate to the employer, except that if the employee furnishes the withholding allowance certificate to the employer and specifies on the certificate that the certificate is not to take effect until a specified future date, the estimation year shall be the taxable year including that specified future date. It is not reasonable for an employee to include in his or her withholding computation for the estimation year any amount that is shown for a particular item on the income tax return that the employee has filed for the taxable year preceding the estimation year (or, if such return has not yet been filed, then the income tax return that the employee filed for the taxable year preceding such year) and that has been disallowed by the Service as part of an adjustment described in § 601.103(b) of this chapter (relating to examination and determination of tax liability) and § 601.105(b) through (d) of this chapter (relating to examination of returns), without regard to any pending request for reconsideration, protest, request for consideration by an Appeals office, or civil action in which such proposed adjustment is at issue.
(2)
Restriction for employees with nonwage income.
The employee must offset any deduction described in paragraph (b) of this section with items includible in the employee's gross income for which no Federal income tax is withheld in accordance with forms, instructions, publications, and other guidance prescribed by the Commissioner. In addition, an employee whose employer must withhold for that employee pursuant to a notice under § 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g)(2) must offset any tax benefit resulting from any deduction or credit described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section with the anticipated income tax attributable to items other than wages includible in the employee's gross income in the manner determined by the Commissioner.
(3)
Multiple withholding allowance certificates
—(i)
In general.
The employee may not take into account deductions, credits, or estimated tax payments described in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section if these deductions, credits, or estimated tax payments are claimed on another valid withholding allowance certificate in effect with respect to another employer of the employee or any employer of the employee's spouse.
(ii)
Married taxpayers filing jointly.
Married taxpayers who reasonably expect to file as married filing jointly on their Federal income tax return for the estimation year determine the withholding allowance to which they are entitled under section 3402(m) on the
basis of their combined wages, allowable credits or deductions, and estimated tax payments permitted to be taken into account. The deductions, credits, or estimated tax payments described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section to which either spouse is entitled may be claimed by either spouse or may be allocated between both spouses. However, one spouse may not claim deductions, credits, or estimated tax payments described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section claimed on the other spouse's withholding allowance certificate.
(iii)
Married taxpayers filing separately.
A married taxpayer who reasonably expects to file a separate income tax return from the employee's spouse for the estimation year determines the withholding allowance deductions, credits, or estimated tax payments described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section on the basis of the employee's individual wages, deductions, credits, and estimated tax payments.
(4)
IRS instructions.
An employee must follow the instructions to the Form W-4, and other IRS forms, instructions, publications, and related guidance in determining the employee's withholding allowance or other reductions in withholding permitted under section 3402(m) for deductions, credits, or estimated tax payments described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
(f)
Applicability date.
The provisions of this section apply on or after October 6, 2020. Taxpayers may choose to apply paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) this section on or after January 1, 2020 and before October 6, 2020. For rules that apply before October 6, 2020, see 26 CFR part 31, revised as of April 1, 2020.
[T.D. 9924, 85 FR 63034, Oct. 6, 2020]
§ 31.3402(n)-1
Employees incurring no income tax liability.
(a)
In general.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart (except to the extent a payment of wages is subject to withholding under § 31.3402(g)-1(a)(2)), an employer shall not deduct and withhold any tax under chapter 24 of the Code upon a payment of wages made to an employee, if there is in effect with respect to the payment a withholding allowance certificate furnished to the employer by the employee which certifies that—
(1) The employee incurred no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code for the employee's preceding taxable year; and
(2) The employee anticipates that the employee will incur no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A for the employee's current taxable year.
(b)
Mandatory flat rate withholding.
To the extent wages are subject to income tax withholding under § 31.3402(g)-1(a)(2), such wages are subject to such income tax withholding regardless of whether a withholding allowance certificate under section 3402(n) and this section has been furnished to the employer.
(c)
Liability for income tax.
For purposes of section 3402(n) and this section, an employee is not considered to incur liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A if the amount of such tax imposed is equal to or less than the total amount of credits against such tax which are allowable under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, other than those credits allowable under section 31 or 34. For purposes of this section, an employee who files a joint return under section 6013 is considered to incur liability for any tax shown on such return. An employee who is entitled to file a joint return under section 6013 shall not certify that the employee anticipates that he or she will incur no liability for income tax imposed by subtitle A for the employee's current taxable year if such statement would not be true in the event that the employee files a joint return for such year, unless the employee filed a separate return for the preceding taxable year and anticipates that the employee will file a separate return for the current taxable year.
(d)
Rules about withholding allowance certificates.
For rules relating to invalid withholding allowance certificates, see § 31.3402(f)(2)-1(h), and for rules relating to disregarding certain withholding allowance certificates on which an employee claims a complete exemption from withholding, see § 31.3402(f)(2)-1(i).
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this section:
(1)
Example 1.
A, an unmarried, calendar-year basis taxpayer, files an income tax return for 2020 on April 10, 2021, showing that A had adjusted gross income of $5,000 and is not liable for any income tax for 2020. A had $180 of income tax withheld during 2020. A anticipates that A's gross income for 2021 will be approximately the same amount, and that A will not incur income tax liability for that year. On April 20, 2021, A commences employment and furnishes the employer a withholding allowance certificate certifying that A incurred no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A for 2020, and that A anticipates that A will incur no liability for income tax imposed under subtitle A for 2021. A's employer shall not deduct and withhold on payments of wages made to A on or after April 20, 2021. Under § 31.3402(f)(4)-1(b), unless A furnishes a new withholding allowance certificate including the certifications described in paragraph (a) of this section to the employer, the employer is required to deduct and withhold upon payments of wages to A made after February 15, 2022.
(2)
Example 2.
Assume the facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (Example 1) except that A had been employed by the employer prior to April 20, 2021, and had furnished the employer a withholding allowance certificate prior to furnishing the withholding allowance certificate including the certifications described in paragraph (a) of this section on April 20, 2021. Under § 31.3402(f)(3)-1(b), the employer would be required to give effect to the new withholding allowance certificate no later than the beginning of the first payroll period ending (or the first payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period) on or after May 20, 2021. However, under § 31.3402(f)(3)-1(b), the employer could, if it chose, make the new withholding allowance certificate effective with respect to any payment of wages made on or after April 20, 2021, and before the effective date mandated by section 3402(f)(3)(B)(i) and § 31.3402(f)(3)-1(b). Under § 31.3402(f)(4)-1(b), unless A furnishes a new withholding allowance certificate including the certifications described in § 31.3402(n)-1(a) to A's employer, the employer is required to deduct and withhold upon payments of wages to A made after February 15, 2022.
(3)
Example 3.
Assume the facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1) of this section (Example 1) except that for 2020 A has taxable income of $8,000, income tax liability of $839, and income tax withheld of $1,195. Although A received a refund of $356 due to income tax withholding of $1,195, A may not certify on A's withholding allowance certificate that A incurred no liability for income tax imposed by subtitle A for 2020.

§ 31.3402(o)-1
Extension of withholding to supplemental unemployment compensation benefits.
(a)
In general.
Withholding of income tax is required under section 3402(o) with respect to payments of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits made after December 31, 1970, which are treated under paragraph (b)(14) of § 31.3401(a)-1 as if they were wages.
(b)
Withholding exemption certificates.
For purposes of section 3402(f) (2) and (3) and the regulations thereunder (relating to withholding exemption certificates), in the case of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits an employment relationship shall be considered to commence with either the date on which such benefits begin to accrue or January 1, 1971, whichever is later, and the withholding exemption certificate furnished the employer with respect to such commencement of employment shall be considered the first certificate furnished the employer. The withholding exemption certificate furnished by the employee to his former employer (with whom his employment has been involuntarily terminated, within the meaning of paragraph (b)(14)(ii) of § 31.3401(a)-1) shall be treated as meeting the requirements of section 3402(f)(2)(A) and the regulations
thereunder if such former employer furnishes such certificate to the employee's current employer, as defined in paragraph (g) of § 31.340(d)-1, or if such former employer is the agent of such current employer with respect to the employee's withholding exemption certificate. However, the preceding sentence shall not be applicable if such employee furnishes a new withholding exemption certificate to such current employer (or his agent), provided that such withholding exemption certificate meets the requirements of section 3402(f)(2)(A) and the regulations thereunder. See the definitions of payroll period in paragraph (c) of § 31.3401(b)-1 and of employee in paragraph (g) of § 31.3401(c)-1.
[T.D. 7068, 35 FR 17329, Nov. 11, 1970, as amended by T.D. 7803, 47 FR 3546, Jan. 26, 1982]
§ 31.3402(o)-2
Extension of withholding to annuity payments if requested by payee.
(a)
In general.
Under section 3402(o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and this section, the payee (as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section) of an annuity (as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section) may request the payor (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) of the annuity to withhold income tax with respect to payments of the annuity made after December 31, 1970. If such a request is made, the payor shall deduct and withhold as requested.
(b)
Manner of making request.
A payee who wishes a payor to deduct and withhold income tax from annuity payments shall file a request with the payor to deduct and withhold a specific whole dollar amount from each annuity payment. Such specific dollar amount requested shall be at least $5 per month and shall not reduce the net amount of any annuity payment received by the payee below $10. The request shall be made on Form W-4P (annuitant's withholding exemption certificate and request) in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto, and shall set forth fully and clearly the data therein called for. In lieu of Form W-4P, payors may prepare and use a form the provisions of which are identical with those of Form W-4P.
For the requirements relating to Form W-4P with respect to qualified State individual income taxes, see paragraph (d)(3)(i) of § 301.6361-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
(c)
When request takes effect.
Upon receipt of a request under this section the payor of the annuity with respect to which such request was made shall deduct and withhold the amount specified in such request from each annuity payment commencing with the first annuity payment made on or after the date which occurs—
(1) In a case in which no previous request is in effect, 3 calendar months after the date on which such request is furnished to such payor, and
(2) In a case in which a previous request is in effect, the first status determination date (see section 3402(f)(3)(B) and paragraph (d) of § 31.3402(f)(3)-1 of this chapter) which occurs at least 30 days after the date on which such request is so furnished.
However, the payor may, at his election, commence to deduct and withhold such specified amount with respect to an annuity payment which is made prior to the annuity payment described in the preceding sentence with respect to which the payor must commence to deduct and withhold.
(d)
Duration and termination of request.
A request under this section shall continue in effect until terminated. The payee may terminate the request by furnishing the payor a signed written notice of termination. Such notice of termination shall, except as hereinafter provided, take effect with respect to the first payment of an amount in respect of which the request is in effect which is made on or after the first status determination date (see section 3402(f)(3)(B) and paragraph (d) of § 31.3402(f)(3)-1 of this chapter) which occurs at least 30 days after the date on which such notice is so furnished. However, at the election of such payor, such notice may be made effective with respect to any payment of an amount in respect of which the request is in effect which is made on or after the date on which such notice is so furnished and before such status determination date.
(e)
Special rules.
For purposes of chapter 24 of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to collection of income tax at source on wages) and of subtitle F of such Code (relating to procedure and administration), and the regulations thereunder—
(1) An amount which is requested to be withheld pursuant to this section shall be deemed a tax required to be deducted and withheld under section 3402.
(2) An amount deducted and withheld pursuant to this section shall be deemed an amount deducted and withheld under section 3402.
(3) The term “wages” includes the gross amount of an annuity payment with respect to which there is in effect a request for withholding under this section. However, references to the definition of wages in section 3401(a) which are made in section 6014 (relating to election by the taxpayor not to compute the tax on his annual return) and section 6015(a) (relating to declaration of estimated tax by individuals) shall not be deemed to include any portion of such an annuity payment.
(4) The term “employer” includes a payor with respect to whom a request for withholding is in effect under this section.
(5) The term “employee” includes a payee with respect to whom a request for withholding is in effect under this section.
(6) The term “payroll period” includes the period of accrual with respect to which payments of an annuity which is subject to withholding under this section are ordinarily made.
(f)
Returns of income tax withheld and statements for payees.
(1) Form W-2P is to be used in lieu of Form W-2, which is required to be furnished by an employer to an employee under § 31.6051-1 of this chapter and to the Social Security Administration under paragraph (a) of § 31.6051-2 of this chapter, with respect to an annuity subject to withholding under this section. If an amount is required to be deducted and withheld under this section from any or all of the payments made to a payee under an annuity contract during a calendar year, all payments with respect to that annuity contract are required to be reported on Form W-2P, in lieu of Form 1099, as prescribed in §§ 1.6041-1, 1.6041-2, and 1.6047-1 of this chapter; any other annuity payments made by the same payor to the same payee may, at the option of the payor, be reported on Form W-2P.
(2) Each statement on Form W-2P shall show the following:
(i) The gross amount of annuity payments made during the calendar year, whether or not income tax withholding under this section was in effect with respect to all such payments,
(ii) The total amount deducted and withheld as tax under section 3402 of this section, and
(iii) The information required to be shown by Form W-2P and the instructions applicable thereto.
For the requirements relating to Form W-2P with respect to qualified State individual income taxes, see paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of § 301.6361-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
(3) The provisions of § 1.9101-1 of this chapter (relating to permission to submit information required by certain returns and statements on magnetic tape) shall be applicable to the information required to be furnished on Form W-2P.
(4) The provisions of § 31.6109-1 of this chapter (relating to supplying of identifying numbers) shall be applicable to Form W-2P and to any payee of an annuity to whom a statement on Form W-2P is required to be furnished.
(g)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
(1) The term “annuity” means periodic payments which are payable over a period greater than 1 year and which are treated under section 72 as amounts received as an annuity, whether or not such periodic payments are variable in amount. Also, periodic payments to an individual who is retired before the normal retirement age for reasons of disability, to which the provisions of section 105(d) apply, shall be deemed to be an annuity for purposes of this section. A lump-sum payment (including a total distribution under section 72(n)) is not an annuity.
(2) The term “payee” means an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States and who receives an annuity payment.
(3) The term “payor” means a person making an annuity payment except that, if the person making the payment is acting soley as an agent for another person, the term “payor” shall mean such other person and not the person actually making the payment. For example, if a bank makes an annuity payment only as agent for an employees' trust, the trust shall be deemed to be the “payor.” Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, any person who, under section 3401(a) (5) or (8), would not be required to deduct and withhold the tax under section 3402 if the annuity payment were remuneration for services shall not be considered a “payor.”
(Sec. 7805, 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 7805; 86 Stat. 944, 26 U.S.C. 6364; 68A Stat. 747, 26 U.S.C. 6051)

§ 31.3402(o)-3
Extension of withholding to sick pay.
(a)
In general.
Under section 3402(o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and this section, the payee (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section) of sick pay (as defined in paragraph (h)(1) of this section) may request the payor (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section) of the sick pay to withhold income tax with respect to payments of sick pay made on or after May 1, 1981. If such a request is made, the payor must deduct and withhold as requested.
(b)
Manner of making request.
A payee who wishes a payor to deduct and withhold income tax from sick pay shall file a written request with the payor to deduct and withhold a specific whole dollar amount (subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section) from each sick pay payment. The request shall be made on Form W-4S in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto, and shall set forth fully and clearly the data therein called for. In lieu of Form W-4S, payors may prepare and use a form the provisions of which are identical to those of Form W-4S. The payee must include his social security account number in the request.
(c)
Amount requested to be withheld.
The payee shall request that the payor withhold a specific whole dollar amount. The specific whole dollar amount shall be at least $20 per weekly payment of sick pay. If the payee is paid sick pay computed on a daily basis, the specific whole dollar amount shall be at least $4 per daily payment of sick pay. If the payee is paid sick pay on a biweekly basis, the specific whole dollar amount shall be at least $40 per 2 week payment of sick pay. If the payee is paid sick pay on a semimonthly basis, the specific whole dollar amount shall be at least $44 per semimonthly payment of sick pay. If the payee is paid sick pay on a monthly basis, the specific whole dollar amount shall be at least $88 per monthly payment of sick pay. If the payee is paid sick pay on a basis other than weekly, daily, biweekly, semi-monthly, or monthly, the specific whole dollar amount shall be the equivalent of at least $4 per day, assuming a 5 day work week of 8 hours per day (40 hours total) in each 7 day calendar week. In the case of a payment which is greater or less than a full payment, the amount withheld is to bear the same relation to the specific whole dollar amount requested to be withheld as such payment bears to a full payment. For example, assume an individual receives sick pay of $100 per week and requests that $25 per week be withheld for taxes. After 4 full weeks of absence, the individual returns to work on a Wednesday (having been absent on sick leave Monday and Tuesday). For the week the individual returns to work, the individual would be entitled to $40 of sick pay, $10 of which would be withheld for taxes. The payor may, at his option, permit the payee to request that the payor withhold a specific percentage from each payment. The specific percentage shall be at least 10 percent. If the payor so opts, the payor must also accept requests under the whole dollar method. If the amount requested to be withheld under either the whole dollar method or the optional percentage method reduces the net amount of a sick pay payment received by the payee to below $10, no income tax shall be withheld from that payment by the payor.
(d)
When request takes effect.
The payor must deduct and withhold the amount specified in the request with respect to payments made more than 7 days after the date on which the request is received by the payor. At the election of the payor, the request may take effect before this deadline.
(e)
Duration and termination of request.
A request under this section shall continue in effect until changed or terminated. The payee may change the request by filing a new written request that meets all of the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The new request shall take effect as specified in paragraph (d) of this section and the old request shall be deemed terminated when the new request takes effect. The payee may terminate the request by furnishing the payor a signed written notice of termination containing both a request to terminate withholding and all the information contained in the request to withhold. This written notice of termination shall take effect with respect to payments made more than 7 days after the date on which the notice of termination is received by the payor. At the election of the payor, the request may take effect before this deadline.
(f)
Special rules.
For purposes of chapter 24 on subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to collection of income tax at source on wages) and of subtitle F of the Code (relating to procedure and administration), and the regulations thereunder—
(1) An amount which is requested to be withheld pursuant to this section shall be deemed a tax required to be deducted and withheld under section 3402.
(2) An amount deducted and withheld pursuant to this section shall be deemed an amount deducted and withheld under section 3402.
(3) The term “wages” includes the gross amount of a sick pay payment with respect to which there is in effect a request for withholding under this section. However, references to the definition of wages in section 3401(a) which are made in section 6014 (relating to election by the taxpayer not to compute the tax on his annual return) and section 6015(a) (relating to declaration of estimated tax by individuals) shall not be deemed to include any portion of such a sick pay payment.
(4) The term “employer” includes a payor with respect to whom a request for withholding is in effect under this section.
(5) The term “employee” includes a payee with respect to whom a request for withholding is in effect under this section.
(6) The term “payroll period” includes the period of accrual with respect to which payments of sick pay which are subject to withholding under this section are ordinarily made.
(g)
Statements required to be furnished to payees.
See section 6051(f) and the regulations thereunder for requirements relating to statements required to be furnished to payees.
(h)
Definitions.
(1) (i) The term “sick pay” means any payment made to an individual which does not constitute wages (determined without regard to section 3402(o) and this section), which is paid to an employee pursuant to a plan to which the employer is a party, and which constitutes remuneration or a payment in lieu of remuneration for any period during which the employee is temporarily absent from work on account of personal injuries or sickness. The term “personal injuries or sickness” shall have the same meaning as ascribed thereto by section 105(a) and the regulations thereunder. The term “sick pay” does not include any amounts either excludable from gross income under section 104(a) (1), (2), (4) or (5) or section 105(b) or (c) or paid under section 3402(o)(1)(B). The term “sick pay” does not include amounts paid under a plan if all amounts paid under the plan are paid to individuals who are described in the first sentence of section 105(d)(4) (relating to the definition of permanent and total disability) and the regulations thereunder. Amounts paid under any other plan shall be deemed to be paid for a period during which the employee is temporarily absent from work. For sick pay paid in 1981 only, however, the payor may opt not to follow the rules of the two preceding sentences but to follow instead the rule that an employee is temporarily absent if his absence is not described in section 105(d)(4) (relating to the definition of
permanent and total disability) and the regulations thereunder. An employer is not a party to the plan if the plan is a contract between only employees and a third party payor or the employer makes no contributions to provide sick pay benefits under the plan, even if the employer withholds amounts from the employees' salaries and pays the amounts over to the third party payor.
(ii) This paragraph (h)(1) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Employee A works for P Company and Employee B works for Q Company. P Company has contracted with R Insurance Company for R to pay P's employees the equivalent of their normal wages when they are temporarily absent from work because of sickness or personal injury. Q Company has neither entered into such a contract, nor will it make such payments directly from it own funds. B consequently goes to S Insurance Company and purchases directly an insurance policy which will pay him the equivalent of his normal wages when he is unable to work because of sickness or personal injury. Both A and B are subsequently temporarily absent from work on account of sickness or personal injuries. A receives payments from R and B receives payments from S. Neither the payments made by R to A nor the payments made by S to B constitute wages (determined without regard to section 3402(o) and this section). A may request that R withhold income taxes under section 3402(o) and this section from the payments he receives because the payments are sick pay as defined in section 3402(o) and this section. B may not request that S withhold income taxes under section 3402(o) and this section from the payments he receives because the payments are not paid pursuant to a plan to which Q Company is a party and thus are not sick pay as defined in section 3402(o) and this section.

# Example 2.
Employees C and D both work for T Company , which has contracted with U Insurance Company for U to pay T's employees for all sickness or injury claims Employee C is sick and out from work for a month. U pays C the equivalent of C's regular pay. Employee D loses his arm in an accident and U pays D $10,000. C may request that U withhold income taxes under section 3402(o) and this section from the payments he receives because the payments constitute remuneration or a payment in lieu of remuneration for any period during which the employee is temporarily absent from work on account of sickness or personal injuries. D may not request that U withhold income taxes from the payments he receives because the payments do not constitute remuneration or a payment in lieu of remuneration for any period during which the employee is temporarily absent from work on account of sickness or personal injuries.
(2) The term “payee” means an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States and who receives a sick pay payment.
(3) (i) The term “payor” means any person making a sick pay payment who is not the employer (as defined in section 3401 and in § 31.3401(d)-1 (except paragraph (f) thereof)) of the payee. If however the person making the payment is acting solely as an agent for another person, the term “payor” shall mean the other person and not the person actually making the payment.
(ii) This paragraph (h)(3) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X Company contracts with Y Insurance Company for Y to pay X's employees the equivalent of their normal wages when they are temporarily absent from work because of sickness or personal injury. Y computes the amount to be paid and determines the date payment is to be made for each of X's employees. Y then instructs Z Bank to issue a check for that amount on that date. Y reimburses Z for the amount of the check plus Z's administrative costs. Under these circumstances, Z is the agent of Y and Y is the payor under section 3402(o) and this section.

# Example 2.
V Company contracts with W Company for W to pay V's employees the equivalent of their normal wages when they are temporarily absent from work on account of sickness or personal injury. Under the contractual arrangement, V advises W of the wages normally paid to each of V's employees. V tells W when an employee of V is temporarily absent from work on account of sickness or personal injury, and W computes the amount to be paid the employee and makes payments of sick pay to the employee during the period of the employee's absence. V subsequently reimburses W for the amount of those payments and pays W a fee for W's services. Under these circumstances, W is acting solely as the agent of V, and a payee may not request under section 3402(o) and these regulations that W withhold income taxes from his payments. However, see section 3401 and the regulations thereunder for the obligation of V to withhold income taxes from the payments that W makes as the agent of V, which are not excluded from income under section 105 and the regulations thereunder and which are wages under section 3401 and the regulations thereunder. See also § 31.3402(g)-1 (relating to supplemental wage payments) for the conditions under which a flat percentage rate of withholding may be used.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that the consideration for W's services is a set insurance premium rather than reimbursement for costs plus a fee. Under these circumstances W is the payor and is not acting solely as the agent of V. An employee of V to whom W makes payments under the agreement may request under section 3402(o) and the regulations thereunder that W withhold income taxes from those payments.
(i)
Special rules for sick pay paid pursuant to certain collective-bargaining agreements.
(1) Special rules (enumerated in subparagraph (2)) apply to sick pay where all of the following tests are met.
(i) The sick pay must be paid pursuant to a collective-bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers.
(ii) The agreement must contain a provision that section 3402(o)(5) is to apply to sick pay paid pursuant to the agreement.
(iii) The agreement must contain a provision for determining the amount to be deducted and withheld from each payment of sick pay.
(iv) The social security number of the payee must be furnished to the payor. The agreement may provide that the employer will furnish this or the payee may furnish his social security number directly to the payor.
(v) The payor must be furnished with information that is necessary for the payor to determine whether the payment is pursuant to the agreement and to determine the amount to be deducted and withheld. The agreement may provide that the employer will furnish this information directly to the payor.
(2) The following special rules apply to sick pay where all of the tests of subparagraph (1) are met.
(i) The requirement of section 3402(o)(1)(c) and this section that a request for withholding be in effect does not apply.
(ii) The amount to be deducted and withheld from the sick pay shall be determined according to the provisions of the agreement and not according to this section. This rule shall not however apply—
(A) To payments enumerated in section 3402(n) (relating to employees incurring no income tax liability) and the regulations thereunder, or
(B) To payments made to a payee more than 7 days after the date that the payor receives a statement from the payee that the payee expects to claim an exclusion from gross income under section 105(d). Such statement must include adequate verification of disability. A certificate from a qualified physician attesting that the employee is permanently and totally disabled (within the meaning of section 105(d)) shall be deemed to constitute adequate verification. If the payor receives such a statement, the payor shall not withhold any income tax from the payments made to the payee, regardless of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. This exception from withholding does not affect the requirements of § 31.6051-3.

Voluntary withholding agreements.
(a)
Employer-employee agreement.
An employee and his employer may enter into an agreement under section 3402(p)(3)(A) to provide for the withholding of income tax upon payments of amounts described in paragraph (b)(1) of § 31.3401(a)-3, made after December 31, 1970. An agreement may be entered into under this section only with respect to amounts which are includible in the gross income of the employee under section 61, and must be applicable to all such amounts paid by the employer to the employee. The amount to be withheld pursuant to an agreement under section 3402(p)(3)(A) shall be determined under the rules contained in section 3402 and the regulations thereunder. See § 31.3405(c)-1, Q
A-3 concerning agreements to have more than 20-percent Federal income tax withheld from eligible rollover distributions within the meaning of section 402.
(b)
Form and duration of employer-employee agreement.
(1)(i) Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, an employee who desires to
enter into an agreement under section 3402(p)(3)(A) shall furnish his employer with Form W-4 (withholding exemption certificate) executed in accordance with the provisions of section 3402(f) and the regulations thereunder. The furnishing of such Form W-4 shall constitute a request for withholding.
(ii) In the case of an employee who desires to enter into an agreement under section 3402(p)(3)(A) with his employer, if the employee performs services (in addition to those to be the subject of the agreement) the remuneration for which is subject to mandatory income tax withholding by such employer, or if the employee wishes to specify that the agreement terminate on a specific date, the employee shall furnish the employer with a request for withholding which shall be signed by the employee, and shall contain—
(
a
) The name, address, and social security number of the employee making the request,
(
b
) The name and address of the employer,
(
c
) A statement that the employee desires withholding of Federal income tax, and applicable, of qualified State individual income tax (see paragraph (d)(3)(i) of § 301.6361-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedures and Administration)), and
(
d
) If the employee desires that the agreement terminate on a specific date, the date of termination of the agreement.
If accepted by the employer as provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, the request shall be attached to, and constitute part of, the employee's Form W-4. An employee who furnishes his employer a request for withholding under this subdivision shall also furnish such employer with Form W-4 if such employee does not already have a Form W-4 in effect with such employer.
(iii) No request for withholding under section 3402(p)(3)(A) shall be effective as an agreement between an employer and an employee until the employer accepts the request by commencing to withhold from the amounts with respect to which the request was made.
(2) An agreement under section 3402(p)(3)(A) shall be effective for such period as the employer and employee mutually agree upon. However, either the employer or the employee may terminate the agreement prior to the end of such period by furnishing a signed written notice to the other. Unless the employer and employee agree to an earlier termination date, the notice shall be effective with respect to the first payment of an amount in respect of which the agreement is in effect which is made on or after the first “status determination date” (January 1, May 1, July 1, and October 1 of each year) that occurs at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is furnished. If the employee executes a new Form W-4, the request upon which an agreement under section 3402(p)(3)(A) is based shall be attached to, and constitute a part of, such new Form W-4.
(c)
Other payments.
The Secretary may issue guidance by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB) (which will be available at
www.IRS.gov
) describing other payments for which withholding under a voluntary withholding agreement would be appropriate and authorizing payors to agree to withhold income tax on such payments if requested by the payee. Requirements regarding the form and duration of voluntary withholding agreements authorized by this paragraph (c) will be provided in the IRB guidance issued regarding specific types of payments.

§ 31.3402(q)-1
Extension of withholding to certain gambling winnings.
(a)
Withholding obligation
—(1)
General rule.
Every person, including the Government of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof, or any instrumentality of any of the foregoing making any payment of “winnings subject to withholding” (defined in paragraph (b) of the section) must deduct and withhold a tax in an amount equal to the product of the
third lowest rate of tax applicable under section 1(c) and the payment. The tax must be deducted and withheld upon payment of the winnings by the person making the payment (“payer”). See paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section for a special rule relating to the time for making deposits of withheld amounts and filing the return with respect to those amounts. Any person receiving a payment of winnings subject to withholding must furnish the payer a statement as required in paragraph (d) of this section. Payers of winnings subject to withholding must file a return with the Internal Revenue Service and furnish a statement to the payee as required in paragraph (e) of this section. With respect to reporting requirements for certain payments of gambling winnings not subject to withholding, see section 6041 and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Exceptions.
The tax imposed under section 3402(q)(1) and this section shall not apply (i) with respect to a payment of winnings which is made to a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation under the circumstances described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section or (ii) with respect to a payment of winnings from a slot machine play, or a keno or bingo game.
(b)
Winnings subject to withholding
—(1)
In general.
Winnings subject to withholding means any payment from—
(i) A wager placed in a State-conducted lottery (defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) but only if the proceeds from the wager exceed $5,000;
(ii) A wager placed in a sweepstakes, wagering pool, or lottery other than a State-conducted lottery but only if the proceeds from the wager exceed $5,000; or
(iii) Any other wagering transaction (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) but only if the proceeds from the wager:
(A) Exceed $5,000; and
(B) Are at least 300 times as large as the amount of the wager.
(2)
Total proceeds subject to withholding.
If proceeds from the wager qualify as winnings subject to withholding, then the total proceeds from the wager, and not merely amounts in excess of $5,000, are subject to withholding.
(c)
Definitions; special rules
—(1)
Rules for determining amount of proceeds from a wager
—(i)
In general.
The amount of proceeds from a wager is the amount paid with respect to the wager, less the amount of the wager.
(ii)
Amount of the wager in the case of horse races, dog races, and jai alai.
In the case of a wagering transaction with respect to horse races, dog races, or jai alai, all wagers placed in a single parimutuel pool and represented on a single ticket are aggregated and treated as a single wager for purposes of determining the amount of the wager. A ticket in the case of horse races, dog races, or jai alai is a written or electronic record that the payee must present to collect proceeds from a wager or wagers.
(iii)
Amount paid with respect to a wager
—(A)
Identical wagers.
Amounts paid with respect to identical wagers are treated as paid with respect to a single wager for purposes of calculating the amount of proceeds from a wager. Two or more wagers are identical wagers if winning depends on the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of the same event or events; the wagers are placed with the same payer; and, in the case of horse races, dog races, or jai alai, the wagers are placed in the same parimutuel pool. Wagers may be identical wagers even if the amounts wagered differ as long as the wagers are otherwise treated as identical wagers under this paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A). Tickets purchased in a lottery generally are not identical wagers, because the designation of each ticket as a winner generally would not be based on the occurrence of the same event, for example, the drawing of a particular number.
(B)
Non-monetary proceeds.
In determining the amount paid with respect to a wager, proceeds which are not money are taken into account at the fair market value.
(C)
Periodic payments.
Periodic payments, including installment payments or payments which are to be made periodically for the life of a person, are aggregated for purposes of determining the amount paid with respect to the wager. The aggregate amount of periodic payments to be made for a person's life is based on that person's life
expectancy. See §§ 1.72-5 and 1.72-9 of this chapter for rules used in computing the expected return on annuities. For purposes of determining the amount subject to withholding, the first periodic payment must be reduced by the amount of the wager.
(2)
Wager placed in a State-conducted lottery.
The term “wager placed in a State-conducted lottery” means a wager placed in a lottery conducted by an agency of a State acting under authority of State law provided that the wager is placed with the State agency conducting such lottery or with its authorized employees or agents. This term includes wagers placed in State-conducted lotteries in which the amount of winnings is determined by a parimutuel system.
(3)
Other wagering transaction.
The term “other wagering transaction” means any wagering transaction other than one in a lottery, sweepstakes, or wagering pool. This term includes a wagering transaction in a parimutuel pool with respect to horse races, dog races, or jai alai.
(4)
Certain payments to nonresident aliens or foreign corporations.
A payment of winnings that is subject to withholding tax under section 1441(a) (relating to withholding on nonresident aliens) or 1442(a) (relating to withholding on foreign corporations) is not subject to the tax imposed by section 3402(q) and this section when the payee is a foreign person, as determined under the rules of section 1441(a) and the regulations thereunder. A payment is treated as being subject to withholding tax under section 1441(a) or 1442(a) notwithstanding that the rate of such tax is reduced (even to zero) as may be provided by an applicable treaty with another country. However, a reduced or zero rate of withholding of tax must not be applied by the payer in lieu of the rate imposed by sections 1441 and 1442 unless the person receiving the winnings has provided to the payer the documentation required by § 1.1441-6 of this chapter to establish entitlement to treaty benefits.
(5)
Gambling winnings treated as payments by employer to employee.
(i) Except as provided in subdivision (ii), for purposes of sections 3403 and 3404 and the regulations thereunder and for purposes of so much of subtitle F (except section 7205) and the regulations thereunder as relate to chapter 24, payments to any person of winnings subject to withholding under this section shall be treated as if they are wages paid by an employer to an employee.
(ii) Solely for purposes of applying the deposit rules under 6302(c) and the return requirement of section 6011, the withholding from winnings shall be deemed to have been made no earlier than at the time the winner's identity is known to the payer. Thus, for example, winnings from a State-conducted lottery are subject to withholding when actually or constructively paid, whichever is earlier; however, the time for depositing the withheld taxes and filing a return with respect thereto shall be determined by reference to the date on which the winner's identity is known to the State, if such date is later than the date on which the winnings are actively or constructively paid. If a payer's obligation to pay winnings terminates other than by payment, all liabilities and requirements resulting from the requirement that the payer deduct and withhold with respect to such winnings shall also terminate.
(d)
Statement furnished by payee
—(1)
In general.
Each person who is making a payment subject to withholding under this section must obtain from the payee a statement described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Contents of statement.
Each person who is to receive a payment of winnings subject to withholding under this section must furnish the payer a statement on Form W-2G or 5754 (whichever is applicable) made under the penalties of perjury containing—
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the winner accompanied by a declaration that no other person is entitled to any portion of such payment, or
(ii) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the payee and of every person entitled to any portion of the payment.
(3)
Multiple payments.
If more than one payment of winnings subject to withholding is to be made with respect to a single wager, for example in the
case of an annuity, the payee is required to furnish the payer a statement with respect to the first payment only, provided that the other payments are taken into account in a return required by paragraph (e) of this section.
(4)
Reliance on statement for identical wagers.
If the payee furnishes the statement which may be required pursuant to § 1.6011-3 of this chapter (regarding the requirement of a statement from payees of certain gambling winnings), indicating that the payee (and any other persons entitled to a portion of the winnings) is entitled to winnings from identical wagers, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, and indicating the amount of the winnings, if any, then the payer may rely upon the statement in determining the total amount of proceeds from the wager under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(e)
Return of payer
—(1)
In general.
Every person making payment of winnings for which a statement is required under paragraph (d) of this section must file a return on Form W-2G at the Internal Revenue Service location designated in the instructions to the form on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the payment of winnings is made. The return required by this paragraph (e) need not include the statement by the payee required by paragraph (d) of this section and, therefore, need not be signed by the payee, provided the statement is retained by the payer as long as its contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. In addition, the return required by this paragraph (e) need not contain the information required by paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section provided the information is obtained with respect to the payee and retained by the payer as long as its contents may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. For payments to more than one winner, a separate Form W-2G, which in no event need be signed by the winner, must be filed with respect to each such winner. Each Form W-2G must contain the following:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the payer;
(ii) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the winner;
(iii) The date, amount of the payment, and amount withheld;
(iv) The type of wagering transaction;
(v) Except with respect to winnings from a wager placed in a State-conducted lottery, a general description of the two types of identification (as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section), one of which must have the payee's photograph on it (except in the case of tribal member identification cards in certain circumstances as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section), that the payer relied on to verify the payee's name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(vi) The amount of winnings from identical wagers; and
(vii) Any other information required by the form, instructions, or other applicable guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(2)
Identification.
The following items are treated as identification for purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section—
(i) Government-issued identification (for example, a driver's license, passport, social security card, military identification card, tribal member identification card issued by a federally-recognized Indian tribe, or voter registration card) in the name of the payee; and
(ii) A Form W-9, “Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,” signed by the payee that includes the payee's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and other information required by the form. A Form W-9 is not acceptable for this purpose if the payee has modified the form (other than pursuant to instructions to the form) or if the payee has deleted the jurat or other similar provisions by which the payee certifies or affirms the correctness of the statements contained on the form.
(3)
Special rule for tribal member identification cards.
A tribal member identification card need not contain the payee's photograph to meet the identification requirement described in paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section if—
(i) The payee is a member of a federally-recognized Indian tribe;
(ii) The payee presents the payer with a tribal member identification card issued by a federally-recognized Indian tribe stating that the payee is a member of such tribe; and
(iii) The payer is a gaming establishment (as described in § 1.6041-10(b)(2)(iv) of this chapter) owned or licensed (in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 2710) by the tribal government that issued the tribal member identification card referred to in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Transmittal form.
Persons making payments of winnings subject to withholding must use Form 1096 to transmit Forms W-2G to the Internal Revenue Service.
(5)
Furnishing a statement to the payee.
Every payer required to make a return under paragraph (e)(1) of this section must also make and furnish to each payee, with respect to each payment of winnings subject to withholding, a written statement that contains the information that is required to be included on the return under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The payer must furnish the statement to the payee on or before January 31st of the year following the calendar year in which payment of the winnings subject to withholding is made. The statement will be considered furnished to the payee if it is provided to the payee at the time of payment or if it is mailed to the payee on or before January 31st of the year following the calendar year in which payment was made.
(f)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A purchases a lottery ticket for $1 in the State W lottery from an authorized agent of State W. On February 1, 1977, the drawing is held and A wins $5,001. Since the proceeds of the wager ($5,001—$1) are not greater than $5,000, State W is not required to withhold or deduct any amount from A's winnings.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that A purchases two $1 tickets and that A wins $5,002 when one of the tickets is drawn. State W must deduct and withhold tax at a rate of 20% from $5,001 ($5,002 less the $1 wager), or $1,000.20.

# Example 3.
C purchases a lottery ticket for $1. On June 1, 1979, the lottery drawing is held and C wins the grand prize of $50,000, payable $500 monthly. The payer must deduct and withhold tax at a rate of 20% from each payment of winnings. Therefore, $99.80 must be withheld from the first monthly payment to B ($500−$1) × 20% = $99.80) and $100 ($500 × 20%) must be withheld from each monthly payment thereafter.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example 3, except that C wins an automobile rather than the grand prize. The fair market value of the automobile on the date on which it is made available to C is $10,000. The payer must deduct and withhold a tax of $2,000 (($10,001−$1) × 20%). This may be accomplished, for example, if C pays $2,000 to the payer. Alternatively, if the payer, as part of the prize, pays all taxes required to be duducted and withheld, the payer must deduct and withhold tax not only on the fair market value of the automobile less the wager, but also on the taxes it pays that are required to be deducted and withheld. This results in a pyramiding of taxes requiring the use of an algebraic formula. Under this formula, the payer must deduct and withhold a tax of 25 percent of the fair market value of the automobile less the wager ($2,500) and, in addition, the payer must indicate on Form W-2G the amount of such winnings as $12,501 ($10,001 + 25%($10,001−$1)).

# Example 5.
D purchases a ticket for $1 in the State Y lottery from an authorized agent of State Y On January 1, 1976, a drawing is held and D wins $100 a month for the rest of D's life. It is actuarially determined that, on January 3, 1977, D's life expectancy is 5 years. Based on that determination, the proceeds from the wager paid to D on or after January 3, 1977, will exceed $5,000. Therefore, State Y must deduct and withhold $20 from each monthly payment made on or after January 3, 1977. (None of such payments is reduced by the amount of the wager because the amount of the wager was offset by the first payment of winnings which was made before January 3, 1977)).

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in example 5 except that State Y purchases in its own name, as owner, an annuity of $100 a month for D's life from E Corporation, in order to fund its own obligation to make the payments. Although State Y remains liable for the withholding of tax, E Corporation as paying agent for State Y, making payments directly to D, should deduct and withhold from each monthly payment in the manner described in example 5.

# Example 7.
E purchases a sweepstakes ticket for $1 in a sweepstakes conducted by W. E purchases the ticket on behalf of himself and on behalf of F and G, who have contributed equal amounts toward the purchase of the ticket and who have agreed to share equally in any prizes won. The ticket which E purchases wins $1,002. Since the proceeds of the wager ($1,002—$1) are greater than $1,000 W is required to withhold and deduct 20 percent of such proceeds.

# Example 8.
On February 1, 1977, a drawing is held in the State X lottery in which a winning ticket is selected. The person holding the winning ticket is entitled to proceeds of $100,000 payable either as a lump sum upon demand or $10,000 a year for 10 years. Under State law, the winning ticket must be presented to an authorized agent of State X before February 1, 1978. Until the ticket is presented, State X does not know the identity of the winner. On December 1, 1977, H, the winner, presents the winning ticket to an authorized agent of the State X lottery. The winnings are constructively paid to H on February 1, 1977. Since H, has the option of receiving the entire proceeds upon demand, State X is required to deduct and withhold $20,000 ($100,000 × 20%) from the proceeds of H's winnings on February 1, 1977; but for purposes of determining the time at which the deposit and inclusion on Form 941 of these taxes is to be made, the withholding shall be deemed to have beem made on December 1, 1977.

# Example 9.
J purchases a subscription to N magazine, at the regular subscription price. All new subscribers are automatically eligible for a special drawing. The drawing is held and J wins $50,000. Since J has not paid any more than the regular subscription price, J has not placed a wager or entered a wagering transaction. Therefore, N is not required to deduct and withhold J's winnings.

# Example 10.
(i) B places a $15 bet at the cashier window at the racetrack for horse A to win the fifth race at the racetrack that day. After placing the first bet, B gains confidence in horse A's prospects to win and places an additional $40 bet at the cashier window at the racetrack for horse A to win the fifth race, receiving a second ticket for this second bet. Horse A wins the fifth race, and B wins a total of $5,500 (100 to 1 odds) on those bets. The $15 bet and the $40 bet are identical wagers under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section because winning on both bets depended on the occurrence of the same event and the bets are placed in the same parimutuel pool with the same payer. This is true regardless of the fact that the amount of the wager differs in each case.
(ii) B cashes the tickets at different cashier windows. Pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section and § 1.6011-3, B completes a Form W-2G indicating that the amount of winnings is from identical wagers and provides the form to each cashier. The payments by each cashier of $1,500 and $4,000 are less than the $5,000 threshold for withholding, but under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, identical wagers are treated as paid with respect to a single wager for purposes of determining the proceeds from a wager. The payment is not subject to withholding or reporting because although the proceeds from the wager are $5,445 ($1,500 + $4,000 − $55), the proceeds from the wager are not at least 300 times as great as the amount wagered ($55 × 300 = $16,500).

# Example 11.
B makes two $1,000 bets in a single “show” pool for the same jai alai game, one bet on Player X to show and one bet on Player Y to show. A show bet is a winning bet if the player comes in first, second, or third in a single game. The bets are placed at the same time at the same cashier window, and B receives a single ticket showing both bets. Player X places second in the game, and Player Y does not place first, second, or third in the game. B wins $8,000 from his bet on Player X. Because winning on both bets does not depend on the occurrence of the same event, the bets are not identical bets under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. However, pursuant to the rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the amount of the wager is the aggregate amount of both wagers ($2,000) because the bets were placed in a single parimutuel pool and reflected on a single ticket. The payment is not subject to withholding or reporting because although the proceeds from the wager are $6,000 ($8,000 − $2,000), the proceeds from the wager are not at least 300 times as great as the amount wagered ($2,000 × 300 = $600,000).

# Example 12.
B bets a total of $120 on a three-dog exacta box bet ($20 for each one of the six combinations played) at the dog racetrack and receives a single ticket reflecting the bet from the cashier. B wins $5,040 from one of the selected combinations. Pursuant to the rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the amount of the wager is $120, not $20 for the single winning combination of the six combinations played. The payment is not subject to withholding under section 3402(q) because the proceeds from the wager are $4,920 ($5,040 − $120), which is below the section 3402(q) withholding threshold.

# Example 13.
B makes two $12 Pick 6 bets at the horse racetrack at two different cashier windows and receives two different tickets each representing a single $12 Pick 6 bet. In his two Pick 6 bets, B selects the same horses to win races 1-5 but selects different horses to win race 6. All Pick 6 bets on those races at that racetrack are part of a single parimutuel pool from which Pick 6 winning bets are paid. B wins $5,020 from one of his Pick 6 bets. Pursuant to the rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the bets are not aggregated for purposes of determining the amount of the wager because the bets are reflected on separate tickets. Assuming that the applicable rate is 25%, the racetrack must deduct and withhold $1,252 (($5,020 − $12) × 25%) because the amount of the proceeds of $5,008 ($5,020 − $12) is greater than $5,000 and is at least 300 times as great as the amount wagered ($12 × 300 = $3,600). The racetrack also must report B's winnings on Form W-2G pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section and furnish a copy of the Form W-2G to B.

# Example 14.
C makes two $50 bets in two different parimutuel pools for the same jai alai game. One bet is an “exacta” in which C bets on player M to win and player N to “place.” The other bet is a “trifecta” in which C bets on player M to win, player N to “place,” and player O to “show.” C wins both bets and is paid $2,000 with respect to the bet in the “exacta” pool and $3,100 with respect to the bet in the “trifecta” pool. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the bets are not identical bets. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the bets are not aggregated for purposes of determining the amount of the wager for either payment because they are not wagers in the same parimutuel pool. No section 3402(q) withholding is required on either payment because neither payment separately exceeds the $5,000 withholding threshold.

# Example 15.
C makes two $100 bets for the same dog to win a particular race. C places one bet at the racetrack and one bet at an off-track betting establishment, but the two pools constitute a single pool. C receives separate tickets for each bet. C wins both bets and is paid $4,000 from the racetrack and $4,000 from the off-track betting establishment. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the bets are not aggregated for purposes of determining the amount of the wager because the wager placed at the racetrack and the wager placed at the off-track betting establishment are reflected on separate tickets, despite being placed in the same parimutuel pool. No section 3402(q) withholding is required because neither payment separately exceeds the $5,000 withholding threshold.

# Example 16.
C places a $200 Pick 6 bet for a series of races at the racetrack on a particular day and receives a single ticket for the bet. No wager correctly picks all six races that day, so that portion of the pool carries over to the following day. On the following day, C places an additional $200 Pick 6 bet for that day's series of races and receives a new ticket for that bet. C wins $100,000 on the second day. Pursuant to the rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the bets are on two separate tickets, so C's two Pick 6 bets are not aggregated for purposes of determining the amount of the wager. Assuming that the applicable rate is 25%, the racetrack must deduct and withhold $24,950 (($100,000 − $200) × 25%) because the amount of the proceeds of $99,800 ($100,000 − $200) is greater than $5,000, and is at least 300 times as great as the amount wagered ($200 × 300 = $60,000). The racetrack also must report C's winnings on Form W-2G pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section and furnish a copy of the Form W-2G to C.
(g)
Applicability date.
The rules in this section apply to payments made with respect to a winning event that occurs after November 13, 2017. For rules that apply to payments made with respect to a winning event on or before that date, see § 31.3402(q)-1 as contained in 26 CFR part 31, revised April 1, 2017.
(Secs. 6011 and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (68A Stat. 732, 917; 26 U.S.C. 6011, 7805)

§ 31.3402(r)-1
Withholding on distributions of Indian gaming profits to tribal members.
(a) (1)
General rule.
Section 3402(r)(1) requires every person, including an Indian tribe, making a payment to a member of an Indian tribe from the net revenues of any class II or class III gaming activity, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 2703, conducted or licensed by such tribe to deduct and withhold from such payment a tax in an amount equal to such payment's proportionate share of the annualized tax, as that term is defined in section 3402(r)(3).
(2)
Withholding tables.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the amount of a payment's proportionate share of the annualized tax shall be determined under the applicable table provided by the Commissioner.
(3)
Annualized amount of payment.
Section 3402(r)(5) provides that payments shall be placed on an annualized basis under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. A payment may be placed on an annualized basis by multiplying the amount of the payment by the total number of payments to be made in a calendar year. For example, a monthly payment may be annualized by multiplying the amount of the payment by 12. Similarly, a quarterly payment may be annualized by multiplying the amount of the payment by 4.
(4)
Alternate withholding procedures
—(i)
In general.
Any procedure for determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under section 3402(r) may be used, provided that the amount of tax deducted and withheld is substantially the same as it would be using the tables provided by the Commissioner
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. At the election of an Indian tribe, the amount to be deducted and withheld under section 3402(r) shall be determined in accordance with this alternate procedure.
(ii)
Method of election.
It is sufficient for purposes of making an election under this paragraph (a)(4) that an Indian tribe evidence the election in any reasonable way, including use of a particular method. Thus, no written election is required.
(5)
Additional withholding permitted.
Consistent with the provisions of section 3402(p), a tribal member and a tribe may enter into an agreement to provide for the deduction and withholding of additional amounts from payments in order to satisfy the anticipated tax liability of the tribal member. The agreement may be made in a manner similar to that described in § 31.3402(p)-1 (with respect to voluntary withholding agreements between employees and employers).
(b) Effective date. This section applies to payments made after December 31, 1994.
[T.D. 8634, 60 FR 65238, Dec. 19, 1995]
§ 31.3403-1
Liability for tax.
Every employer required to deduct and withhold the tax under section 3402 from the wages of an employee is liable for the payment of such tax whether or not it is collected from the employee by the employer. If, for example, the employer deducts less than the correct amount of tax, or if he fails to deduct any part of the tax, he is nevertheless liable for the correct amount of the tax. See, however, § 31.3402(d)-1. The employer is relieved of liability to any other person for the amount of any such tax withheld and paid to the district director or deposited with a duly designated depositary of the United States.
§ 31.3404-1
Return and payment by governmental employer.
If the United States, or a State, Territory, Puerto Rico, or a political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, is an employer required to deduct and withhold tax under Chapter 24, the return of the amount deducted and withheld as such tax may be made by the officer or employee having control of the payment of the wages or other officer or employee appropriately designated for that purpose. (For provisions relating to the execution and filing of returns, see Subpart G of the regulations in this part.)
§ 31.3405(a)-1
Questions and answers relating to Federal income tax withholding on periodic retirement and annuity payments.
(a) The questions and answers in this section relate to Federal income tax withholding on periodic payments under section 3405(a), as amended by section 11041(c)(2)(G) of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 115-97, 131 Stat. 2054 (2017)). The withholding rules of section 3405(a) do not apply to periodic payments that are eligible rollover distributions (as defined in section 402(f)(2)(A)). See generally section 3405(c) and § 31.3405(c)-1 for Federal income tax withholding rules applicable to eligible rollover distributions. See section 3405(e)(13) for additional rules applicable to certain periodic payments under section 3405(a) and nonperiodic distributions under section 3405(b) that are to be delivered outside the United States and its possessions. For additional guidance regarding periodic payments, see §§ 35.3405-1 and 35.3405-1T of this chapter.
(b)(1) Q-1: How will Federal income tax be withheld from a periodic payment?
(2) A-1: In the case of a periodic payment that is subject to withholding under section 3405(a), amounts are withheld as if the payment were a payment of wages by an employer to the employee for the appropriate payroll period. If the payee has not furnished a withholding certificate, the amount to be withheld is determined in the manner described in the applicable forms, instructions, publications, and other guidance prescribed by the Commissioner. The rules for withholding when the payee has not furnished a withholding certificate apply regardless of whether the payor is aware of the payee's actual marital status or actual Federal income tax filing status.
(c)(1) Q-2: Do rules similar to those for wage withholding apply to the furnishing of a withholding certificate for periodic payments?
(2) A-2: Yes. Unless the rules of section 3405 specifically conflict with the rules of section 3402, the rules for withholding on periodic payments that are not eligible rollover distributions will parallel the rules for wage withholding. Thus, if a withholding certificate is furnished by a payee, it will generally take effect in accordance with section 3402(f)(3) and as provided in applicable forms, instructions, publications, and other guidance prescribed by the Commissioner. If no withholding certificate is furnished, the amount withheld must be determined in the manner described in the applicable forms, instructions, publications, and other guidance prescribed by the Commissioner for withholding on periodic payments when no withholding certificate is furnished.
(d)(1) Q-3: What is the applicability date of this section?
(2) A-3: This section applies with respect to periodic payments made after December 31, 2020.

# Questions and Answers
Q-1: What are the withholding requirements under section 3405 for distributions from qualified plans and section 403(b) annuities?
A-1: (a)
General rule.
Section 3405(c), added by UCA, provides that any designated distribution that is an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in section 402(f)(2)(A)) from a qualified plan or a section 403(b) annuity is subject to income tax withholding at the rate of 20 percent unless the distributee of the eligible rollover distribution elects to have the distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover. See § 1.402(c)-2(a)(1)(iii)of this chapter for the definition of a qualified plan and § 1.403(b)-7(b) of this chapter for the definition of a section 403(b) annuity. For purposes of section 3405 and this section, with respect to a distribution from a qualified plan, an eligible retirement plan is a trust qualified under section 401(a), an annuity plan described in section 403(a), or an individual retirement plan (as described in § 1.402(c)-2(a)(1)(iii) of this chapter). For purposes of section 3405 and this section, with respect to a distribution from a section 403(b) annuity, an eligible retirement plan is an annuity contract, a custodial account, a retirement income account described in section 403(b), or an individual retirement plan. If a designated distribution is not an eligible rollover distribution, it is subject to the elective withholding provisions of section 3405(a) and (b) and § 35.3405-1 of this chapter and is not subject to the mandatory withholding provisions of section 3405(c) and this section.
(b)
Application of other statutory provisions.
See § 1.401(a)(31)-1 of this chapter concerning the requirements and the procedures for electing a direct rollover under section 401(a)(31). See section 402(c)(2) and (4), and § 1.402(c)-2 of this chapter for rules to determine what constitutes an eligible rollover distribution. See § 1.402(f)-1, Q
A-1 through Q
A-3 and § 1.403(b)-7(b) of this chapter concerning the notice that must be provided to a distributee, within a reasonable period of time before making an eligible rollover distribution. See § 1.403(b)-7(b) of this chapter for guidance concerning the rollover provisions and direct rollover requirements for distributions from annuities described in section 403(b).
(c)
Effective date
—(1)
Statutory effective date
—(i)
General rule.
Section 3405(c), as added by UCA, applies to eligible rollover distributions made on or after January 1, 1993, even if the employee's employment with the employer maintaining the plan terminated before January 1, 1993 and even if the eligible rollover distribution is part of a series of payments that began before January 1, 1993.
(ii)
Special rule for governmental section 403(b) annuities.
Section 522 of UCA provides a special effective date for governmental section 403(b) annuities. This special effective date appears in § 1.403(b)-2T of this chapter (as it appeared in the April 1, 1995 edition of 26 CFR part 1).
(2)
Regulatory effective date.
This section applies to eligible rollover distributions made on or after October 19, 1995. For eligible rollover distributions made on or after January 1, 1993 and before October 19, 1995, § 31.3405(c)-1T (as it appeared in the April 1, 1995 edition of 26 CFR part 1), applies. However, for any distribution made on or after January 1, 1993 but before October 19, 1995, a plan administrator or payor may comply with the withholding requirements of section 3405(c) by substituting any or all provisions of this section for the corresponding provisions of § 31.3405(c)-1T, if any.
Q-2: May a distributee elect under section 3405(c) not to have Federal income tax withheld from an eligible rollover distribution?
A-2: No. The 20-percent income tax withholding imposed under section 3405(c)(1) applies to an eligible rollover distribution unless the distributee elects under section 401(a)(31) to have the eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover. See § 1.401(a)(31)-1 and § 1.403(b)-7(b) of this chapter for provisions concerning the requirement that a distributee of an eligible rollover distribution be permitted to elect a distribution in the form of a direct rollover.
Q-3: May a distributee be permitted to elect to have more than 20-percent Federal income tax withheld from an eligible rollover distribution?
A-3: Yes. Under section 3402(p), a distributee of an eligible rollover distribution and the plan administrator or payor are permitted to enter into an agreement to provide for withholding in excess of 20 percent from an eligible rollover distribution. Any agreement must be made in accordance with applicable forms and instructions. However, no request for withholding will be effective between the plan administrator or payor and the distributee until the plan administrator or payor accepts the request by commencing to withhold from the amounts with respect to which the request was made. An agreement under section 3402(p) shall be effective for such period as the plan administrator or payor and the distributee mutually agree upon. However, either party to the agreement may terminate the agreement prior to the end of such period by furnishing a signed written notice to the other.
Q-4: Who has responsibility for complying with section 3405(c) relating to the 20-percent income tax withholding on eligible rollover distributions?
A-4: Section 3405(d) generally requires the plan administrator of a qualified plan and the payor of a section 403(b) annuity to withhold under section 3405(c)(1) an amount equal to 20 percent of the portion of an eligible rollover distribution that the distributee
does not elect to have paid in a direct rollover. When an amount is paid under a qualified plan distributed annuity contract as defined in § 1.402(c)-2(h) of this chapter, the payor is treated as the plan administrator. See Q
A-13 of this section concerning eligible rollover distributions from a qualified plan distributed annuity contract.
Q-5: May the plan administrator shift the withholding responsibility to the payor and, if so, how?
A-5: Yes. The plan administrator may shift the withholding responsibility to the payor by following the procedures set forth in § 35.3405-1, Q
A E-2 through E-5 of this chapter (relating to elective withholding on pensions, annuities and certain other deferred income) with appropriate adjustments, including the plan administrator's identification of amounts that constitute required minimum distributions.
Q-6: How does the 20-percent withholding requirement under section 3405(c) apply if a distributee elects to have a portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover and to have the remainder of that distribution paid to the distributee?
A-6: If a distributee elects to have a portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover and to receive the remainder of the distribution, the 20-percent withholding requirement under section 3405(c) applies only to the portion of the eligible rollover distribution that the distributee receives and not to the portion that is paid in a direct rollover.
Q-7: Will the plan administrator be subject to liability for tax, interest, or penalties for failure to withhold 20 percent from an eligible rollover distribution that, because of erroneous information provided by a distributee, is not paid to an eligible retirement plan even though the distributee elected a direct rollover?
A-7: (a)
General rule.
If the plan administrator reasonably relied on adequate information provided by the distributee (as described in paragraph (b) of this Q
A), the plan administrator will not be subject to liability for taxes, interest, or penalties for failure to withhold income tax from an eligible rollover distribution solely because the distribution is paid to an account or plan that is not an eligible retirement plan (as defined, with respect to distributions from qualified plans, in section 402(c)(8)(B) and § 1.402(c)-2(a)(1)(iii) of this chapter and, with respect to a distributions from section 403(b) annuities, in § 1.403(b)-7(b) of this chapter.) Although the plan administrator is not required to verify independently the accuracy of information provided by the distributee, the plan administrator's reliance on the information furnished must be reasonable. For example, it is not reasonable for the plan administrator to rely on information that is clearly erroneous on its face.
(b)
Adequate information.
The plan administrator has obtained from the distributee adequate information on which to rely in making a direct rollover if the distributee furnishes to the plan administrator: the name of the eligible retirement plan; a representation that the recipient plan is an individual retirement plan, a qualified plan, or a section 403(b) annuity, as appropriate; and any other information that is necessary in order to permit the plan administrator to accomplish the direct rollover by the means it has selected. This information must include any information needed to comply with the specific requirements of § 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q
A-3 and Q
A-4 of this chapter. For example, if the direct rollover is to be made by mailing a check to the trustee of an individual retirement account, the plan administrator must obtain, in addition to the name of the individual retirement account and the representation described above, the name and address of the trustee of the individual retirement account.
Q-8: Is an eligible rollover distribution that is paid to a qualified defined benefit plan subject to 20-percent withholding?
A-8: No. If an eligible rollover distribution is paid in a direct rollover to an eligible retirement plan within the meaning of section 402(c)(8), including a qualified defined benefit plan, it is reasonable to believe that the distribution is not includible in gross income pursuant to section 402(c)(1). Accordingly, pursuant to section 3405(e)(1)(B), the distribution is not a designated distribution and is not subject to 20-percent withholding.
Q-9: If property other than cash, employer securities, or plan loans is distributed, how is the 20-percent income tax withholding required under section 3405(c) accomplished?
A-9: When all or a portion of an eligible rollover distribution subject to 20-percent income tax withholding under section 3405(c) consists of property other than cash, employer securities, or plan loan offset amounts, the plan administrator or payor must apply § 35.3405-1, Q
A F-2 of this chapter and may apply § 35.3405-1, Q
A F-3 of this chapter in determining how to satisfy the withholding requirements.
Q-10: What assumptions may a plan administrator make regarding whether a benefit is an eligible rollover distribution for purposes of determining the amount of a distribution that is subject to 20-percent mandatory withholding?
A-10: (a)
In general.
For purposes of determining the amount of a distribution that is subject to 20-percent mandatory withholding, a plan administrator may make the assumptions described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this Q
A in determining the amount of a distribution that is an eligible
rollover distribution and a designated distribution. Section 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q
A-18 of this chapter provides assumptions for purposes of complying with section 401(a)(31). See § 1.402(c)-2(k)(2) of this chapter concerning the effect of these assumptions for purposes of section 402(c).
(b)
$5,000 death benefit.
A plan administrator may assume that a distribution that qualifies for the $5,000 death benefit exclusion under section 101(b) is the only death benefit being paid with respect to a deceased employee that qualifies for that exclusion. Thus, in such a case, the plan administrator may assume that the distribution is not an eligible rollover distribution to the extent that it would be excludible from gross income based on this assumption.
(c)
Required minimum distributions.
The plan administrator is permitted to determine the amount of the minimum distribution required to satisfy section 401(a)(9)(A) for any calendar year by assuming that there is no designated beneficiary.
(d)
Valuation of property.
In the case of a distribution that includes property, in calculating the amount of the distribution for purposes of applying section 3405(c), the value of the property may be determined in accordance with § 35.3405-1, Q
A F-1 of this chapter.
Q-11: Are there special rules for applying the 20-percent withholding requirement to employer securities and a plan loan offset amount distributed in an eligible rollover distribution?
A-11: Yes. The maximum amount to be withheld on any designated distribution (including any eligible rollover distribution) under section 3405(c) must not exceed the sum of the cash and the fair market value of property (excluding employer securities) received in the distribution. The amount of the sum is determined without regard to whether any portion of the cash or property is a designated distribution or an eligible rollover distribution. For purposes of this rule, any plan loan offset amount, as defined in § 1.402(c)-2(g) of this chapter, is treated in the same manner as employer securities. Thus, although employer securities and plan loan offset amounts must be included in the amount that is multiplied by 20-percent, the total amount required to be withheld for an eligible rollover distribution is limited to the sum of the cash and the fair market value of property received by the distributee, excluding any amount of the distribution that is a plan loan offset amount or that is distributed in the form of employer securities. For example, if the only portion of an eligible rollover distribution that is not paid in a direct rollover consists of employer securities or a plan loan offset amount, withholding is not required. In addition, if a distribution consists solely of employer securities and cash (not in excess of $200) in lieu of fractional shares, no amount is required to be withheld as income tax from the distribution under section 3405 (including section 3405(c) and this section). For purposes of section 3405 and this section, employer securities means securities of the employer corporation within the meaning of section 402(e)(4)(E)(ii).
Q-12: How does the mandatory withholding rule apply to net unrealized appreciation from employer securities?
A-12: An eligible rollover distribution can include net unrealized appreciation from employer securities, within the meaning of section 402(e)(4), even if the net unrealized appreciation is excluded from gross income under section 402(e)(4). However, to the extent that it is excludable from gross income pursuant to section 402(e)(4), net unrealized appreciation is not a designated distribution pursuant to section 3405(e)(1)(B) because it is reasonable to believe that it is not includable in gross income. Thus, to the extent that net unrealized appreciation is excludable from gross income pursuant to section 402(e)(4), net unrealized appreciation is not included in the amount of an eligible rollover distribution that is subject to 20-percent withholding.
Q-13: Does the 20-percent withholding requirement apply to eligible rollover distributions from a qualified plan distributed annuity contract?
A-13: The 20-percent withholding requirement applies to eligible rollover distributions from a qualified plan distributed annuity contract as defined in § 1.402(c)-2(h) of this chapter. In the case of an eligible rollover distribution from such an annuity contract, the payor is treated as the plan administrator for purposes of section 3405. See § 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q
A-17 of this chapter concerning the direct rollover requirements that apply to distributions from such an annuity contract and see § 1.402(c)-2(h) of this chapter concerning the treatment of distributions from such annuity contracts as eligible rollover distributions.
Q-14: Must a payor or plan administrator withhold tax from an eligible rollover distribution for which a direct rollover election was not made if the amount of the distribution is less than $200?
A-14: No. However, all eligible rollover distributions received within one taxable year of the distributee under the same plan must be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the $200 floor is reached. If the plan administrator or payor does not know at the time of the first distribution (that is less than $200) whether there will be additional eligible rollover distributions during the year for which aggregation is required, the plan administrator need not withhold from the first distribution. If distributions are made within one taxable year under more
than one plan of an employer, the plan administrator or payor may, but need not, aggregate distributions for purposes of determining whether the $200 floor is reached. However, once the $200 threshold has been reached, the sum of all payments during the year must be used to determine the applicable amount to be withheld from subsequent payments during the year.
Q-15: If eligible rollover distributions are made from a qualified plan, who has responsibility for making the returns and reports required under these regulations?
A-15: Generally, the plan administrator, as defined in section 414(g), is responsible for maintaining the records and making the required reports with respect to eligible rollover distributions from qualified plans. However, if the plan administrator fails to keep the required records and make the required reports, the employer maintaining the plan is responsible for the reports and returns.
Q-16: What eligible rollover distributions must be reported on Form 1099-R?
A-16: Each eligible rollover distribution, including each eligible rollover distribution that is paid directly to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover, must be reported on Form 1099-R in accordance with the instructions for Form 1099-R. For purposes of the reporting required under section 6047(e), a direct rollover is treated as a distribution that is immediately rolled over to an eligible retirement plan. Distributions that are not eligible rollover distributions are subject to the reporting requirements set forth in § 35.3405-1 of this chapter and applicable forms and instructions.
Q-17: Must the plan administrator, trustee or custodian of the eligible retirement plan report amounts received in a direct rollover?
A-17: (a)
Individual retirement plan.
If a distributee elects to have an eligible rollover distribution paid to an individual retirement plan in a direct rollover, the eligible rollover distribution is reported on Form 5498 as a rollover contribution to the individual retirement plan, in accordance with the instructions for Form 5498.
(b)
Qualified plan or section 403(b) annuity.
If a distributee elects to have an eligible rollover distribution paid to a qualified plan or section 403(b) annuity, the recipient plan or annuity is not required to report the receipt of the rollover contribution.
[T.D. 8619, 60 FR 49215, Sept. 22, 1995, as amended by T.D. 8880, 65 FR 21315, Apr. 21, 2000; T.D. 9340, 72 FR 41159, July 26, 2007; T.D. 10001, 89 FR 58951, July 19, 2024]
§ 31.3405(e)-1
Questions and answers relating to withholding on pensions, annuities, and certain other deferred income.
(a) The following questions and answers apply for purposes of determining whether a payor of periodic payments or nonperiodic distributions from pensions, annuities, and certain other deferred income (other than eligible rollover distributions) must withhold federal income tax under section 3405(a) or (b) of the Code. For purposes of this section, references to the United States include possessions of the United States.
(b)(1)
Q-1.
Is an Army Post Office (APO), a Fleet Post Office (FPO), or a Diplomatic Post Office (DPO) address an address located within the United States for purposes of section 3405(e)(13)(A)?
(2)
A-1.
For purposes of section 3405(e)(13)(A), an APO, an FPO, or a DPO address is an address located within the United States.
(c)(1)
Q-2.
Is the payor of a designated distribution described in section 3405(a) or (b) required to withhold income tax from the distribution if the payee's residence address that is provided to the payor is located within the United States?
(2)
A-2.
If the payee's residence address that is provided to the payor of a designated distribution described in section 3405(a) or (b) is located within the United States, then the payor is required to withhold income tax from the distribution unless the payee has made a valid election of no withholding in accordance with section 3405(a)(2) or (b)(2). Any election of no withholding with respect to such a distribution under section 3405(a)(2) or (b)(2) is not valid if the payee instructs the payor to do one or more of the following in connection with the distribution:
(i) Send the distribution to a financial institution or other person located outside of the United States;
(ii) Send the distribution to a financial institution or other person located within the United States with further instructions (such as
for further credit to
instructions) directing that the funds be forwarded to a financial institution or other person located outside of the United States; or
(iii) Send the distribution to a financial institution or other person pursuant to payment instructions (including addenda information) that reference an International Automated Clearing House Transaction (IAT), International
Bank Account Number (IBAN), Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) Business Identifier Code (BIC), or similar identifier linked to a financial institution or other person located outside of the United States.
(d)(1)
Q-3.
Is the payor of a designated distribution described in section 3405(a) or (b) required to withhold income tax from the distribution if the payee's residence address that is provided to the payor is located outside of the United States?
(2)
A-3.
Unless section 3405(e)(13)(B) (which provides an exception for certain nonresident aliens) applies, if the payee's residence address that is provided to the payor is located outside of the United States, the payor of a designated distribution described in section 3405(a) or (b) is required to withhold income tax from the distribution without regard to the delivery instructions and without regard to any request by the payee to elect no withholding. Withholding would be required, in this case, even if the payee has requested that the distribution be delivered to a financial institution or other person located within the United States.
(e)(1)
Q-4.
Is the payor of a designated distribution described in section 3405(a) or (b) required to withhold income tax from the distribution if the payee has not provided the payor with the payee's residence address?
(2)
A-4.
If a payee has not provided the payor of a designated distribution described in section 3405(a) or (b) with the payee's residence address, the payor is required to withhold income tax from the distribution. Such a payee may not elect no withholding under section 3405(a)(2) or (b)(2), and any purported election of no withholding by such a payee is not valid. For purposes of this section, a payee who has provided the payor with an address for the payee's nominee, trustee, or agent without also providing the payee's residence address has not provided a residence address.
(f)(1)
Q-5.
Do the withholding rules under section 3405(a) and (b) apply to a payee who is to receive a payment or distribution that is subject to the withholding rules that apply to nonresident aliens (or that would be so subject but for a tax treaty)?
(2)
A-5.
In accordance with section 3405(e)(1)(B)(iii), a designated distribution does not include a distribution of a United States-source payment that is subject to withholding under the rules of sections 1441 through 1446 of the Code (or that would be so subject but for a tax treaty). Therefore, the withholding rules under section 3405(a) and (b) do not apply to such a distribution. For example, section 3405(a) or (b) withholding would not apply to a pension or other deferred compensation plan distribution to be made to a payee who is a nonresident alien (or other individual payee who is presumed to be a foreign person under the presumption rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)). In such a case, withholding under the rules of section 1441, rather than under the rules of section 3405(a) or (b), would apply to such a distribution.
(g)(1)
Q-6.
What is the applicability date of this section?
(2)
A-6.
This section applies with respect to payments and distributions made on or after January 1, 2026. However, taxpayers may apply it to earlier payments and distributions.

§ 31.3406(a)-1
Backup withholding requirement on reportable payments.
(a)
Overview.
Under section 3406, a payor must deduct and withhold 31 percent of a reportable payment if a condition for withholding exists.
Reportable payments
mean interest and dividend payments (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)) and other reportable payments (as defined in section 3406(b)(3)). The conditions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply to all reportable payments, including reportable interest and dividend payments. The conditions described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section apply only to reportable interest and dividend payments.
(b)
Conditions that invoke the backup withholding requirement
—(1)
Conditions applicable to all reportable payments.
A payor of a reportable payment must deduct and withhold under section 3406 if—
(i) The payee of the reportable payment does not furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor, as required in section 3406(a)(1)(A) and § 31.3406(d)-1; or
(ii) The Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies the payor that the taxpayer identification number furnished by its payee for a reportable payment is incorrect, as described in section 3406(a)(1)(B) and § 31.3406(d)-5.
(2)
Conditions applicable only to reportable interest or dividend payments.
A payor of a reportable interest or dividend payment must deduct and withhold under section 3406 if—
(i) The Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies the payor that its payee has underreported interest or dividend
income, as described in section 3406(a)(1)(C) and § 31.3406(c)-1; or
(ii) The payee fails to certify to the payor or broker that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting, as described in section 3406(a)(1)(D) and § 31.3406(d)-2.
(c)
Exceptions.
The requirement to withhold does not apply to certain minimal payments as described in § 31.3406(b)(4)-1 or to payments exempt from withholding under §§ 31.3406(g)-1 through 31.3406(g)-3.
(d)

§ 31.3406(a)-2
Definition of payors obligated to backup withhold.
(a)
In general. Payor
means the person that is required to make an information return under section 6041, 6041A(a), 6042, 6044, 6045, 6049, 6050A, 6050N, or 6050W with respect to any reportable payment (as described in section 3406(b)), or that is described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Persons treated as payors.
The following persons are treated as payors for purposes of section 3406—
(1) A grantor trust established after December 31, 1995, all of which is owned by two or more grantors (treating for this purpose spouses filing a joint return as one grantor);
(2) A grantor trust with ten or more grantors established on or after January 1, 1984 but before January 1, 1996;
(3) A common trust fund; and
(4) A partnership or an S corporation that makes a reportable payment.
(c)
Persons not treated as payors.
A person on the following list is not treated as a payor for purposes of section 3406 if the person does not have a reporting obligation under the section on information reporting to which the payment relates—
(1) A trust (other than a grantor trust as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section) that files a Form 1041 containing information required to be shown on an information return, including amounts withheld under section 3406; or
(2) A partnership making a payment of a distributive share or an S corporation making a similar distribution.
(d)

§ 31.3406(a)-3
Scope and extent of accounts subject to backup withholding.
A payor who is required to withhold under § 31.3406(a)-1 must withhold—
(a) On the accounts subject to withholding under § 31.3406(a)-1 (b)(1)(i) or (b)(2)(ii); and
(b) On the accounts subject to withholding under § 31.3406(a)-1(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2)(i), as described under § 31.3406(d)-5 (relating to notification of incorrect TIN) or § 31.3406(c)-1 (relating to notified payee underreporting), respectively.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66114, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 31.3406(a)-4
Time when payments are considered to be paid and subject to backup withholding.
(a)
Timing
—(1)
In general.
If backup withholding is required under section 3406 on a reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)), the payor must withhold at the time it makes the payment to the payee or to the payee's account that is subject to withholding. Amounts are considered paid when they are credited to the account of, or made available to, the payee. Amounts are not considered paid solely because they are posted (e.g., an informational notation on the payee's passbook) if they are not actually credited to the payee's account or made available to the payee. See paragraph (c) of this section for the timing of withholding by a middleman.
(2)
Special rules for dividends.
For purposes of section 3406 and this section—
(i)
Record date earlier than payment date.
In the case of stock for which the record date is earlier than the payment date, the dividends are considered paid on the payment date.
(ii)
Dividends paid in corporate reorganizations.
In the case of a corporate reorganization, if a payee is required to
exchange stock held in the former corporation for stock in the new corporation before the dividends that have been paid with respect to the stock in the new corporation will be provided to the payee, the dividend is considered paid on the date the payee actually exchanges the stock and receives the dividend.
(b)
Amounts reportable under section 6045
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, in the case of a transaction reportable under section 6045 (except in the case of forward contracts (including foreign currency contracts), regulated futures contracts, and security short sales), the obligation to withhold under section 3406 arises on the date the sale is entered on the books of the broker or the date the exchange occurs as provided in § 1.6045-1(f)(3) of this chapter. A broker (in its capacity as payor) is not required, however, to satisfy its withholding liability until payment is made. See § 31.3406(b)(3)-2(b)(2) for special rules applicable to forward contracts (including foreign currency contracts), regulated futures contracts, and security short sales.
(2)
Special rule for interest accrued on bonds.
For purposes of determining the time that interest is considered paid and subject to withholding under section 3406 when bonds are sold between interest payment dates, the portion of the sales price representing interest accrued to the date of sale is considered a portion of a reportable payment of gross proceeds under section 6045 (provided that the accrued interest is not tax-exempt as described in section 103(a), relating to certain governmental obligations), and is not considered to be a payment of interest for purposes of section 6049.
(c)
Middlemen
—(1)
In general.
A person that is a middleman and is a person defined in § 31.3406(a)-2(b) or in the section on information reporting to which the payment relates must withhold under section 3406 at the time the reportable payment is received by or credited to the middleman. If the middleman makes or credits the reportable payment to the payee prior to the middleman's receipt of the corresponding payment, the middleman may withhold at the time the reportable payment is made or credited to the payee.
(2)
Special rule for common trust funds.
A common trust fund (as defined in section 584) must withhold either—
(i) At the time the reportable payment is received by or credited to the common trust fund as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;
(ii) On the date on which the assets of the common trust fund are valued; or
(iii) At the time the common trust fund pays or credits the reportable payment to a participant of the common trust fund.
(3)
Special rule for certain grantor trusts.
For grantor trusts described in § 31.3406(a)-2(b)(1) or (2), reportable payments made to the trust are treated as paid by the trust to each grantor, in an amount equal to the distribution made by the trust to each grantor, on the date that the reportable payment is paid to the trust (except for gross proceeds reportable under section 6045). Paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies to a grantor trust making a payment of gross proceeds under section 6045 subject to withholding under section 3406. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3) a husband and wife filing a joint return are considered to be one grantor.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66115, Dec. 21, 1995, as amended by T.D. 9010, 67 FR 48760, July 26, 2002]
§ 31.3406(b)(2)-1
Reportable interest payment.
(a)
Interest subject to backup withholding
—(1)
In general.
A payment of a kind, and to a payee, that is required to be reported under section 6049 (relating to returns regarding interest and original issue discount) is a reportable payment for purposes of section 3406, subject to the special rules of § 31.3406(b)(2)-2 (relating to original issue discount) and § 31.3406(b)(2)-3 (relating to window transactions). See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.
(2)
Special rule for tax-exempt interest.
When an issuer is required to make an information return under § 1.6049-4(d)(8) of this chapter because a payee provided a signed written statement on
the envelope or shell incorrectly claiming that the interest was exempt from taxation under section 103(a) (as described in § 1.6049-5(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter), the issuer is not required to impose withholding under section 3406.
(b)
Amount subject to backup withholding
—(1)
In general.
The amount of interest subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6049.
(2)
Special rule to adjust for premature withdrawal penalty.
Solely for purposes of computing the amount subject to withholding under section 3406, the payor may elect not to withhold from the portion of any interest payment that is not received by the payee because a penalty is in fact imposed for premature withdrawal of funds deposited in a time savings account, certificate of deposit, or similar class of deposit.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66115, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 31.3406(b)(2)-2
Original issue discount.
(a)
Original issue discount subject to backup withholding.
The amount of original issue discount, treated as interest, subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6049, but is limited to the amount of cash paid. In addition, if an original issue discount obligation, subject to reporting under section 6045, is sold prior to maturity and with respect to the seller a condition exists for imposing withholding under section 3406 on the gross proceeds, then withholding under § 31.3406(b)(3)-2 applies to the gross proceeds of the sale reportable under section 6045, and not to the amount of any original issue discount includible in the gross income of the seller for the calendar year of the sale. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.
(b)
Amount subject to backup withholding and time when backup withholding is imposed with respect to short-term obligations.
In the case of an obligation with a fixed maturity date not exceeding one year from the date of issue (a short-term obligation), withholding under section 3406 applies to any payment of original issue discount on the obligation includible in the gross income of the holder to the extent of the cash amount of the payment. See § 1.1273-1 of this chapter to determine the amount of original issue discount on a short-term obligation. See § 1.446-2(e)(1) of this chapter to determine the amount of a payment treated as original issue discount.
(c)
Transferred short-term obligations
—(1)
Subsequent holder may establish purchase price
—(i)
In general.
At maturity of a short-term obligation, a subsequent holder (i.e., any person who purchased or otherwise obtained the obligation after the obligation was issued to the original holder) may establish the price of the obligation. The price established by the subsequent holder must then be treated as the original issue price for purposes of computing the amount of the original issue discount subject to withholding under section 3406. The price of a short-term obligation may be established by confirmation receipt or other record of a similar type or, if the obligation is redeemed by or through the person from whom the obligation was purchased or otherwise obtained, by the records of the person from whom or through whom the obligation was purchased or otherwise obtained. The subsequent holder is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the price determined under this paragraph (c)(1)(i) is correct.
(ii)
Exception.
A payor may elect to disregard the price at which the subsequent holder purchased or otherwise obtained the obligation if the payor's computer or recordkeeping system on which the details of the obligation are stored is not able to accept that price without significant manual intervention.
(2)
Subsequent holder unable (or not permitted) to establish purchase price.
If a subsequent holder fails (or is unable, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) to establish the purchase price of the obligation, then the person redeeming the obligation must determine the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 as though the obligation had been purchased by the holder on the date of issue. If the person redeeming the obligation is the issuer of
the obligation, then the issuer must determine the amount subject to withholding from its records. If a person other than the issuer of the obligation redeems the obligation and the obligation is listed in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1212, List of Original Issue Discount Obligations, that person must determine the amount subject to withholding by using the issue price indicated in Publication 1212.
(3)
Transferred obligation.
If a short-term obligation is transferred, no part of the purchase price is considered a reportable interest payment under section 6049. Withholding under section 3406 applies, however, to the gross proceeds of the sale of the obligation if the transfer is subject to reporting under section 6045 and a condition exists for imposing withholding. For the rules regarding withholding for amounts subject to reporting under section 6045, see § 31.3406(b)(3)-2.
(d)
Amount subject to backup withholding and time when backup withholding is imposed with respect to long-term obligations
—(1)
No cash payments prior to maturity.
In the case of an obligation with a fixed maturity date that is more than one year from the date of issue (a long-term obligation) and with no cash payments prior to maturity, withholding under section 3406 applies at the maturity of the obligation to the amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder for the calendar year in which the obligation matures. The amount required to be withheld must not exceed the amount of the cash payment.
(2)
Registered long-term obligations with cash payments prior to maturity.
In the case of a long-term obligation in registered form that provides for cash payments prior to maturity, withholding under section 3406 applies at the time cash payments are made to the sum of the amounts of qualified stated interest and original issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder for the calendar year in which the cash payments are made. The amount required to be withheld at the time of any cash payment, however, must not exceed the amount of the cash payment. If more than one cash payment is made during a calendar year, the tax that is required to be withheld with respect to original issue discount must be allocated among all the expected cash payments in the ratio that each cash payment bears to the total of the expected cash payments.
(3)
Transferred registered long-term obligations with payments prior to maturity.
In the case of a long-term obligation that is transferred after its issuance from the original holder, the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to a subsequent holder is the amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of all holders during the calendar year (without regard to any amount paid by a subsequent holder at the time of transfer). If the person redeeming the obligation at maturity is the issuer of the obligation, the issuer must determine the amount subject to withholding through its records by treating the holder as if he were the original holder. If a person redeeming the obligation at maturity is a person other than the issuer of the obligation, and the obligation is listed in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1212, List of Original Issue Discount Obligations, the person must determine the amount subject to withholding by using the issue price indicated in Publication 1212.
(e)
Bearer long-term obligations.
In the case of a bearer long-term obligation with cash payments prior to maturity—
(1)
Payments prior to maturity.
Withholding under section 3406 applies prior to maturity only to the payment of qualified stated interest (and not to any amount of original issue discount) includible in the gross income of the holder for the calendar year.
(2)
Payments at maturity.
At maturity of the obligation, withholding applies to the sum of any qualified stated interest payment made at maturity and the total amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder during the calendar year of maturity. The amount required to be withheld at the time of the cash payment, however, must not exceed the amount of the cash payment.

§ 31.3406(b)(2)-3
Window transactions.
(a)
Requirement to backup withhold.
Withholding under section 3406 applies to a window transaction (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) only if the payee does not furnish a taxpayer identification number to the payor in the manner required in paragraph (c) of this section or furnishes an obviously incorrect number as described in § 31.3406(h)-1(b)(2). Withholding does not apply to a window transaction even though the Internal Revenue Service notifies the payor of the payee's incorrect taxpayer identification number under section 3406(a)(1)(B) or of notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C). The payee in a window transaction is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting (as described in § 31.3406(d)-2(b)(2)).
(b)
Window transaction defined. Window transaction
means a payment of interest with respect to any of the following obligations:
(1) An interest coupon in bearer form that is subject to taxation (i.e., other than exempt interest described in § 1.6049-5(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter);
(2) A United States savings bond; or
(3) A discount obligation having a maturity at issue of one year or less, including commercial paper and bankers' acceptances that are in definitive form (i.e., evidenced by a paper document other than a confirmation receipt) but not including short-term government obligations (as defined in section 1271(a)(3)(B)).
(c)
Manner of furnishing taxpayer identification number in the case of a window transaction.
A payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor with respect to a window transaction either orally or in writing at the time that the window transaction occurs. See § 31.3406(g)-3(c)(1)(i), which provides that a payee may not claim the payee is awaiting receipt of a taxpayer identification number with respect to a window transaction. The payee is not required to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66116, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 31.3406(b)(2)-4
Reportable dividend payment.
(a)
Dividends subject to backup withholding.
A payment of a kind, and to a payee, that is required to be reported under section 6042 (relating to returns regarding payments of dividends and corporate earnings and profits) is a reportable payment for purposes of section 3406. See paragraph (b) of this section for certain dividends not subject to withholding under section 3406. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.
(b)
Dividends not subject to backup withholding.
Except as provided in § 31.3406(b)(3)-2 (relating to transactions reportable under section 6045), withholding under section 3406 does not apply to—
(1) Any amount treated as a taxable dividend by reason of section 302 (relating to redemptions of stock), section 304 (relating to redemptions through the use of related corporations), section 306 (relating to disposition of certain stock), section 356 (relating to receipt of additional consideration in connection with certain reorganizations), or section 1081(e)(2) (relating to certain distributions pursuant to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission);
(2) Any exempt-interest dividend, as defined in section 852(b)(5)(A), paid by a regulated investment company; or
(3) Any amount paid or treated as paid during a year by a regulated investment company, provided that the payor reasonably estimates, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that 95 percent or more of all dividends paid or treated as paid during the year are exempt-interest dividends.
(c)
Amount subject to backup withholding
—(1)
In general.
The amount of a dividend subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6042, including any dividend that is reinvested pursuant to a plan under which a shareholder may elect to receive stock as a dividend instead of property. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), withholding applies to the entire amount of the distribution.
(2)
Reasonable estimate of amount of dividend subject to backup withholding.
Pursuant to section 6042(b)(3) and § 1.6042-3(c) of this chapter, if the payor is unable to determine the portion of a distribution that is a dividend, the entire amount of the distribution must be treated as a dividend for information reporting under section 6042. Hence, withholding applies to the entire amount of the distribution. If a payor is able reasonably to estimate under section 6042 and § 1.6042-3(c) of this chapter the portion of a distribution that is not a dividend, however, the payor must not withhold on that portion (which is not considered a dividend). A payor making a payment, all or a portion of which may not be a dividend, may use previous experience to estimate the portion of a distribution that is not a dividend. The payor's estimate is considered reasonable if—
(i) The estimate does not exceed the proportion of the distributions made by the payor during the most recent calendar year for which a Form 1099 was required to be filed that was not reported by the payor as a dividend; and
(ii) The payor has no reasonable basis to expect that the proportion of the distribution that is not a dividend will be substantially different for the current year.
(3)
Reinvested dividends.
In the case of a dividend paid pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan, withholding under section 3406 applies, pursuant to § 31.3406(a)-4(a), at the time and to the amount made available to the shareholder or credited to the shareholder's account. At the discretion of the payor, withholding under section 3406 need not be applied to any excess of the fair market value of the shares of stock received by the shareholder or credited to the shareholder's account over the purchase price of the shares (including shares acquired by the shareholder at a discount in connection with the dividend distribution) or to any fee that is paid by the payor in the nature of a broker's fee for purchase of the stock or service charge for maintenance of the shareholder's account. The payor must, however, treat any excess amounts and fees on a consistent basis for each calendar year.

§ 31.3406(b)(2)-5
Reportable patronage dividend payment.
(a)
Patronage dividends subject to backup withholding.
A payment of a kind, and to a payee, that is required to be reported under section 6044 (relating to returns regarding patronage dividends) is a reportable payment for purposes of section 3406. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.
(b)
Amount subject to backup withholding
—(1)
Failure to provide taxpayer identification number or notification of incorrect taxpayer identification number.
For purposes of sections 3406(a)(1) (A) and (B), the amount of a payment described in paragraph (a) of this section that is subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6044, but only to the extent the payment is made in money. For purposes of this paragraph (b),
money
includes cash or a qualified check (as defined in section 1388(c)(4)).
(2)
Notified payee underreporting or payee certification failure.
For purposes of sections 3406(a)(1) (C) and (D), the amount of a payment described in paragraph (a) of this section that is subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to withholding under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but only if 50 percent or more of that reportable amount is paid in money. Thus, a payor is required to withhold according to this paragraph (b)(2) on a payment if—
(i) There has been a notified payee underreporting described in section 3406(a)(1)(C) and § 31.3406(c)-1 or there has been a payee certification failure described in section 3406(a)(1)(D) and § 31.3406(d)-2;
(ii) The payor makes a reportable payment subject to reporting under section 6044 to the payee; and
(iii) Fifty percent or more of the payment is in cash or by qualified check.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66117, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 31.3406(b)(3)-1
Reportable payments of rents, commissions, nonemployee compensation, etc.
(a)
Section 6041 and 6041A(a) payments subject to backup withholding.
A payment of a kind, and to a payee, that is required to be reported under section
6041 (relating to information reporting of rents, commissions, nonemployee compensation, etc.) or a payment that is required to be reported under section 6041A(a) (relating to information reporting of payments to nonemployees for services) is a reportable payment for purposes of section 3406. See paragraph (b) of this section for an exception concerning payments aggregating less than $600. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.
(b)
Amount subject to backup withholding
—(1)
In general.
The amount of a payment described in paragraph (a) of this section subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6041 or section 6041A(a).
(2)
Net commissions.
Withholding under section 3406 does not apply to net commissions paid to unincorporated special agents with respect to insurance policies that are subject to reporting under section 6041, provided that no cash is actually paid by the payor to the special agent.
(3)
Payments aggregating $600 or more for the calendar year
—(i)
In general.
A payment is a reportable payment under paragraph (a) of this section only if the aggregate amount of the current payment and all previous payments to the payee during the calendar year aggregate $600 or more. The amount subject to withholding is the entire amount of the payment that causes the total amount paid to the payee to equal $600 or more and the amount of any subsequent payments made to the payee during the calendar year. This paragraph (b)(3)(i) does not apply to gambling winnings (as provided in § 31.3406(g)-2(e)(1)).
(ii)
Exceptions
—(A)
The $600 aggregation rule.
The $600 aggregation rule of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section does not apply if the payor was required to make an information return under section 6041 or 6041A(a) for the preceding calendar year with respect to payments to the payee, or the payor was required to withhold under section 3406 during the preceding calendar year with respect to payments to the payee that were reportable under section 6041 or 6041A(a).
(B)
Determination of whether payments aggregate $600 or more.
In determining whether payments to a payee aggregate $600 or more during a calendar year for purposes of withholding under section 3406, the payor must aggregate only payments of the same kind made to the same payee. For this purpose, payments are of the same kind if they are of the same type, regardless of whether they are reportable under the same section. However, a payor with different paying departments making reportable payments of the same kind is not required to aggregate payments made by all those departments unless it is the payor's customary method to aggregate those payments. A payor may, in its discretion, aggregate—
(
1
) Payments not of the same kind to the same payee, reportable under either section 6041 or 6041A(a); and
(
2
) Payments reportable under section 6041 with payments reportable under section 6041A(a).

§ 31.3406(b)(3)-2
Reportable barter exchanges and gross proceeds of sales of securities, commodities, or digital assets by brokers.
(a)
Transactions subject to backup withholding.
A payment of a kind, and to a payee, that any broker (as defined in section 6045(c) and § 1.6045-1(a)(1) of this chapter) or any barter exchange (as defined in section 6045(c) and § 1.6045-1(a)(4) of this chapter) is required to report under section 6045 is a reportable payment for purposes of section 3406. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.
(b)
Amount subject to backup withholding
—(1)
In general.
The amount subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6045. The amount subject to withholding with respect to broker reporting is the amount of gross proceeds (as determined under § 1.6045-1(d)(5) of this chapter). The amount subject to withholding with respect to barter exchanges is the amount received by any member or client (as determined under § 1.6045-1(f)(4) of this chapter).
(2)
Forward contracts, including foreign currency contracts, and regulated futures contracts
—(i)
In general.
If a customer is subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to a forward contract (subject to information reporting under § 1.6045-1(c)(5) of this chapter), including a foreign currency contract (as defined in section 1256(g)(2)), or a regulated futures contract (as defined in section 1256(g)(1)), or with respect to an account through which those contracts are disposed of or acquired, the broker must withhold on both of the following amounts:
(A) All cash or property withdrawn from the account by the customer during the relevant year; and
(B) The amount of cash in the account available for withdrawal by the customer at the relevant year-end (including both gross proceeds and variation margin).
(ii)
Rules concerning withdrawals.
A withdrawal includes the use of money (including both gross proceeds and variation margin) or property in the account to purchase any property other than property acquired in connection with the closing of a contract. For this purpose, the acceptance of a warehouse receipt or other taking of delivery to close a contract is in connection with the closing of a contract only if the property acquired is disposed of by the close of the seventh trading day following the trading day that the customer takes delivery under the contract. In addition, making delivery to close a contract is in connection with the closing of a contract only if the broker is able to determine that the property used to close the contract was acquired no earlier than the seventh trading day prior to the trading day on which delivery is made. Withdrawals do not include repayments of debt incurred in connection with making or taking delivery that meets the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2). Withdrawals also do not include payments of commissions, fees, transfers of cash from the account to another futures account that is subject to this paragraph (b)(2) or cash withdrawals traceable to dispositions of property other than futures (not including profit on the contract separately reportable under § 1.6045-1(c)(5)(i)(
b
) of this chapter).
(iii)
Special rule for forward contracts, including foreign currency contracts, and regulated futures contracts.
The determination of whether the customer is subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to an account containing forward contracts, including foreign currency contracts, or regulated futures contracts must be made at the time of the cash or property withdrawals or the relevant year-end, whichever is applicable.
(3)
Security sales made through a margin account.
The amount described in paragraph (a) of this section that is subject to withholding under section 3406 in the case of a security sale made through a margin account (as defined in 12 CFR part 220 (Regulation T)) is the gross proceeds (as defined in § 1.6045-1(d)(5) of this chapter) of the sale. The amount required to be withheld with respect to the sale, however, is limited to the amount of cash available for withdrawal by the customer immediately after the settlement of the sale. For this purpose, the amount available for withdrawal by the customer does not include amounts required to satisfy margin maintenance under Regulation T, rules and regulations of the National Association of Securities Dealers and national securities exchanges, and generally applicable self-imposed rules of the margin account carrier.
(4)
Security short sales
—(i)
Amount subject to backup withholding.
The amount subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to a short sale of securities is the gross proceeds (as defined in § 1.6045-1(d)(5) of this chapter) of the short sale. At the option of the broker, however, the amount subject to withholding may be the gain upon the closing of the short sale (if any); consequently, the obligation to withhold under section 3406 would be deferred until the closing transaction. A broker may use this alternative method of determining the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 with respect to a short sale only if at the time the short sale is initiated, the broker expects that the amount of gain realized upon the closing of the short sale will be determinable from
the broker's records. If, due to events unforeseen at the time the short sale was initiated, the broker is unable to determine the basis of the property used to close the short sale, the property must be assumed for this purpose to have a basis of zero.
(ii)
Time of backup withholding.
The determination of whether a short seller is subject to withholding under section 3406 must be made on the date of the initiation or closing, as the case may be, or on the date that the initiation or closing, as the case may be, is entered on the broker's books and records.
(5)
Fractional shares.
A broker is not required to withhold under section 3406 with respect to a sale of a fractional share of stock resulting in less than $20 of gross proceeds (as described in § 1.6045-1(c)(3)(x) of this chapter).
(6)
Amount subject to backup withholding in the case of reporting under § 1.6045-1(d)(2)(i)(C) and (d)(10) of this chapter
—(i)
Optional reporting method for sales of qualifying stablecoins and specified nonfungible tokens
—(A)
In general.
The amount subject to withholding under section 3406 for a broker that reports sales of digital assets under the optional method for reporting qualifying stablecoins or specified nonfungible tokens under § 1.6045-1(d)(10) of this chapter is the amount of gross proceeds from designated sales of qualifying stablecoins as defined in § 1.6045-1(d)(10)(i)(C) of this chapter and sales of specified nonfungible tokens without regard to the amount which must be paid to the broker's customer before reporting is required.
(B)
Backup withholding on non-designated sales of qualifying stablecoins
—(
1
)
In general.
A broker is not required to withhold under section 3406 on non-designated sales of qualifying stablecoins as defined under § 1.6045-1(d)(10)(i)(C) of this chapter.
(
2
)
Non-qualifying events.
In the case of a digital asset that would satisfy the definition of a non-designated sale of a qualifying stablecoin as defined under § 1.6045-1(d)(10)(i)(C) of this chapter for a calendar year but for a non-qualifying event during that year, a broker is not required to withhold under section 3406 on such sale if it occurs no later than the end of the day that is 30 days after the first non-qualifying event with respect to such digital asset during such year. A
non-qualifying event
is the first date during a calendar year on which the digital asset no longer satisfies all three conditions described in § 1.6045-1(d)(10)(ii)(A) through (C) of this chapter to be a qualifying stablecoin. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(6)(i)(B)(
2
), the date on which a non-qualifying event has occurred with respect to a digital asset and the date that is no later than 30 days after such non-qualifying event must be determined using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
(ii)
Applicable threshold for sales by processors of digital asset payments.
For purposes of determining the amount subject to withholding under section 3406, the amount subject to reporting under section 6045 is determined without regard to the minimum gross proceeds which must be paid to the customer under § 1.6045-1(d)(2)(i)(C) of this chapter before reporting is required.
(c)
Applicability date.
This section applies to reportable payments made on or after January 1, 2025. For the rules applicable to reportable payments made prior to January 1, 2025,
see
§ 31.3406(b)(3)-2 in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2024.

See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.
(b)
Amount subject to backup withholding.
The amount described in paragraph (a) of this section subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6050A, but only to the extent the amount is paid in money and represents a share of the proceeds of the catch.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66119, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 31.3406(b)(3)-4
Reportable payments of royalties.
(a)
Royalty payments subject to backup withholding.
A payment of a kind, and to a payee, that is required to be reported under section 6050N (relating to information reporting of payments of royalties) is a reportable payment for purposes of section 3406. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.
(b)
Amount subject to backup withholding.
In general, the amount described in paragraph (a) of this section that is subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6050N. However, if the reportable payment is for an oil or gas interest, the amount subject to withholding is the net amount the payee receives (i.e., the gross proceeds less production-related taxes such as state severance taxes).

§ 31.3406(b)(3)-5
Reportable payments of payment card and third party network transactions.
(a)
Payment card and third party network transactions subject to backup withholding.
The gross amount of a reportable transaction that is required to be reported under section 6050W (relating to information reporting for payment card and third party network transactions) is a reportable payment for purposes of section 3406. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.
(b)
Amount subject to backup withholding.
In general, the amount described in paragraph (a) of this section that is subject to withholding under section 3406 is the amount subject to reporting under section 6050W. In the case of payments made in settlement of third party network transactions, the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 is determined without regard to the exception for de minimis payments by third party settlement organizations in section 6050W(e) and the associated regulations.
(c)
Time when payments are considered to be subject to backup withholding
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a payment card or third party network transaction reportable under section 6050W, the obligation to withhold arises on the date of the transaction. A payor is not required, however, to satisfy its withholding liability until the time that payment is made.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On Day 1, Customer A uses a payment card to purchase $100 worth of goods from Merchant B. Bank X, the merchant acquiring entity for B, is the party with the contractual obligation to make payment to B in settlement of the transaction. On Day 2, X, after deducting fees of $2, makes payment of $98 to settle the transaction for the sale of goods from B to A. Under paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.6050W-1, X must report the amount of $100, the amount of the transaction on Day 1, without any reduction for fees or any other amount, as the gross amount of this reportable payment transaction on the annual information return filed under paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.6050W-1. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, X's obligation, if any, to backup withhold arises on Day 1, the backup withholding obligation must be satisfied on Day 2, and the amount subject to backup withholding is $100 (the gross amount of the reportable payment transaction (as defined in paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.6050W-1)).
(d)
Backup withholding from an alternate source
—(1)
In general.
A payor may not withhold under section 3406 from a source maintained by the payor other than the source with respect to which there exists a liability to withhold under section 3406 with respect to the payee. See section 3403 and § 31.3403-1, which provide that the payor is liable for the amount required to be withheld regardless of whether the payor withholds.
(2)
Exceptions for backup withholding when there are no funds available
—(i)
Backup withholding from an alternative source.
In the event there are no funds available in the source with respect to which there exists a liability to withhold under section 3406 with respect to the payee, the payor may withhold under section 3406 from another source maintained by the payee with the payor. The source from which the tax is withheld under section 3406 must be payable to at least one of the persons listed on the account subject to withholding. If the account or source is not payable exclusively to the same person
or persons listed on the account subject to withholding under section 3406, then the payor must obtain a written statement from all other persons to whom the account or source is payable authorizing the payor to withhold under section 3406 from the alternative account or source. A payor that elects to withhold under section 3406 from an alternative source may determine the account or source from which the tax is to be withheld, or may allow the payee to designate the alternative source.
(ii)
Deferral of withholding.
If the payor cannot locate, with reasonable care (following procedures substantially similar to those set forth in § 31.3406(d)-5(c)(3)(ii)(A) and (B)), an alternative source of cash from which the payor may satisfy its withholding obligation pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the payor may defer its obligation to withhold under section 3406 until the earlier of—
(A) The date on which cash, in a sufficient amount to satisfy the obligation in full, is deposited in the account subject to withholding under section 3406; or
(B) The close of the fourth calendar year after the obligation arose.
(iii)
Termination of obligation to backup withhold.
If, at the close of the fourth calendar year after the backup withholding arose, the payor has not located an alternate source of cash from which the payor may satisfy its withholding obligation, and sufficient cash to satisfy the obligation in full has not been deposited in the account subject to withholding under section 3406, then the obligation to backup withhold terminates at the close of the fourth calendar year.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
The provisions of this section apply to amounts paid after December 31, 2011.
[T.D. 9496, 75 FR 49835, Aug. 16, 2010]
§ 31.3406(b)(4)-1
Exemption for certain minimal payments.
(a)
In general.
A payor of reportable interest or dividends (as described in section 3406(b)(2)) or of royalties (as described in section 3406(b)(3)(E)) may elect not to withhold from a payment that does not exceed $10 and that on an annualized basis does not exceed $10 (see paragraph (c) of this section). A broker or barter exchange may elect not to withhold on gross proceeds of $10 or less without regard to the annualization requirement. See § 31.6051-4 for the requirement to furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.
(b)
Manner of making the election.
The election not to withhold from payments that do not exceed $10 can be made only for payments described in paragraph (a) of this section. The election may be made on a payment-by-payment basis.
(c)
How to annualize
—(1)
In general.
To annualize a reportable interest payment, dividend payment, or royalty payment, a payor must calculate what the amount of the payment would be if it were paid for a 1-year period (instead of the period for which it actually is paid). The annualized amount is determined by dividing the amount of the payment by the number of days in the period for which it is being paid and then multiplying that result by the number of days in the year. If the annualized amount is $10 or less, the payor may elect not to withhold on that payment regardless of whether more than $10 may be or has been paid to the payee in other reportable payments during the calendar year. Conversely, if the annualized amount is more than $10, withholding applies even if $10 or less is actually paid to the payee during the calendar year. For purposes of computing the annualized amount, the payor may assume that February always consists of 28 days and that the year always consists of 360 days. For amounts that are deposited with a payor in a new account or certificate between the dates on which the payor customarily pays or credits interest, the payor may assume that the period for which the interest is paid is the payor's customary period for paying or crediting interest.
(2)
Special aggregation rule for reportable interest and dividends.
If a payor maintains records that reflect multiple holdings of one payee and the payor makes an aggregate payment of reportable interest or dividends (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)) with respect to those multiple holdings (such as a dividend check that reflects payment on all
stock owned by the payee), the payor must annualize the aggregate payment.
(d)
Exception for window transactions and original issue discount.
A payor is not required to annualize payments made in window transactions (as defined in § 31.3406(b)(2)-3(b)) or payments of original issue discount. With respect to a window transaction, however, the payor is required to aggregate all payments made in the same transaction (e.g., payments made with respect to coupons or obligations presented for payment at the same time as described in § 1.6049-4(e)(4) of this chapter).
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66119, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 31.3406(c)-1
Notified payee underreporting of reportable interest or dividend payments.
(a)
Overview.
Withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) applies to any reportable interest or dividend payment (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)) made with respect to an account of a payee if the Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies a payor under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section that the payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), and the payor is required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to identify that account. After receiving the notice and identifying accounts, the payor must notify the payee, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, that withholding due to notified payee underreporting has started. Paragraph (e) of this section describes the period for which withholding due to notified payee underreporting is required. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules concerning notices that the Internal Revenue Service will send to a payee before notifying a payor that the payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules that a payee can use to prevent withholding due to notified payee underreporting from starting or to stop it once it has started. Paragraph (h) of this section provides special rules for joint accounts of payees who have filed a joint return. See section 6682 for the penalties that may apply to a payee subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C).
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Notified payee underreporting. Notified payee underreporting
means that the Internal Revenue Service has—
(i) Determined that there was a payee underreporting (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section);
(ii) Mailed at least four notices under paragraph (f)(1) of this section to the payee (over a period of at least 120 days) with respect to the underreporting; and
(iii) Assessed any deficiency attributable to the underreporting in the case of any payee who has filed a return.
(2)
Payee underreporting
—(i)
In general. Payee underreporting
means that the Internal Revenue Service has determined, for a taxable year, that—
(A) A payee failed to include in the payee's return of tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code for that year any portion of a reportable interest or dividend payment required to be shown on that tax return; or
(B) A payee may be required to file a return for that year and to include a reportable interest or dividend payment in the return, but failed to file the return.
(ii)
Payments included in making payee underreporting determination.
The determination of whether there is payee underreporting is made by treating as reportable interest or dividend payments, all payments of dividends reported under section 6042, all patronage dividends reported under section 6044, and all interest and original issue discount reported under section 6049, regardless of whether withholding due to notified payee underreporting applies to those payments.
(c)
Notice to payors regarding backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting
—(1)
In general.
If the Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies a payor that a payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting, the payor must—
(i) Identify any accounts of the payee under the rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
(ii) Notify the payee and withhold under section 3406 on reportable interest or dividend payments made with respect to any identified account under
the rules of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
(2)
Additional requirements for payors that are also brokers
—(i)
In general.
A broker must notify the payor of a readily tradable instrument that the payee of the instrument is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting if—
(A) The broker (in its capacity as a payor) receives a notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that a payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting and the broker is required to identify an account of the payee under paragraph (c)(3) of this section;
(B) The payee subsequently acquires the instrument from the broker through the same account; and
(C) The acquisition of the instrument occurs after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the broker receives the notice (or on any earlier date that the broker may begin applying this paragraph (c)(2) after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
(ii)
Transfer out of street name.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), an acquisition includes a transfer of an instrument out of street name into the name of the registered owner (i.e., the payee).
(iii)
Method of providing notice.
A broker must provide the notice required under this paragraph (c)(2) to the payor of the instrument with the transfer instructions for the acquisition. See § 31.3406(d)-4(a)(2).
(iv)
Termination of obligation to provide information.
The obligation of a broker to provide notice to payors under this paragraph (c)(2) terminates simultaneously with the termination of the broker's obligation to withhold (in its capacity as payor) due to notified payee underreporting on reportable interest or dividends made with respect to the account.
(3)
Payor identification of accounts of the payee subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Notice from the Internal Revenue Service.
If a payor receives a notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the payor must identify, exercising reasonable care, all accounts using the same taxpayer identification number for information reporting purposes as the one provided in the notice. The notice may provide, however, that the payor need only identify the account or accounts corresponding to any account number or designation and related taxpayer identification number used for information reporting purposes as that listed on the notice.
(B)
Notice from a broker.
If a payor receives a notice from a broker under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, the payor is not required to identify any account other than the account identified in the notice.
(ii)
Exercise of reasonable care.
If an account identified pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section contains a customer identifier that can be used to retrieve systemically any other accounts that use the same taxpayer identification number for information reporting purposes, the payor must identify all accounts that can be so retrieved. Otherwise, a payor is considered to exercise reasonable care in identifying accounts subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) if the payor searches any computer or other recordkeeping system for the region, division, or branch that serves the geographic area in which the payee's mailing address is located and that was established (or is maintained) to reflect reportable interest or dividend payments.
(iii)
Newly opened accounts.
(A) In general, a new account is not subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) if the payee provides to the payor a Form W-9 (or other acceptable substitute) on which the payor may reasonably rely (within the meaning of § 31.3406(h)-3(e)(2) without regard to § 31.3406(h)-3(e)(2)(v)), unless the payor has actual knowledge (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section) that the statements made on the form are not true.
(B) For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a payor is considered to have actual knowledge that a payee's statement that the payee is not subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) is not true if—
(
1
) The employee or individual agent of the payor who receives the payee's certification knows that the statement is not true;
(
2
) In conducting the investigation, if any, required by paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the payor identifies any other accounts of the payee that are already subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C); or
(
3
) In the course of processing the certification or in administering an account to which a certification relates, the payor discovers that the payor was previously notified by the Internal Revenue Service that the payee is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) and no notice was received to stop withholding pursuant to section 3406(c)(3) prior to the time of the discovery.
(C) Except as provided in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C), a payor is not required to investigate whether the statements made on the Form W-9 described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section are true. If, however, in opening a new account, the payor relies on the same Form W-9 (or appropriate substitute) that it relied on previously in opening another account, the payor must investigate whether any such existing account is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). Similarly, if the payor utilizes a universal account system described in the first sentence of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, and in opening a new account the payor searches its records to determine whether the new account should be identified under an existing identifier (because the payee has existing accounts with the payor), the payor must investigate whether any existing accounts identified with the same identifier are subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C).
(d)
Notice from payors of backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting
—(1)
In general.
If a payor receives notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and is required to identify an account under paragraph (c)(3) of this section as an account of the payee, the payor must notify the payee in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section that withholding due to notified payee underreporting has started.
(2)
Procedures.
The payor must send the notice required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the payee no later than 15 days after the date that the payor makes the first payment subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting. The payor must send the notice by first-class mail to the payee at the payee's last known address. The notice to the payee required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section must state—
(i) That the Internal Revenue Service has given notice that the payee has underreported reportable interest or dividends;
(ii) That, as a result of the underreporting, the payor is required under section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code to withhold 31 percent of reportable interest or dividend payments made to the payee;
(iii) The date that the payor started (or plans to start) withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C);
(iv) The account number or numbers that are subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting;
(v) That the payee must obtain a determination from the Internal Revenue Service in order to stop the withholding due to notified payee underreporting; and
(vi) That while the payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting, the payee may not certify to a payor making reportable interest or dividend payments (or to a broker acquiring a readily tradable instrument for the payee) that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified underreporting.
(e)
Period during which backup withholding is required
—(1)
In general.
If a payor receives notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the payor must impose withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) on all reportable interest or dividend payments with respect to any account of the payee required to be identified under paragraph (c)(3) of this section made after the close of the 30th business day after the day on which the payor receives that
notice and before the stop date (as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section). A payor may choose to start withholding under this paragraph (e)(1) at any time during the 30-business-day period described in the preceding sentence.
(2)
Stop withholding
—(i)
When no underreporting exists or undue hardship exists
—(A)
Stop date.
In the case of a determination under paragraph (g)(3) (i) or (iii) of this section that no underreporting exists or that an undue hardship exists, the stop date is the day that is 30 days after the earlier of—
(
1
) The date on which the payor receives written notification from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (g) of this section that withholding is to stop; or
(
2
) The date on which the payor receives a copy of the written certification provided to the payee by the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (g) of this section that withholding is to stop.
(B)
Acceleration of stop date.
A payor may choose to stop withholding at any time during the 30-day period described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section.
(ii)
When underreporting is corrected or bona fide dispute exists.
In the case of a determination under paragraph (g)(3) (ii) or (iv) of this section that the underreporting has been corrected or that a bona fide dispute exists, the stop date occurs on the first day of January (immediately following a period of at least twelve months ending on October 15 of any calendar year in which the determination has been made) or if later, the stop date determined under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Dormant accounts.
The requirement that a payor withhold under this paragraph (e) on reportable interest or dividend payments made with respect to an account terminates no later than the close of the third calendar year ending after the later of—
(i) The date that the most recent reportable interest or dividend payment was made with respect to that account; or
(ii) The date that the payor received notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(f)
Notice to payees from the Internal Revenue Service
—(1)
Notice period.
After the Internal Revenue Service determines under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that payee underreporting exists, the Internal Revenue Service will mail to the payee at least four notices over a period of at least 120 days (the notice period) before payors will be notified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting. The notices may be accompanied by, or incorporated in, other notices provided to the payee by the Internal Revenue Service.
(2)
Payee subject to backup withholding.
After the Internal Revenue Service provides the notices described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will send notices to payors under paragraph (c)(1) of this section unless—
(i) A payee obtains a determination under paragraph (g) of this section; or
(ii) In the case of a payee who has filed a tax return, the Internal Revenue Service has not assessed the deficiency attributable to the underreporting.
(3)
Disclosure of names of payors and brokers.
Pursuant to section 3406(c)(5) the Internal Revenue Service may require a payee subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting to disclose the names of all the payee's payors of reportable interest or dividend payments and the names of all of the brokers with whom the payee has accounts which may involve reportable interest or dividend payments. To the extent required in the request from the Internal Revenue Service, the payee must also provide the payee's account numbers and other information necessary to identify the payee's accounts.
(4)
Backup withholding certification.
After a payee receives a final notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the payee is not permitted to certify to any payor or broker, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is not subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C), until the payee receives the certification from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (g) of this section advising the payee that the payee is no longer subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). A final notice will contain the information described in this paragraph (f)(4).
See sections 6682 and 7205(b) for civil and criminal penalties for making a false certification.
(g)
Determination by the Internal Revenue Service that backup withholding should not start or should be stopped
—(1)
In general.
A payee may prevent withholding due to notified payee underreporting from starting, or stop the withholding once it has started, by requesting and receiving a determination from the Internal Revenue Service under one or more of the provisions of paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Following its review of a request for a determination under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will either make the determination or provide the payee with a written report informing the payee that the request for determination is being denied and the reasons for the denial. If a determination is made during the notice period (as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section), the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting with respect to any taxable year for which a determination was made. If a determination is made after the notice period, the Internal Revenue Service will, at the time prescribed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, provide written certification to a payee that withholding is to stop, and will notify payors who were contacted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section to stop withholding. A broker who (in its capacity as payor) under this paragraph (g)(1) receives a notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a copy of the certification provided to a payee by the Internal Revenue Service is not required to provide a corresponding notice to any payors whom the broker has previously notified under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Date notice to stop backup withholding will be provided
—(i)
Underreporting corrected or bona fide dispute.
If the Internal Revenue Service makes a determination under paragraph (g)(3) (ii) or (iv) of this section during the 12-month period ending on October 15 of any calendar year (as described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section), the Internal Revenue Service will provide the certification and the notices described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section no later than December 1 of that calendar year.
(ii)
No underreporting or undue hardship.
If the Internal Revenue Service makes a determination under paragraph (g)(3)(i) or (iii) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will provide the notices described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section no later than the 45th day after the day on which the Internal Revenue Service makes its determination.
(3)
Grounds for determination.
The Internal Revenue Service will make a determination that withholding due to notified payee underreporting should not start or should stop once it has started if the payee—
(i) Shows that there was no payee underreporting (as provided in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) for each taxable year with respect to which the Internal Revenue Service determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that there was payee underreporting;
(ii) Corrects any payee underreporting (as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section) for each taxable year with respect to which the Internal Revenue Service determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that there was payee underreporting;
(iii) Shows that withholding will cause or is causing an undue hardship (as defined in paragraph (g)(6) of this section) and that it is unlikely that the payee will underreport interest or dividend payments again; or
(iv) Shows that a bona fide dispute exists regarding whether any underreporting has occurred (as provided in paragraph (g)(7) of this section) for each taxable year with respect to which the Internal Revenue Service determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that there was payee underreporting.
(4)
No underreporting.
A payee may show that no underreporting of reportable interest or dividends payments exists by presenting—
(i) Receipts or other satisfactory documentation to the Internal Revenue Service showing that all taxes relating to the payments were reported; or
(ii) Evidence showing that the payee did not have to file a return for the taxable year in question (e.g., because
the payee did not make enough income) or that the underreporting determination was based upon a factual, clerical, or other error.
(5)
Correcting any payee underreporting
—(i)
Before issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency.
Before a statutory notice of deficiency is issued to a payee pursuant to section 6212, the payee may correct underreporting—
(A) By filing a return if one was not previously filed and including the unreported interest and dividends thereon;
(B) By filing an amended return in the event a return was filed and including the unreported interest and dividends thereon; or
(C) By consenting to the additional assessment according to applicable notices and forms sent to the payee by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the underreporting, and paying taxes, penalties, and interest due with respect to any underreported interest or dividend payments.
(ii)
After issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency.
After a statutory notice of deficiency is issued to a payee—
(A) The payee may correct underreporting at any time, by filing a return if one was not previously filed and paying the entire deficiency and any other taxes including penalties and interest attributable to any payee underreporting of interest or dividend payments; or
(B) The payee may correct underreporting after the mailing of the statutory notice of deficiency but before the expiration of the 90-day or 150-day period described in section 6213(a) or, if a petition is filed with the United States Tax Court, before the decision of the Tax Court is final, by making a remittance to the Internal Revenue Service of the amounts described in paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(A) of this section. The payee must specifically designate in writing that the remittance is a deposit in the nature of a cash bond.
(iii)
Special rules.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, the payee will not be deemed to have corrected the payee underreporting under paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) of this section after the remittance is returned to the payee in the manner described in any applicable administrative procedure. For further guidance on a deposit in the nature of a cash bond, see subparagraph 2 of section 4.01 of Rev. Proc. 84-58 (1984-2 C.B. 501). (See § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.) Once the remittance is returned to the payee, the rules of this section will apply. If the Internal Revenue Service previously contacted payors of the payee to start withholding with respect to the notified payee underreporting, however, the Internal Revenue Service will recontact those payors to start withholding under paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to the payee underreporting without regard to paragraph (f) of this section.
(6)
Undue hardship
—(i)
In general.
A determination of undue hardship will be based on the overall impact to the payee of having reportable interest or dividend payments withheld at a 31 percent rate under section 3406. In addition, a determination of undue hardship will be made only if the Internal Revenue Service concludes that it is unlikely that any payee underreporting will occur again.
(ii)
Factors.
Factors that will be considered in determining whether withholding causes undue hardship include, but are not limited to, the following—
(A) Whether estimated tax payments, and other credits for current tax liabilities, or amounts withheld on employee wages or pensions, in addition to withholding under section 3406, would cause significant overwithholding;
(B) The payee's health, including the payee's ability to pay foreseeable medical expenses;
(C) The extent of the payee's reliance on interest and dividend payments to meet necessary living expenses and the existence, if any, of other sources of income;
(D) Whether other income of the payee is limited or fixed
(e.g., social security, pension, and unearned income);
(E) The payee's ability to sell or liquidate stocks, bonds, bank accounts, trust accounts, or other assets, and the consequences of doing so;
(F) Whether the payee reported and timely paid the most recent year's tax liability, including interest and dividend income; and
(G) Whether the payee has filed a bankruptcy petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court.
(7)
Bona fide dispute.
The Internal Revenue Service may make a determination under this paragraph (g)(7) if there is a dispute between the payee and the Internal Revenue Service on a question of fact or law that is material to a determination under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section and, based upon all the facts and circumstances, the Internal Revenue Service finds that the dispute is asserted in good faith by the payee and there is a reasonable basis for the payee's position.
(h)
Payees filing a joint return
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, if payee underreporting is found to exist with respect to a joint return, then the provisions of this section apply to both payees (i.e., the husband and wife). As a result, both payees are subject to withholding on accounts in their individual names as well as accounts in their joint names. Either or both payees may satisfy the criteria for a determination that no payee underreporting exists, that the underreporting has been corrected, or that a bona fide dispute exists (as provided in paragraph (g)(3) (i), (ii), or (iv) of this section). Both payees, however, must satisfy the criteria for a determination that withholding will cause or is causing undue hardship (as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section).
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Innocent spouse.
A spouse who files a joint return may obtain a determination that withholding should stop or not start with respect to payments made to his or her individual accounts, if the spouse shows that—
(A) He or she did not underreport income because he or she is a spouse described in section 6013(e), i.e., innocent spouse; or
(B) There is a bona fide dispute regarding whether he or she is an innocent spouse and hence did not underreport income.
(ii)
Divorced or legally separated payee.
A payee who, at the time of the request for a determination under paragraph (g) of this section, is divorced or separated under State law may obtain a determination that undue hardship exists (or would exist) under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section with respect to reportable interest or dividend payments made to his or her individual accounts if the divorced or legally separated payee satisfies the criteria for a determination under paragraph (g)(6) of this section.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Penalties.
For the application of penalties related to this section, see sections 6682 and 7205(b).
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66119, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 31.3406(d)-1
Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number.
(a)
Requirement to backup withhold.
Withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A) applies to a reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)) if the payee does not furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor in the manner required by this section. The period for which withholding is required is described in § 31.3406(e)-1(b). See § 31.3406(d)-3(a) and (b) for special rules when an account is established directly with, or an instrument is acquired directly from, the payor by electronic transmission or by mail, or an instrument is sold through a broker by electronic transmission or by mail. See § 31.3406(d)-4 for special rules applicable to readily tradable instruments acquired through a broker. See § 31.3406(h)-3(e) for the rules on when a payor may rely on a Form W-9. See also § 31.3406(g)-3 for rules regarding a payee awaiting receipt of a taxpayer identification number. See the applicable information reporting sections and section 6109 and the regulations thereunder to determine whose taxpayer identification number should be provided.
(b)
Reportable interest or dividend account
—(1)
Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number with respect to a pre-1984 account or instrument.
A payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor with respect to any obligation, deposit, certificate, share, membership, contract, investment, account, or other relationship or instrument established or acquired on or before December 31, 1983 (a pre-1984 account) and with respect to which the payor makes a reportable interest or dividend payment (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)). The
manner of determining whether an account or an instrument is a pre-1984 account is described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The payee of a pre-1984 account may furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor orally or in writing. The payee is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number is correct.
(2)
Determination of pre-1984 account or instrument
—(i)
In general.
An account that is in existence before January 1, 1984, will be considered a pre-1984 account, regardless of whether additional deposits are made to the account on or after January 1, 1984. An account established as an expansion of a credit union prime account in existence prior to January 1, 1984, constitutes a pre-1984 account. If funds taken from one account in existence prior to January 1, 1984, are used to create a new account on or after that date, however, the new account does not constitute a pre-1984 account except as provided in the preceding sentence. An instrument acquired prior to January 1, 1984, is a pre-1984 account. Regardless of when an instrument was acquired, if it is negotiated in a window transaction as defined in § 31.3406(b)(2)-3(b), it is treated as an instrument acquired after December 31, 1983. An obligation in bearer form and subject to reporting under section 6045, whenever acquired, is not a pre-1984 account. Any instrument, whenever acquired, that is held in a brokerage account is considered a pre-1984 account if the brokerage account is not a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section). If shares of a corporation are held before January 1, 1984 (or considered held before that date by operation of this paragraph (b)(2)), and additional shares are acquired by the holder, irrespective of whether the shares are received by reason of a stock dividend, investing new cash, or otherwise, the new shares, in the discretion of the payor, may be considered a pre-1984 account. In the case of a qualified employee trust that distributes instruments in kind, any instrument distributed from the trust is considered a pre-1984 account with respect to employees who were participants in the trust before 1984. Similarly, when a payor offers participants in a plan the opportunity to purchase stock of the payor after a specified time, using the money that the payee invested during that period of time, the stock so purchased after December 31, 1983, is considered a pre-1984 account with respect to participants in the plan who either owned shares or invested money in the plan before January 1, 1984.
(ii)
Account or instrument automatically acquired on the maturity or termination of an account.
When an account is opened, or an instrument is acquired, automatically on the maturity or termination of an account that was in existence or an instrument that was held before January 1, 1984 (or considered to have been in existence or held before that date by operation of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)), without the participation of the payee, the new account or instrument, in the discretion of the payor, may be considered a pre-1984 account. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a payee is not considered to have participated in the acquisition of the new account or instrument solely because the payee failed to exercise a right to withdraw funds at the maturity or termination of the old account or instrument.
(iii)
Insurance policies.
In the case of insurance policies in effect on December 31, 1983, the election of a dividend accumulation option pursuant to which interest is paid (as defined in § 1.6049-5(a)(4) of this chapter), or the creation of an account in which proceeds of a policy are held for the policy beneficiary, may, in the payor's discretion, be treated as a pre-1984 account.
(iv)
Acquisitions of accounts and instruments
—(A)
Pre-1984 or post-1983 status known.
If a payor acquires accounts or instruments of another payor (including through a tax-free reorganization under section 368), the acquiring payor must treat the persons specified in this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) as having the same requirement to furnish a taxpayer identification number in the manner required under this paragraph (b) to the acquiring payor for information reporting, withholding, and related tax provisions as existed with respect to the payor whose accounts or instruments were acquired. Persons specified in this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A)
are persons who held accounts or instruments in the other payor immediately before the acquisition and who receive an account or instrument in the acquiring payor immediately after the acquisition.
(B)
Pre-1984 or post-1983 status unknown.
If the acquiring payor, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, is unable to identify from the business records of the other payor whether any or all of the accounts or instruments of the persons specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section are pre-1984 (or post-1983) accounts or instruments, then the acquiring payor may treat these unidentified accounts or instruments as pre-1984 accounts or instruments.
(C)
Cross reference.
See § 31.3406(g)-2(g) for the limited exception from withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A) on accounts or instruments described in paragraphs (b)(2)(iv) (A) and (B) of this section for which the payor does not have a taxpayer identification number.
(3)
Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number with respect to an account or instrument that is not a pre-1984 account.
A payee who receives reportable interest or dividend payments (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)) from a payor must certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number the payee furnishes to the payor is the payee's correct taxpayer identification number. The payee must make the certification only with respect to an account or instrument that is not a pre-1984 account (as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). See § 31.3406(h)-3 for a description of the certificate on which the certification must be made. See § 31.3406(d)-2 for the requirement that the payee must certify under penalties of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting. See § 31.3406(d)-3(a) with respect to an account established directly with, or an instrument acquired directly from, the payor by electronic transmission or by mail. See § 31.3406(d)-4 for the rules applicable to readily tradable instruments acquired through a broker.
(4)
Special rule with respect to the acquisition of a readily tradable instrument in a transaction between certain parties acting without the assistance of a broker.
If a payee, at any time, acquires a readily tradable instrument without the assistance of a broker, and no party to the acquisition is a broker or an agent of the payor, the payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor prior to the time reportable payments are made on the instrument. The payee is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the number is correct. See § 31.3406(d)-2 for the rule that a payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting with respect to a readily tradable instrument acquired in the manner described in this paragraph (b)(4). A broker is considered to provide assistance in the acquisition of an instrument if the person effecting the acquisition would be required to make an information return under section 6045 if such person were to sell the instrument. See § 31.3406(d)-4 for rules relating to an acquisition of a readily tradable instrument when a broker is involved.
(c)
Brokerage account
—(1)
Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number with respect to a brokerage relationship that is not a post-1983 brokerage account
—(i)
In general.
With respect to any instrument, investment, or deposit made through a brokerage account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account, a payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the broker either orally or in writing. The payee is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number is correct. See paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for the rule that any instrument, whenever acquired, that is held in a brokerage account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account, is considered held in an account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account. For example, in 1983 a payee established and acquired a readily tradable instrument from a brokerage account; no activity took place through that account until the payee purchased a readily tradable instrument in 1995. That readily tradable instrument is not held in a post-1983 brokerage account; therefore, the payee need not certify under penalties of perjury that the payee's taxpayer identification number is correct.
(ii)
Definition of a brokerage account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account.
A brokerage account that was established by a payee before January 1, 1984, through which during 1983 the broker either bought or sold securities for the payee or held securities on behalf of the payee as a nominee (i.e., in street name), is an account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account.
(2)
Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number with respect to a post-1983 brokerage account
—(i)
In general.
With respect to a post-1983 brokerage account, the payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the broker and certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number furnished is correct, except as provided in § 31.3406(d)-3(b).
(ii)
Definition of a post-1983 brokerage account.
A brokerage account established after December 31, 1983 (or before January 1, 1984, through which during 1983 the broker neither bought nor sold securities nor held securities on behalf of the payee as a nominee (i.e., in street name)), is a post-1983 brokerage account.
(d)
Rents, commissions, nonemployee compensation, certain fishing boat operators, and payment card and third party network transactions, etc.—Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number.
For accounts, contracts, or relationships subject to information reporting under section 6041 (relating to information reporting at source on rents, royalties, salaries, etc.), section 6041A(a) (relating to information reporting of payments for nonemployee services), section 6050A (relating to information reporting by certain fishing boat operators), section 6050N (relating to information reporting of payments of royalties), or section 6050W (relating to information reporting for payment card and third party network transactions), the payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor either orally or in writing. Except as provided in § 31.3406(d)-5, the payee is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number is correct regardless of when the account, contract, or relationship is established.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66123, Dec. 21, 1995, as amended by T.D. 9496, 75 FR 49835, Aug. 16, 2010]
§ 31.3406(d)-2
Payee certification failure.
(a)
Requirement to backup withhold.
Withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(D) applies to a reportable interest or dividend payment (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)) if, and only if, the payee fails to certify to the payor, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C). The period for which withholding applies is described in § 31.3406(e)-1(e). See § 31.3406(d)-3(a) for special rules when an account is established directly with, or an instrument is acquired directly from, the payor by electronic transmission or by mail. See § 31.3406(c)-1(c)(3)(iv) for rules with respect to a payor's reliance on a payee certification for a new account following notified payee underreporting. See § 31.3406(d)-4 for special rules relating to the acquisition of a readily tradable instrument through a broker. The certificate on which the certification should be made is described in § 31.3406(h)-3.
(b)
Exceptions.
Withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(D) and paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to reportable interest or dividend payments (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)) made—
(1) With respect to a pre-1984 account (as defined in § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(1));
(2) In a window transaction (as defined in § 31.3406(b)(2)-3(b));
(3) With respect to a readily tradable instrument described in § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(2)(iv) or § 31.3406(d)-4(a)(3); or
(4) During the period and with respect to an account or readily tradable instrument described in § 31.3406(d)-3.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66125, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 31.3406(d)-3
Special 30-day rules for certain reportable payments.
(a)
Accounts or readily tradable instruments acquired directly from the payor (including a broker who holds an instrument in street name) by electronic transmission or by mail.
In the case of an account established directly with, or a
readily tradable instrument acquired directly from, the payor by means of electronic transmission (i.e., telephone or wire instruction) or by mail, the payor may permit the payee to furnish the certifications required in § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(3) (relating to certification that the payee's taxpayer identification number is correct) and § 31.3406(d)-2 (relating to certification of notified payee underreporting) within 30 days after the establishment or acquisition without subjecting the account to withholding during the 30 days. The preceding sentence applies only if the payee furnishes a taxpayer identification number to the payor at the time of the establishment or acquisition, and the payee does not withdraw more than 69 percent of a reportable interest or dividend payment before the certifications are received within the 30 days. If the payee does not provide the required certifications within 30 days of the establishment or acquisition, the payor must withhold 31 percent of any reportable interest or dividend payments made to the account after its acquisition. For purposes of this section, an account or instrument is considered acquired directly from the payor if the instrument was acquired by the payee without the assistance of a broker or the instrument was acquired directly from a broker who holds the instrument as nominee for the payee (i.e., in street name) and who is considered a payor under § 31.3406(a)-2. For payments made after December 31, 1998, see § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter for the application of a 90-day grace period in lieu of the 30-day grace period described in this paragraph (a) if, at the beginning of the 90-day grace period, certain conditions are satisfied. If the grace period provisions of § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) or § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv) of this chapter are applied with respect to a new account, the grace period provisions of this paragraph (a) shall not apply to that account.
(b)
Sale of an instrument for a customer by electronic transmission or by mail.
The special rules set forth in paragraph (a) of this section apply comparably with respect to certification of the taxpayer identification number for the sale of an instrument under section 6045 (as described in § 31.3406(b)(3)-2) through a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(c)(2)) for a customer by electronic transmission or by mail. However, the 30-day rules may apply only if the payee furnishes the payee's taxpayer identification number before the sale occurs. For purposes of applying the 30-day rules under this paragraph (b), a payee's reinvestment of the gross proceeds of the sale into other instruments constitutes a withdrawal.
(c)
Application to foreign payees.
The rules of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section also apply to a payee from whom the payor is required to obtain a Form W-8 (or an acceptable substitute) or other evidence of foreign status (pursuant to relevant regulations under an applicable Internal Revenue Code section without regard to the requirement to furnish a taxpayer identifying number, and the certifications described in §§ 31.3406(d)-1(b)(3) and 31.3406(d)-2), provided the payee represents orally or otherwise, before or at the time of the acquisition or sale of the instrument or the establishment of the account, that the payee is not a United States citizen or resident. The 30-day rules described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may apply only if the payee does not qualify for, or the payor does not apply, the 90-day grace period described in § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) or § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv) of this chapter.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66125, Dec. 21, 1995, as amended by T.D. 8734, 62 FR 53493, Oct. 14, 1997]
§ 31.3406(d)-4
Special rules for readily tradable instruments acquired through a broker.
(a)
Readily tradable instruments acquired through post-1983 brokerage accounts with a broker who is not a payor
—(1)
In general.
If a readily tradable instrument is acquired through a post-1983 brokerage account (as defined in § 31.3406(d)-1(c)(2)) and the broker is not a broker holding a security (including stock) for a customer in street name, the broker must—
(i) Obtain once with respect to each account the certifications described in § 31.3406(d)-2(a) and § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(3) and (c)(2) from the payee (relating to
certification regarding payee underreporting and taxpayer identification number, respectively);
(ii) Furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor; and
(iii) Notify the payor to impose withholding if the payee fails to make either of the required certifications to the broker or if the broker has been notified by the Internal Revenue Service before the acquisition of the instrument that the payee is subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C) or that the payee is subject to withholding because the payee's taxpayer identification number is incorrect under section 3406(a)(1)(B) (as described in § 31.3406(d)-5).
(2)
Additional requirements.
The broker must give the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section to the payor with the transfer instructions for the acquisition (including account registration instructions transmitted by a broker in the case of acquisitions of shares in a mutual fund). A notice including the information described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section fulfills the broker's requirement to give notice to the payor. Once the broker transmits the transfer instructions containing the information required by this section, the broker has no further responsibility to obtain a missing taxpayer identification number or missing certification or to provide additional notices to the payee or payor with respect to the acquisition of the instrument. Upon receiving the notice from a broker, the payor must impose withholding on the account pursuant to § 31.3406(a)-1.
(3)
Transactions entered into through a brokerage account that is not a post-1983 brokerage account.
If a broker acquires readily tradable instruments for a payee through an account (with the broker) that is not a post-1983 brokerage account (as defined in § 31.3406(d)-1(c)(1)), and the broker is not the payor of the instruments, the broker must furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor. In addition, if the broker has been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that the payee is subject to withholding under section 3406 either because of an incorrect taxpayer identification number or due to notified payee underreporting as described in section 3406(a)(1) (B) or (C), respectively, the broker must notify the payor of the instrument to impose withholding with respect to that payee and transmit the information in the manner described in this paragraph (a). After a payor receives a notice from a broker pursuant to section 3406(d)(2)(B) and this paragraph (a), the payor must impose withholding on any accounts of the payee paying reportable interest or dividends as defined in section 3406(b)(2) in accordance with § 31.3406(a)-1.
(4)
Payor must notify payee
—(i)
Failure to provide certifications.
If a payor is notified by a broker, as required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that a payee is subject to withholding because the payee failed to provide the certifications, as described in § 31.3406(d)-2(a) and § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(3) and (c)(2), and the payor has not received the certifications from the payee, then the payor must notify the payee that withholding has started (or will start) no later than 15 days after the payor makes the first payment to the payee that is subject to withholding under section 3406. A notice that contains the information described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section satisfies the payor's requirement to give notice to the payee. If the broker notifies the payor that the payee failed to make a required certification and the payor has received the certification from the payee, the payor may disregard the notice from the broker.
(ii)
Notified payee underreporting and incorrect taxpayer identification number.
The payor must notify the payee under this section if the Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies the payor to withhold either because of an incorrect taxpayer identification number under section 3406(a)(1)(B) (as described in § 31.3406(d)-5) or due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C) (as described in § 31.3406(c)-1). If a payor is notified by the Internal Revenue Service or a broker with respect to a readily tradable instrument, the payor may not ignore the notice even if the payee previously provided the payee's taxpayer identification number under penalties of perjury to
the payor and even if the payee certified to the payor that the payee is not subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting. See § 31.3406(d)-5(c) (1) and (2) and (f)(2) for notice requirements under section 3406(a)(1)(B) due to an incorrect taxpayer identification number. See § 31.3406(c)-1(c)(2) for notice requirements under section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to notified payee underreporting.
(b)
Notices
—(1)
Form of notice by broker to payor.
A broker who is required under paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (2) of this section to notify the payor with respect to a readily tradable instrument may notify the payor in connection with the transfer instructions by means of magnetic media, machine readable document, or any other medium, provided that the notice includes the following information—
(i) The payee's name, address, and taxpayer identification number (if provided to the broker); and
(ii) A statement that the payee is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D) of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever section applies; and
(iii) When applicable, a statement that the broker was notified by the Internal Revenue Service that the payee is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(B) or (C).
(2)
Form of notice by payor to payee.
A payor who is required to notify a payee that the payee is subject to withholding must provide notice that is substantially similar to the following—
(i) For a notification concerning a failure to provide a taxpayer identification number in the required manner under section 3406(a)(1)(A) or a failure to make the following certification described in section 3406(a)(1)(D):
Recently, you purchased (identify security acquired). Because of the existence of one or more of the following conditions, payments of interest, dividends, and other reportable amounts that are made to you will be subject to withholding of tax at a 31 percent rate: (specify the condition or conditions, described below, that are applicable)
(1) You failed to provide a taxpayer identification number, or failed to provide this number under penalties of perjury, in connection with the purchase of the acquired security. (An individual's taxpayer identification number is his or her social security number.)
(2) You failed to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting as required under section 3406(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.
If condition (1) applies, you may stop withholding by providing your taxpayer identification number on the enclosed Form W-9, signing the form, and returning it to us. If you do not have a taxpayer identification number, but have applied (or will soon apply) for one, you may so indicate on the Form W-9. Withholding may apply during the 60-day period you are waiting for your taxpayer identification number. You must provide us with your taxpayer identification number promptly after you receive it in order to avoid withholding after the end of the 60-day period or to stop withholding if it has already begun. Certain persons, described on the enclosed Form W-9, are exempt from withholding. Follow the instructions on that form if applicable to you.
If condition (2) applies, you may stop withholding by certifying on the enclosed Form W-9 that you are not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting, signing the form, and returning it to us.
If more than one condition applies, you must remove all applicable conditions to stop withholding.
Please address any questions concerning this notice to: [Insert payor identifying information].
(Do not address questions to the broker who purchased the securities for you.)
(ii) For the form of the notice concerning imposition of withholding due to an incorrect taxpayer identification number, see § 31.3406(d)-5 (d)(2) and (g)(2).
(iii) For the form of the notice concerning the imposition of withholding due to notified payee underreporting, see § 31.3406(c)-1(d)(2).
(c)
Payor's reliance on information from broker
—(1)
In general.
A payor of an instrument acquired by a payee through a broker may rely on the information that the payor receives from the broker pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(2)
Amount subject to backup withholding.
The payor is required to withhold under section 3406 depending on the payor's customary method of making payment on an instrument or instruments owned by a payee. If it is the practice of a payor to combine in one account all readily tradable instruments of the same issue owned by a
payee and if only certain of those instruments are subject to withholding, the payor must withhold on the aggregate payment made with respect to all the instruments in the account. Otherwise, the payor must withhold on the payment made on the instrument or instruments with respect to which the payee is subject to withholding.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66125, Dec. 21, 1995; 61 FR 11307, Mar. 20, 1996; 61 FR 12135, Mar. 25, 1996; T.D. 9010, 67 FR 48760, July 26, 2002]
§ 31.3406(d)-5
Backup withholding when the Service or a broker notifies the payor to withhold because the payee's taxpayer identification number is incorrect.
(a)
Overview.
Backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(B) applies to any reportable payment made with respect to an account of a payee if the Internal Revenue Service or a broker notifies a payor under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section that the payee's name and taxpayer identification number combination (name/TIN combination) is incorrect and the payor is required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to identify that account as having the same name/TIN combination. After receiving a notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and identifying an account as having the incorrect name/TIN combination under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the payor must notify the payee in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. In addition, under paragraph (e) of this section, the payor must backup withhold on all reportable payments made to such account after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the payor receives the notice and on or before the close of the 30th calendar day after the date that the payor receives from the payee the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section. Under paragraph (g) of this section, if a payor receives 2 notices from the Internal Revenue Service or broker within 3 calendar years with respect to a payee's account, the payor must notify the payee in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) (rather than paragraph (d)) of this section. In addition, the payor must backup withhold on all reportable payments made with respect to the account after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the payor receives the second notice and on or before the 30th calendar day after the date that the payor receives notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination for the account. Paragraph (h) of this section requires a payor to use a corrected name/TIN combination on subsequent information returns.
(b)
Definitions and special rules

Notice regarding an incorrect name/TIN combination
—(1)
In general.
If the Internal Revenue Service notifies a payor that a payee's name/TIN combination is incorrect and that the payor must commence backup withholding as required on reportable payments made with respect to accounts of the payee with the same name/TIN combination, the payor must—

(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, notify the payee and backup withhold on reportable payments made to the account or accounts under the rules of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section.
This paragraph (c)(1) also applies if the payor receives notice from a broker under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Additional requirements for payors that are also brokers
—(i)
In general.
A broker must notify the payor of an instrument of the information required under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if—
(A) The broker (in its capacity as a payor) receives a notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that a payee's name/TIN combination is incorrect and is required to identify an account of the payee pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section as having the name/TIN combination;
(B) The payee acquires through the same account with the broker a readily tradable instrument with respect to which the broker is not the payor; and
(C) The acquisition of such instrument occurs after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the broker receives that notice (or on any earlier date that the broker chooses to begin applying this paragraph (c)(2)).
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(i), with respect to notices under paragraph (c)(1) of this section received on or after September 1, 1992, an acquisition includes a transfer of an instrument out of street name into the name of the registered owner,
i.e.,
the payee.
(ii)
Required information.
The information required to be provided under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) is:
(A) The fact that the broker was notified by the Internal Revenue Service that the payee furnished an incorrect name/TIN combination;
(B) The incorrect name/TIN combination; and
(C) The fact that the named payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(B).
The broker is required to provide this information to the payor of the instrument in connection with the transfer instructions for the acquisition.
(iii)
Termination of obligation to provide information.
The obligation of a broker to provide information to payors under this paragraph (c)(2) terminates simultaneously with the termination of the broker's obligation to backup withhold (in its capacity as payor) on reportable payments to the account.
(3)
Payor identification of the account or accounts of the payee that have the incorrect taxpayer identification number
—(i)
In general.
If an account number or designation is provided in the notice received under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the payor need only identify any account or accounts corresponding to that number or designation that has the same name/TIN combination provided in the notice. If no account number or designation is provided in the notice received under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the payor must identify, using reasonable care, all accounts of the payee having the same name/TIN combination provided in the notice. If a payor receives notice from a broker under paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to the acquisition of a readily tradable instrument, the payor is not required to identify any other account of the payee.
(ii)
Reasonable care where no account number or designation is provided.
A payor who satisfies the following two-part facts-and-circumstances test will be considered to have exercised reasonable care for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3).
(A) Part one of the test is satisfied if a payor searches for accounts of the
payee on the computer or other recordkeeping system that the payor can reasonably associate with the information return that generated the notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For example, a payor who maintains separate computer or recordkeeping systems for different product lines will have identified and used the appropriate system if the payor searches for accounts of the payee on the computer or recordkeeping system that contains the product line for the type of payments reported on the information return. A payor with the same product line on several nonintegrated computer or record systems will have identified and used the appropriate system if the payor searches for accounts of the payee on any computer or record system that the payor otherwise can reasonably associate with the information return.
(B) Part two of the test is satisfied if the payor inputs the name/TIN combination provided on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section into the system that is described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. If the system of a payor cannot utilize the name/TIN combination, the payor must input appropriate data or criteria, as determined by the capability of the payor's computer or recordkeeping system.
(iii)
No identification if error is caused by payor.
A payor may treat an account as not having the incorrect name/TIN combination if the error resulted because the name or taxpayer identification number on such account is not the name or taxpayer identification number that was provided to the payor. This may occur, for example, where a payor transposes numbers in the taxpayer identification number when incorporating it into the payor's business records.
(4)
Special rules for joint accounts
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a joint account, the relevant name/TIN combination for purposes of this section is the name/TIN combination used for information reporting purposes.
(ii)
Transitional rule.
With respect to notices received under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section prior to September 1, 1993, a payor may treat the name/TIN combination of the first person on a joint account as the relevant name/TIN combination, unless that person is an exempt foreign person and the account registration includes names of persons who are not foreign persons.
(iii)
Optional rule where names are switched.
A payor may backup withhold under this section on reportable payments made to a joint account if the order of the names (or taxpayer identification numbers) on the account is merely changed subsequent to receipt of a notice under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, provided that the name of the person to which the incorrect name/TIN combination originally applies remains on the account.
(5)
Date of receipt.
For purposes of this section, the date set forth on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or broker under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section is considered to be the date of receipt of the notice by the payor. However, if the payor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service that the date of actual receipt of the notice is later than the date on the notice, the actual date of receipt is controlling.
(d)
Notice from payors of backup withholding due to an incorrect name/TIN combination
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if a payor receives notice under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and is required to identify an account as having the incorrect name/TIN combination under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the payor must send a copy of the notice (or an acceptable substitute notice) to the payee of the account in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Procedures
—(i)
In general.
The notice that a payor must send to a payee under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must comply with such procedural requirements as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin such as to form and manner of delivery. A payor must send the notice to the payee within 15 business days after the date that the payor receives the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or a broker under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
(ii)
Two or more notices for an account for the same year or received in the same year.
A payor who receives, under the
same payor taxpayer identification number, two or more notices under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to the same payee's account for the same year, or in the same calendar year, need only send one notice to the payee under this section.
(e)
Period during which backup withholding is required due to notification of an incorrect name/TIN combination
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if a payor receives a notice under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and is required to identify an account as having the same name/TIN combination under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the payor must impose backup withholding on all reportable payments made with respect to the account after the close of the 30th business day after the date the payor receives that notice and on or before the close of the 30th calendar day after the day the payor receives from the payee the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section.
(2)
Grace periods
—(i)
Starting backup withholding.
A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to begin backup withholding under this paragraph (e) at any time during the 30-business-day period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Stopping backup withholding.
A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to stop backup withholding under this paragraph (e) at any time within 30 calendar days after the payor receives from the payee the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section.
(3)
Dormant accounts.
The requirement that a payor backup withhold under this paragraph (e) on reportable payments made with respect to an account terminates no later than the close of the third calendar year ending after the later of—
(i) The date that the last reportable payment was made to that account; or
(ii) The date that the payor received the notice under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
(f)
Manner required for payee to furnish certified taxpayer identification number.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, in order to prevent backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section from starting, or to stop it once it has begun, a payee with respect to whom the payor has been notified under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) that the payee's name/TIN combination is incorrect is required on Form W-9 (or an acceptable substitute form) to—
(i) Provide the payee's name and taxpayer identification number; and
(ii) Certify, under penalties of perjury, that the taxpayer identification number being provided is correct.
(2) The certification must be made even if the account is a pre-1984 account and even if the payment to the account is a reportable payment other than interest, dividends, patronage dividends, original issue discount, or proceeds of a sale of a security or commodity. In order to prevent backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section from starting or to stop it once it has begun, a payee is not required to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is not subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C). With respect to notices received under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section on or after September 1, 1993, the requirements of this paragraph (f) are not satisfied if a payee provides only an awaiting TIN certification. As a result, a payor must not fail to begin backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section solely because the payee provided an awaiting TIN certification, or stop it once it has begun solely because the payee provided an awaiting TIN certification.
(g)
Receipt of two notices within a 3-year period
—(1)
In general.
If a payor receives notification under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section twice within 3 calendar years, and in each case the payor is required to identify the same account as having the incorrect name/TIN combination, the payor must—
(i) Disregard any future certifications (described in paragraph (f) of this section) furnished by the payee with respect to the account until the payor receives notice from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination under paragraph (g)(5) of this section;
(ii) Send the notice described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section to the payee (and not the notice required under paragraph (d) of this section) within 15 business days after the date that the payor receives the second notice; and
(iii) Impose backup withholding on the account for the period described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
The payor must maintain sufficient records to determine whether the payor has received notices under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section twice within 3 calendar years with respect to the same account.
(2)
Notice to payee who has provided two incorrect name/TIN combinations within 3 calendar years.
The notice to the payee required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section must comply with such procedural requirements as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin such as to form and manner of delivery.
(3)
Period during which backup withholding is required due to a second notice of an incorrect name/taxpayer identification combination within 3 calendar years
—(i)
In general.
If paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies, the payor must backup withhold on all reportable payments made with respect to the account of the payee after the close of the 30th business day after the date that the payor receives the second notice under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section and on or before the close of the 30th calendar day after the date that the payor receives notice from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination under paragraph (g)(5) of this section for the account. However, a payor may choose not to commence backup withholding under this paragraph (g) until January 1, 1992.
(ii)
Grace periods
—(A)
Starting backup withholding.
A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to begin backup withholding under this paragraph (g) at any time during the 30-business-day period described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.
(B)
Stopping backup withholding.
A payor may, on an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to stop backup withholding under this paragraph (g) at any time within 30 calendar days after the date the payor receives notice from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination under paragraph (g)(5) of this section for the account.
(iii)
Dormant accounts.
The requirement that a payor backup withhold under this paragraph (g) on reportable payments made with respect to an account terminates no later than the close of the third calendar year ending after the later of—
(A) The date that the last reportable payment was made to that account; or
(B) The date that the payor received the second notice under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section.
(4)
Receipt of two notices for the same year or in the same calendar year.
A payor who receives, under the same payor taxpayer identification number, two or more notices under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to the same payee's account for the same year, or in the same calendar year, must treat such notices as one notice for purposes of this paragraph (g).
(5)
Notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination.
The Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) will notify a payor after it validates a name/TIN combination that the payee provides for an account to which paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies. Notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (g)(5) only if it complies with such procedural requirements as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin such as to form and manner of delivery. In order to obtain notification from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination for an account, a payee who receives notice from a payor under paragraph (g)(2) of this section should follow such procedures as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(h)
Payor must use newly provided certified number.
If a payor receives a certification under paragraph (f) of this section or a notification under paragraph (g)(5) of this section for an account, the payor must use the name/TIN combination provided on such certification or notification on information returns for the account for which the due date (without regard to extensions) is more than 30 calendar days after the date that the payor receives the certification or notification. A payor who uses that name/TIN combination on the first such information return satisfies the requirement of section 3406(h)(9) to provide this information to the Internal Revenue Service. If the payor is not required to file any information returns with respect to the account after the date that the payor receives the certification or notification, a payor is deemed to satisfy the requirements of section 3406(h)(9).
(i)
Effective date.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of this section are effective with respect to notices received on or after September 1, 1990, under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section.
(j)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
D opened an account with Bank O prior to 1984 and furnished a taxpayer identification number to O at the time he opened the account. O pays interest on the account at the end of each calendar month, and the account is a pre-1984 account. On October 1, 1990, the Internal Revenue Service notifies Bank O that the name/TIN combination provided by D is incorrect. O timely notifies D as required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. O does not receive the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section from D. O is required to backup withhold 20 percent of all reportable payments made after November 14, 1990 (which is 30 business days after the date the Internal Revenue Service notified O). Therefore, O is not required to backup withhold on the reportable payment made on October 31, 1990, but is required to backup withhold on the reportable payment made on November 30, 1990. O is required to continue to backup withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(B) until O receives the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section from D (or, if earlier, until backup withholding terminates under paragraph (e)(3) of this section).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that D furnishes a new taxpayer identification number to O on November 1, 1990, but does not certify, under penalties of perjury, that it is his correct taxpayer identification number as required under paragraph (f) of this section. Even though the account is a pre-1984 account, O is required to withhold 20 percent of all reportable payments made after November 14, 1990 (which is 30 business days after the date the Internal Revenue Service notified O), and before the date O receives the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section from D.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2
except that D provides O with the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section on November 10, 1990. D elects pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section to treat the certification as received on November 20, 1990. Even though D did not provide the certification to O within 30 business days after the Internal Revenue Service notified O that D provided an incorrect taxpayer identification number, O is not required to backup withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(B) because O did not make any reportable payment to D after 30 business days after notification of an incorrect name/TIN combination and before O received D's certification under paragraph (f) of this section (or, if earlier, until backup withholding terminates under paragraph (e)(3) of this section).

# Example 4.
Individual F has two post-1983 accounts with Bank R that pay reportable interest: a savings account and a money market account. The money market account was opened in 1986, and the savings account was opened on February 1, 1991. R treats each of these accounts as a separate account on its books and records for business purposes. On October 1, 1990, the Internal Revenue Service notified R pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section that F furnished an incorrect name/TIN combination with respect to the money market account. R timely sends F the notice required under paragraph (d) of this section and receives the certification required under paragraph (f) of this section from F on November 1, 1990. On October 1, 1991, the Internal Revenue Service again notifies R that F furnished an incorrect name/TIN combination with respect to the money market account. Further, R determines from its business records that two notifications of an incorrect name/TIN combination have been received with respect to the money market account within 3 calendar years. R must send F the notice required under paragraph (g)(2) of this section and must commence backup withholding on reportable interest paid on the money market account pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section after November 14, 1991, which is 30 business days after R received the second notice. R must continue to backup withhold under paragraph (g) of this section on the
money market account until R receives notification from the Social Security Administration as described in paragraph (g)(5) of this section (or, if earlier, until backup withholding terminates under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section). R is not required to backup withhold on the savings account unless and until it receives notice under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section with respect to the savings account.

(a)
In general.
A payor must withhold under section 3406 at a rate of 31 percent on any reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)) made to a payee during the period described in this section (irrespective of the number of conditions for imposing withholding under section 3406 that exist with respect to the payee). A payor must continue to withhold under section 3406 until no condition for imposing backup withholding exists with respect to the payee.
(b)
Failure to furnish a taxpayer identification number in the manner required
—(1)

(i) The payor has not received the payee's taxpayer identification number in the manner required in § 31.3406(d)-1; or
(ii) The payor has received notice from a broker (as required in § 31.3406(d)-4(a)(1)(iii)) with respect to a readily tradable instrument that the payee did not furnish a taxpayer identification number to the broker in the manner required in § 31.3406(d)-1 and the payor has not received the taxpayer identification number from the payee in this manner.
(2)
Stop withholding.
The payor must stop withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A) within 30 days after the payor receives—
(i) The payee's taxpayer identification number in the manner required under § 31.3406(d)-1; or
(ii) A statement, in such form and containing such information as is required under applicable regulations, that the payee is not a United States person.
(c)
Notification of an incorrect taxpayer identification number.
See § 31.3406(d)-5(e) and (g)(3) for the period for which withholding is required in the case of notification of an incorrect taxpayer identification number.
(d)
Notified payee underreporting.
See § 31.3406(c)-1(e) for the period for which withholding is required in the case of notified payee underreporting.
(e)
Payee certification failure
—(1)
Start withholding.
A payor is required to withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(D) at a rate of 31 percent on any reportable interest or dividend payment (as defined in section 3406(b)(2)) at the time the payor pays such reportable interest or dividend payment (as described in § 31.3406(a)-4) to a payee if—
(i) The payor has not received from the payee the certification required in § 31.3406(d)-2; or
(ii) The payor has received notice from a broker (as required in § 31.3406(d)-4(a)(1)(iii)) with respect to a readily tradable instrument that the payee did not make the required certification and the payor has not received the required certification from the payee.
(2)
Stop withholding.
The payor must stop withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(D) on any reportable interest or dividend payment within 30 days after the payor receives the certification from the payee in the manner required by § 31.3406(d)-2.
(f)
Rule for determining when the payor receives a taxpayer identification number or certificate from a payee.
In determining whether a payee has failed to provide a taxpayer identification number or any certification to a payor (including a Form W-8 or substitute form), a payor is required to process the taxpayer identification number or certification within 30 days after the payor receives the taxpayer identification number or certification from the payee or in certain cases, from a broker. Thus, the payor may take up to
30 days to treat the taxpayer identification number or a certificate as having been received.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66127, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 31.3406(f)-1
Confidentiality of information.
(a)
Confidentiality and liability for violation.
Pursuant to section 3406(f) no person may use any information obtained under section 3406 for any purpose except for the purpose of complying with the requirements of section 3406 or for purposes permitted under section 6103 (subject to the safeguards of section 6103). See section 7431 for civil damages for violating the confidential use of the information (subject to an exception for good faith).
(b)
Permissible use of information
—(1)
In general.
A payor or broker may transmit information on a Form W-9, Form W-8, or other acceptable form relating to withholding to the department, institution, or firm (or to any employee therein) responsible for withholding or processing of taxpayer identification numbers, certifications described in § 31.3406(h)-3, or other substitute forms. In addition, a broker may notify the payor with respect to a readily tradable instrument of the requirement to withhold and the condition or conditions for imposing withholding (as described in § 31.3406(d)-4) that exist with respect to the payee. A payor or broker may, without violating the Internal Revenue Code, close an account of, refuse to open an account for, issue an instrument to, or redeem an instrument for, a person solely because the person fails to furnish the person's taxpayer identification number or documentation of foreign status in the manner required in § 31.3406(d)-1 and § 31.3406(g)-1, respectively. A payor who closes an account of a payee in the calendar year in which the account was opened and during which no taxpayer identification number or evidence of foreign status was provided for that account will be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary to have closed the account without violating section 3406(f) even though the payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A). A payor, except as provided in §§ 31.3406(d)-3 and 31.3406(g)-3, may not prohibit a payee who fails to furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number in the manner required in § 31.3406(d)-1 from withdrawing any funds in the account.
(2)
Window transactions.
In the case of a window transaction (as defined in § 31.3406(b)(2)-3(b)), a payor may, without violating the Internal Revenue Code, refuse to redeem or may refuse to make payment if the payee fails to provide a taxpayer identification number regardless of when the obligation was issued or acquired.
(c)
Specific restrictions on the use of information.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a payor or broker is not permitted to—
(1) Close an account (or instrument) of a payee solely because that payee (or the account of a payee) is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D);
(2) Refuse to open an account or to issue an instrument if the person fails to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the person is not subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) (relating to notified payee underreporting);
(3) Use information obtained under section 3406 (including a payee's failure or inability to certify that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting or the fact that the account is subject to withholding), surcharge an account (i.e., charge an account more than the fee charged a similar account that was not subject to withholding under section 3406), or use that information to determine whether to open or close an account, whether to issue or redeem an instrument, or whether to extend credit to the payee.
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66127, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 31.3406(g)-1
Exception for payments to certain payees and certain other payments.
(a)
Exempt recipients
—(1)
In general.
A payor of any reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)) must not withhold under section 3406 if the payee is—
(i) An organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) or an individual retirement account;
(ii) The United States or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality thereof;
(iii) A state, the District of Columbia, a possession of the United States, any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing;
(iv) A foreign government, a political subdivision of a foreign government, or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing (as defined in regulations under section 892); or
(v) An international organization or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality thereof (as defined in section 7701(a)(18)).
(2)
Nonexclusive list.
Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not prescribe an exclusive list of payees that are exempt from information reporting and also are exempt from withholding under section 3406.
(b)
Determination of whether a person is described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
The determination of whether a person is a payee described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be made as provided in the applicable provisions of section 6049 and the regulations issued thereunder. A payor, even if permitted to treat a person as an exempt recipient without requiring a certificate under the provisions of section 6049, may require a payee, otherwise not required to file a certificate regarding its exempt status, to file a certificate and may treat a payee who fails to file the certificate as a person who is not an exempt recipient. See § 31.3406(h)-3 for a description of the Form W-9 or a substitute form prescribed under section 3406 for claiming exempt status.
(c)
Prepaid or advance premium life-insurance contracts.
A payor of a reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)(1)) may, but is not required to, withhold under section 3406 on reportable payments made from January 1, 1984, to December 31, 1996, on prepaid or advance premium life-insurance contracts to a payee who is the owner for tax purposes of the prepaid or advance premium life-insurance contract. For purposes of this exception from backup withholding, a prepaid or advance premium life-insurance contract is one entered into on or before June 30, 1984, by the payee and under which the increment in value of the prepaid or advance premium is used for the payment of premiums during the period in which the exception from backup withholding applies.
(d)
Reportable payments made to nonresident alien individuals.
A payment of interest to a nonresident alien individual that is described in § 1.6049-(8)(a) of this chapter is not subject to withholding under section 3406 if the payor may treat the payee as a foreign beneficial owner or foreign payee under the rules of § 1.6049-5(b)(12). (For interest paid to a Canadian nonresident alien individual on or before December 31, 2012, see paragraph (d) of this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2000.)
(e)
Certain reportable payments made outside the United States by foreign persons, foreign offices of United States banks and brokers, and others
—(1)
Reportable payments other than gross proceeds from sales of digital assets.
For reportable payments made after June 30, 2014, other than gross proceeds from sales of digital assets (as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(19) of this chapter), a payor or broker is not required to backup withhold under section 3406 of the Code on a reportable payment that is paid and received outside the United States (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(16) of this chapter) with respect to an offshore obligation (as defined in § 1.6049-5(c)(1) of this chapter) or on the gross proceeds from a sale effected at an office outside the United States as described in § 1.6045-1(g)(3)(iii) of this chapter (without regard to whether the sale is considered effected inside the United States under § 1.6045-1(g)(3)(iii)(B) of this chapter). The exception to backup withholding described in the preceding sentence does not apply when a payor or broker has actual knowledge that the payee is a United States person. Further, no backup withholding is required on a reportable payment of an amount already withheld upon by a participating FFI (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(91) of this chapter) or another payor in accordance with the withholding provisions under chapter 3 or 4 of the Code and the regulations under
those chapters even if the payee is a known U.S. person. For example, a participating FFI is not required to backup withhold on a reportable payment allocable to its chapter 4 withholding rate pool (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(5) of this chapter) of recalcitrant account holders (as described in § 1.6049-4(f)(11) of this chapter), if withholding was applied to the payment (either by the participating FFI or another payor) pursuant to § 1.1471-4(b) or § 1.1471-2(a) of this chapter.

§ 31.3406(g)-2
Exception for reportable payment for which withholding is otherwise required.
(a)
In general.
A payor of a reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)) must not withhold under section 3406 if the payment is subject to withholding under any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code.
(b)
Payment of wages.
A payor who is required to make an information return under section 6041 with respect to a payment of wages (as defined in section 3401) because, e.g., the employee makes a certification under section 3402(n) (relating to employees incurring no income tax liability), must not withhold under section 3406 on those wages.
(c)
Distribution from a pension, annuity, or other plan of deferred compensation.
An amount reportable under section 6047, such as a designated distribution under section 3405, is not a reportable payment subject to withholding under section 3406. See section 3406(b). Designated distributions not subject to withholding under section 3406 include—
(1) Distributions from a pension, annuity, profit-sharing, stock bonus plan, or other plan deferring the receipt of compensation;
(2) Distributions from an individual retirement account or annuity;
(3) Distributions from an owner-employee plan; and
(4) Certain surrenders of life insurance contracts.
(d)
Gambling winnings
—(1)
In general.
A payor of a reportable gambling winning must not withhold under section 3406 if tax is required to be withheld from the gambling winning under section 3402(q) (relating to the extension of withholding to certain gambling winnings). If the reportable gambling winning is not required to be withheld upon under section 3402(q), withholding under section 3406 applies to the gambling winning if, and only if, the payee does not furnish a taxpayer identification number to the payor. Section 31.3406(b)(3)-1(b)(3) does not apply to a reportable gambling winning. The payor of a reportable gambling winning is not required to aggregate all such winnings made to a payee during a calendar year, nor is the payor required to determine whether an information return was required to be made with respect to the payee for the preceding year.
(2)
Definition of a reportable gambling winning and determination of amount subject to backup withholding.
For purposes of withholding under section 3406, a reportable gambling winning is any gambling winning subject to information reporting under section 6041. A gambling winning (other than a winning from bingo, keno, or slot machines) is a reportable gambling winning only if the amount paid with respect to the wager is $600 or more and if the proceeds are at least 300 times as large as the amount wagered. See § 1.6041-10 of this chapter to determine whether a winning from bingo, keno, or slot machines is a reportable gambling
winning and thus subject to withholding under section 3406. The amount of a reportable gambling winning is—
(i) The amount paid with respect to the amount of the wager reduced, at the option of the payer; by
(ii) The amount of the wager.
(3)
Special rules.
For special rules for determining the amount of the wager in a wagering transaction with respect to horse racing, dog racing, and jai alai, or amounts paid with respect to identical wagers, see § 31.3402(q)-1(c).
(e)
Certain real estate transactions.
A real estate reporting person (the so-called broker) as defined in section 6045(e)(2) must not withhold under section 3406 on a payment made with respect to a real estate transaction that is subject to reporting under sections 6045 (a) and (e) and § 1.6045-4 of this chapter. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a real estate reporting person must withhold under section 3406 of the Code and pursuant to the rules under § 31.3406(b)(3)-2 on a reportable payment made in a real estate transaction with respect to a purchaser that exchanges digital assets for real estate to the extent that the exchange is treated as a sale of digital assets subject to reporting under § 1.6045-1 of this chapter.
(f)
Certain payments after an acquisition of accounts or instruments.
A payor who acquires pre-1984 accounts or instruments described in § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(2)(iv) for which the payor does not have a taxpayer identification number or has an obviously incorrect taxpayer identification number as defined in § 31.3406(h)-1(b)(2) must start withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A) and § 31.3406(d)-1 on those accounts or instruments no later than sixty days following the date of the payor's acquisition of those accounts or instruments.
(g)
Certain gross proceeds.
No withholding under section 3406 is required with respect to any portion of the original issue discount on an instrument or security that is subject to withholding under section 3406 as reportable gross proceeds of such instrument or security under section 6045.
(h)
Applicability date.
The rules apply to reportable gambling winnings paid with respect to a winning event that occurs after November 13, 2017. For rules that apply to payments made with respect to a winning event on or before that date, see § 31.3406(g)-2 as contained in 26 CFR part 31, revised April 1, 2017. For sales of digital assets, this section applies on or after January 1, 2026.

§ 31.3406(g)-3
Exemption while payee is waiting for a taxpayer identification number.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Backup withholding not required for 60 days.
If a payor has received an awaiting-TIN certificate from a payee with respect to an account or instrument receiving reportable interest or dividends as described in section 3406(b)(2), the payor must exempt the payee from withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A) during the 60-day exemption period to the extent and in the manner described in either paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section. The 60-day exemption period means the 60-consecutive-day period beginning with the day the payor receives the awaiting-TIN certificate. The payor must withhold under section 3406 beginning after the 60-day exemption period if the payor has not received a taxpayer identification number from the payee in the manner required in § 31.3406(d)-1. Regardless of whether the payee provides an awaiting-TIN certificate to a payor, the payor is required to withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(D) and § 31.3406(d)-2 on reportable interest or dividend payments as described in § 31.3406(d)-2 if the payee fails to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting as required in section 3406(a)(1)(D) and § 31.3406(d)-2.
(2)
Reserve method.
A payor must not withhold under section 3406 during the 60-day exemption period unless the payee (or a joint payee in the case of a joint account) desires to make a withdrawal of more than $500 of either principal or interest from the account in any single transaction during the period. If a payee (or a joint payee) desires to make a withdrawal of more
than $500 during the 60-day exemption period, the payor is required under section 3406 to withhold 31 percent of all reportable payments made during the period and at the time of withdrawal unless the payee reserves 31 percent of all reportable payments made to the account during the period.
(3)
Alternative rule; 7-day grace period
—(i)
In general.
A payor who receives an awaiting-TIN certificate may elect, on a payee-by-payee basis or in general, to exempt reportable interest or dividend payments to a payee from withholding under section 3406 applying the rules in paragraph (a)(3) (ii) or (iii) of this section.
(ii)
Withholding on withdrawals.
Under this paragraph (a)(3)(ii), a payor must obtain a certified taxpayer identification number from the payee within 60 days after the date that the payor receives the awaiting-TIN certification. In addition, the payor must withhold under section 3406 on any withdrawals made after the close of 7 business days after the date the awaiting-TIN certification is received and before the earlier of the date that the payor receives a certified taxpayer identification number from the payee, the date the account is closed (in which case the payor must withhold on any reportable payment made at the time the account or relationship is closed), or the date withholding under section 3406 starts on all reportable payments made to the account, instrument, or relationship. All cash withdrawals in an amount up to the reportable payments made from the day after the date of receipt of the awaiting-TIN certification to the date of withdrawal are treated as reportable payments.
(iii)
Withholding regardless of withdrawals.
Under this paragraph (a)(3)(iii), a payor must start withholding under section 3406 on the account not later than 7 business days after the date the payor receives the awaiting-TIN certification on reportable payments thereafter made to the account (whether or not the payee makes a cash withdrawal). The payor must withhold under section 3406 until the earlier of the date the payor receives a certified taxpayer identification number from the payee, the date the account is closed, or the date withholding under section 3406 starts on all reportable payments made to the account, instrument, or relationship. The payor must obtain a certified taxpayer identification number from the payee within 60 days after the date that the payor receives the awaiting-TIN certificate or undertake a mailing each year soliciting the certified taxpayer identification number from the payee until the earlier of the calendar year that the certified taxpayer identification number is received, or the calendar year in which the account is closed. However, if the account is closed in December of a calendar year, the mailing must be made after the account is closed and before January 31 of the subsequent calendar year.
(b)
Special rule for readily tradable instruments.
The 60-day awaiting-TIN exemption described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments only if the payee provides an awaiting-TIN certificate directly to the payor. If a broker acquires a readily tradable instrument through a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(c)(2)) for a payee who has no taxpayer identification number, the broker must advise the payor as required in § 31.3406(d)-4(a)(1) that the payee failed to provide a taxpayer identification number under penalties of perjury, regardless of whether the payee provides an awaiting-TIN certificate to the broker. Once a payor is notified by a broker that a payee failed to provide a taxpayer identification number in the required manner, or that the payee is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1) (B) or (C), the payor must impose withholding under section 3406 for the appropriate period described in § 31.3406(e)-1.
(c)
Exceptions
—(1)
In general.
The 60-day awaiting-TIN exemption described in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to—
(i) Window transactions (as defined in § 31.3406(b)(2)-3(b));
(ii) Redemptions of bearer obligations that are subject to reporting under section 6045; or
(iii) Other amounts that are subject to reporting under section 6045 (except as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section).
(2)
Special rule for amounts subject to reporting under section 6045 other than proceeds of redemptions of bearer obligations.
If a broker's customer does not provide a taxpayer identification number to the broker, and the broker effects a sale that is subject to reporting under section 6045 (other than a redemption of a bearer obligation), § 31.3406(d)-3(b) applies, whether or not the sale is pursuant to an instruction by electronic transmission, provided the customer furnishes an awaiting-TIN certificate to the broker before the sale. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the 30-day period provided in § 31.3406(d)-3(b) is a 60-day period.
(d)
Awaiting-TIN certificate.
A payee qualifies for the 60-day awaiting-TIN exemption provided in paragraph (a) of this section if the payee furnishes a written statement to the payor, signed under penalties of perjury, that the payee has not been issued a taxpayer identification number, that the payee has applied for a taxpayer identification number or intends to apply for a number in the near future, and that the payee understands that if the payee does not provide a number to the payor within 60 days, the payor is required under section 3406 to withhold 31 percent of any reportable payment thereafter made to the payee until the payor receives a number, and 31 percent of a withdrawal to the extent of reportable payments made to the payee during the 60-day period, as described in paragraph (a) of this section. Language that is substantially similar to the awaiting-TIN certification on Form W-9 will satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (d).
(e)
Form for awaiting-TIN certificate.
A payor may use Form W-9 for the awaiting-TIN certificate, or a payor may include language that is substantially similar to the awaiting-TIN certification on Form W-9 in any other document of the payor. See § 31.3406(h)-3, which provides that Form W-9 is the prescribed form but permits use of substitute forms, and specifies the length of time the payor is required to retain the form. If Form W-9 is used, the payee should write “Applied For” in the space reserved for the taxpayer identification number.

§ 31.3406(h)-1
Definitions.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of section 3406 and the regulations thereunder, the definitions of this section apply.
(b)
Taxpayer identification number
—(1)
In general. Taxpayer identification number
means the identifying number assigned to a person under section 6109 (relating to identifying numbers, generally a nine-digit social security number for an individual and a nine-digit employer identification number for a nonindividual, e.g., a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate). An obviously incorrect number is not considered a taxpayer identification number. See § 31.6011(b)-2 and § 301.6109-1 of this chapter for provisions relating to obtaining a taxpayer identification number.
(2)
Obviously incorrect number. Obviously incorrect number
means a number that does not contain nine digits or a number that includes an alpha character as one of the nine digits.
(c)
Broker. Broker
is defined in section 6045(c)(1) and § 1.6045-1(a)(1) of this chapter. If there could be more than one broker with respect to any acquisition, only the broker having the closest contact (as determined under 1.6045-1(c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this chapter) with the payee is treated as a broker. In the case of any instrument, the term
broker
does not include any person who is the payor with respect to the instrument as described in § 31.3406(a)-2.
(d)
Readily tradable instrument. Readily tradable instrument
means—
(1) Any instrument that is part of an issue any portion of which is traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of section 453(f)(5)); or
(2) Any instrument that is regularly quoted by brokers or dealers making a market.
(e)
Day. Day
means a calendar day unless specified otherwise under any section of the regulations under section 3406. For example, see §§ 31.3406(d)-5(a) and 31.3406(g)-3(a)(2).
(f)
Business day. Business day
means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday (within the meaning of section 7503).
[T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66130, Dec. 21, 1995; 61 FR 12135, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended by T.D. 9010, 67 FR 48760, July 26, 2002]
§ 31.3406(h)-2
Special rules.
(a)
Joint accounts
—(1)
Relevant name and taxpayer identification number combination.
For purposes of identifying the account subject to withholding under sections 3406(a)(1) (B) and (C), the relevant name and taxpayer identification number combination is that which is used for information reporting purposes.
(2)
Optional rule for accounts subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1) (B) or (C) where the names are switched.
See § 31.3406(d)-5(c)(4)(iii) under which a payor may withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(B) as required even though the names or taxpayer identification numbers on the account have been switched. The rules under § 31.3406(d)-5(c)(4)(iii) may be applied comparably by a payor who is required to withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(C).
(3)
Joint foreign payees
—(i)
In general.
If the relevant payee listed on a jointly owned account or instrument provides a Form W-8 or documentary evidence described in § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) regarding its foreign status, withholding under section 3406 applies unless every joint payee provides the statement regarding foreign status (under the provisions of chapters 3 or 61 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations under those provisions); any one of the joint owners who has not established foreign status provides a taxpayer identification number to the payor in the manner required in §§ 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5; or, in the case of a withholdable payment (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(15)), any joint payee does not appear to be an individual as described in § 1.1471-3(f)(7). See § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(iii) of this chapter for corresponding joint payees provisions.
(ii)
Information reporting on an account including foreign payees.
If any one of the joint payees who has not established foreign status provides a taxpayer identification number under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section, that number is the taxpayer identification number that is required to be furnished for purposes of information reporting and withholding under section 3406.
(b)
Backup withholding from an alternative source
—(1)
In general.
A payor may not withhold under section 3406 from a source maintained by the payor other than the source with respect to which there exists a liability to withhold under section 3406 with respect to the payee. See section 3403 and § 31.3403-1, which provide that the payor is liable for the amount required to be withheld regardless of whether the payor withholds.
(2)
Exceptions for payments made in property
—(i)
Backup withholding from alternative source.
In the case of a payment that is made in property (other than money), the payor must withhold under section 3406, 31 percent of the fair market value of the property determined immediately before or on the date of payment. The payor may withhold under section 3406 from the principal amount being deposited with the payor or from another source maintained by the payee with the payor. The source from which the tax is withheld under section 3406 must be payable to at least one of the persons listed on the account subject to withholding. If the account or source is not payable exclusively to the same person or persons listed on the account subject to withholding under section 3406, then the payor must obtain a written statement from all other persons to whom the account or source is payable authorizing the payor to withhold under section 3406 from the alternative account or source. A payor that elects to withhold under section 3406 from an alternative source may determine the account or source from which the tax is to be withheld, or may allow the payee to designate the alternative source. A payee may not, however, require a payor to withhold under section 3406 from a specific alternative source. See § 31.3402(q)-1(d),
Example 5,
for methods of withholding on prizes, awards, and gambling winnings paid in property other than cash.
(ii)
Deferral of withholding.
If the payor cannot locate, using reasonable care (following procedures substantially similar to those set forth in § 31.3406(d)-5(c)(3)(ii) (A) and (B)), an alternative source of cash from which the payor may satisfy its withholding obligation pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the payor may defer its obligation to withhold under
section 3406, except for reportable payments of property made in connection with prizes, awards, or gambling winnings, until the earlier of—
(A) The date the payor makes a cash payment to the account subject to withholding under section 3406 or cash is otherwise deposited in the account in a sufficient amount to satisfy the obligation in full; or
(B) The close of the fourth calendar year after the obligation arose.
(iii)
Barter exchanges.
In the case of a barter exchange that issues scrip to, or credits the account of, a member or client of the exchange in payment for property or services, the barter exchange may withhold under section 3406 from—
(A) The scrip or credit, if converted to cash in order to satisfy the deposit requirements of section 6302 and § 31.6302-4; or
(B) Any other source maintained by the exchange for the member or client in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(c)
Trusts.
Withholding under section 3406 applies to reportable payments made to a trust if any of the conditions for imposing withholding under section 3406 apply to the trust. Generally, a trust is not a payor and will not be required to withhold under section 3406 on reportable payments that it makes to its beneficiary who is subject to withholding under section 3406. The preceding sentence does not apply, however, to a grantor trustdescribed in § 31.3406(a)-2(b)(1) or (2), which is treated as a payor. The trustee of a trust described in this paragraph (c) may certify that the trust's taxpayer identification number is correct and that the trust is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting, without regard to the status of the beneficiaries of the trust.
(d)
Adjustment of prior withholding by middlemen.
A middleman payor (as defined in § 31.3406(a)-2(b) or in the section on information reporting to which the payment relates) who receives a payment from which tax has been erroneously withheld under section 3406 may seek a refund of the tax withheld by the payor from whom the middleman payor received the payment (referred to as the “upstream payor”). Alternatively, the middleman payor may obtain a refund of the tax by claiming a credit for the amount of tax withheld by the upstream payor against the deposit of any tax imposed by this chapter which the middleman payor is required to withhold and deposit (as described in section 6413 and § 31.6413(a)-2). In either case, the middleman payor must pay or credit the gross amount of the payment (including the tax withheld) to its payee as though it had received the gross amount of the payment from the upstream payor and must withhold under section 3406 only if one of the conditions for imposing backup withholding exists with respect to its payee. If its payee is not subject to withholding under section 3406, the payor must pay or credit the full amount of the payment to the payee, unless, with respect to payments made after December 31, 2000, the payor chooses to apply prior withholding under section 3406 to an amount required to be withheld under another section of the Internal Revenue Code (such as under section 1441) to the extent permitted under procedures prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). See § 31.6413(a)-3 regarding repayment by a payor of tax erroneously collected from a payee.
(e)
Conversion of amounts paid in foreign currency into United States dollars
—(1)
Convertible foreign currency.
If a payment is made in a currency other than the United States dollar, the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 is determined by applying the statutory rate of backup withholding to the foreign currency payment and converting the amount withheld into United States dollars on the date of payment at the spot rate (as defined in § 1.988-1(d)(1) of this chapter) or pursuant to a reasonable spot rate convention. For example, a withholding agent may use a month-end spot rate or a monthly average spot rate. A spot rate convention must be used consistently with respect to all non-dollar amounts withheld and from year to year. Such convention cannot be changed without the consent of the Commissioner.
(2)
Nonconvertible foreign currency.
[Reserved]
(f)
Coordination with other sections.
For purposes of section 31, chapter 24 (other than section 3402(n)) of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to employment taxes and collection of income tax at source) and so much of subtitle F (other than section 7205) of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to procedure and administration) as relates to this chapter, and the regulations thereunder—
(1) An amount required to be withheld under section 3406 must be treated as a tax required to be withheld under section 3402;
(2) An amount withheld under section 3406 must be treated as an amount withheld under section 3402;
(3) An amount withheld under section 3406 must be deposited as required under § 31.6302-4;
(4)
Wages
includes the gross amount of any reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)) except for purposes of section 6014 (relating to an election by the taxpayer not to compute the tax on his annual return);
(5)
Employee
includes a payee of any reportable payment; and
(6)
Employer
includes a payor who is required to withhold the tax under section 3406 (as defined in § 31.3406(a)-2) with respect to any reportable payment (as defined in section 3406(b)).
(g)
Tax liabilities and penalties.
A payor is subject to the same civil and criminal penalties for failing to impose withholding under section 3406 as an employer who fails to withhold on a payment of wages. In addition, a broker may be subject to the penalty under section 6705 (failure of a broker to provide notice to a payor).
(h)
To whom payor is liable for amount withheld.
A payor is not liable to any person for any amount withheld under section 3406. A payor is liable only to the United States for an amount that is required to be withheld as provided in § 31.3403-1.
(i)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to payments made on or after January 6, 2017. (For payments made after June 30, 2014, and before January 6, 2017, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2016.)

Prescribed form to furnish information under penalties of perjury
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the Form W-9 is the form prescribed under section 3406 on which a payee that is a U.S. person certifies, under penalties of perjury, that—
(i) The taxpayer identification number furnished to the payor is correct (as required in § 31.3406(d)-1 and § 31.3406(d)-5);
(ii) The payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting (as required in § 31.3406(d)-2);
(iii) The payee is an exempt recipient (as described in § 31.3406(g)-1); or
(iv) The payee is awaiting receipt of a taxpayer identification number (as described in § 31.3406(g)-3).
(2)
Use of a single or multiple Forms W-9 for accounts of the same payee.
A valid Form W-9 must include the name and taxpayer identification number of the payee. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the payee must sign under penalties of perjury and date the Form W-9 in order to satisfy the requirements of this section. A payor or broker may require a payee to furnish a separate Form W-9 for each obligation, deposit, certificate, share, membership, contract, or other instrument, or one Form W-9 for all the payee's obligations or relationships with the payor or broker. In addition, a payee of a mutual fund that has a common investment advisor or common principal underwriter with other mutual funds (within the same family of funds) may be permitted, in the discretion of the mutual fund, to provide one Form W-9 with respect to shares acquired or owned in any of the funds.
(b)
Prescribed form to furnish a noncertified taxpayer identification number.
With respect to accounts or other relationships where the payee is not required to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the taxpayer identification number being furnished is correct, the payor or broker may obtain the taxpayer identification number orally or may use Form W-9, a substitute form, or any other document, but the payee is not required to sign the form.
(c)
Forms prepared by payors or brokers—(1) Substitute forms; in general.
A payor or broker may prepare and use a form that contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the official Form W-9. A payor or broker may use any document relating to the transaction, such as the signature card for an account, so long as the certifications are clearly set forth. A payor or broker who uses a substitute form may furnish orally or in writing the instructions for the Form W-9 that relate to the account. A payor or broker may refuse to accept certifications (including the official Form W-9) that are not made on the form or forms provided by the payor or broker. A payor or broker may refuse to accept a certification provided by a payee only if the payor or broker furnishes the payee with an acceptable form immediately upon receipt of an unacceptable form or within 5 business days of receipt of an unacceptable form. An acceptable form for this purpose must contain a notice that the payor or broker has refused to accept the form submitted by the payee and that the payee must submit the acceptable form provided by the payor in order for the payee not to be subject to withholding under section 3406. If the payor or broker requires the payee to furnish a form for each account of the payee, the payor or broker is not required to furnish an acceptable form until the payee furnishes the payor or broker with the payee's account numbers. A payor or broker may use separate substitute forms to have a payee certify under penalties of perjury that—
(i) The payee's taxpayer identification number is correct; and
(ii) The payee is not subject to withholding under section 3406 due to notified payee underreporting.
(2)
Form for exempt recipient.
A payor or broker may use a substitute form for the payee to certify, under penalties of perjury, that the payee is an exempt recipient (described in § 31.3406(g)-1 or described in the respective reporting section), provided the form contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the official Form W-9 relating to exempt recipients. A certificate must be prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable to exempt recipients on Form W-9, and must set forth fully and clearly the data called for therein. If a payor will treat the payee as an exempt recipient only if the payee files a certificate as to its exempt status, the certificate is valid only if it contains the payee's taxpayer identification number. Thus, a payee must include the payee's taxpayer identification number on a certificate that a payor requires to be made in order to treat the payee as an exempt recipient.
(d)
Special rule for brokers.
A broker may act as the payee's agent for purposes of furnishing a taxpayer identification number or certification to a payor with respect to any readily tradable instrument (as defined in § 31.3406(h)-1(d)) provided the payee provides a taxpayer identification number on Form W-9 or other acceptable substitute form to the broker. The payor may rely on a taxpayer identification number provided by the broker unless certification is required (as described in § 31.3406(d)-4) and the broker notifies the payor that the number was not certified.
(e)
Reasonable reliance on certificate
—(1)
In general.
A payor is not liable for the tax imposed under section 3406 if the payor's failure to deduct and withhold the tax is due to reasonable reliance, as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, on a Form W-9 (or other acceptable substitute) required by this section.
(2)
Circumstances establishing reasonable reliance.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a payor can reasonably rely on a Form W-9 (or other acceptable substitute) unless—
(i) The form does not contain the name and taxpayer identification number of the payee (or does not state, in lieu of a taxpayer identification number, that the payee is awaiting receipt
of a taxpayer identification number (i.e., an awaiting-TIN certificate));
(ii) The form is not signed and dated by the payee;
(iii) The form does not contain the statement, when required, that the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee underreporting;
(iv) The payee has deleted the jurat or other similar provisions by which the payee certifies or affirms the correctness of the statements contained on the form; or
(v) For purposes of section 3406(a)(1)(C), the payor is required to subject the account to which the form relates to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) under the circumstances described in § 31.3406(c)-1(c)(3)(iii).
(f)
Who may sign certificate
—(1)
In general.
A Form W-9 or other acceptable substitute form may be signed by any person who is authorized to sign a declaration under penalties of perjury on behalf of the payee as provided in section 6061 and the regulations thereunder (relating to who may sign generally for an individual, which includes certain agents who may sign returns and other documents), section 6062 and the regulations thereunder (relating to who may sign corporate returns), and section 6063 and the regulations thereunder (relating to who may sign partnership returns).
(2)
Notified payee underreporting.
A payee who has not been notified that he is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) as a result of notified payee underreporting may make the certification related to notified payee underreporting. In addition, a payee who was subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to notified payee underreporting may certify that he is not subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to notified payee underreporting if the Internal Revenue Service has provided the payee with written certification that withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to notified payee underreporting has terminated.
(g)
Retention of certificates
—(1)
Accounts or instruments that are not pre-1984 accounts and brokerage relationships that are post-1983 brokerage accounts.
With respect to an account or instrument that is not a pre-1984 account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(3)), or with respect to a brokerage relationship that is a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(c)(2)), a payor or broker who receives a Form W-9 or other acceptable substitute form related to withholding under section 3406 must retain the form in its records for 3 years from the date the account is opened or the instrument is purchased. The form may be retained on microfilm or microfiche.
(2)
Accounts or instruments that are pre-1984 accounts and brokerage relationships that are not post-1983 brokerage accounts.
With respect to a pre-1984 account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(b)(1)) or with respect to a brokerage relationship that is not a post-1983 brokerage account (as described in § 31.3406(d)-1(c)(1)), a payor or broker is not required to retain any Form W-9 or other acceptable substitute form. If, however, the payor or broker requires the payee to file only one Form W-9 or substitute form for all accounts or instruments of the payee, the payor or broker must retain the single form in the manner and for the period of time described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section if that form relates to any account or instrument that is not a pre-1984 account or relates to a post-1983 brokerage account. If a payee has certified that the payee is an exempt recipient described in § 31.3406(g)-1, the payor or broker must retain the form unless the payor or broker can establish the existence of procedures that are reasonably calculated to ensure that a payee who has so certified is accurately identified in the payor's or broker's records.

§ 31.3406(j)-1
Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) matching program.
(a)
The matching program.
Under section 3406(i), the Commissioner has the authority to establish Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) matching programs. The Commissioner may prescribe in a revenue procedure (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) or other appropriate guidance the scope and the terms and conditions of participating in any TIN matching program. In general, under a matching program, prior to filing information returns with respect to reportable payments as defined in section 3406(b)(1), a payor of those reportable payments who is entitled to participate in the matching program may contact the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to the TIN furnished by a payee who has received or is likely to receive a reportable payment. The IRS will inform the payor whether or not a name/TIN combination furnished by the payee matches a name/TIN combination maintained in the data base utilized for the particular matching program. For purposes of this section, the term payor includes an agent designated by the payor to participate in TIN matching on the payor's behalf.
(b)
Notice of incorrect TIN.
No matching details received by a payor through a matching program will constitute a notice regarding an incorrect name/TIN combination under § 31.3406(d)-5(c) for purposes of imposing backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(B).
(c)
Application of section 3406(f).
The provisions of section 3406(f), relating to confidentiality of information, apply to any matching details received by a payor through the matching program. A payor may not take into account any such matching details in determining whether to open or close an account with a payee.
(d)
Reasonable cause.
The IRS will not use either a payor's decision not to participate in an available TIN matching program or the results received by a payor from participation in a TIN matching program implemented under the authority of this section as a basis to assert that the payor lacks reasonable cause under section 6724(a) for the failure to file an information return under section 6721 or to furnish a correct payee statement under section 6722. If the establishment of reasonable cause may be relevant to a substantial number of the participants in a TIN matching program implemented under the authority of this section, the extent to which, if any, a payor may establish reasonable cause by participating in the TIN matching program will be set forth in the guidance establishing the program.
(e)
Definition of account. Account
means any account, instrument, or other relationship with a payor and with respect to which a payor has made or is likely to make a reportable payment as defined in section 3406(b)(1).
(f)
Effective date.
The last sentence in paragraph (a) of this section is applicable on January 31, 2003. All other provisions of this section are applicable on and after June 18, 1997.

# Subpart F—General Provisions Relating to Employment Taxes (Chapter 25, Internal Revenue Code of 1954)
§ 31.3501(a)-1T
Question and answer relating to the time employers must collect and pay the taxes on noncash fringe benefits (Temporary).
The following questions and answers relate to the time employers must collect and pay the taxes imposed by subtitle C on noncash fringe benefits:
Q-1:
If a noncash fringe benefit constitutes “wages” under section 3121(a), 3306(b), or 3401(a), or constitutes “compensation” under section 3231(e), when must an employer collect and pay the taxes imposed by Subtitle C?
A-1:
For purposes of an employer's liability to collect and pay the taxes imposed by Subtitle C, an employer may deem such fringe benefit to be paid at any time on or after the date on which it is provided, as long as such date is on or before the last day of the calendar quarter in which such benefit is provided. An employer may consider the benefit to be provided in two or more parts for purposes of the preceding sentence. For example, if a fringe benefit with a fair market value of $1,000 is provided on January 1, 1985, the employer could deem $500 paid on February 28, 1985 and $500 paid on March 31, 1985.
With respect to noncash fringe benefits provided during the first calendar quarter of 1985, a special rule applies. Such benefits may be deemed paid at any time on or after the date on which they are provided as long as the date they are deemed paid is on or before the last day of the second calendar quarter of 1985.
In addition, for purposes of § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i), the term “tax” does not include the employer tax under section 3111 with respect to noncash fringe benefits which are deemed by the employer to be paid on the last day of any calendar quarter. For purposes of the first sentence of § 31.6302(c)-2(a)(1), the phrase “employer tax imposed after December 31, 1983, under section 3221 (a) and (b)” will not include any such employer tax with respect to noncash fringe benefits which are deemed by the employer to be paid on the last day of the quarter; provided that for purposes of deposits required under § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(v), such first sentence applies to such noncash fringe benefits.
Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if an employer in fact withholds, the amount withheld is subject to the general deposit rules.
The manner in which and the time at which the employer withholds amounts from the wages of an employee to pay the taxes imposed under section 3101, 3201, and/or 3402 will generally be left to be determined by the employer and the employee. Any delay in withholding, however, does not affect the employer's obligation upon the filing of an employment tax return, to pay amounts which would be due under this subtitle if the employer had withheld, with respect to noncash fringe benefits, the amount which would have been required to be withheld if such noncash fringe benefits had been paid in cash on the date the benefits were deemed paid. However, if such amounts are not withheld from the wages of an employee within a reasonable period after payment of the taxes by the employer, payment by the employer may be deemed additional compensation of the employee.
Q-2:
Are any fringe benefits excepted from the rules contained in Q/A-1 of this section?
A-2:
Yes. The rules contained in Q/A-1 of this section do not apply to the transfer of personal property (both tangible and intangible) of a kind held for investment or to the transfer of real property. Accordingly, an employer is liable for the collection and payment of taxes imposed by this subtitle when such property is transferred. For example, stock transferred in connection with the performance of services is paid, for purposes of this subtitle C, on the date the stock is transferred, i.e., on the date the stock vests pursuant to section 83 (absent a section 83(b) election).
Q-3:
What is an example of the application of the rules contained in Q/A-1 of this section with respect to obligations under Chapters 21 and 24 of subtitle C?
A-3:
All of employer A's employees received $100 in cash as wages each week from A. In addition, during a calendar quarter, each such employee receives noncash fringe benefits, the fair market value of which is $500. A deems all such noncash fringe beneftis to be paid on the last day of the quarter. As of the end of the quarter, no amount has been withheld from the employee's wages with respect to such noncash fringe benefits, and A has “undeposited taxes” (within the meaning of § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i)) of more than $3,000 attributable to amounts actually withheld under section 3102 or section 3402 or due under section 3111 with respect to cash wages of A's employees. The amount which A must deposit within 3 banking days after the end of the quarter will be determined without regard to the noncash fringe benefits deemed paid on the last day of the quarter.
During the month following the quarter, A withholds from its employees with respect to the noncash fringe benefits deemed paid on the last day of the quarter. As A withholds amounts, such amounts become “taxes” subject to § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i). If, as of the date of filing of the return for the period which includes the last day of the quarter, A has not deposited all amounts with respect to the quarter which are due under section 3111 or which would have been due had A withheld, under sections 3102 and 3402, with respect to noncash fringe benefits, the amount which would have been required to be withheld had such benefits been paid in cash, A shall pay the balance with its return. A must make such payment regardless of whether, at the time the return is filed, he has actually withheld all amounts which he would have been required to withhold had such benefits been paid in cash.
Q-4:
If an employee is provided with a noncash fringe benefit and separates from service before the benefit is deemed paid by the employer, is the employer liable for the taxes imposed by subtitle C?
A-4:
Yes. The employer's liability is unaffected by his ability to collect the tax from the former employer.
Q-5:
If an entity other than the employer provides a noncash fringe benefit to an employee, is that entity considered the employer of such employee with respect to such noncash fringe benefit for any purposes of subtitle C?
A-5:
The provision of noncash fringe benefits by an entity to an employee of another employer does not make such entity the employer of such employee with respect to such noncash fringe benefit for any purpose of subtitle C, so long as such noncash fringe benefits are incidental to the provision of wages by the employer to such employee. For example, if two unrelated airlines, A and B, enter into a reciprocal agreement where by the parents of employees of both airlines are entitled to free flights on both airlines, the fact that A is providing a noncash fringe benefit to the employees of B generally will not make A the employer of such employees for purposes of subtitle C.
Q-6:
Do special rules apply to the provision of taxable noncash fringe benefits by a nonemployer under a reciprocal agreement with the employee's employer?
A-6:
If the provision of taxable noncash fringe benefits meets the requirements of Q/A-5 of this section, the nonemployer provider of the benefits is not required to withhold. The employer must take the steps necessary to obtain the relevant information from the provider of the benefits in order to enable the employer to satisfy, in a timely manner, its obligations under subtitle C to collect and pay taxes with respect to the noncash fringe benefits provided by the nonemployer.
Q-7:
For purposes of subtitle C, how is the fair market value of an employer-provided automobile or other road vehicle during any time period to be determined?
A-7:
The value of the availability of an employer-provided automobile or other road vehicle must be determined under the rules provided in ;§§ 1.61-21 and 1.132-1 of this chapter. (For purposes of this section, the terms “automobile” and “road vehicle” have the meaning given those terms in § 1.61-21). For example, assume that an employee adopts the special rule provided in § 1.61-21 and that the Annual Lease Value, as defined in § 1.61-21, of an automobile or other road vehicle is $2,100. The automobile or other road vehicle is provided to employee A on
January 1, 1985. As of March 31, A had driven the automobile or other road vehicle 1,000 personal miles and 3,000 miles in the course of his employer's business. For the quarter, A would have had wages of $131.25 attributable to his personal use of the automobile or other road vehicle computed by subtracting a $393.75 working condition fringe from $525 ($2,100 divided by 4). See section 132(d) and § 1.132-1T. During the second quarter of 1985, A drives the automobile or other road vehicle only 1,000 miles, all of which are personal. In order to calculate the value of the wages provided to A in the second quarter in the form of the availability of the employer-provided automobile or other road vehicle, first A's employer calculates the Annual Lease Value attributable to the first six months of 1985 which is $1,050 ($2,100 divided by 2). Second, A's employer calculates the working condition fringe exclusion which is $630 ($1,050 multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is A's business mileage (3,000 miles) and the denominator of which is A's total mileage (5,000 miles)). The calculations result in a total inclusion of $420 ($1,050—$630). From the total inclusion of $420, the wages provided in the first quarter, $131.25, are subtracted, leaving $288.75 as the wages includible in the second quarter attributable to the availability to A of the employer-provided automobile or other road vehicle.
Q-8: May an employer treat any part of the Annual Lease Value or Daily Lease Value (as defined in 1.61-21 of this chapter ), or the fair market value if the special rule of 1.61-21 of this chapter is not or cannot be used, of an automobile or other road vehicle made available to an employee as includible in the employee's gross income without regard to whether the employee has used the automobile or other road vehicle in the employer's business?
A-8: No, except as otherwise provided in this Q/A-8, an employer may not include any amount in an employee's income with respect to an employer-provided automobile or other road vehicle unless such inclusion is based on:
(a) Records or a statement submitted by an employee that contain the business and total mileage for the period beginning on January 1, 1985, and ending on the last day of the employer's taxable year that began in 1984, or
(b) Records that satisfy the employer's “adequate contemporaneous record” requirement under section 274(d)(4) and the regulations thereunder for the employer's taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984.
For example, an employer who is subject to (b) of this Q/A-8 may rely on a statement submitted by the employee indicating for the period the number of miles driven by the employee in the employer's business and the total number of miles driven by the employee unless the employer knows or has reason to know the statement submitted is not based on “adequate contemporaneous records”. (For purposes of this section, if a road vehicle is available to any person and such availability would be taxable to an employee, miles driven by that person will be considered miles driven by the employee).
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph of this Q/A-8, an employer may include in an employee's income the value of the availability of an employer-provided road vehicle, calculated without regard to a working condition fringe exclusion based on business mileage if one of the conditions listed in § 1.274-6T(f)(1) is satisfied with respect to the relevant period.
In addition, the employer must, before including any amount in an employee's income with respect to an employer-provided road vehicle, take into account other working condition fringe exclusions, such as the security exclusion discussed in § 1.132-1T. If proper calculation of an exclusion requires information from the employee and the employee does not respond within a reasonable period of time to a request for that information or produces information which the employer knows or has reason to know is not accurate, the employer may disregard such exclusion in reporting the employee's gross income.
Q-8a: May an employer withhold amounts attributable to noncash fringe benefits on the basis of average wages as permitted under section 3402(h)(1)?
A-8a: In general, yes. In estimating wages under section 3402(h)(1)(A), however, the employer must take into account estimated business use of the benefit (such as an employer-provided road vehicle). In no event, however, may the amount reported by the employer as “wages” for any employee for any quarter be based on an estimation. However, the rules in Q/A-1 of this section regarding permissible delays in actual withholding apply.
Q-9:
If an employee purchases any property or service from an employer at a discount and the discount is not excludable under section 132 and any applicable regulations thereunder, when is the noncash fringe benefit provided?
A-9:
Such property or service is provided at the time that ownership is transferred, in the case of property, or the time service is rendered, in the case of services. This will be true regardless of when the employee pays for such property or service or the date payment is due or the rate of interest charged prior to payment. The time at which ownership of the property is transferred must be determined under general tax principles.
Q-10:
What rules apply with respect to the treatment of the payment of any noncash fringe benefit as the payment of supplemental wages under section 3402?
A-10:
An employer may treat the payment of any noncash fringe benefit as the payment of supplemental wages. Thus, if noncash fringe benefits are provided and tax has been withheld from the employee's regular wages, the employer may determine the tax to be withheld with respect to such noncash fringe benefits by using a flat percentage rate of 20 percent, without allowance for exemptions and without reference to any regular payment of wages. For example, assume that during a calendar quarter A receives from his employer a taxable noncash fringe benefit with a fair market value of $1,000. If the requirements specified above are satisfied, A's employer may determine the tax to be withheld with respect to such benefit by using a flat percentage rate of 20 percent. The employer may also determine the tax to be withheld with respect to such benefit by use of the method described in § 31.3402 (g)-1(a)(2).

§ 31.3503-1
Tax under chapter 21 or 22 paid under wrong chapter.
If, for any period, an amount is paid as tax—
(a) Under chapter 21 or corresponding provisions of prior law by a person who is not liable for tax for such period under such chapter or prior law, but who is liable for tax for such period under chapter 22 or corresponding provisions of prior law, or
(b) Under chapter 22 or corresponding provisions of prior law by a person who is not liable for tax for such period under such chapter or prior law, but who is liable for tax for such period under chapter 21 or corresponding provisions of prior law,

Each claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made on Form 843 and in accordance with § 31.6402(a)-2 and the applicable provisions of section 6402(a) and the regulations thereunder in Part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
§ 31.3504-1
Designation of agent by application.
(a)
In general.
In the event wages as defined in chapter 21 or 24 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), or compensation as defined in chapter 22 of the Code, of an employee or group of employees, employed by one or more employers, is paid by a fiduciary, agent, or other person (“agent”), or if that agent has the control, receipt, custody, or disposal of (collectively “pays”) wages or compensation, the Internal Revenue Service may, subject to the terms and conditions as it deems proper, authorize that agent to perform the acts required of the employer or employers under those provisions of the Code and the regulations that apply, for purposes of the taxes imposed by the chapter or chapters, with respect to wages or compensation paid by the agent. If the agent is authorized by the Internal Revenue Service to perform such acts, all provisions of law (including penalties) and of the regulations applicable to an employer with respect to such acts shall be applicable to the agent. However, each employer for whom the agent acts shall remain subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) and of the regulations applicable to an employer with respect to such acts. Any application to authorize an agent to perform such acts, signed by the agent and the employer, shall be made on the form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service and shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service as prescribed in the instructions to the form and other applicable guidance.
(b)
Special rule for home care service recipients.

If the agent is authorized by the Internal Revenue Service to perform such acts, all provisions of law (including penalties) and of the regulations applicable to an employer in respect of such acts shall be applicable to the agent. However, each employer for whom the agent acts shall remain subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) and of the regulations applicable to an employer with respect to such acts.

Home care services.
For purposes of this section, the term
home care services

(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:
(1)
Example 1.
Corporation P enters into an agreement with Employer, effective January 1, 2015. Under the agreement, Corporation P hires the Employer's employees as its own employees and provides them back to Employer to perform services for Employer. Corporation P also assumes responsibility to make payment of the individuals' wages and for the collection, reporting, and payment of applicable taxes. For all pay periods in 2015, Employer provides Corporation P with an amount equal to the gross payroll (that is, wage and tax amounts) of the individuals, and Corporation P pays wages (less the applicable withholding) to the individuals performing services for Employer. Corporation P also reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941,
Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,
filed for each quarter of 2015 under Corporation P's employer identification number. Corporation P is not a common paymaster, the employer of the individuals (including an employer within the meaning of section 3401(d)(1)), or treated as the employer of the individual under section 3121(a)(2)(A). Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages
Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.
(2)
Example 2.
Same facts as
Example 1,
except that Corporation P only reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941,
Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,
filed for the 1st and 2nd quarters of 2015. Neither Corporation P nor Employer files returns for the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2015. Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.
(3)
Example 3.
Same facts as
Example 1,
except that neither Corporation P nor Employer reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941,
Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,
for any quarter of 2015. Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.
(4)
Example 4.
Same facts as
Example 1,
except that Employer provides only net payroll (that is, wages less tax amounts) to Corporation P for each pay period. Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.
(5)
Example 5.
Same facts as
Example 1,
except that after Corporation P reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941,
Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,
filed for each quarter of 2015 under Corporation P's employer identification number, Corporation P files a claim for refund of the employment taxes it paid for each quarter of 2015 that are related to wages Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer. The basis for Corporation P's refund claim is that Corporation P is not the employer of the individuals that performed services for Employer. Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Accordingly, Corporation P is not entitled to a refund. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.
(6)
Example 6.
Corporation S enters into an agreement with Employer, effective January 1, 2015. Under the agreement, Corporation S provides payroll services, including payment of wages to individuals performing services for Employer, and assumes responsibility for the collection, reporting, and payment of applicable taxes. For all pay periods in 2015, Employer provides Corporation S with an amount equal to the gross payroll (that is, wage and tax amounts) of the individuals, and Corporation S pays wages (less the applicable withholding) to the individuals performing services for Employer. Corporation S also reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941,
Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,
filed for each quarter of 2015 under Employer's employer identification number. Corporation S is not designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation S paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Corporation S did not assert it was the employer and filed Forms 941 using Employer's employer identification number. Accordingly, Corporation S is not liable for the applicable employment taxes under this section. Employer remains subject
to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.
(7)
Example 7.
Corporation T enters into a consulting agreement with Manufacturer effective January 1, 2015, to provide consulting services to Manufacturer. Corporation T is responsible to pay wages to the individuals providing the consulting services to Manufacturer and to collect, report, and pay the applicable taxes. Corporation T has the right to direct and control the individuals as to when and how to perform the consulting services and, thus, is the common law employer of the individuals providing the consulting services. Corporation T is not designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation T pays to individuals providing consulting services to Manufacturer. However, as the common law employer of the individuals, Corporation T is subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers with respect to such wages.
(8)
Example 8.
On January 1, 2015, Corporation U enters into an agreement with Employer for Employer to farm Corporation U's property. Under the agreement, Corporation U and Employer agree to split the proceeds of the sale of the products grown on the property. Employer hires workers to assist it with the farming. Employer has the right to direct and control the workers as to when and how to perform the services and, thus, is the common law employer of the workers. However, Employer is unable to pay the workers until after the products are sold. Therefore, Corporation U pays wages to the workers and deducts this amount from Employer's share of the profits. Corporation U controls the payment of wages within the meaning of section 3401(d)(1). Corporation U is not designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation U paid to workers providing services for Employer. However, as the section 3401(d)(1) employer of the workers performing services for Employer, Corporation U is subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers with respect to such wages.
(9)
Example 9.
Corporation V and Employer execute and submit a Form 2678,
Employer/Payer Appointment of Agent,
to the Service, requesting approval to authorize Corporation V to report, deposit, and pay taxes with respect to wages it pays, as agent of Employer for purposes of Form 941,
Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return.
The Form 2678 is approved by the Service and effective for all quarters of 2015. Accordingly, Corporation V reports the wages it pays to individuals performing services for Employer and related tax amounts on Form 941 and Schedule R (Form 941),
Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers,
filed for each quarter of 2015 under Corporation V's employer identification number. Corporation V is not designated under this section to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation V paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. However, as an agent authorized under § 31.3504-1(a), Corporation V is subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages. Employer also remains subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
These final regulations are effective for wages or compensation paid by a payor in quarters beginning on or after March 31, 2014.

§ 31.3505-1
Liability of third parties paying or providing for wages.
(a)
Personal liability in case of direct payment of wages
—(1)
In general.
A lender, surety, or other person—
(i) Who is not an employer for purposes of section 3102 (relating to deduction of tax from wages under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act), section 3202 (relating to deduction of tax from compensation under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act), or section 3402 (relating to deduction of income tax from wages) with respect to an employee or group of employees, and
(ii) Who pays wages on or after January 1, 1967, directly to such employee or group of employees, employed by one or more employers, or to an agent on behalf of such employee or employees,
shall be liable in his own person and estate for payment to the United States of an amount equal to the sum of the taxes required to be deducted and withheld from those wages by the employer under subtitle C of the Code and interest from the due date of the employer's return relating to such taxes for the period in which the wages are paid.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Pursuant to a wage claim of $200, A, a surety company, paid a net amount of $158 to B, an employee of the X Construction Company. This was done in accordance with A's payment bond covering a private construction job on which B was an employee. If X Construction Company fails to make timely payment or deposit of $42.00, the amount of tax required by subtitle C of the Code to be deducted and withheld from, a $200 wage payment to B, A becomes personally liable for $42.00 (
i.e.,
an amount equal to the unpaid taxes), plus interest upon this amount from the due date of X's return.
(b)
Personal liability where funds are supplied
—(1)
In general.
A lender, surety, or other person who—
(i) Advances funds to or for the account of an employer for the specific purpose of paying wages of the employees of that employer, and
(ii) At the time the funds are advanced, has actual notice or knowledge (within the meaning of section 6323(i)(1)) that the employer does not intend to, or will not be able to, make timely payment or deposit of the amounts of tax required by subtitle C of the Code to be deducted and withheld by the employer from those wages,
shall be liable in his own person and estate for payment to the United States of an amount equal to the sum of the taxes which are required by subtitle C of the Code to be deducted and withheld from wages paid on or after January 1, 1967, and which are not paid over to the United States by the employer, and interest from the due date of the employer's return relating to such taxes. However, the liability of the lender, surety, or other person shall not exceed 25 percent of the amount supplied by him for the payment of wages. The preceding sentence and the second sentence of section 3505(b) limit the liability of a lender, surety, or other person arising solely by reason of section 3505, and they do not limit the liability which the lender, surety or other person may incur to the United States as a third-party beneficiary of an agreement between the lender, surety, or other person and the employer. The liability of a lender, surety, or other person does not include penalties imposed on the taxpayer.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
D, a savings and loan association, advances $10,000 to Y for the specific purpose of paying the net wages of Y's employees. D advances those funds with knowledge that Y will not be able to make timely payment of the taxes required to be deducted and withheld from these wages by subtitle C of the Code, Y uses the $10,000 to pay the net wages of his employees but fails to remit withholding taxes under subtitle C in the amount of $2,600. D's liability, under this section, is limited to $2,500, 25 percent of the amount supplied for the payment of wages to Y's employees.

# Example 2.
E, a loan company, advances $15,000 to F, a contractor, for the specific purpose of paying $20,000 of net wages due to F's employees. E advances those funds with knowledge that F will not be able to make timely payment of the taxes required to be deducted and withheld from these wages by subtitle C of the Code. F applies $5,000 of its own funds toward payment of these wages. The amount of tax required to be deducted and withheld from the gross wages is $4,500. The limitation applicable to E's liability is $3,750 (25 percent of $15,000). However, because E furnished only a portion of the total net wages, E is liable for $3,375 of the taxes required to be deducted and withheld ($4,500 × $15,000/$20,000).
(3)
Ordinary working capital loan.
The provisions of section 3505(b) do not apply in the case of an ordinary working capital loan made to an employer, even though the person supplying the funds knows that part of the funds advanced may be used to make wage payments in the ordinary course of business. Generally, an ordinary working capital loan is a loan which is made to enable the borrower to meet current obligations as they arise. The person
supplying the funds is not obligated to determine the specific use of an ordinary working capital loan or the ability of the employer to pay the amounts of tax required by subtitle C of the Code to be deducted and withheld. However, section 3505(b) is applicable where the person supplying the funds has actual notice or knowledge (within the meaning of section 6323(i)(1)) at the time of the advance that the funds, or a portion thereof, are to be used specifically to pay net wages, whether or not the written agreement under which the funds are advanced states a different purpose. Whether or not a lender has actual notice or knowledge that the funds are to be used to pay net wages, or merely that the funds may be so used, depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, a lender, who has actual notice or knowledge that the withheld taxes will not be paid, will be deemed to have actual notice or knowledge that the funds are to be used specifically to pay net wages where substantially all of the employer's ordinary operating expenses consist of salaries and wages even though fund for other incidental operating expenses may be supplied pursuant to an agreement described as a working capital loan agreement.
(c)
Definition of other person
—(1)
In general.
As used in this section, the term “other person” means any person who directly pays the wages or supplies funds for the specific purpose of paying the wages of an employee or group of employees of another employer. It does not include a person acting only as agent of the employer or as agent of the employees.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Pursuant to an agreement between L, a labor union, and M, an employer, M makes monthly vacation payments (of a sum equal to a certain percentage of the remuneration paid to each union member employed by M during the previous month) to a union administered pool plan under which each employee's rights are fully vested and nonforfeitable from the time the money is paid by M. Vacation allowances are accumulated by the plan and distributed to eligible employees during their vacations. L, acting merely as a conduit with respect to these payments, would incur no liability under section 3505.

# Example 2.
N, a construction company, maintains a payroll account with the O Bank in which N deposits its own funds. Pursuant to an automated payroll service agreement between N and O, O prepares payroll checks and earnings statements for each of N's employees reflecting the net pay due each such employee. These checks are delivered to N for signature. After the checks are signed, O distributes them directly to N's employees on the regularly scheduled pay day. O, acting only in the capacity of a disbursing agent of N's funds, would incur no liability under section 3505 with respect to these payroll distributions. However, O may incur liability under section 3505 in the capacity of a lender if it supplies the funds for the payment of wages.
(d)
Payment of taxes and interest
—(1)
Procedure for payment.
A lender, surety, or other person may satisfy the personal liability imposed upon him by section 3505 by executing Form 4219 and filing it, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax and interest due the United States, in accordance with the instructions for the form. In the event that the lender, surety, or other person does not satisfy the liability imposed by section 3505, the United States may collect the liability by appropriate civil proceedings commenced within 10 years after assessment of the tax against the employer.
(2)
Effect of payment
—(i)
In general.
A person paying the amounts of tax required to be deducted and withheld by subtitle C of the Code as a result of section 3505 and this section is not required to pay the employer's portion of the payroll taxes upon those wages, or file an employer's tax return with respect to those wages, or furnish annual wage and tax statements to the employees.
(ii)
Amounts paid by a lender, surety, or other person.
Any amounts paid by the lender, surety, or other person to the United States pursuant to this section shall be credited against the liability of the employer on whose behalf those payments are made and shall also reduce the total liability imposed upon the lender, surety, or other person under section 3505 and this section.
(iii)
Amounts paid by the employer.
Any amounts paid to the United States by an employer and applied to his liability under subtitle C of the Code
shall reduce the total liability imposed upon that employer by subtitle C. Such payments will also reduce the liability imposed upon a lender, surety, or other person under section 3505 except that such liability shall not be reduced by any portion of an employer's payment applied against the employer's liability under subtitle C which is in excess of the total liability imposed upon the lender, surety, or other person under section 3505. For example, if a lender supplies $1,000 to an employer for the payment of net wages, upon which $300 withholding tax liability is imposed, a part-payment of $25 by the employer which is applied to this liability would reduce the employer's total liability under subtitle C of the Code by that amount, but the liability imposed upon the lender by section 3505(b) in an amount equal to the withholding tax liability of the employer, which is limited to 25 percent of the amount supplied by him, would remain $250. However, if the employer makes another payment of $200 which is applied to his liability for the withholding taxes, the lender's liability under section 3505 attributable to the withholding taxes is reduced by $175 ($225 less $50 (the amount by which the employer's liability exceeds the lender's liability after application of the limitation)). Thus, after the second payment by the employer, the lender's liability under section 3505(b) is $75 ($250 less $175), plus interest due on the underpayment for the period of underpayment, to a maximum of $250, 25 percent of the funds supplied.
(3)
Extensions of the period for collection.
Prior to the expiration of the 10-year period for collection after assessment against the employer, the lender, surety, or other third party may agree in writing with the district director, service center director, or compliance center director to extend the 10-year period for collection. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. If any timely proceeding in court for the collection of the tax and any applicable interest is commenced, the period during which such tax and interest may be collected shall be extended and shall not expire until the liability for the tax (or a judgment against the lender, surety, or other third party arising from such liability) is satisfied or becomes unenforceable.
(e)
Returns required by employers and statements for employees.
This section does not relieve the employer of the responsibilities imposed upon him to file the returns and supply the receipts and statements required under subchapter A, Chapter 61 of the Code (relating to returns and records).
(f)
Time when liability arises.
The liability under section 3505 and this section of a lender, surety, or other person paying or supplying funds for the payment of wages is incurred on the last day prescribed for the filing of the employer's Federal employment tax return (determined without regard to any extension of time) in respect of such wages.
(g)
Effective date.
These regulations are effective on August 1, 1995.
[T.D. 7430, 41 FR 35175, Aug. 20, 1976, as amended by T.D. 8604, 60 FR 39110, Aug. 1, 1995]
§ 31.3506-1
Companion sitting placement services.
(a)
Definitions
—(1)
Companion sitting placement service.
For purposes of this section, the term “companion sitting placement service” means a person (whether or not an individual) engaged in the trade or business of placing sitters with individuals who wish to avail themselves of the sitters' services.
(2)
Sitters.
For purposes of this section, the term “sitters” means individuals who furnish personal attendance, companionship, or household care services to children or to individuals who are elderly or disabled.
(b)
General rule.
For purposes of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to employment taxes), a companion sitting placement service shall not be treated as the employer of its sitters, and the sitters shall not be treated as the employees of the placement service. However, the rule of the preceding sentence shall apply only if the companion sitting placement service neither pays nor receives (directly or through an agent) the salary or wages of the sitters, but is compensated, if at all, on a fee basis by the
sitters or the individuals for whom the sitting is performed.
(c)
Individuals deemed self-employed.
Any individual who, by reason of this section, is deemed not to be the employee of a companion sitting placement service shall be deemed to be self-employed for purposes of the tax on self-employment income (see sections 1401-1403 and the regulations thereunder in Part 1 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations)).
(d)
Scope of rules.
The rules of this section operate only to remove sitters and companion sitting placement services from the employee-employer relationship when, under §§ 31.3121(d)-1 and 31.3121(d)-2, that relationship would otherwise exist. Thus, if, under §§ 31.3121(d)-1 and 31.3121(d)-2, a sitter is considered to be the employee of the individual for whom the sitting is performed rather than the employee of the companion sitting placement service, this section has no effect upon that employee-employer relationship.
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X is an agency that places babysitters with individuals who desire babysitting services. X furnishes all the sitters with an instruction manual regarding their conduct and appearance, requires them to file semimonthly reports, and determines the total fee to be charged the individual for whom the sitting is performed. Individuals who need a babysitter contact the agency, are informed of the charges, and, if agreement is reached, a sitter is sent to perform the services. The sitter collects the entire amount of the charges and remits a percentage to X as a fee for the placement. X is a companion sitting placement service within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Therefore, since the agency does not actually pay or receive the wages of the sitters, X is not treated as the employer of the sitters for purposes of this subtitle. The sitters are deemed to be self-employed for the purpose of the tax imposed by section 1401.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that the individual for whom the sitting is performed pays to X the entire amount of the charges. X retains a percentage and pays the difference to the sitter. Since X actually receives and pays the wages of the sitters, X is the employer of the sitters.

# Example 3.
As a service to the community a neighborhood association maintains a list of individuals who are available to babysit. Parents in need of a sitter contact the association and are provided with a list of names and telephone numbers. The association charges no fee for the service and takes no action other than compiling the list of sitters and making it available to members of the community. Issues such as hours of work, amount of payment, and the method by which the services are performed are all resolved between the sitter and parent. A, a parent, used the list to hire B to sit for A's child. B performs the services four days a week in A's home and follows specific instructions given by A. Under § 31.3121(d)-1, B is the employee of A rather than the employee of the neighborhood association. Consequently, this section does not apply and B remains the employee of A.
(f)
Effective date.
This section shall apply to remuneration received after December 31, 1974.
(Secs. 3506 and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; 91 Stat. 1356 (26 U.S.C. 3506); 68A Stat. 917 (26 U.S.C. 7805))

§ 31.3507-1
Advance payments of earned income credit.
(a)
General rule
—(1)
In general.
Every employer paying wages after June 30, 1979, to an employee with respect to whom an earned income credit advance payment certificate is in effect must, at the time of paying the wages, also pay the employee the advance earned income credit amount of that employee. For the purposes of applying this section and § 31.3507-2—
(i) In the case of an individual who receives wages which are subject to income tax withholding, the term “employee” has the same meaning as set forth in section 3401(c) and the regulations thereunder, and the term “wages” has the same meaning as set forth in sections 3401(a) and 3402(e) and the regulations under those sections; and
(ii) In the case of an individual who does not receive wages which are subject to income tax withholding, but who receives wages which are subject to employee FICA taxes, the term “employee” has the same meaning as set forth in section 3121(d) and the regulations thereunder and the term “wages” has the same meaning as set forth in section 3121(a) and the regulations thereunder.
An individual not having wages subject to either income tax withholding or employee FICA taxes is not entitled to advance payments of the earned income credit. Moreover, notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, employers are not required to pay advance earned income credit amounts to agricultural workers paid on a daily basis. For this purpose an “agricultural worker” is an employee who performs “agricultural labor”, as that term is defined in section 3121(g) and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Cross references.
For determination of the advance earned income credit amount of an employee, see paragraph (b) of this section. For rules relating to the treatment of the payment of an employee's advance earned income credit amount as equivalent to payment by the employer of withholding and FICA taxes, see paragraph (c) of this section. For rules describing the earned income credit advance payment certificate, see § 31.3507-2 (a) and (b). For rules relating to the employee's furnishing of the earned income credit advance payment certificate and the payroll periods for which the certificate is effective, see § 31.3507-2 (c) and (d).
(b)
Advance earned income credit amount.
The advance earned income credit amount of an employee is determined, with respect to any payroll period, on the basis of the employee's wages from the employer for the period and in accordance with the advance amount tables prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and then in effect for the payroll period. See, however, paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The advance amount paid is reflected on the employee's W-2 form as a separate item (and neither as a reduction of withholding nor an increase in compensation). For purposes of applying this section and § 31.3507-2, the term “payroll period” has the meaning set forth in section 3401(b) and the regulations thereunder. As required by section 3507(c)(2)(A), these advance amount tables must be similar in form to, and coordinated with, the tables prescribed under section 3402 (relating to income tax collected at the source). Sections 3507(c)(2)(B) and 3507(c)(2)(C) provide, respectively, separate rules for the treatment in the advance amount tables of the advance earned income credit of the following two separate classes of employees:
(1) Employees who are not married (within the meaning of section 143), or employees whose spouses do not have an earned income credit advance payment certificate in effect; and
(2) Employees whose spouses have an earned income credit advance payment certificate in effect.
If during the calendar year an employer has paid an employee amounts of earned income, within the meaning of section 43(c)(2)(A)(i), which in the aggregate equal or exceed $10,000, the employer need not make further payments of advance earned income credit to the employee during that calendar year.
(c)
Payment of advance earned income credit amount as payment of withholding and FICA taxes
—(1)
In general.
(i) The provisions of this paragraph (c) apply for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Payments of advance earned income credit amounts pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not constitute the payment of compensation. These payments by the employer are treated as made—
(A) First, from the aggregate amount, with respect to all employees, required to be deducted and withheld for the payroll period under section 3401 (relating to income tax withholding);
(B) Second, from the aggregate amount, with respect to all employees, required to be deducted for the payroll period under section 3102 (relating to employee FICA taxes); and
(C) Third, from the aggregate amount of the taxes imposed for the payroll period under section 3111 (relating to employer FICA taxes).
For purposes of the requirements of sections 3401, 3102, and 3111, as the case may be, and 6302, amounts equal to the advance earned income credit amounts paid to employees are treated as if paid to the Treasury Department on the day on which the wages (and advance amounts) are paid to the employees. The employer must report the payment and treatment of the advance amounts on the employer's Form 941, 941E, 942,
or 943, as the case may be, in accordance with the applicable instructions.
(ii) The provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Employer X has ten employees, each of whom is entitled to advance earned income credit payment of $10. The total of advance amounts paid by the employer to the ten employees for the payroll period is $100. The total of income tax withholding for the payroll period is $90. The total of employee FICA taxes for the payroll period is $61.30, and the total of employer FICA taxes for the payroll period is also $61.30. Under the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the total of advance amounts paid to employees is treated as if X had paid the Treasury Department on the day X paid the employees' wages: first, the $90 aggregate amount of income tax withholding; and second, $10 of the aggregate amount of employee FICA tax. X remains liable only for $112.60 of the aggregate FICA tax [$51.30 + $61.30 = $112.60].
(2)
Advance payments exceeding taxes due.
(i) if, for any payroll period, the aggregate amount of advance earned income credit amounts required to be paid by an employer under paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds the sum of the amounts for the payroll period referred to in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) (A) through (C) of this section, the employer reduces each advance amount paid for the payroll period by an amount which bears the same ratio to the excess of the advance amounts as the subject advance amount bears to the aggregate of advance amounts for the payroll period. However, this paragraph (c)(2) does not apply if the employer makes the election provided by paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(ii) The provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
Assume the same facts as the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, except that the employer is a state government which does not pay FICA taxes. Under these facts, the advance amounts would be $10 greater than the $90 total of income tax withholding for the payroll period. Assume 10 employees each receiving $10 in advance payments. Under the rule of this paragraph (c)(2), the employer X reduces the amount of the advance amount paid to each employer by
1/10
, computed as follows: $10/$100=
1/10
. This is the same result as would be obtained by reducing the advance payment of $10 for each of the ten employees by one-tenth 10/100 of the $10 excess or $1.00.
(3)
Election to treat excess amounts as advance tax payment.
In lieu of reducing advance payments under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an employer may elect under this paragraph (c)(3) to pay in full all advance earned income credit amounts. However, if no election is made, the employer is required to reduce advance amounts paid in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The election, if made, applies to all advance earned income credit amounts required to be paid for the payroll period. The employer reflects the election on the employer's Form 941, 941E, 942, or 943 as the case may be, and must specify (with supporting computations) the amount of the excess of advance amounts paid and the payroll period to which the excess relates. Separate elections may be made for separate payroll periods. The excess of advance amounts paid is treated as an advance payment by the employer of employment taxes described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section and due for the period reported on the Form 941, 941E, 942, or 943 which includes the payroll period during which the excess amounts were paid. The amount of the excess advance payment is applied to the amounts of the employer's liability—
(i) First, for income tax withholding due under section 3401 for the reporting period in which the payment is made;
(ii) Second, for employee FICA taxes due under section 3102 for the reporting period in which the payment is made; and
(iii) Third, for employer FICA taxes due under section 3111 for the reporting period in which the payment is made.
If the amount of the employment taxes (as described) for which the employer remains liable for the reporting period in which the excess payment is made is less than the excess payment, the employer may claim a refund of that portion of the excess amount paid which exceeds the employer's remaining liability for these taxes for the reporting period. This refund may be claimed, in the same manner as a refund of wage withholding taxes paid by the employer under section 3401, on the employer's Form 941, 941E, 942, or 943, as the case
may be, for the reporting period. In the absence of a claim for refund, that portion of the excess amount will be applied by the Internal Revenue Service against the employer's liability for employment taxes reported on the employer's Form 941, 941E, 942, or 943, as the case may be, filed for the next reporting period.
(4)
Failure to make advance payments.
The failure to pay an employee, at the time required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, all or any part of an advance earned income credit amount as required by this section is treated, for all purposes including penalties, as a failure by the employer as of that time to deduct and withhold under chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 an amount equal to the advance amount (or part thereof) not paid. This treatment applies to the failure to pay an advance amount to an eligible employee without regard to whether the employee is ultimately not entitled to claim the earned income credit (in full or in part) on a return for the year, so long as the employee has a valid earned income credit advance payment certificate in effect with the employer at the time when the wages were paid. If an employer fails to pay an advance earned income credit amount as required under this section, the advance amount will not be collected by the Internal Revenue Service from the employer if the employer has properly withheld and deposited all income taxes and FICA taxes applicable with respect to the employee. However, such amount may be collected if the employer has not properly withheld and deposited these taxes.

§ 31.3507-2
Earned income credit advance payment certificates.
(a)
Definition.
For the purposes of this section and § 31.3507-1, an earned income credit advance payment certificate is a statement furnished by an employee to the employer which—
(1) Certifies that the employee reasonably expects to be eligible to receive the earned income credit provided by section 43 for the employee's last taxable year under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 which begins in the calendar year in which the wages are paid:
(2) Certifies that the employee does not have an earned income credit advance payment certificate in effect for the calendar year (in which the wages are paid) with respect to the payment of wages by another employer, and
(3) States if the employee's spouse has an earned income credit advance payment certificate in effect with any employer. For the rule for determining if an employee's spouse has a certificate in effect, see paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(b)
Form and content of earned income credit advance payment certificate
—(1)
In general.
Form W-5 (Earned Income Credit Advance Payment Certificate) is the prescribed form for the earned income credit advance payment certificate. The Form W-5 must be prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto and must set forth fully and clearly the data therein called for. In lieu of the prescribed form, a form the provisions of which are identical with those of the prescribed form may be used.
(2)
Invalid certificates.
A Form W-5 does not meet the requirements of section 3507 or this section and is invalid if it is not completed or signed or contains an alteration or unauthorized addition (as defined in § 31.3402(f)(5)-1(b) (1) and (2)). Any earned income credit advance payment certificate which the employee clearly indicates to be false by oral statement or written statement to the employer must be treated by the employer as a certificate which is invalid as of the date of the employee's statement. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “employer” includes any individual authorized by the employer to receive earned income credit advance payment certificates or to make payroll distributions. If an employer receives from an employee an invalid certificate, the employer must consider it a nullity with respect to all payments of wages thereafter to the employee and must inform the employee of the certificate's invalidity. The employer is not required to ascertain whether any completed and signed earned income credit advance payment
certificate is correct. However, the employer should inform the district director if the employer has reason to believe that the certificate contains any incorrect statement.
(c)
When earned income credit advance payment certificate takes effect
—(1)
No previous certificate.
An earned income credit advance payment certificate furnished the employer where no previous certificate is or has been in effect with the employer for that employee for the calendar year takes effect with—
(i) The date of the beginning of the first payroll period ending on or after the date on which the certificate is received by the employer;
(ii) The date of the first payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period on or after the date on which the certificate is received by the employer; or
(iii) The first day of the calendar year for which the certificate is furnished, if that day is later than the otherwise applicable effective date specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(2)
Previous certificate.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(2), an earned income credit advance payment certificate furnished the employer where a previous certificate is or has been in effect with the employer for that employee for the calendar year takes effect on the date of the first payment of wages made on or after the first status determination date (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) occurring at least thirty days after the date on which the certificate is received by the employer. However, if the employer so chooses, the employer may treat the certificate as effective on the date of any payment of wages made on or after the date on which the certificate is received by the employer (without regard to any status determination date).
(3)
Certificate of spouse.
For the sole purpose of applying paragraph (a)(3) of this section, in determining if a certificate is in effect with respect to an employee's spouse, the spouse's certificate is treated as then in effect if the spouse's certificate will be or is reasonably expected to be in effect on the first status determination date following the date on which the employer receives the employee's certificate.
(4)
Status determination date.
For the purposes of this section, the term “status determination date” means January 1, May 1, July 1, and October 1 of each year.
(d)
Period during which certificate remains in effect; change of status
—(1)
Period certificate remains in effect.
An earned income credit advance payment certificate which takes effect during a calendar year continues in effect with respect to the employee only during that calendar year and until revoked by the employee or until another certificate takes effect. See paragraphs (d)(2) and (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Change of status
—(i)
Revocation of certificate.
If, after an employee has furnished an earned income credit advance payment certificate—
(A) The employee no longer wishes to receive advance earned income credit payments; or
(B) There has been a change of circumstances which has the effect of either making the employee ineligible for the earned income credit for the taxable year or causing a certificate to be in effect for the employee's spouse, then the employee must revoke the certificate previously furnished by furnishing the employer a new certificate (Form W-5 or identical form) in revocation of the earlier certificate. Depending upon the nature of the change of circumstances, the employer may be required, pursuant to the new certificate, to pay further advance earned income credit amounts to the employee (but in different amounts than previously paid to the employee). The Form W-5 (or identical form) must be prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto and must set forth fully and clearly the data therein called for. In the case of revocation due to change of circumstances, the new certificate in revocation must be delivered to the employer within ten days after the employee first learns of the change of circumstances. The new certificate is effective under the rules provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for later certificates. A new certificate furnished by an employee which is invalid within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)
of this section is considered a nullity with respect to all payments of wages thereafter to the employee. The prior certificate of the employee remains in effect, unless the employee clearly indicates by an oral or written statement to the employer that the prior certificate is invalid. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
The employer is not required to ascertain whether any employee has experienced a change of circumstances described in subdivision (i)(B) of this paragraph which necessitates the employee's furnishing a new certificate. However, the employer should inform the district director if the employer has reason to believe than an employee has experienced a change of circumstances as described if the employee does not deliver a new certificate to the employer within the ten day period.
(ii)
Change in spouse's certificate.
If, after an employee has furnished an earned income credit advance payment certificate stating that a certificate is in effect for the spouse of the employee, the certificate of the spouse is no longer in effect, the employee may furnish the employer with a new certificate which reflects this change of circumstances.
[T.D. 7766, 46 FR 10152, Feb. 2, 1981]
§ 31.3511-1
Certified professional employer organization.
(a)
Treatment as employer
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of the federal employment taxes and other obligations imposed under chapters 21 through 25 of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code (federal employment taxes), a certified professional employer organization (CPEO) (as defined in § 301.7705-1(b)(1) of this chapter) is treated as the employer of any covered employee (as defined in § 301.7705-1(b)(5) of this chapter), but only with respect to remuneration remitted by the CPEO to the covered employee.
(2)
Work site employee.
In the case of a covered employee who is a work site employee (as defined in § 301.7705-1(b)(17) of this chapter) of the customer, no person other than the CPEO is treated as the employer of the work site employee with respect to the customer for purposes of federal employment taxes imposed on remuneration remitted by the CPEO to the work site employee.
(3)
Non-work site covered employee.
In the case of a covered employee who is not a work site employee, a person other than the CPEO is also treated as an employer of the employee for purposes of federal employment taxes imposed on remuneration remitted by the CPEO to the employee if such person is determined to be an employer of the employee without regard to the application of this paragraph (a) and section 3511.
(b)
Exemptions, exclusions, definitions, and other rules
—(1)
In general.
Solely for purposes of federal employment taxes imposed on remuneration remitted by a CPEO to a covered employee, the application of exemptions, exclusions, definitions, and other rules that are based on the type of employer is presumed to be based on the type of employer of the customer of the CPEO for whom the covered employee performs services. If a covered employee performs services for more than one customer of the CPEO during the calendar year, the presumption described in the previous sentence applies separately to remuneration remitted by the CPEO to the covered employee for services performed with respect to each such customer.
(2)
Presumption rebutted.
The presumption set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be rebutted if either the Commissioner determines, or the CPEO demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence, that the relationship between the customer and the covered employee is not the legal relationship of employer and employee as set forth in § 31.3401(c)-1. If such a determination or demonstration is made, then, with respect to remuneration remitted by a CPEO to a covered employee, the application of exemptions, exclusions, definitions, and other rules that are based on the type of employer will be based on the type of employer of the person determined by the Commissioner or demonstrated by the CPEO to be the common law employer of the covered employee in accordance with § 31.3401(c)-1.
(3)
No inference from presumption.
The presumption set forth in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section does not create any inference with respect to the determination of who is an employer or employee or whether the legal relationship of employer and employee exists for federal tax purposes or for purposes of any other provision of law (other than for paragraph (b)(1) of this section).
(c)
Annual wage limitation, contribution base, and withholding threshold
—(1)
CPEO has separate taxable wage base, contribution base, and withholding threshold.
For purposes of applying the annual wage limitations under sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) (relating to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, respectively), the contribution base under section 3231(e)(2) (relating to the Railroad Retirement Tax Act), and the withholding threshold under section 3102(f)(1) (relating to the Additional Medicare Tax), remuneration received by a covered employee from a CPEO for performing services for a customer of the CPEO within any calendar year is subject to a separate annual wage limitation, contribution base, and withholding threshold that are each computed without regard to any remuneration received by the covered employee during the calendar year from any other employer (including, if applicable, remuneration received directly from the customer receiving services from the employee). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a CPEO is treated as a successor or predecessor employer for purposes of the annual wage limitations and contribution base upon entering into or terminating a CPEO contract (as defined in § 301.7705-1(b)(3) of this chapter) with respect to a work site employee, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Performance of services for more than one customer.
If, during a calendar year, a covered employee receives remuneration from a CPEO for services performed by the covered employee for more than one customer of the CPEO, the annual wage limitation, contribution base, and withholding threshold do not apply to the aggregate remuneration received by the covered employee from the CPEO for services performed for all such customers. Rather, the annual wage limitation, contribution base, and withholding threshold apply separately to the remuneration received by the covered employee from the CPEO with respect to services performed for each customer.
(d)
Successor employer status
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of sections 3121(a)(1), 3231(e)(2)(C), and 3306(b)(1), a CPEO and its customer are treated as—
(i) A successor and predecessor employer, respectively, upon entering into a CPEO contract with respect to a work site employee who is performing services for the customer; and
(ii) A predecessor and successor employer, respectively, upon termination of the CPEO contract between the CPEO and the customer with respect to the work site employee who is performing services for the customer.
(2)
Non-work site covered employee.
A CPEO entering into a CPEO contract with a customer during a calendar quarter with respect to a covered employee who is not a work site employee at any time during that calendar quarter will not be treated as a successor employer (and the customer will not be treated as a predecessor employer) for purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section regardless of whether, during the term of the CPEO contract, the covered employee subsequently becomes a work site employee. Similarly, a CPEO terminating a CPEO contract with a customer during a calendar quarter with respect to a covered employee who is not a work site employee at any time during that calendar quarter will not be treated as a predecessor employer (and the customer will not be treated as a successor employer) for purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section regardless of whether, during the term of the CPEO contract, the covered employee had previously been a work site employee.
(e)
Treatment of credits
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of the credits specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section—
(i) The credit with respect to a work site employee performing services for a customer applies to the customer, not to the CPEO; and
(ii) In computing the credit, the customer, and not the CPEO, is to take into account wages and federal employment taxes paid by the CPEO with respect to the work site employee and for
which the CPEO receives payment from the customer.
(2)
Credits specified.
A credit is specified in this paragraph (e) if such credit is allowed under—
(i) Section 41 (credit for increasing research activity);
(ii) Section 45A (Indian employment credit);
(iii) Section 45B (credit for portion of employer social security taxes paid with respect to employee cash tips);
(iv) Section 45C (clinical testing expenses for certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions);
(v) Section 45R (employee health insurance expenses for small employers);
(vi) Section 45S (employer credit for paid family and medical leave);
(vii) Section 51 (work opportunity credit);
(viii) Section 1396 (empowerment zone employment credit);
(ix) Statutory employee retention credits that are similar to the employee retention credit in section 1400R and that provide disaster relief to employers in designated disaster areas; and
(x) Any other section specified by the Commissioner in further guidance (as defined in § 301.7705-1(b)(8) of this chapter).
(f)
Section not applicable to related customers, self-employed individuals, and other circumstances.
This section does not apply—
(1) In the case of any customer that—
(i) Has a relationship to a CPEO described in section 267(b) (including, by cross-reference, section 267(f)) or section 707(b), except that “10 percent” shall be substituted for “50 percent” wherever it appears in such sections; or
(ii) Has commenced a CPEO contract with the CPEO but such commencement has not been reported to the IRS as described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section; or
(2) To remuneration paid by a CPEO to any self-employed individual (as defined in § 301.7705-1(b)(14) of this chapter) in that capacity;
(3) To any CPEO contract that a CPEO enters into while its certification has been suspended by the IRS; or
(4) To any CPEO whose certification has been revoked or voluntarily terminated for periods after the effective date of revocation or voluntary termination.
(g)
Reporting and recordkeeping
—(1)
Reporting and recordkeeping for employers.
A CPEO that is treated as an employer of a covered employee pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must meet all reporting and recordkeeping requirements described in subtitle F of the Code that are applicable to employers in a manner consistent with such treatment.
(2)
Reporting on magnetic media
—(i)
In general.
A CPEO must file on magnetic media any Form 940, “Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return,” Form 941, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,” and Form 943, “Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees,” and all required accompanying schedules, as well as such other returns, schedules, and other required forms and documents as is required by further guidance.
(ii)
Waiver.
The Commissioner may waive the requirements of this paragraph (g)(2) in case of undue economic hardship (including economic hardship resulting from temporary software and technological issues). The principal factor in determining hardship will be the amount, if any, by which the cost of filing the return, schedule, or other required form or document on magnetic media in accordance with this paragraph (g)(2) exceeds the cost of filing on or by other media. A request for a waiver must be made in accordance with applicable guidance. The waiver must specify the type of filing (that is, the name of the form or schedule) and the period to which it applies. In addition, the waiver will be subject to such terms and conditions regarding the method of filing as may be prescribed by the Commissioner in further guidance.
(iii)
Magnetic media.
The term magnetic media means any magnetic media permitted under applicable guidance. These generally include electronic filing, as well as other media specifically permitted under the applicable guidance.
(3)
Reporting to the IRS by CPEOs.
A CPEO must report the following to the
IRS in such time and manner, and including such information, as the Commissioner may prescribe in further guidance:
(i) The commencement or termination of any CPEO contract (as defined in § 301.7705-1(b)(3) of this chapter) with a customer, or any service agreement as described in § 31.3504-2(b)(2) with a client, and the name and employer identification number (EIN) of such customer or client.
(ii) With any Form 940, Form 941, and Form 943 that it files, all required schedules, including, but not limited to, the applicable Schedule R (or any successor form), containing such information as the Commissioner may require about each of its customers under a CPEO contract (as defined in § 301.7705-1(b)(3) of this chapter) and each of its clients under a service agreement (as described in § 31.3504-2(b)(2)). A CPEO must file Form 940, Form 941, and Form 943, along with all required schedules, on magnetic media, unless the CPEO is granted a waiver by the Commissioner in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iii) A periodic verification that it continues to meet the requirements of § 301.7705-2 of this chapter, as described in § 301.7705-2(j).
(iv) Any change that materially affects the continuing accuracy of any agreement or information that was previously made or provided by the CPEO to the IRS, as described in § 301.7705-2(k) of this chapter.
(v) A copy of its audited financial statements and an opinion of a certified public accountant regarding such financial statements, as described in § 301.7705-2(e)(1) of this chapter.
(vi) The quarterly statements, assertions, and attestations regarding those assertions described in § 301.7705-2(f)(1) of this chapter.
(vii) Any information the IRS determines is necessary to promote compliance with respect to the credits described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and provided in section 3302.
(viii) Any other information the Commissioner may prescribe in further guidance.
(4)
Reporting to customers by CPEOs.
A CPEO must meet the following reporting requirements with respect to its customers in such time and manner, and including such information, as the Commissioner may prescribe in further guidance:
(i) Provide each of its customers with the information necessary for the customer to claim the credits described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(ii) Notify any customer if its CPEO contract has been transferred to another person (or if another person will report, withhold, or pay, under such other person's EIN, any applicable federal employment taxes with respect to the wages of any individuals covered by its CPEO contract) and provide the customer with the name and EIN of such other person.
(iii) If the CPEO's certification is suspended or revoked as described in § 301.7705-2(n) of this chapter, notify each of its current customers of such suspension or revocation.
(iv) If any covered employees are not, or cease to be, work site employees because they perform services at a location at which the 85 percent threshold described in § 301.7705-1(b)(17) of this chapter is not met, notify the customer that it may also be liable for federal employment taxes imposed on remuneration remitted by the CPEO to such covered employees, as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(5)
Information and agreements in any contract or agreement between a CPEO and a customer or client.
Any CPEO contract (as defined in § 301.7705-1(b)(3) of this chapter) between a CPEO and a customer or service agreement described in § 31.3504-2(b)(2) between a CPEO and a client must—
(i) In the case of a contract that is a CPEO contract—
(A) Contain the name and EIN of the CPEO reporting, withholding, and paying any applicable federal employment taxes with respect to any remuneration paid to individuals covered by the contract or agreement;
(B) Require the CPEO to provide to the customer the notices and information required by paragraph (g)(4) of this section;
(C) Describe the information that the CPEO will provide that is necessary for the customer to claim the credits specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and
(D) Require the CPEO to notify the customer that the customer may also be liable for federal employment taxes on remuneration remitted by the CPEO to covered employees if the work sites at which they perform services do not (or ever cease to) meet the 85 percent threshold described in § 301.7705-1(b)(17) of this chapter; and
(ii) In the case of a service agreement described in § 31.3504-2(b)(2) that is not a CPEO contract (and thus the individuals covered by that contract are not covered employees), or if this section does not apply to the contract under paragraph (f) of this section, notify, or be accompanied by a notification to, the client that the service agreement or contract is not covered by section 3511 and does not alter the client's liability for federal employment taxes on remuneration remitted by the CPEO to the employees covered by the service agreement or contract.
(h)
Penalties and additions to tax
—(1)
In general.
A CPEO that is treated as an employer of a covered employee under this section and that is required to meet the reporting requirements of an employer is subject to the same penalties and additions to tax as an employer with respect to such reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, penalties and additions to tax under sections 6651, 6656, 6672, 6721, 6722, and 6723.
(2)
Failures to timely make reports required under section 3511.
CPEOs are subject to penalty under section 6652(n) with respect to reports required to be made to the IRS in paragraphs (g)(1) and (3) of this section and reports required to be made to customers in paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
(3)
Failures to attach Schedule R.
A CPEO is subject to penalty under section 6652(n) for failure to attach Schedule R (or successor form) to Forms 941, 940, or 943 as required by paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section. A CPEO is also subject to penalty under section 6723 for failure to include the EIN of each customer on Schedule R of Form 941, 940, or 943. See § 301.6723-1 of this chapter for the application of the section 6723 penalty in the case of multiple failures on a single document.
(4)
Failures to file on magnetic media.
With respect to the requirement in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section that a CPEO must file Forms 940, 941, and 943, along with all required schedules, on magnetic media, a failure to file on magnetic media does not constitute a failure to file for purposes of section 6651(a)(1) nor does it constitute a failure to make a report for purposes of section 6652(n). Rather, the requirement to file Forms 940, 941, and 943 on magnetic media is a condition of maintaining certification as a CPEO.
(i)
Applicability date.
The rules in this section apply on and after May 3, 2019.

[T.D. 9350, 72 FR 43154, Aug. 3, 2007]
§ 31.6011(a)-1
Returns under Federal Insurance Contributions Act.
(a)
Requirement
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(5) of this section and in § 31.6011(a)-5 every employer is required to make a return for the first calendar quarter in which the employer pays wages, other than wages for agricultural labor, subject to the tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and is required to make a return for each subsequent calendar quarter (whether or not wages are paid therein) until the employer has filed a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6. Except as otherwise provided in § 31.6011(a)-8 and in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of this section, Form 941, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,” is the form prescribed for making the return required by this paragraph (a)(1). Such return shall not include wages for agricultural labor required to be reported on any return prescribed by paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The return shall include wages received by an employee in the form of tips only to the extent of the tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a).
(2)
Employers of agricultural workers.
Every employer who pays wages for agricultural labor with respect to taxes imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act must make a return for the first calendar year in which the employer pays such wages and for each subsequent calendar year (whether or not wages are paid) until the employer has filed a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6. Form 943, “Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees,” is the form prescribed for making the annual return required by this section, except that, if the employer's principal place of business is in Puerto Rico, or if the employer has employees who are subject to income tax withholding for Puerto Rico, the return must be made on Form 943-PR, “Planilla para la Declaración ANUAL de la Contribución Federal del Patrono de Empleados Agrícolas.” However, Form 943 is the form prescribed for making such return in the case of every employer of agricultural workers who is required pursuant to § 31.6011(a)-4 to make a return of income tax withheld from wages.
(3)
Employers of domestic workers.
Schedule H (Form 1040), “Household Employment Taxes,” is the form prescribed for use by every employer in making a return as required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in respect of wages, as defined in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, paid by the employer in any calendar year
for domestic service as defined in section 3510. Schedule H (Form 1040) is generally filed as an attachment to an income tax return; however, if the employer does not otherwise have an obligation to file an income tax return, Schedule H (Form 1040) may be filed as a separate return. If, however, the employer is required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to make a return on Form 941, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,” or under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to make a return on Form 943, “Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return For Agricultural Employees,” or under paragraph (a)(5) of this section to make a return on Form 944, “Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return,” the employer may choose instead to report wages with respect to domestic workers on such Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944. If such wages are included on Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944, the employer must also include Federal unemployment tax for the employee(s) on Form 940, “Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return,” under the provisions of § 31.6011(a)-3.
(4)
Employers in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(5), Form 941-PR, “Planilla para la Declaracion Federal TRIMESTRAL del Patrono,” is the form prescribed for use in making the return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the case of every employer whose principal place of business is in Puerto Rico, or if the employer has employees who are subject to income tax withholding for Puerto Rico. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(5), Form 941-SS, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands),” is the form prescribed for use in making the return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the case of every employer whose principal place of business is in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or if the employer has employees who are subject to income tax withholding for these U.S. possessions. Form 941 (or Form 944, as described under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, if the IRS notified the employer that Form 944 must be filed in lieu of Form 941) is the form prescribed for making the return in the case of every employer who is required pursuant to § 31.6011(a)-4 to make a return of income tax withheld from wages.
(5)
Employers in the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944)
—(i)
In general.
Employers notified of their qualification for the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) are required to file Form 944, “Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return,” instead of Form 941 (or Form 941-SS or Form 941-PR under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) to make a return as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Upon proper request by the employer, the IRS will notify employers in writing of their qualification for the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944). The IRS will notify employers when they no longer qualify for the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) and must file Forms 941 instead. Qualified employers are those with an estimated annual employment tax liability (that is, social security, Medicare, and withheld Federal income taxes) of $1,000 or less for the entire calendar year, except employers required under—
(A) Paragraph (a)(2) of this section to make a return on Form 943, “Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees”; or
(B) Paragraph (a)(3) of this section to make a return on Schedule H (Form 1040), “Household Employment Taxes.”
(ii)
Requests to opt in or opt out of the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944).
The IRS has established procedures in Revenue Procedure 2009-51 published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin for employers to follow to request to participate in the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) (to opt in) and to request to be removed from the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) after becoming a participant in order to file Forms 941 instead (to opt out). The IRS will notify employers that their filing requirements have changed to Form 944 or Forms 941. Employers must follow the procedures in Revenue Procedure
2009-51 or its successor to request to opt in or opt out of the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944).
(b)
When to report wages.

§ 31.6011(a)-2
Returns under Railroad Retirement Tax Act.
(a)
Requirement
—(1)
Employers.
Every employer shall make a return for the first return period after 1954 within which compensation taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act is paid to his employee or employees for services rendered after 1954, and for each subsequent return period (whether or not taxable compensation is paid therein) until he has filed a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6. For calendar years after 1975, the return period shall be the calendar year; for calendar years prior to 1976, the return period shall be the calendar quarter. Form CT-1 is the form prescribed for making the return required under this paragraph. One original and a duplicate of each return on Form CT-1 shall be filed with the director of the service center.
(2)
Employee representatives.
Every employee representative shall make a return for the first calendar quarter after 1954 within which he is paid taxable compensation for services rendered after 1954 as an employee representative, and for each subsequent calendar quarter (whether or not he is paid taxable compensation therein) until he has filed a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6. Form CT-2 is the form prescribed for making the return required under this subparagraph. One original and a duplicate of each return on Form CT-2 shall be filed with the director of the service center.
(b)
When to report compensation
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, compensation taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act shall be reported in the return required under this section for the period in which it is deemed, under paragraph (d) of § 31.3231(e)-1 to be paid, unless under such section the compensation may be deemed to be paid in more than one return period, in which case it shall be reported only in the return for the first return period in which it is deemed to be paid.
(2)
Pre-1976 returns of employers required by State law to pay compensation on weekly basis
—(i)
In general.
If any employer is required by the laws of any State to pay compensation weekly in any calendar year prior to 1976, the return of tax with respect to such compensation may, at the election of such employer, cover all payroll weeks which, or the major part of which, fall within the period for which a return of tax is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. This provision shall not apply, however, to any payroll week which falls in two calendar years. Any employer who elects to file a return as provided in this subparagraph shall notify the district director in writing of such election and shall include therein a statement setting forth the facts which entitle him to make the election. Such notice shall be in duplicate and shall be attached to the original and duplicate of the return for the first period to which such election applies. Any election so made shall be binding upon the employer with respect to all returns subsequently made by him until the director of the service center authorizes or directs the employer to make a return on a different basis. For the purpose of determining the time when compensation is deemed to be paid in accordance with paragraph (d) of § 31.3231(e)-1 and of determining the due date of a return in accordance with paragraph (b) of § 31.6071(a)-1, the calendar month following the period covered by the return of an employer making such election is the same calendar month which would be determinative for such purposes if the employer had not made the election.
(ii)
Prior elections.
An election made by an employer, pursuant to the provisions of 26 CFR (1939) 410.501(b) (Regulations 100) or of 26 CFR (1939) 411.601 (b) (Regulations 114), which is in force and effect at the time the employer makes his first return under this section shall satisfy the requirements of
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section with respect to the making of an election and shall be binding upon the employer with respect to all returns made by him under this section until the director of the service center authorizes or directs the employer to make a return on a different basis.
(iii)
Example.
Employer X is required by State law to pay his employees within 6 days after the compensation is earned. In compliance with the State law, employer X, for services rendered to him for the payroll week of June 27 to July 2, 1955, pays his employees on the last-named date. June 1955 is the last month of a period for which a return of tax is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Employer X may elect to include in the return required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the period April 1 to June 30, 1955, the compensation paid to his employees for the payroll week of June 27 to July 2, 1955, inclusive, although the compensation for July 1 and 2 falls within another period for which a return is required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If, in this example, the payroll week ended on July 5, 1955, the compensation paid for the payroll week of June 29 to July 5 would be included in the return period in which July falls although the compensation earned for June 29 and 30 fell in a prior return period under the general rule.
(c)
Time and place for filing returns.
For provisions relating to the time and place for filing returns, see §§ 31.6071 (a)-1 and 31.6091-1, respectively.

The return shall be made on Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.” The form to be used by residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands is Form 1040-SS, “U.S. Self-Employment Tax Return (Including Additional Child Tax Credit for Bona Fide Residents of Puerto Rico).” The form to be used by residents of Puerto Rico is either Form 1040-SS or Form 1040-PR, “Planilla para la Declaración de la Contribución Federal sobre el Trabajo por Cuenta Propia (Incluyendo el Crédito Tributario Adicional por Hijos para Residentes Bona Fide de Puerto Rico).”

—(i)
In general.
Employers notified of their qualification for the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) are required to file Form 944, “Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return,” instead of Form 941 to make a return of income tax withheld from wages pursuant to section 3402.

The IRS will notify employers when they no longer qualify for the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) and must file Forms 941 instead. Qualified employers are those with an estimated annual employment tax liability (that is, social security, Medicare, and withheld federal income taxes) of $1,000 or less for the entire calendar year, except employers required under—
(A) Paragraph (a)(3) of this section to make a return on Form 943, “Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees”; or

The IRS will notify employers that their filing requirements have changed to Form 944 or Forms 941. Employers must follow the procedures in Revenue Procedure 2009-51 or its successor to opt in or opt out of the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944).
(b)
Withheld from nonpayroll payments.
Every person required to withhold tax from nonpayroll payments for calendar year 1994 must make a return for calendar year 1994 and for any subsequent calendar year in which the person is required to withhold such tax until the person makes a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6. Every person not required to withhold tax from nonpayroll payments for calendar year 1994 must make a return for the first calendar year after 1994 in which the person is required to withhold such tax and for any subsequent calendar year in which the person is required to withhold such tax until the person makes a final return in accordance with § 31.6011(a)-6.

An employer (or other person) who is required to make a return on a particular form pursuant to § 31.6011(a)-1, § 31.6011(a)-4, or § 31.6011(a)-5, and who in any return period ceases to pay wages or nonpayroll payments in respect of which he is required to make a return on that form, must make the return for the period as a final return. Each return made as a final return shall be marked “Final return” by the person filing the return. Every such person filing a final return (other than a final return on Form 942 or Form 943) must furnish information showing the date of the last payment of wages (as defined in section 3121(a) or section 3401(a)), and, if appropriate, the date of the last payment of nonpayroll payments defined in § 31.6011(a)-4(b).

If (i) for any return period an employer makes a final return on a particular form, and (ii) after the close of such period the employer pays wages, as defined in section 3121(a) or section 3401(a), in respect of which the same or a different return form is prescribed, such employer shall make returns on the appropriate return form.

§ 31.6011(a)-7
Execution of returns.
(a)
In general.
Each return required under the regulations in this part, together with any prescribed copies or supporting data, shall be filled in and disposed of in accordance with the forms, instructions, and regulations applicable thereto. The return shall be carefully prepared so as fully and accurately to set forth the data required to be furnished therein. Returns which have not been so prepared will not be accepted as meeting the requirements of the regulations in this part. The return may be made by an agent in the name of the person required to make the return if an acceptable power of attorney is filed with the internal revenue office with which such person is required to file his returns and if such
return includes all taxes required to be reported by such person on such return for the period covered by the return. Only one return on any one prescribed form for a return period shall be filed by or for a taxpayer. Any supplemental return made on such form in accordance with § 31.6205-1 shall constitute a part of the return which it supplements. Except as may be provided under procedures authorized by the Commissioner with respect ot taxes imposed by the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, consolidated returns of two or more employers are not permitted, as for example, returns of a parent and a subsidiary corporation. For provisions relating to the filing of returns of the taxes imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and of income tax withheld under section 3402 in the case of governmental employers see §§ 31.3122 and 31.3404-1.
(b)
Use of prescribed forms
—(1)
In general.
Copies of the prescribed return forms will so far as possible be regularly furnished taxpayers by the Internal Revenue Service. A taxpayer will not be excused from making a return, however, by the fact that no return form has been furnished to him. Taxpayers not supplied with the proper forms should make application therefor to an internal revenue office in ample time to have their returns prepared, verified, and filed on or before the due date with the internal revenue office with which they are required to file their returns. See §§ 31.6071 (a)-1 and 31.6091-1, relating, respectively, to the time and place for filing returns. In the absence of a prescribed return form, a statement made by a taxpayer disclosing the aggregate amount of wages or compensation reportable on such form for the period in respect of which a return is required and the amount of taxes due may be accepted as a tentative return. If filed within the prescribed time, the statement so made will relieve the taxpayer from liability for the addition to tax imposed for the delinquent filing of the return, provided that without unnecessary delay such tentative return is supplemented by a return made on the proper form. For additions to the tax in case of failure to file a return within the prescribed time, see the provisions of § 301.6651-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
In any case where the use of Form W-2 is required from the purpose of making a return or reporting information, such requirement may be satisfied by submitting the information required by such form on magnetic tape or by other media, provided that the prior consent of the Commissioner of Social Security (or other authorized officer or employee thereof has been obtained.
(c)
Signing and verification.
For provisions relating to the signing of returns, see § 31.6061-1. For provisions relating to the verifying of returns, see § 31.6065(a)-1.
(d)
Reporting of identifying numbers.
For provisions relating to the reporting of identifying number on returns required under the regulations in this part, see § 31.6109-1.

§ 31.6011(a)-8
Composite return in lieu of specified form.
The Commissioner may authorize the use, at the option of the employer, of a composite return in lieu of any form specified in this part for use by an employer, subject to such conditions, limitations, and special rules governing the preparation, execution, filing, and correction thereof as the Commissioner may deem appropriate. Such composite return shall consist of a form prescribed ty the Commissioner and an attachment or attachments of magnetic tape or other approved media. Notwithstanding any provisions in this part to the contrary, a single form and attachment may comprise the returns of more than one employer. To the extent that the use of a compsoite return has been authorized by the Commissioner, references in this part to a specific form for use by the employer shall be deemed to refer also to a composite return under this section.
[T.D. 7200, 37 FR 16544, Aug. 16, 1972]
§ 31.6011(a)-9
Instructions to forms control as to which form is to be used.
Notwithstanding provisions in this part which specify the use of a particular form for a return or other document required by this part, the use of a different form may be required by the latter form's instructions. In such case, the latter form shall be completed in accordance with its instructions.
[T.D. 7351, 40 FR 17145, Apr. 17, 1975]
§ 31.6011(a)-10
Instructions to forms may waive filing requirement in case of no liability tax returns.
Notwithstanding provisions in this part which require that a tax return be filed, the instructions to the form on which a return of tax is otherwise required by this part to be made may waive such requirement with respect to a particular class or classes of no liability tax returns. Returns in a class for which such requirement has been so waived need not be made.
This Treasury decision is not adverse to any taxpayer. For this reason, it is found unnecessary to issue this Treasury decision with notice and public procedure under subsection (b) of section 553 of title 5 of the United States Code or subject to the effective date limitation of subsection (d) of that section.

The payor and the employer may at their option enter into an agency agreement valid under local law whereby the employer designates the payor to be the employer's agent for purposes of fulfilling the requirements of this section. This agreement must specify what portion, if any, of the sick pay is excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(3). If they enter into such an agreement, the payor shall not provide the statement required by paragraph (a) but shall instead furnish statements that meet all of the requirements of paragraph (b), except that the agreement must provide that the payor will furnish the statements with the payor's, rather than the employer's name, address, and Employer Identification Number (EIN) if “Sick Pay Statement Furnished under an Agency Agreement with Your Employer” appears in the box labelled “Employer's Use” on Form W-2. Paragraph (a)(2) remains applicable to statements furnished under this paragraph. In the case of sick pay paid under a multiemployer plan pursuant to a collectively bargained agreement, an amendment to either the multiemployer plan or the collectively bargained agreement designating the payor to be the employers' agent for purposes of fulfilling the requirements of this section shall be deemed an agency agreement that fulfills the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph.
(d)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the terms “payor”, “payee”, and “sick pay” shall have the same meaning as ascribed thereto in section 3402(o) and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of this section, the term “employer” shall have the same meaning as ascribed thereto in section
3401(d) and the regulations thereunder, except that the term “employer” shall not include the payor for purposes of this section.

(3) The provisions of section 6109 (relating to identifying numbers) and the regulations in this part and part 301 under section 6109 shall be applicable to Form W-2 and to any payee of sick pay to whom a statement on Form W-2 is required by this section to be furnished. The employer must include the social security number of the payee on all copies of Forms W-2. The employer may truncate the payee's social security number to appear in the form of a TTIN on copies of Forms W-2 that are furnished to the payee. For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see § 301.6109-4 of this chapter.

§ 31.6053-1
Report of tips by employee to employer.
(a)
Requirement that tips be reported
—(1)
In general.
An employee who receives, in the course of employment by an employer, tips that constitute wages as defined in section 3121(a) or section 3401, or compensation as defined in section 3231(e), must furnish to the employer a statement, or statements, disclosing the total amount of the tips received by the employee in the course of employment by the employer. Tips received by an employee in a calendar month in the course of employment by an employer that are required to be reported to the employer must be reported on or before the 10th day of the following month. For example, tips received by an employee in January 2000 are required to be reported by the employee to the employer on or before February 10, 2000.

(b)
Statement for use in reporting tips
—(1)
In general.
The statement described in paragraph (a) of this section can be provided on paper or transmitted electronically. The statement must be signed by the employee and must disclose:
(i) The name, address, and social security number of the employee.
(ii) The name and address of the employer.
(iii) The period for which, and the date on which, the statement is furnished. If the statement is for a period of less than 1 calendar month, the beginning and ending dates of the period must be included (for example, January 1 through January 8, 1998).
(iv) The total amount of tips received by the employee during the period covered by the statement which are required to be reported to the employer (see paragraph (a) of this section).
(2)
Form of statement
—(i)
In general.
No particular form is prescribed for use in furnishing the statement required by this section. The statement may be furnished on paper or transmitted electronically. An electronic system and all tip statements generated by that system must meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. If the employer does not provide any other means for the employee to report tips, the employee may use Form 4070, “Employee's Report of Tips to Employer.”
(ii)
Single-purpose forms.
A statement may be furnished on an employer-provided form. The form may be on paper or in electronic form. An employer that provides a paper form must make blank copies of the form readily available to all tipped employees. Any form, whether paper or electronic, provided by an employer for use by its tipped employees solely to report tips must meet all the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Regularly used forms.
Instead of requiring that tips be reported as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section on a special form used solely for tip reporting, an employer may prescribe regularly used forms for use by employees in reporting tips. A regularly used form may be on paper or in electronic form (such as a time card or report), must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section, must contain identifying information that will ensure accurate identification of the employee by the employer, and is permitted to be used
only if the employer furnishes the employee a statement suitable for retention showing the amount of tips reported by the employee for the period. The employer statement may be furnished when the employee reports the tips, when wages are first paid following the reporting of tips by the employee, or within a short time after the wages are paid. The employer may meet this requirement, for example, through the use of a payroll check stub or other payroll document regularly furnished (if not less frequent than monthly) by the employer to the employee showing gross pay and deductions.
(c)
Period covered by, and due date of, tip statement
—(1)
In general.
A tip statement furnished by an employee to an employer may not cover a period greater than 1 calendar month. An employer may, however, require the submission of a statement in respect of a specified period of time, for example, on a weekly or biweekly basis, regular payroll period, etc. An employer may specify, subject to the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, the time within which, or the date on which, the statement for a specified period of time should be submitted by the employee. For example, a statement covering a payroll period may be required to be submitted on the first (or second) day following the close of the payroll period. A statement submitted by an employee after the date specified by the employer for its submission nevertheless is a statement furnished pursuant to section 6053(a) and this section if it is submitted to the employer on or before the 10th day following the month in which the tips were received.
(2)
Termination of employment.
If an employee's employment terminates, the employee must furnish a tip statement to the employer when the employee ceases to perform services for the employer. A statement submitted by an employee after the date on which the employee ceases to perform services for the employer is a statement furnished pursuant to section 6053(a) and this section if the statement is submitted to the employer on or before the earlier of the day on which the final wage payment is made by the employer to the employee or the 10th day following the month in which the tips were received.
(d)
Requirements for electronic systems
—(1)
In general.
The electronic system must ensure that the information received is the information transmitted by the employee and must document all occasions of access that result in the transmission of a tip statement. In addition, the design and operation of the electronic system, including access procedures, must make it reasonably certain that the person accessing the system and transmitting the statement is the employee identified in the statement transmitted.
(2)
Same information as on paper statement.
The electronic tip statement must provide the employer with all the information required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(3)
Signature.
The electronic tip statement must be signed by the employee. The electronic signature must identify the employee transmitting the electronic tip statement and must authenticate and verify the transmission. For this purpose, the terms
authenticate
and
verify
have the same meanings as they do when applied to a written signature on a paper tip statement. Any form of electronic signature that satisfies the foregoing requirements is permissible.
(4)
Copies of electronic tip statements.
Upon request by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the employer must supply the IRS with a hard copy of the electronic tip statement and a statement that, to the best of the employer's knowledge, the electronic tip statement was filed by the named employee. The hard copy of the electronic tip statement must provide the information required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but need not be a facsimile of Form 4070 or any employer-designed form.
(5)
Record retention.
The record retention requirements applicable to automatic data processing systems also apply to electronic tip reporting systems.
(6)
Effective date.
The provisions pertaining to electronic systems and electronic tip reports are applicable as of December 13, 2000. However, employers
may apply these provisions to earlier periods.

(1) The amount of the employee tax imposed by section 3101 in respect of tips reported by an employee to his employer pursuant to section 6053(a) (see § 31.6053-1) exceeds
(2) The amount of employee tax imposed by section 3101 in respect of such tips which can be collected by the employer from wages (exclusive of tips) of such employee or from funds furnished to the employer by the employee,
the employer shall furnish to the employee a statement showing the amount of the excess. For provisions relating to the collection of, and liability for, employee tax on tips, see § 31.3102-3.
(b)
Form of statement.
Form W-2 is the form prescribed for use in furnishing the statement required by paragraph (a) of this section, except that if an employer files a composite return pursuant to § 31.6011(a)-8 he may furnish to the employee, in lieu of Form W-2, a statement containing the required information in a form suitable for retention by the employee. A statement is required under this section in respect of an excess referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, even though the employer may not be required to furnish a statement to the employee under § 31.6051. Provisions applicable to the furnishing of a statement under § 31.6051 shall be applicable to statements under this section.
(c)
Excess to be shown on statement.
If there is an excess in respect of the tips reported by an employee in two or more statements furnished pursuant to section 6053(a), only the total excess for the period covered by the employer statement shall be shown on such statement.
[T.D. 7001, 34 FR 1005, Jan. 23, 1969, as amended by T.D. 7351, 40 FR 17145, Apr. 17, 1975]

In the case of the 1983 calendar year information return, the information required by paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) through (viii) of this section shall be reported for the period beginning with the first payroll period ending on or after April 1, 1983, and ending with the end of the 1983 calendar year. See paragraph (c) of this section relating to information required for the first quarter of 1983.
(3)
Prescribed form.
The return required by this paragraph shall be made on Form 8027 with the transmittal form being Form 8027T.

(4)
Time and place for filing.
The information return required by this paragraph (a) shall be filed on or before the last day of February (March 31 if filed electronically) of the year following the calendar year for which the return is made with the Internal Revenue Service Center specified by the Form 8027 or its instructions. See section 6652(a) relating to the penalty for failure to file this information return.
(5)
Large food or beverage establishment identification number.
Each large food or beverage establishment shall have a unique identification number to be included on Form 8027 and any employer's application pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section. If an identification number is changed for any reason, for example if the establishment becomes a different “type” of establishment as described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, or if the employer identification number changes, the employer shall notify the Service by including both the old and new identification numbers on the Form 8027 filed for the year in which the identification number was changed. An establishment identification number shall be determined as follows:
(i) The first nine digits shall be the employer's identification number (EIN).
(ii) The next digit shall identify the type of large food or beverage establishment, with the categories as follows:
(A) The number “1” signifies an establishment that serves evening meals only (with or without alcoholic beverages).
(B) The number “2” signifies an establishment that serves evening meals and other meals (with or without alcoholic beverages).

(iii) The last five digits are to differentiate between multiple establishments reporting under the same EIN number. For this purpose, the employer shall assign each establishment reporting under such employer's EIN number a unique five digit number. For example, each establishment could be assigned a unique number by beginning with “00001” and progressing in numerical sequence (
i.e.,
“00002”, “00003”, “00004”, “00005”) until each establishment has been assigned a number.

(4)
Employee's request for an early W-2.
If an employee's employment is terminated prior to the end of a calendar year and the employee requests an early W-2 under section 6051 and § 31.6051-1(d), a tip allocation under section 6053(c) is not required to be shown on such early W-2. However, the employer may include on such early W-2 the employee's actual tip allocation under section 6053(c), if known, or a
good faith estimate of such allocation. A good faith estimate of an allocation shall be signified by placing the word “estimate” next to the allocation on the employee's copy of the early W-2. An amended W-2 must be furnished to each employee to whom an amount is allocated under section 6053(c), during January of the calendar year following the calendar year for which the statement is made, if there is no tip allocation on the early W-2 or if the estimated allocation is found to vary from the actual allocation by more than 5 percent of the amount of the actual allocation.
(5)
Employee reporting of tip income.
Regardless of whether an employee receives an allocation under section 6053(c) and § 31.6053-3, the employee is required to report as income on his or her Federal income tax return all tips received. For tips received before October 1, 1985, an employee must be able to substantiate the amount of reported tip income as provided in section 6001 and the regulations thereunder, For tips received on or after October 1, 1985, an employee must be able to substantiate the amount of reported tip income as provided in § 31.6053-4.

—(1)
In general.
For the period beginning with the first day of calendar year 1983, and ending on the last day of the last payroll period ending before April 1, 1983, an employer must file an information return for each large food or beverage establishment that was a large food or beverage establishment on January 1, 1983, that contains the information required by paragraph (a)(1)(i)-(vii) of this section for such period.
(2)
Prescribed form.
The information return required by this paragraph shall be made on Form 8027. The returns for the first calendar quarter of 1983 and for calendar year 1983 may be incorporated onto a single Form 8027 but must separately set forth the required information for each of the two return periods.
(3)
Time and place for filing.
The time and place for filing the information return required by this paragraph shall be the same as for the calendar year 1983 information return. See paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(d)
Allocation of excess of 8 percent of gross receipts over the aggregate amount of reported tips
—(1)
In general.
An employer that operates a large food or beverage establishment shall allocate (as tips for purposes of the requirements of section 6053(c) among tipped employees at such establishment performing services during any payroll period an amount equal to the excess of:
(i) Eight percent of the gross receipts (other than nonallocable receipts) of such establishment for the payroll period, over
(ii) The aggregate amount of tips reported by employees at such establishment to the employer under section 6053(a) for such period. For this purpose, if an employee reports under section 6053(a) on the basis of a period other than a payroll period such employee may specify what portion of his or her reported tips are attributable to a given payroll period when reporting tips to the employer under section 6053(a). In the absence of any specification by the employee, the employer shall allocate the amount of tips reported by an employee to a given payroll period either:
(A) By multiplying the aggregate amount of those reported tips by a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross receipts attributable to the tipped employee for the payroll period and the denominator of which is the gross receipts attributable to the employee for the entire tip reporting period; or
(B) By multiplying the aggregate amount of those reported tips by a fraction, the numerator of which is the hours worked by the employee during the payroll period and the denominator of which is the total hours worked by the employee during the entire tip reporting period.
With respect to each establishment, the employer shall choose the method described in either paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) or paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section for a calendar year and apply such method consistently in making all allocations required by the preceding sentence. If an employee is
employed in more than one of an employer's food or beverage operations, such employee may specify what portion of his or her reported tips are attributable to a given operation when reporting tips to the employer under section 6053(a). In the absence of any specification by the employee, the employer shall allocate the amount of tips reported by the employee to a given food or beverage operation in a manner similar to that provided above for allocation of tips among payroll periods. The employer shall choose the method described in either paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) or paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section for a calendar year and apply such method consistently in making all allocations required by the preceding sentence.
(2)
Employer not liable to employees for allocations.
An employer who makes allocations (as tips for purposes of the requirements of section 6053(c) and this section) among such employer's employees in accordance with paragraph (d) and either paragraph (e) or (f) of this section shall not be liable to any employee if any amount is improperly allocated. However, if an employee's total tip allocations for a calendar year as reported on Form W-2 varies from the correct allocation amount by more than 5 percent of the correct allocation amount, the employer shall adjust such employee's allocation. If such an adjustment of an employee's allocation is required, the employer shall also review all tips allocations made to other employees in the same establishment to assure that the error did not distort other allocated amounts by more than 5 percent. Any adjustments made for variances of more than 5 percent shall be reflected in amended W-2's issued to the affected employees. Tip allocations made under this section shall have no effect on the withholding responsibilities of the employer under subtitle C of the Code. Withholding on tips is authorized only with respect to amounts of tips reported to employers by employees under section 6053(a).
(e)
Allocation pursuant to a good faith agreement.
The amount determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for each payroll period must be allocated among tipped employees providing services during such payroll period either on the basis of a good faith agreement described in this paragraph, or, if there is no good faith agreement applicable with respect to the payroll period on the basis of the allocation method provided in paragraph (f) of this section. A good faith agreement is a written agreement consented to by the employer and at least two-thirds of the members of each occupational category of tipped employees (
e.g.,
waiters, busboys, maitre d's) employed in the large food or beverage establishment at the time the agreement is adopted which:
(1) Provides for the allocation of the amount described in paragraph (d)(1) among tipped employees in a manner that, in combination with the tips reported by such employees under section 6053(a), will reflect a good faith approximation of the actual distribution of tip income among such tipped employees;
(2) Is effective prospectively beginning with the first day of a payroll period that begins after the date of adoption, but in no event later than the first day of the succeeding calendar year. However, a good faith agreement may be effective for calendar year 1983 if adopted on or before December 31, 1983.
(3) Is adopted at a time when there are tipped employees employed by the employer in each occupational category of tipped employees (
e.g.,
waiters, busboys, maitre d's) which would be affected by the agreement; and
(4) May be revoked prospectively by a written instrumnent adopted by a least two-thirds of the tipped employees who are employed in the establishment in occupational categories affected by the agreement at the time of the revocation. A revocation of an agreement shall be effective only at the beginning of a payroll period.
(f)
Allocation method to be used in the absence of a good faith agreement.
(1) In a case in which there is no good faith agreement in effect and the aggregate amount of tips reported pursuant to section 6053(a) with respect to a payroll period is less than 8 percent of the establishment's gross receipts for the payroll period, the employer shall allocate the difference as tips for purposes of section 6053(c) as provided in this
paragraph. No allocations shall be made to indirectly tipped employees. An allocation shall be made to each directly tipped employee performing services for the establishment who has a reporting shortfall (as determined under paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section) for the payroll period. The amount of each allocation shall be determined in the following manner:
(i) Multiply the amount of the establishment's gross receipts for the payroll period by 8 percent (0.08).
(ii) Determine the aggregate amount of tips reported for the payroll period by indirectly tipped employees.
(iii) Subtract from the amount determined under paragraph (f)(1)(i) the aggregate amount of tips reported by indirectly tipped employees as determined under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section. The excess is the directly tipped employees' aggregate share of 8 percent of the gross receipts of the establishment for the payroll period.
(iv) For each directly tipped employee, multiply the amount determined under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of gross receipts of the establishment for the payroll period that is attributable to the employee and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of gross receipts for the payroll period that is attributable to all directly tipped employees. The product is each directly tipped employee's share of 8 percent of the gross receipts of the establishment for the payroll period. The employer may determine the fraction described in the first sentence of this subparagraph by substituting for the numerator the number of hours worked by the directly tipped employee during the payroll period and by substituting for the denominator the number of hours worked by all directly tipped employees during the payroll period. For payroll periods beginning after December 31, 1986, the method of allocation described in the preceding sentence may be used only by an employer that employs less than the equivalent of 25 full-time employees (as defined in paragraph (j)(19) of this section) at the establishment during the payroll period.
(v) For each directly tipped employee, determine the excess, if any, of the amount determined under paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section over the amount reported as tips by the employee for the payroll period pursuant to section 6053(a). Such excess, if any, is the employee's shortfall for the payroll period.
(vi) Subtract from the amount determined under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section the aggregate amount of tips reported pursuant to section 6053(a) by all directly and indirectly tipped employees for the payroll period. The excess is the amount to be allocated as tips among directly tipped employees who had a shortfall for the payroll period as determined under paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section.
(vii) For each directly tipped employee who had a shortfall for the payroll period, multiply the amount determined under paragraph (f)(1)(vi) of this section by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of such employee's shortfall (determined under paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section and the denominator of which is the aggregate of all shortfalls for the payroll period for all directly tipped employees. The product is the employee's allocation for the payroll period.
(2) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X is a large food or beverage establishment that has chosen to make tip allocations using its actual payroll period and gross receipts attributable to employees. X had gross receipts for a payroll period of $100,000 and tips reported for the payroll period of $6,200. Directly tipped employees reported $5,700 while indirectly tipped employees reported $500.

# Example 3.
X is a large food or beverage establishment that has chosen to make tip allocations using a calendar year period. X had gross receipts for a calendar year of $2,000,000 and tips reported for the calendar year of $176,000. The amount to be allocated as tips is equal to the excess of 8 percent of the gross receipts of the establishment for the calendar year over the aggregate amount of tips reported by the employees of the establishment to the employer under section 6053(a) for the calendar year. Because the reported tips for the year ($176,000) are in excess of 8 percent of the gross receipts ($2,000,000 × .08 = $160,000), no tip allocations are made to the employees of this establishment for the calendar year.

Period of allocation.
In applying paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (h)(3) of this section an employer may substitute the calendar year or any period that results from a reasonable division of a calendar year for the term “payroll period” each place it appears in such paragraphs. If an employer makes such a substitution with respect to a large food or beverage establishment the substituted period shall be stated on Form 8027 for such large food or beverage establishment and shall be effective for such employer's large food or beverage establishment for the entire calendar year.
(h)
Lowering the percentage to be used
—(1)
In general.
On and after July 18, 1984, an employer or a majority of the employees (as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section) of an employer may petition the district director for the internal revenue district in which the employer's establishment is located to have the percentage of gross receipts that is used to determine the amount to be allocated under section 6053(c)(3)(A) and paragraph (d) of § 31.6053-3 reduced from 8 percent to the percentage that the petitioning employer or employees believe to be the actual percentage of the amount of the establishment's gross receipts that reflects the amount of tips. The district director may thereafter reduce the percentage of gross receipts used to determine the amount to be so allocated to the percentage that the district director determines to be the proper estimate of the actual percentage of gross receipts constituting tips. The district director, however, may not reduce the percentage below 2 percent. For the rules in effect prior to July 18, 1984, see 26 CFR 31.6053-3(h) (Rev. as of April 1, 1984).
(2)
Time and manner for petition to have percentage reduced
—(i)
In general.
The petition shall be in writing and shall include sufficient information to allow the district director to estimate with reasonable accuracy the actual tip rate of the establishment. For example, such information might include the charged tip rate, the type of establishment, menu prices, the location of the establishment, the amount of “self-service” required, the days and hours open for business, and whether the customer receives the check from or pays the server for the meal.
(ii)
Employer petitions.
In the case of employer-originated petitions, the employer has the burden of supplying sufficient information to allow the district director to estimate with reasonable accuracy the actual tip rate of the establishment. The employer also shall attach to the petition copies of Form 8027 (if any) filed for the establishment for the 3 years preceding calendar years.
(iii)
Employee petitions.
(A) In the case of employee-originated petitions, a majority of the employees of an establishment must consent to the petition. A majority for purposes of this paragraph is more than one-half of all the directly tipped employees (within the meaning of paragraph (j)(12) of this section) employed by the establishment at the time the petition is filed. In the case of a single petition for certain multi-establishment employers (see paragraph
(h)(4) of this section), more than one-half of the aggregate directly tipped employees (at the time the petition is filed) of the establishments covered by the petition must consent. The petition filed with the district director must state the total number of directly tipped employees employed by the establishment (or establishments) and the number of the directly tipped employees consenting to the petition.
(B) The petitioning employees have the burden of supplying sufficient information to allow the district director to estimate with reasonable accuracy the actual tip rate of the establishment to the extent they possess such information. If the employer possesses relevant information, the employer must provide such information to the district director upon the request of the petitioning employees or district director. Employees who file a petition under this paragraph must promptly notify their employer of the petition. Promptly upon receipt of such notification, their employer must submit to the district director copies of the Form 8027 (if any) filed for the establishment for the 3 immediately preceding calendar years. Any information supplied by the employer during the petitioning process constitutes return information (as defined in section 6103(b)(2)) which shall not be disclosed by the Internal Revenue Service (except as provided in section 6103) to any employees of the employer or to representatives of such employees.
(3)
Effective date for reduced percentage.
The district director shall determine the term for which the reduced percentage is to be effective. At the end of such term, the reduced percentage shall cease to apply unless previously extended by the district director for the district in which the large food or beverage establishment is located. In no event shall the reduced percentage be applied to payroll periods before the date the petition described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section is filed unless the establishment is a new business (as described in paragraph (i) of § 31.6053-3). In the case of a new business or a petition for reduction filed prior to September 30, 1983, the district director may allow the approved reduced percentage to be applied retroactively to the first day of the calendar year of the petition. Until such time as the employer is notified in writing by the district director of approval of a reduction, the employer must continue to use 8 percent of gross receipts for purposes of complying with section 6053(c) and this section.
(4)
Single petition for certain multi-establishment employers.
An employer (including a single employer as defined in section 52 (a) or (b)) or a majority of the employees of such employer may use a single petition for two or more of the employer's establishments if such establishments are essentially the same type of business, the petitioning employer or employees have made a good faith determination that the tip rates at such establishments are essentially the same, and the establishments are located in the same internal revenue region. Single petitions shall include the names and locations of the establishments for which a reduction is requested and the information required by paragraph (h)(2) of this section for a typical establishment. A single petition for multi-establishments located within an internal revenue region shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the greatest number of the establishments included in the petition are located. If there is an equal number of establishments located in two or more internal revenue districts the employer or employees petitioning may choose the district to which the petition is sent.
(i)
Application of reporting requirements to new businesses
—(1)
In general.
A food or beverage operation is a new business if the employer of the operation did not operate any food or beverage operations during the preceding calendar year. An employer will not be considered to have operated a food or beverage operation during a calendar year if each food or beverage operation of the employer was operated for less than one calendar month during such year. In a calendar year in which a food or beverage operation is a new business, the determination of whether the operation is a large food or beverage establishment shall be made as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section and the employer shall comply with
section 6053(c) and this section as provided in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
(2)
Determination of status as a large food or beverage establishment.
A food or beverage operation shall be considered a large food or beverage establishment during the calendar year in which it is a new business if the average number of hours worked per business day by all employees of the employer at the new business during each of any two consecutive calendar months of the calendar year, computed in the manner provided in the second sentence of paragraph (j)(9) of this section, is greater than 80 hours.
(3)
New business compliance under section 6053(c).
A new business that is determined to be a large food or beverage establishment under paragraph (i)(2) of this section shall comply with section 6053(c) and this section beginning with the first payroll period that begins after the first period of two consecutive calendar months described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
(j)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 6053(c) and this section:
(1)
Gross receipts.
Gross receipts shall include all receipts (other than nonallocable receipts), from the provision of food or beverages by a large food or beverage establishment from cash sales, charge receipts (including charged tips only to the extent the cash sales amount has been reduced due to the employer paying cash to tipped employees for charged tips due them), charges to a hotel room (excluding tips charged to a hotel room only to the extent that the employer's accounting procedures allow such tips to be segregated out and excluding charges that are otherwise included in charge receipts), and the retail value of complimentary food or beverages (as defined in paragraph (j)(16) of this section) served to customers. Gross receipts shall not include state or local taxes. In the case of a trade or business that does not charge separately for the provision of food or beverages (
i.e.,
a trade or business that provides other goods or services along with food or beverages for a combined price, such as a “package deal” for food and lodging), the employer shall make a good faith estimate of the gross receipts attributable to the provision of the food or beverages that reflects the cost to the employer of providing the food or beverages plus a reasonable profit factor.
(2)
Gross receipts attributable to a directly tipped employee.
Gross receipts attributable to a directly tipped employee are those gross receipts (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) from the provision of food or beverages to customers with respect to which the employee provided services. For example, if a directly tipped employee's name is on every check given to customers for whom the employee has provided services, the gross receipts attributable to such employee could be determined by aggregating the amounts of all checks bearing that employee's name (other than amounts from nonallocable receipts).
(3)
Nonallocable receipts.
Nonallocable receipts are receipts which are attributable to carryout sales or to services with respect to which a service charge of 10 percent or more is added. Carryout sales are sales of food or beverages for consumption off the premises of the establishment. Room service is not a carryout sale. If an establishment's accounting system does not segregate receipts from carryout sales from the establishment's other receipts, receipts from carryout sales may be determined as an estimated percentage of total receipts. The applicable percentage shall be determined in good faith by the employer on the basis of generally accepted accounting practices, including but not limited to, surveys of carryout sales as a percentage of gross sales. An employer may rely upon estimates as to carryout sales which are established in good faith between the employer and state or local governments for purposes of state or local taxation.
(4)
Charge receipts.
Charge receipts shall include credit card charges and charges under any other credit arrangement (e.g., house charges, city ledger, and charge arrangements to country club members). Charges to a hotel room may be excluded from charge receipts if such exclusion is consistent with the employer's normal accounting practices and the employer applies such exclusion consistently for a given large food or beverage establishment. Otherwise, charges to a hotel
room shall be included in charge receipts.
(5)
Charged tips.
A tip included on a charge receipt is a charged tip.
(6)
Food or beverage operation.
A “food or beverage operation” is any business activity which provides food or beverages for consumption on the premises (other than “fast food” operations). If an employer conducts activities that provide food or beverages at more than one location, the activity at each separate location shall be considered to be a separate food or beverage operation, Each activity conducted within a single building shall be considered to be conducted at a separate location if the customers of the activity, while being provided with food or beverages, occupy an area separate from that occupied by customers of other activities and the gross receipts of the activity are recorded separately from the gross receipts of other activities. For example, a gourmet restaurant, a coffee shop, and a cocktail lounge in a hotel would each be treated as a separate food or beverage operation if gross receipts from each activity are recorded separately. In addition, an employer may treat different activities conducted in the identical place at different times as separate food or beverage operations if the gross receipts of the activities at each time are recorded separately. For example, a restaurant may record the gross receipts from its cafeteria style lunch operation separately from the gross receipts of its full service food or beverage operations.
(7)
Large food or beverage establishment.
A food or beverage operation is a “large food or beverage establishment” if:
(i) The employer at the food or beverage operation normally employed more than 10 employees on a typical business day during the preceding calendar year, and
(ii) The tipping of food or beverage employees of the food or beverage operation is customary. Generally, tipping would not be considered customary for a cafeteria style operation (as defined in paragraph (j)(18) of this section) or for a food or beverage operation where at least 95 percent of its total sales are nonallocable receipts, within the meaning of paragraph (j)(3) of this section, by reason of the addition of a service charge of 10 percent or more. Total sales shall include only gross receipts (as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) and nonallocable receipts (other than carryout receipts) from the provision of food or beverages. In the case of an operation such as a restaurant that is a cafeteria style operation at lunch and that has full service with tipping customary at dinner, the entire operation is generally a large food or beverage establishment if the employer meets the 10-employee test. However, if the gross receipts of the cafeteria style operation at lunch are recorded separately from the dinner operation gross receipts the employer may treat the dinner operation as a large food or beverage establishment and the lunch operation as a separate food or beverage operation that is not a large food or beverage establishment due to the fact that tipping is not considered customary for cafeteria style operations.

The term “employee” has the same meaning as in section 3401(c) and § 31.3401(c)-1.
(9)
More than 10 employees on a typical business day.
An employer shall be considered to have normally employed more than 10 employees on a typical business day during a calendar year if one-half of the sum of the average number of employee hours worked per business day during the calendar month in which the aggregate gross receipts from food or beverage operations were the greatest plus the average number of employee hours worked per business day during the calendar month in which the aggregate gross receipts from food or beverage operations were the least, is greater than 80 hours. The average number of employee hours worked per business day during a month shall be computed by dividing the total number of hours worked during the month by all employees of the employer who are employed in a food or beverage operation by the average of the number of days during the month that each food or beverage operation at which such employees worked was open for business. If an employer operates both a food or beverage operation and a nonfood or beverage operation, and one or more of his or her employees work
for both operations, the employer may make a good faith estimate of the number of hours such employees worked for each operation in a given month. Similarly, in cases where one or more of an employer's employees work for more than one of such employer's food or beverage operations, a good faith estimate may be made of the number of hours such employees worked for each operation in a given month. For purposes of this subparagraph, employees who are employed in a food or beverage operation include all employees of the operation, not just food or beverage employees. The employees of an employer shall include all employees at all food or beverage operations who, along with the employees of such employer, would be treated as employees of a single employer under section 52 (a) or (b) (as in effect on September 3, 1982) and the regulations thereunder. For example, if an employer at a food or beverage operation is a member of a controlled group of corporations, then all employees of all corporations which are members of such controlled group of corporations shall be treated as employed by each such employer for purposes of this paragraph. However, an individual who owns 50 percent or more in value of the stock of a corporation operating an establishment shall not be treated as an employee of any establishment owned by the corporation.
(10)
Food or beverage employee.
A “food or beverage employee” is an employee who provides services in connection with the provision of food or beverages. Such employees include, but are not limited to, waiters, waitresses, busboys, bartenders, persons in charge of seating (such as a hostess, maitre d' or dining room captain), wine stewards, cooks, and kitchen help. Examples of employees who are not food or beverage employees include, but are not limited to, coat check persons, bellhops, and doormen.
(11)
Tipped employee.
A “tipped employee” of a food or beverage operation is an employee who is a food or beverage employee that customarily receives tip income from employment at that operation. An employee who occasionally receives small amounts of tip income is not a tipped employee. Generally, an employee who receives less than $20 per month in tip income would not be considered as customarily receiving tip income.
(12)
Directly tipped employee.
A “directly tipped employee” is any tipped employee who receives tips directly from customers, including an employee who after receiving tips directly from customers turns all the tips over to a tip pool. Examples of directly tipped employees are waiters, waitresses, and bartenders.
(13)
Indirectly tipped employee.
An “indirectly tipped employee” is a tipped employee who does not normally receive tips directly from customers. Examples of indirectly tipped employees are busboys, service bartenders and cooks. An employee, such as a maitre d', who receives tips both directly from customers and indirectly through tip splitting or tip pooling shall be treated as a directly tipped employee.
(14)
Calendar year.
The term “calendar year” shall mean either the period from January 1 through December 31 or the period that begins with the first day of the first payroll period ending on or after January 1 and ends with the last day of the last payroll period ending in December of the same year. With respect to any establishment, the employer shall choose one of these two descriptions and apply it consistently.
(15)
Tips reported for a specified period.
Tips reported to an employer for a specified period under section 6053(a) are those tips actually received by an employee during such period without regard to the time when the tips are reported to the employer. Thus, if an employee reports to the employer in calendar year 1984 tips the employee actually received in calendar year 1983, the amount of tips actually received in calendar year 1983 must be included by the employer when making such information returns, statements and allocations required under section 6053(c) and this section for calendar year 1983.
(16)
Complimentary food or beverages.
Food or beverages served to customers without charge are complimentary if:
(i) Tipping for the provision of such food or beverages is customary at the establishment, and
(ii) Such food or beverages are provided in connection with an activity that is engaged in for profit and whose
receipts would not be included in gross receipts as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section but for this subparagraph and are not nonallocable receipts which are attributable to services with respect to which a service charge of 10 percent or more is added.
For example, the retail values of complimentary hors d'oeuvres served at a bar or a complimentary dessert served to a regular patron of a restaurant would not be included in gross receipts because the receipts of the bar or restaurant would be included in gross receipts as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. The retail value of a complimentary fruit basket placed in a hotel room generally would not be included in gross receipts because tipping for the provision of such items is not customary. The retail value of complimentary drinks served to customers in a gambling casino would be included in gross receipts because tipping for the provision of such items is customary, the gambling casino is an activity engaged in for profit, and the gambling receipts of the casino would not be included in gross receipts as defined in paragraph (j)(1) of this section except for this subparagraph.
(17)
Fast food operation.
An operation is a “fast food” operation only if its customers order, pick up, and pay for food or beverages at a counter, window, etc., and then carry the food or beverages to another location (either on or off the premises of such activities).
(18)
Cafeteria style operation.
The term “cafeteria style” operation means a food or beverage operation which is primarily self-service and in which the total cost of food or beverages selected by a customer is paid prior to the customer's being seated or is stated on a check provided to the customer prior to the customer's being seated and is paid by the customer to a cashier. Generally, operations are primarily self-service if food or beverages are ordered or selected by a customer at one location and carried by the customer from such location to the customer's seat. For example, cafeteria lines, buffets, and smorgasbords are primarily self-service. If, after a customer is seated, a food or beverage employee delivers items such as an item that required additional preparation after being selected by the customer, condiments, beverages, or refills at no additional cost to the customer, a food or beverage operation's status as primarily self-service would not be affected.
(19)
Less than the equivalent of 25 full-time employees.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, an employer shall be considered to employ less than the equivalent of 25 full-time employees at an establishment during a payroll period (as defined in section 3401(b) and the regulations thereunder) if the average number of employee hours worked per business day during a payroll period is less than 200 hours. The average number of employee hours worked per business day during a payroll period shall be computed by dividing the total number of hours worked during the period by all employees of the employer who are employed in a food or beverage operation by the average of the number of days during the period that each food or beverage operation at which such employees worked was open for business. If an employer operates both a food or beverage operation and a nonfood or beverage operation, and one or more of his employees work for both operations, the employer may make a good faith estimate of the number of hours such employees worked for each operation in a given payroll period. Similarly, in cases where one or more of an employer's employees work for more than one of such employer's food or beverage operations, a good faith estimate may be made of the number of hours such employees worked for each operation in a given payroll period. If there is more than one payroll period for the establishment, the payroll period which is used for the greatest number of employees shall be the payroll period for purposes of this paragraph (j)(19). For purposes of this paragraph (j)(19), employees who are employed in a food or beverage operation include all employees of the operation, not just food or beverage employees. The employees of an employer shall include all employees at all food or beverage operations who, along with the employees of such employer, would be treated as employees of a single employer under section 52 (a) or (b) (as in effect on September 3, 1982) and the regulations thereunder.
For example, if an employer at a food or beverage operation is a member of a controlled group of corporations, then all employees of all corporations which are members of such controlled group of corporations shall be treated as employed by each such employer for purposes of this paragraph.
(k)
Permission to submit information on magnetic tape.
For rules relating to permission to submit the information required by section 6053(c) and this section on magnetic tape of other media, see § 31.6011(a)-8.
(l)
Recordkeeping requirements.
An employer shall keep records sufficient to substantiate any information returns, employer statements to employees, applications, or tip allocations made pursuant to section 6053(c) and this section. The records required by this paragraph shall be retained for 3 years after the due date of the return or statement to which they pertain.
(m)
Food or beverage operations outside the United States.
Employers at food or beverage operations outside the United States (as defined in section 7701(a)(9)) are not subject to the reporting requirements under section 6053(c) and this section.
(n)
Effective date.
This section is effective for calendar year 1983 and thereafter.

[T.D. 7906, 48 FR 36809, Aug. 15, 1983; 48 FR 40518, Sept. 8, 1983, as amended by T.D. 8039, 50 FR 29965, July 23, 1985; T.D. 8141, 52 FR 21511, June 8, 1987; T.D. 8895, 65 FR 50408, Aug. 18, 2000]
§ 31.6053-4
Substantiation requirements for tipped employees.
(a)
Substantiation of tip income
—(1)
In general.
An employee shall maintain sufficient evidence to establish the amount of tip income received by the employee during a taxable year. A daily record maintained by the employee (as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) shall constitute sufficient evidence. If the employee does not maintain a daily record, other evidence of the amount of tip income received during the year, such as documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), shall constitute sufficient evidence, but only if such other evidence is as credible and as reliable as a daily record. The Commissioner may by revenue ruling, procedure or other guidance of general applicability provide for other methods of demonstrating evidence of tip income. However, notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (a) (1), a daily record or other evidence that is as credible and as reliable as a daily record may not be sufficient evidence if there are facts or circumstances which indicate that the employee received a larger amount of tip income. Moreover, oral statements of the employee, without corroboration, cannot constitute sufficient evidence.
(2)
Daily record.
The daily record shall state the employee's name and address, the employer's name, and the establishment's name. The daily record shall show for each work day the amount of cash tips and charge tips received directly from customers or from other employees, and the amount of tips, if any, paid out to other employees through tip sharing, tip pooling or other arrangements and the names of such employees. The record shall also show the date that each entry is made. Form 4070A,
Employee's Daily Record of Tips,
may be used to maintain such daily record. In addition, an electronic system maintained by the employer that collects substantially similar information as Form 4070A may be used to maintain such daily record, provided the employee receives and maintains a paper copy of the daily record. The daily record of tips received by an employee shall be prepared and maintained in such manner that each entry is made on or near the date the tip income is received. A daily record made on or near the date the tip income is received has a high degree of credibility not present with respect to a record prepared subsequent thereto when generally there is a lack of accurate recall. An entry is made “near the date the tip income is received” if the required information with respect to tips received and paid out by the employee for the day is recorded at a time when the employee has full present knowledge of those receipts and payments.
(3)
Documentary evidence.
Documentary evidence consists of copies of any
documents that contain (i) amounts that were added to a check by customers as a tip and paid over to the employee or (ii) amounts that were paid by a customer for food or beverages with respect to which tips generally would be received by the employee. Examples of documentary evidence are copies of restaurant bills, credit card charges, or charges under any other arrangement (see § 31.6053-3(j)(4)) containing amounts added by the customer as a tip.
(b)
Retention of records.
Records maintained under this section shall be kept at all times available for inspection by authorized internal revenue officers or employees, and shall be retained so long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law.
(c)
Effective date.
The substantiation requirements of this § 31.6053-4 shall be effective for tips received on or after October 1, 1985. For the rules in effect prior to October 1, 1985, see section 6001 and the regulations thereunder. Substantiation considered sufficient as provided in this § 31.6053-4 will also be considered sufficient for tips received before October 1, 1985.
[T.D. 8141, 52 FR 21513, June 8, 1987, as amended by T.D. 8910, 65 FR 77820, Dec. 13, 2000]
§ 31.6060-1
Reporting requirements for tax return preparers.

In general.
A person that employs one or more tax return preparers to prepare a return or claim for refund of employment tax under chapters 21 through 25 of subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code, other than for the person, at any time during a return period, shall satisfy the recordkeeping and inspection requirements in the manner stated in § 1.6060-1 of this chapter.
(b)
Effective/applicability date.
This section is applicable to returns and claims for refund filed after December 31, 2008.

Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), each application shall be addressed to the internal revenue officer with whom the employer will file the return. Each application shall contain a full recital of the reasons for requesting the extension, to aid such officer in determining the period of the extension, if any, which will be granted. Such a request in the form of a letter to such internal revenue officer will suffice as an application. The application shall be filed on or before the due date prescribed in paragraph (c) of § 31.6071(a)-1 for filing the return, or on or before the date prescribed for filing the return in any prior extension granted.

§ 31.6205-1
Adjustments of underpayments.
(a)
In general.
(1) An employer who has underreported and underpaid employee Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax under section 3101 or employer FICA tax under section 3111, employee Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) tax under section 3201 or employer RRTA tax under section 3221, or income tax required under section 3402 to be withheld, with respect to any payment of wages or compensation, shall correct such error as provided in this section. Such correction may constitute an interest-free adjustment as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
(2) No correction will be eligible for interest-free adjustment treatment if the failure to report relates to an issue that was raised in an examination of a prior return period or if the employer knowingly underreported its employment tax liability.
(3) Every correction under this section of an underpayment of tax with respect to a payment of wages or compensation shall be made on the form prescribed by the IRS that corresponds to the return being corrected. The form, filed in accordance with this section and the instructions, will constitute an adjusted return for the return period being corrected.
(4) Every adjusted return on which an underpayment is corrected pursuant to this section shall designate the return period in which the error was ascertained and the return period being corrected, explain in detail the grounds and facts relied upon to support the correction, and set forth such other information as may be required by the regulations in this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return.
(5) For purposes of this section, an error is ascertained when the employer has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it.
(6) No correction will be eligible for interest-free adjustment treatment pursuant to this section after the earlier of the following:
(i) Receipt from the IRS of notice and demand for payment thereof based upon an assessment.
(ii) Receipt from the IRS of a Notice of Determination of Worker Classification (Notice of Determination) in connection with such underpayment. Prior to receipt of a Notice of Determination, the taxpayer may, in lieu of making a payment, make a cash bond deposit that would have the effect of stopping the accrual of any interest, but would not deprive the taxpayer of its right to receive a Notice of Determination and to petition the Tax Court under section 7436.
(7) Subject to the exceptions specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(6) of this section, Form 2504, “Agreement and Collection of Additional Tax and Acceptance of Overassessment (Excise or Employment Tax),” Form 2504-WC, “Agreement to Assessment and Collection of Additional Tax and Acceptance of Overassessment in Worker Classification Cases (Employment Tax),” and such other forms as may be prescribed by the IRS, constitute adjusted returns for purposes of this section.
(8) For provisions related to furnishing employee statements and corrected employee statements reporting wages and withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-
1. For provisions relating to filing information returns and corrected information returns reporting wages and withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-2.
(9) For the period of limitations upon assessment and collection of taxes, see § 301.6501(a)-1.
(b)
Federal Insurance Contributions Act and Railroad Retirement Tax Act
—(1)
Undercollection ascertained before return is filed.
If an employer collects less than the correct amount of employee FICA or RRTA tax from an employee with respect to a payment of wages or compensation, and if the employer ascertains the error before filing the return on which the employee tax with respect to such wages or compensation is required to be reported, the employer shall nevertheless report on the return and pay to the IRS the correct amount of employee tax. If the employer does not report the correct amount of tax in these circumstances, the employer may not later correct the error through an interest-free adjustment.
(2)
Error ascertained after return is filed.
(i) If an employer files a return on which FICA tax or RRTA tax is required to be reported, and reports on the return less than the correct amount of employee or employer FICA or RRTA tax with respect to a payment of wages or compensation, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for Additional Medicare Tax. The employer shall adjust the underpayment of tax by reporting the additional amount due on an adjusted return for the return period in which the wages or compensation was paid, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the adjusted return and any other information as may be required by this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the underpayment on an adjusted return constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the adjusted return is filed within the period of limitations for assessment for the return period being corrected, and by the due date for filing the return for the return period in which the error is ascertained. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the due date for filing the adjusted return is determined by reference to the return being corrected, without regard to the employer's current filing requirements. For example, an employer with a current annual filing requirement who is correcting an error on a previously filed quarterly return must file the adjusted return by the due date for filing a quarterly return for the quarter in which the error is ascertained. The amount of the underpayment adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the adjusted return is filed. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the adjustment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).
(ii) If an employer files a return reporting FICA tax for a return period although the employer was required to file a return reporting RRTA tax, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. However, if the employer also reported less than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax, the employer shall correct the underwithheld and underpaid Additional Medicare Tax in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The employer shall adjust the underpayment of RRTA tax by reporting the correct amount of RRTA tax on an original return for reporting RRTA tax for the return period for which the incorrect return was filed, accompanied by an adjusted return corresponding to the incorrect return that was filed to correct the erroneously reported and paid FICA tax. The adjusted return must include a detailed explanation of the amounts being reported on the original return and the adjusted return and any other information as may be required by the regulations in this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the correct amounts for the period constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the returns are filed
by the due date of the return for reporting the RRTA tax for the return period in which the error is ascertained. Pursuant to § 31.3503-1, the amount of erroneously paid FICA tax will be credited against the underpaid RRTA tax. Any remaining underpayment of RRTA tax adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the returns are filed in accordance with this paragraph. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the remaining underpayment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).
(iii) If an employer files a return reporting RRTA tax for a return period although the employer was required to file a return reporting FICA tax, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. However, if the employer also reported less than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax, the employer shall correct the underwithheld and underpaid Additional Medicare Tax in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The employer shall adjust the underpayment of FICA tax by reporting the correct amount of FICA tax on an original return for reporting FICA tax for the return period for which the incorrect return was filed (or an adjusted return for reporting the FICA tax if an original return was already filed for such return period to report the income tax required to be withheld under section 3402), accompanied by an adjusted return corresponding to the incorrect return that was filed to correct the erroneously reported and paid RRTA tax. The adjusted return(s) must include a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the original return and/or the adjusted return(s) and any other information as may be required by the regulations in this section and by the instructions relating to the form. The reporting of the correct amounts for the period constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the returns are filed by the due date of the return for reporting the FICA tax for the return period in which the error is ascertained. Pursuant to § 31.3503-1, the amount of erroneously paid RRTA tax will be credited against the underpaid FICA tax. Any remaining underpayment of FICA tax adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the returns are filed in accordance with this paragraph (b)(2)(iii). If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the remaining underpayment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).
(3)
Return not filed because of failure to treat individual as employee.
If an employer fails to file a return for a return period solely because the employer failed to treat any individuals properly as employees for the return period (and, therefore, failed to withhold and pay any employer or employee FICA or RRTA tax with respect to wages or compensation paid to the employees) and if the employer ascertains the error after the due date of the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. The employer shall report the amount due by filing an original return required to be filed to report the tax for the return period for which the employer failed to file a return, accompanied by an adjusted return as provided in the instructions to the adjusted return. The adjusted return must include a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the original return and adjusted return and any other information as may be required by this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the correct amount of tax for the return period constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the original and adjusted returns are filed by the due date of the return for reporting such tax for the return period in which the error is ascertained. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the due date for filing the adjusted return is determined by reference to the return being corrected, without regard to the employer's current filing requirements. For example, an employer with a current annual filing requirement who is correcting an error on a previously filed quarterly return must file
the adjusted return by the due date for filing a quarterly return for the quarter in which the error is ascertained. However, an adjustment of Additional Medicare Tax required to be withheld under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) may only be reported pursuant to this section if the error is ascertained within the same calendar year that the wages or compensation were paid to the employee, or if section 3509 applies to determine the amount of the underpayment, or if the adjustment is reported on a Form 2504 or Form 2504-WC. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The amount of the underpayment adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the returns are filed in accordance with this paragraph. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the adjustment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).
(4)
Additional Medicare Tax.
If an employer files a return on which FICA tax or RRTA tax is required to be reported, and reports on the return less than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax required to be withheld with respect to a payment of wages or compensation, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. An adjustment of Additional Medicare Tax may only be reported pursuant to this paragraph (b)(4) if the error is ascertained within the same calendar year that the wages or compensation were paid to the employee, unless the underpayment is attributable to an administrative error (that is, an error involving the inaccurate reporting of the amount actually withheld), section 3509 applies to determine the amount of the underpayment, or the adjustment is reported on a Form 2504 or Form 2504-WC. The employer shall adjust the underpayment of Additional Medicare Tax by reporting the additional amount due on an adjusted return for the return period in which the wages or compensation were paid, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the adjusted return and any other information as may be required by this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the underpayment on an adjusted return constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the adjusted return is filed within the period of limitations for assessment for the return period being corrected, and by the due date for filing the return for the return period in which the error is ascertained. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the due date for filing the adjusted return is determined by reference to the return being corrected, without regard to the employer's current filing requirements. For example, an employer with a current annual filing requirement who is correcting an error on a previously filed quarterly return must file the adjusted return by the due date for filing a quarterly return for the quarter in which the error is ascertained. The amount of the underpayment adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the adjusted return is filed. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the adjustment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).
(c)
Income tax required to be withheld from wages
—(1)
Undercollection ascertained before return is filed.
If an employer collects less than the correct amount of income tax required to be withheld from wages under section 3402, and if the employer ascertains the error before filing the return on which the withheld tax is required to be reported, the employer shall nevertheless report on the return and pay to the IRS the correct amount of tax required to be withheld. If the employer does not report the correct amount of tax in these circumstances, the employer may not correct the error through an interest-free adjustment.
(2)
Error ascertained after return is filed.
If an employer files a return on which income tax required to be withheld from wages is required to be reported and reports on the return less than the correct amount of income tax required to be withheld, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section.
The employer shall adjust the underpayment of tax by reporting the additional amount due on an adjusted return for the return period in which the wages were paid, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the adjusted return and any other information as may be required by this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the underpayment on an adjusted return constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the adjusted return is filed by the due date for filing the return for the return period in which the error is ascertained. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the due date for filing the adjusted return is determined by reference to the return being corrected, without regard to the employer's current filing requirements. For example, an employer with a current annual filing requirement who is correcting an error on a previously filed quarterly return must file the adjusted return by the due date for filing a quarterly return for the quarter in which the error is ascertained. However, an adjustment may only be reported pursuant to this section if the error is ascertained within the same calendar year that the wages to the employee were paid, unless the underpayment is attributable to an administrative error (that is, an error involving the inaccurate reporting of the amount actually withheld), section 3509 applies to determine the amount of the underpayment, or the adjustment is reported on a Form 2504 or Form 2504-WC. The amount of the underpayment adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the adjusted return is filed. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the adjustment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).
(3)
Return not filed because of failure to treat individual as employee.
If an employer fails to file a return for a return period solely because the employer failed to treat any individuals properly as employees for the return period (and, therefore, failed to withhold and pay any income tax required to be withheld from wages), the employer shall correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. The employer shall report the amount due by filing an original return for the return period for which the employer failed to file a return, accompanied by an adjusted return as provided in the instructions to the adjusted return. The adjusted return must include a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the original and adjusted returns and any other information as may be required by this section and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. The reporting of the correct amount of tax for the return period constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the original and adjusted returns are filed by the due date of the return for reporting such tax for the return period in which the error is ascertained. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the due date for filing the adjusted return is determined by reference to the return being corrected, without regard to the employer's current filing requirements. For example, an employer with a current annual filing requirement who is correcting an error on a previously filed quarterly return must file the adjusted return by the due date for filing a quarterly return for the quarter in which the error is ascertained. However, an adjustment may only be reported pursuant to this section if the error is ascertained within the same calendar year that the wages to the employee were paid, or if section 3509 applies to determine the amount of the underpayment, or if the adjustment is reported on a Form 2504 or Form 2504-WC. The amount of the underpayment adjusted in accordance with this section must be paid to the IRS by the time the returns are filed in accordance with this paragraph. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this section, but the amount of the adjustment is not paid when due, interest accrues from that date (see section 6601).
(d)
Deductions from employee
—(1)
Federal Insurance Contributions Tax Act and Railroad Retirement Tax Act.
If an employer collects less than the correct amount of employee FICA or RRTA tax from an employee with respect to a payment of wages or compensation, the employer must collect the amount of
the undercollection by deducting the amount from remuneration of the employee, if any, paid after the employer ascertains the error. If an employer collects less than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax required to be withheld under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a), the employer must collect the amount of the undercollection on or before the last day of the calendar year by deducting the amount from remuneration of the employee, if any, paid after the employer ascertains the error. Such deductions may be made even though the remuneration, for any reason, does not constitute wages or compensation. The correct amount of employee tax must be reported and paid, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, whether or not the undercollection is corrected by a deduction made as prescribed in this paragraph (d)(1), and even if the deduction is made after the return on which the employee tax must be reported is due. If such a deduction is not made, the obligation of the employee to the employer with respect to the undercollection is a matter for settlement between the employee and the employer. If an employer makes an erroneous collection of employee tax from two or more of its employees, a separate settlement must be made with respect to each employee. An overcollection of employee tax from one employee may not be used to offset an undercollection of such tax from another employee. For provisions relating to the employer's liability for the tax, whether or not it collects the tax from the employee, see §§ 31.3102-1(d), 31.3102-4(c), and 31.3202-1. This paragraph (d)(1) does not apply if section 3509 applies to determine the employer's liability.
(2)
Income tax required to be withheld from wages.
If an employer collects less than the correct amount of income tax required to be withheld from wages during a calendar year, the employer must collect the amount of the undercollection on or before the last day of the year by deducting the amount from remuneration of the employee, if any, paid after the employer ascertains the error. Such deductions may be made even though the remuneration, for any reason, does not constitute wages. The correct amount of income tax must be reported and paid, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, whether or not the undercollection is corrected by a deduction made as prescribed in this paragraph (d)(2), and even if the deduction is made after the return on which the tax must be reported is due. If such a deduction is not made, the obligation of the employee to the employer with respect to the undercollection is a matter for settlement between the employee and the employer within the calendar year. If an employer makes an erroneous collection of income tax from two or more of its employees, a separate settlement must be made with respect to each employee. An overcollection of income tax from one employee may not be used to offset an undercollection of such tax from another employee. For provisions relating to the employer's liability for the tax, whether or not it collects the tax from the employee, see § 31.3403-1. For provisions relating to the employer's liability for an underpayment of tax unless the employer can show that the income tax against which the tax under section 3402 may be credited has been paid, see § 31.3402(d)-1. This paragraph (d)(2) does not apply if section 3509 applies to determine the employer's liability.

Effective/applicability date.
Paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section apply to adjusted returns filed on or after November 29, 2013.

§ 31.6205-2
Adjustments of underpayments of hospital insurance taxes that accrue after March 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1987, with respect to wages of State and local government employees.
(a)
Adjustments without interest.
A State or local government employer who makes, or has made, an undercollection or underpayment of the hospital insurance taxes imposed by sections 3101(b) and 3111(b) that—
(1) Are required to be paid by reason of section 3121(u)(2), and
(2) Are required to be reported on returns due July 31, 1986, October 31, 1986, or February 2, 1987.
may make an adjustment without interest with respect to such taxes provided that all such taxes for the time period specified in paragraph (a)(2) (except for amounts that are subsequently paid pursuant to an interest-free adjustment under § 31.6205-1) are paid on or before February 2, 1987.
(b)
Example.
The application of the provisions of this section are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A State or local government employer should have withheld and paid $100 dollars in hospital insurance taxes for the quarter beginning April 1, 1986, and ending June 30, 1986. The due date for the return and payment for that period is July 31, 1986. If the employer made the payment by February 2, 1987, then, under section 6601, interest is not assessable with respect to the underpayment of the hospital insurance taxes. If the employer did not make the payment by February 2, 1987, the interest is assessable for the period from July 31, 1986, until the time of payment.

§ 31.6302-1
Deposit rules for taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and withheld income taxes.
(a)
Introduction.
With respect to employment taxes attributable to payments made after December 31, 1992, an employer is either a monthly depositor or a semi-weekly depositor based on an annual determination. An employer must generally deposit employment taxes under one of two rules: the Monthly rule in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the Semi-Weekly rule in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Various exceptions and safe harbors are provided. Paragraph (f) of this section provides certain safe harbors for employers who inadvertently fail to deposit the full amount of taxes. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides an overriding exception to the Monthly and Semi-Weekly rules where an employer has accumulated $100,000 or more of employment taxes. Paragraph (e) of this section provides the definition of employment taxes.
(b)
Determination of status
—(1)
In general.
The determination of whether an employer is a monthly or semi-weekly depositor for a calendar year is based on an annual determination and generally depends upon the aggregate amount of employment taxes reported by the employer for the lookback period as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(2)
Monthly depositor
—(i)
In general.
An employer is a monthly depositor for the entire calendar year if the aggregate amount of employment taxes reported for the lookback period is $50,000 or less.
(ii)
Special rule.
An employer ceases to be a monthly depositor on the first day after the employer is subject to the One-Day ($100,000) rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. At that time, the employer immediately becomes a semi-weekly depositor for the remainder of the calendar year and for the following calendar year.
(3)
Semi-weekly depositor.
An employer is a semi-weekly depositor for the entire calendar year if the aggregate amount of employment taxes reported for the lookback period exceeds $50,000.
(4)
Lookback period
—(i)
In general.
For employers who file Form 941, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,” (or any related Spanish-language returns or returns for U.S. possessions) the lookback period for each calendar year is the twelve month period ended the preceding June 30. For example, the lookback period for calendar year 2006 is the period July 1, 2004, to June 30, 2005. The lookback period for employers who file Form 944, “Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return,” or filed Form 944 (or any related Spanish-language returns or returns for U.S. possessions) for either of the two previous calendar years, is the second calendar year preceding the current calendar year. For example, the lookback period for calendar year 2006 is calendar year 2004. In determining status as either a monthly or semi-weekly depositor, an employer should determine the aggregate amount of employment tax liabilities reported on its return(s) (Forms 941 or Form 944) for the lookback period. The amount of employment tax liabilities reported for the lookback period is the amount the
employer reported on either Forms 941 or Form 944 even if the employer is required to file the other form for the current calendar year. New employers shall be treated as having employment tax liabilities of zero for any part of the lookback period before the date the employer started or acquired its business.
(ii)
Adjustments and claims for refund.
The employment tax liability reported on the original return for the return period is the amount taken into account in determining whether the aggregate amount of employment taxes reported for the lookback period exceeds $50,000. Any amounts reported on adjusted returns or claims for refund pursuant to sections 6205, 6402, 6413, and 6414 filed after the due date of the original return are not taken into account when determining the aggregate amount of employment taxes reported for the lookback period. Prior period adjustments reported on Forms 941 or Form 944 for 2008 and earlier years are taken into account in determining the employment tax liability for the return period in which the adjustments are reported.
(c)
Deposit rules
—(1)
Monthly rule.
An employer that is a monthly depositor must deposit employment taxes accumulated with respect to payments made during a calendar month by electronic funds transfer by the 15th day of the following month. If the 15th day of the following month is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia under section 7503, taxes will be treated as timely deposited if deposited on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
(2)
Semi-Weekly rule
—(i)
In general.
An employer that is a semi-weekly depositor for a calendar year must deposit employment taxes by electronic funds transfer by the dates set forth below:
Payment dates/semi-weekly periods
Deposit date
(A) Wednesday, Thursday and/or Friday
On or before the following Wednesday.
(B) Saturday, Sunday, Monday and/or Tuesday
On or before the following Friday.
(ii)
Semi-weekly period spanning two return periods.
If the return period ends during a semi-weekly period in which an employer has two or more payment dates, two deposit obligations may exist. For example, if one quarterly return period ends on Thursday and a new quarterly return period begins on Friday, employment taxes from payments on Wednesday and Thursday are subject to one deposit obligation, and employment taxes from payments on Friday are subject to a separate deposit obligation. Two separate federal tax deposits are required.
(iii)
Special rule for computing days.
Semi-weekly depositors have at least three business days following the close of the semi-weekly period by which to deposit employment taxes accumulated during the semi-weekly period. Business days include every calendar day other than Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays in the District of Columbia under section 7503. If any of the three weekdays following the close of a semi-weekly period is a legal holiday, the employer has an additional day for each day that is a legal holiday by which to make the required deposit. For example, if the Monday following the close of a Wednesday to Friday semi-weekly period is Memorial Day, a legal holiday, the required deposit for the semi-weekly period is not due until the following Thursday rather than the following Wednesday.
(3)
Exception—One-Day rule.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, if on any day within a deposit period (monthly or semi-weekly) an employer has accumulated $100,000 or more of employment taxes, those taxes must be deposited by electronic funds transfer in time to satisfy the tax obligation by the close of the next day. If the next day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia under section 7503, the taxes will be treated as timely deposited if deposited on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For purposes of determining whether the $100,000 threshold is met—
(i) A monthly depositor takes into account only those employment taxes accumulated in the calendar month in which the day occurs; and
(ii) A semi-weekly depositor takes into account only those employment taxes accumulated in the Wednesday-Friday or Saturday-Tuesday semi-weekly period in which the day occurs.
(4)
Deposits required only on business days.
No taxes are required to be deposited under this section on any day that is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Deposits are required only on business days. Business days include every calendar day other than Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays. For purposes of this paragraph (c), legal holidays shall have the same meaning provided in section 7503. Pursuant to section 7503, the term
legal holiday
means a legal holiday in the District of Columbia. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term “legal holiday” does not include other Statewide legal holidays.
(5)
Exception to the monthly and semi-weekly deposit rules for employers in the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944).
Generally, an employer who files Form 944 for a taxable year may remit its accumulated employment taxes with its timely filed return for that taxable year and is not required to deposit under either the monthly or semi-weekly rules set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section during that taxable year. An employer who files Form 944 whose actual employment tax liability exceeds the eligibility threshold, as set forth in §§ 31.6011(a)-1(a)(5) and 31.6011(a)-4(a)(4), will not qualify for this exception and should follow the deposit rules set forth in this section.
(6)
Extension of time to deposit for employers in the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) during the preceding year.
An employer who filed Form 944 for the preceding year but will file Form 941 instead for the current year will be deemed to have timely deposited its current year's January deposit obligation(s) under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section if the employer deposits the amount of such deposit obligation(s) by March 15 of that year.
(7)
Exception to the monthly and semi-weekly deposit rules for employers making interest-free adjustments.
An employer filing an adjusted return under § 31.6205-1 to report taxes that were accumulated in a prior return period shall pay the amount of the adjustment by the time it files the adjusted return, and the amount timely paid will be deemed to have been timely deposited by the employer. The payment may be made by a check or money order with the adjusted return, by electronic funds transfer, or by other methods of payment as provided by the instructions relating to the adjusted return.
(d)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1 Monthly depositor.
(i)
Determination of status.
For calendar year 2011, Employer A determines its depositor status using the lookback period July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010. For the four calendar quarters within this period, A reported aggregate employment tax liabilities of $42,000 on its quarterly Forms 941. Because the aggregate amount did not exceed $50,000, A is a monthly depositor for the entire calendar year 2011.
(ii)
Monthly rule.
During December 2011, A (a monthly depositor) accumulates $3,500 in employment taxes. A has a $3,500 deposit obligation that must be satisfied by the 15th day of the following month. Since January 15, 2012, is a Sunday, and January 16, 2012, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday, is a legal holiday, A's deposit obligation will be satisfied if the deposit is made by electronic funds transfer by the next business day, January 17, 2012.

# Example 2 Semi-weekly depositor.
(i)
Determination of status.
For the calendar year 2011, Employer B determines its depositor status using the lookback period July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010. For the four calendar quarters within this period, B reported aggregate employment tax liabilities of $88,000 on its quarterly Forms 941. Because that amount exceeds $50,000, B is a semi-weekly depositor for the entire calendar year 2011.
(ii)
Semi-weekly rule.
On Friday, January 7, 2011, B (a semi-weekly depositor) has a pay day on which it accumulates $4,000 in employment taxes. B has a $4,000 deposit obligation that must be satisfied by the following Wednesday, January 12, 2011.
(iii)
Deposit made within three business days.
On Friday, January 14, 2011, B (a semi-weekly depositor) has a pay day on which it accumulates $4,200 in employment taxes. Generally, B would have a required deposit obligation of employment taxes that must be satisfied by the following Wednesday, January 19, 2011. Because Monday, January 17, 2011, is Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday, a legal holiday, B has an additional day to make the required deposit. B has a $4,200 deposit obligation that must be satisfied by the following Thursday, January 20, 2011.

# Example 3 One-Day rule.
On Monday, January 10, 2011, Employer C accumulates $110,000 in employment taxes with respect to wages paid on that date. C has a deposit obligation of $110,000 that must be satisfied by the next business day. If C was not subject to the semi-weekly rule on January 10, 2011, C becomes subject to that rule as of January 11, 2011. See paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

# Example 4 One-Day rule in combination with subsequent deposit obligation.
Employer D is subject to the semi-weekly rule for calendar year 2011. On Monday, January 10, 2011, D accumulates $115,000 in employment taxes. D has a deposit obligation that must be satisfied by the next business day. On Tuesday, January 11, D accumulates an additional $30,000 in employment taxes. Although D has a $115,000 deposit obligation incurred earlier in the semi-weekly period, D has an additional and separate deposit obligation of $30,000 on Tuesday that must be satisfied by the following Friday.

# Example 5 Legal Holidays.
Employer E conducts business in State X. Wednesday, August 31, 2011, is a statewide legal holiday in State X which is not a legal holiday in the District of Columbia. On Friday, August 26, 2011, E (a semi-weekly depositor) has a pay day on which it accumulates $4,000 in employment taxes. E has a $4,000 deposit obligation that must be satisfied on or before the following Wednesday, August 31, 2011, notwithstanding that the day is a statewide legal holiday in State X.

# Example 6 Extension of time to deposit for employers who filed Form 944 for the preceding year satisfied.
F (a monthly depositor) was notified to file Form 944 to report its employment tax liabilities for the 2006 calendar year. F filed Form 944 on January 31, 2007, reporting a total employment tax liability for 2006 of $3,000. Because F's annual employment tax liability for the 2006 taxable year exceeded $1,000 (the applicable eligibility threshold for that taxable year), the IRS notified F to file Forms 941 for calendar year 2007 and thereafter. Based on F's liability during the lookback period (calendar year 2005, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section), F is a monthly depositor for 2007. F accumulates $1,000 in employment taxes during January 2007. Because F is a monthly depositor, F's January deposit obligation is due February 15, 2007. F does not deposit these accumulated employment taxes on February 15, 2007. F accumulates $1,500 in employment taxes during February 2007. F's February deposit is due March 15, 2007. F deposits the $2,500 of employment taxes accumulated during January and February on March 15, 2007. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section, F will be deemed to have timely deposited the employment taxes due for January 2007, and, thus, the IRS will not impose a failure-to-deposit penalty under section 6656 for that month.
(e)
Employment taxes defined.
(1) For purposes of this section, the term “employment taxes” means—
(i) The employee portion of the tax withheld under section 3102;
(ii) The employer tax under section 3111;
(iii) The income tax withheld under sections 3402 and 3405, except income tax withheld with respect to payments made after December 31, 1993, on the following—
(A) Certain gambling winnings under section 3402(q);
(B) Retirement pay for service in the Armed Forces of the United States under section 3402;
(C) Certain annuities described in section 3402(o)(1)(B); and
(D) Pensions, annuities, IRAs, and certain other deferred income under section 3405; and
(iv) The income tax withheld under section 3406, relating to backup withholding with respect to reportable payments made before January 1, 1994.
(2) The term
employment taxes
does not include taxes with respect to wages for domestic service in a private home of the employer, unless the employer is otherwise required to file a Form 941 or Form 944 under § 31.6011(a)-4 or § 31.6011(a)-5. In the case of employers paying advance earned income credit amounts for periods ending before January 1, 2011, the amount of taxes required to be deposited shall be reduced by advance amounts paid to employees. Also, see § 31.6302-3 concerning a taxpayer's option with respect to payments made before January 1, 1994, to treat backup withholding amounts under section 3406 separately.
(f)
Safe harbor/De minimis rules
—(1)
Single deposit safe harbor.
An employer will be considered to have satisfied its
deposit obligation imposed by this section if—
(i) The amount of any shortfall does not exceed the greater of $100 or 2 percent of the amount of employment taxes required to be deposited; and
(ii) The employer deposits the shortfall on or before the shortfall make-up date.
(2)
Shortfall defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), the term “shortfall” means the excess of the amount of employment taxes required to be deposited for the period over the amount deposited for the period. For this purpose, a period is either a monthly, semi-weekly or daily period.
(3)
Shortfall make-up date
—(i)
Monthly rule.
A shortfall with respect to a deposit required under the Monthly rule must be deposited or remitted no later than the due date for the quarterly return, in accordance with the applicable form and instructions.
(ii)
Semi-Weekly rule and One-Day rule.
A shortfall with respect to a deposit required under the Semi-Weekly rule or the One-Day rule must be deposited on or before the first Wednesday or Friday (whichever is earlier), falling on or after the 15th day of the month following the month in which the deposit was required to be made or, if earlier, the return due date for the return period.
(4)
De minimis rule
—(i)
De minimis deposit rules for quarterly and annual return periods beginning on or after January 1, 2001.
If the total amount of accumulated employment taxes for the return period is
de minimis
and the amount is fully deposited or remitted with a timely filed return for the return period, the amount deposited or remitted will be deemed to have been timely deposited. The total amount of accumulated employment taxes is
de minimis
if it is less than $2,500 for the return period or if it is
de minimis
pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
De minimis deposit rule for quarterly return periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, if the total amount of accumulated employment taxes for the immediately preceding quarter was less than $2,500, unless § 31.6302-1(c)(3) applies to require a deposit at the close of the next day, then the employer will be deemed to have timely deposited the employer's employment taxes for the current quarter if the employer complies with the time and method payment requirements contained in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.
(iii)
De minimis deposit rule for employers who file Form 944.
An employer who files Form 944 whose employment tax liability for the year equals or exceeds $2,500 but whose employment tax liability for a quarter of the year is
de minimis
pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section will be deemed to have timely deposited the employment taxes due for that quarter if the employer fully deposits the employment taxes accumulated during the quarter by the last day of the month following the close of that quarter. Employment taxes accumulated during the fourth quarter can be either deposited by January 31 or remitted with a timely filed return for the return period.
(5)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (f) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1 Safe-harbor rule satisfied.
On Monday, January 4, 1993,
J
(a semi-weekly depositor), pays wages and accumulates employment taxes. As required under this section,
J
makes a deposit on or before the following Friday, January 8, 1993, in the amount of $4,000. Subsequently,
J
determines that it was actually required to deposit $4,090 by Friday.
J
has a shortfall of $90. The $90 shortfall does not exceed the greater of $100 or 2% of the amount required to be deposited (2% of $4,090 = $81.80). Therefore,
J
satisfies the safe harbor of paragraph (f)(1) of this section as long as the $90 shortfall is deposited by the first deposit date (Wednesday or Friday) on or after the 15th day of the next month (in this case Wednesday, February 17, 1993).

# Example 2 Safe-harbor rule not satisfied.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that on Friday, January 8, 1993,
J
makes a deposit of $25,000, and later determines that it was actually required to deposit $26,000. Since the $1,000 shortfall ($26,000 less $25,000) exceeds $520 (the greater of $100 or 2% of the amount required to be deposited (2% of $26,000 = $520)), the safe harbor of paragraph (f)(1) of this section is not satisfied, and absent reasonable cause,
J
will be subject to a failure-to-deposit penalty under section 6656.

# Example 3 De minimis deposit rule for employers who file Form 944 satisfied.
K (a monthly depositor) was notified to file Form 944 to report its employment tax liabilities for the
2006 calendar year. In the first quarter of 2006, K accumulates employment taxes in the amount of $1,000. On April 28, 2006, K deposits the $1,000 of employment taxes accumulated in the first quarter. K accumulates another $1,000 of employment taxes during the second quarter of 2006. On July 31, 2006, K deposits the $1,000 of employment taxes accumulated in the second quarter. K's business grows and accumulates $1,500 in employment taxes during the third quarter of 2006. On October 31, 2006, K deposits the $1,500 of employment taxes accumulated in the third quarter. K accumulates another $2,000 in employment taxes during the fourth quarter. K files Form 944 on January 31, 2007, reporting a total employment tax liability for 2006 of $5,500 and submits a check for the remaining $2,000 of employment taxes with the return. K will be deemed to have timely deposited the employment taxes due for all of 2006 because K complied with the
de minimis
deposit rule provided in paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section. Therefore, the IRS will not impose a failure-to-deposit penalty under section 6656 for any month of the year. Under this
de minimis
deposit rule, because K was required to file Form 944 for calendar year 2006, if K's employment tax liability for a quarter is
de minimis,
then K may deposit that quarter's liability by the last day of the month following the close of the quarter. This
de minimis
rule allows K to have the benefit of the same quarterly
de minimis
amount K would have received if K filed Form 941 each quarter instead of Form 944 annually. Thus, because K's employment tax liability for each quarter was
de minimis,
K could deposit quarterly.
(g)
Agricultural employers—special rules
—(1)
In general.
An agricultural employer reports wages paid to farm workers annually on Form 943 (Employer's Annual Tax Return for Agricultural Employees) and reports wages paid to nonfarm workers quarterly on Form 941 or annually on Form 944. Accordingly, an agricultural employer must treat employment taxes reportable on Form 943 (“Form 943 taxes”) separately from employment taxes reportable on Form 941 or Form 944 (“Form 941 or Form 944 taxes”). Form 943 taxes and Form 941 or Form 944 taxes are not combined for purposes of determining whether a deposit of either is due, whether the One-Day rule of paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies, or whether any safe harbor is applicable. In addition, Form 943 taxes and Form 941 or Form 944 taxes must be deposited separately. (See paragraph (b) of this section for rules for determining an agricultural employer's deposit status for Form 941 taxes). Whether an agricultural employer is a monthly or semi-weekly depositor of Form 943 taxes is determined according to the rules of this paragraph (g).
(2)
Monthly depositor.
An agricultural employer is a monthly depositor of Form 943 taxes for a calendar year if the amount of Form 943 taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) is $50,000 or less. An agricultural employer ceases to be a monthly depositor of Form 943 taxes on the first day after the employer is subject to the One-Day rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. At that time, the agricultural employer immediately becomes a semi-weekly depositor of Form 943 taxes for the remainder of the calendar year and the succeeding calendar year.
(3)
Semi-weekly depositor.
An agricultural employer is a semi-weekly depositor of Form 943 taxes for a calendar year if the amount of Form 943 taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) exceeds $50,000.
(4)
Lookback period
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), the lookback period for Form 943 taxes is the second calendar year preceding the current calendar year. For example, the lookback period for calendar year 1993 is calendar year 1991. New employers shall be treated as having employment tax liabilities of zero for any lookback period before the date the employer started or acquired its business.
(ii)
Adjustments and Claims for Refund.
The employment tax liability reported on the original return for the return period is the amount taken into account in determining whether the amount of Form 943 taxes accumulated in the lookback period exceeds $50,000. Any amounts reported on adjusted returns or claims for refund pursuant to sections 6205, 6402, 6413 and 6414 filed after the due date of the original return are not taken into account when determining the amount of Form 943 taxes accumulated in the lookback period. However, prior period adjustments reported on Form 943 for 2008 and earlier years are taken into account in determining the employment
tax liability for the return period in which the adjustments are reported.
(5) The following example illustrates the provisions of this section.

# Example.
A, an agricultural employer, employs both farm workers and nonfarm workers (employees in its administrative offices).
A
's depositor status for calendar year 1993 for Form 941 taxes will be based upon its employment tax liabilities reported on Forms 941 for the third and fourth quarters of 1991 and the first and second quarters of 1992 (the period July 1 to June 30).
A
's depositor status for Form 943 taxes will be based upon its employment tax liability reported on its annual Form 943 for calendar year 1991.
(h)
Time and manner of deposit—deposits required to be made by electronic funds transfer
—(1)
In general.
Section 6302(h) requires the Secretary to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the development and implementation of an electronic funds transfer system to be used for the collection of the depository taxes as described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section. Section 6302(h)(2) provides a phase-in schedule that sets forth escalating minimum percentages of those depository taxes to be deposited by electronic funds transfer. This paragraph (h) prescribes the rules necessary for implementing an electronic funds transfer system for collection of depository taxes and for effecting an orderly and expeditious phase-in of that system.
(2)
Applicability of requirement
—(i)
Deposits for return periods beginning before January 1, 2000.
(A) Taxpayers whose aggregate deposits of the taxes imposed by Chapters 21 (Federal Insurance Contributions Act), 22 (Railroad Retirement Tax Act), and 24 (Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages) of the Internal Revenue Code during a 12-month determination period exceed the applicable threshold amount are required to deposit all depository taxes described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section by electronic funds transfer (as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section) unless exempted under paragraph (h)(5) of this section. If the applicable effective date is January 1, 1995, or January 1, 1996, the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer applies to all deposits required to be made on or after the applicable effective date. If the applicable effective date is July 1, 1997, the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer applies to all deposits required to be made on or after July 1, 1997 with respect to deposit obligations incurred for return periods beginning on or after January 1, 1997. If the applicable effective date is January 1, 1998, or thereafter, the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer applies to all deposits required to be made with respect to deposit obligations incurred for return periods beginning on or after the applicable effective date. In general, each applicable effective date has one 12-month determination period. However, for the applicable effective date January 1, 1996, there are two determination periods. If the applicable threshold amount is exceeded in either of those determination periods, the taxpayer becomes subject to the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer, effective January 1, 1996. The threshold amounts, determination periods and applicable effective dates for purposes of this paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) are as follows:
Threshold amount
Determination period
Applicable effective date
$78 million
1-1-93 to 12-31-93
Jan. 1, 1995.
$47 million
1-1-93 to 12-31-93
Jan. 1, 1996.
$47 million
1-1-94 to 12-31-94
Jan. 1, 1996.
$50 thousand
1-1-95 to 12-31-95
July 1, 1997.
$50 thousand
1-1-96 to 12-31-96
Jan. 1, 1998.
$50 thousand
1-1-97 to 12-31-97
Jan. 1, 1999.
(B) Unless exempted under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, a taxpayer that does not deposit any of the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24 during the applicable determination periods set forth in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of
this section, but that does make deposits of other depository taxes (as described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section), is nevertheless subject to the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer if the taxpayer's aggregate deposits of all depository taxes exceed the threshold amount set forth in this paragraph (h)(2)(i)(B) during an applicable 12-month determination period. This requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer applies to all depository taxes due with respect to deposit obligations incurred for return periods beginning on or after the applicable effective date. The threshold amount, determination periods, and applicable effective dates for purposes of this paragraph (h)(2)(i)(B) are as follows:
Threshold amount
Determination period
Applicable effective date
$50 thousand
1-1-95 to 12-31-95
Jan. 1, 1998.
$50 thousand
1-1-96 to 12-31-96
Jan. 1, 1998.
$50 thousand
1-1-97 to 12-31-97
Jan. 1, 1999.
(C) This paragraph (h)(2)(i) applies only to deposits required to be made for return periods beginning before January 1, 2000. Thus, a taxpayer, including a taxpayer that is required under this paragraph (h)(2)(i) to make deposits by electronic funds transfer beginning in 1999 or an earlier year, is not required to use electronic funds transfer to make deposits for return periods beginning after December 31, 1999, unless deposits by electronic funds transfer are required under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Deposits for return periods beginning after December 31, 1999, and made before January 1, 2011.
Unless exempted under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, for deposits for return periods beginning after December 31, 1999, and made before January 1, 2011, a taxpayer that deposits more than $200,000 of taxes described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section during a calendar year beginning after December 31, 1997, must use electronic funds transfer (as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section) to make all deposits of those taxes that are required to be made for return periods beginning after December 31 of the following year and must continue to deposit by electronic funds transfer in all succeeding years. As an example, a taxpayer that exceeds the $200,000 deposit threshold during calendar year 1998 is required to make deposits for return periods beginning in or after calendar year 2000 by electronic funds transfer.
(iii)
Deposits made after December 31, 2010.
Unless exempted under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, a taxpayer that has a required tax deposit obligation described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section must use electronic funds transfer (as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section) to make all deposits of those taxes made after December 31, 2010.
(iv)
Voluntary deposits.
A taxpayer that is authorized to make payment of taxes with a return under regulations may voluntarily make a deposit by electronic funds transfer.
(3)
Taxes required to be deposited by electronic funds transfer.
The requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer under paragraph (h)(2) of this section applies to all the taxes required to be deposited under §§ 1.6302-1, 1.6302-2, and 1.6302-3 of this chapter; §§ 31.6302-1, 31.6302-2, 31.6302-3, 31.6302-4, and 31.6302(c)-3; and § 40.6302(c)-1 of this chapter.

Definitions
—(i)
Electronic funds transfer. An electronic funds transfer
is any transfer of depository taxes made in accordance with Revenue Procedure 97-33, (1997-30 I.R.B.), (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), or in accordance with procedures subsequently prescribed by the Commissioner.
(ii)
Taxpayer.
For purposes of this section, a
taxpayer
is any person required to deposit federal taxes, including not only individuals, but also any trust, estate, partnership, association, company or corporation.
(5)
Exemptions.
If any categories of taxpayers are to be exempted from the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer, the Commissioner will
identify those taxpayers by guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. (See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter.)
(6)
Separation of deposits.
A deposit for one return period must be made separately from a deposit for another return period.
(7)
Payment of balance due.
If the aggregate amount of taxes reportable on the applicable tax return for the return period exceeds the total amount deposited by the taxpayer with regard to the return period, then the balance due must be remitted in accordance with the applicable form and instructions.
(8)
Time deemed deposited.
A deposit of taxes by electronic funds transfer will be deemed made when the amount is withdrawn from the taxpayer's account, provided the U.S. Government is the payee and the amount is not returned or reversed.
(9)
Time deemed paid.
In general, an amount deposited under this paragraph (h) will be considered to be a payment of tax on the last day prescribed for filing the applicable return for the return period (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return) or, if later, at the time deemed deposited under paragraph (h)(8) of this section. In the case of the taxes imposed by chapters 21 and 24 of the Internal Revenue Code, solely for purposes of section 6511 and the regulations thereunder (relating to the period of limitation on credit or refund), if an amount is deposited prior to April 15th of the calendar year immediately succeeding the calendar year that includes the period for which the amount was deposited, the amount will be considered paid on April 15th.
(i)
Time and manner of remittance with a return
—(1)
General rules.
A remittance required to be made by this section that is authorized to be made with a return under regulations and is made with a return must be made separately from a remittance required by any other section. Further, a remittance for a deposit period in one return period must be made separately from a remittance for a deposit period in another return period.
(2)
Payment of balance due.
If the aggregate amount of taxes reportable on the return for the return period exceeds the total amount deposited by the employer with regard to the return period pursuant to this section, the balance due must be remitted in accordance with the applicable form and instructions.
(3)
Time deemed paid.
In general, amounts remitted with a return under this section will be considered as paid on the date payment is received by the Internal Revenue Service at the place prescribed for filing by regulations or forms and instructions (or if section 7502(a) applies, by the date the payment is treated as received under section 7502(a)), or on the last day prescribed for filing the return (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return), whichever is later. In the case of the taxes imposed by chapter 21 and 24 of the Internal Revenue Code, solely for purposes of section 6511 and the regulations thereunder (relating to the period of limitation on credit or refund), if an amount is remitted with a return under this section prior to April 15th of the calendar year immediately succeeding the calendar year that contains the period for which the amount was remitted, the amount will be considered paid on April 15th of the succeeding calendar year.
(j)
Voluntary payments by electronic funds transfer.
Any person may voluntarily remit by electronic funds transfer any payment of tax imposed by subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code. Such payment must be made in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Commissioner.

Special rules
—(1)
Notice exception.
The provisions of this section are not applicable with respect to employment taxes for any month in which the employer receives notice that a return is required under § 31.6011(a)-5 (or for any subsequent month for which such a return is required), if those taxes are also required to be deposited under the separate accounting procedures provided in § 301.7512-1 of the Regulations on Procedure and Administration (which procedures are applicable if notification is given by the Commissioner of failure to comply with certain employment tax requirements). In cases in which a monthly return is required under § 31.6011(a)-5 but the taxes are
not required to be deposited under the separate accounting procedures provided in § 301.7512-1, the provisions of this section shall apply except those provisions shall not authorize the deferral of any deposit to a date after the date on which the return is required to be filed.

§ 31.6302-2
Deposit rules for taxes under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA).
(a)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the rules of § 31.6302-1 determine the time and manner of making deposits of employee tax withheld under section 3202 and employer tax imposed under sections 3221 (a) and (b) attributable to payments made after December 31, 1992. Railroad retirement taxes described in section 3221(c) arising during the month must be deposited on or before the first date after the 15th day of the following month on which taxes are otherwise required to be deposited under § 31.6302-1.
(b)
Separate application of deposit rules.
A person who accumulates tax under sections 3202 or 3221 shall not take that tax into account for purposes of determining when taxes described in paragraph (e) of § 31.6302-1 must otherwise be deposited.
(c)
Modification of Monthly rule determination
—(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person is allowed to use the Monthly rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(1) for an entire calendar year unless the amount of
R.R.T.A. taxes required to be deposited under this section during the lookback period was more than $50,000. The lookback period is defined as the calendar year preceding the calendar year just ended. Thus, for purposes of determining if an R.R.T.A. employer qualifies to use the Monthly rule for calendar year 1993, a lookback must be made to calendar year 1991. New employers shall be treated as having employment tax liabilities of zero for any calendar year during which the employer did not exist.
(2)
Exception.
An employer shall immediately cease to be allowed to use the Monthly rule after any day on which that employer is subject to the One-Day rule set forth in § 31.6302-1(c)(3). Such employer immediately becomes subject to the Semi-Weekly rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(2) for the remainder of the calendar year and the following calendar year.
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to deposits and payments made after December 31, 2010.
[T.D. 8436, 57 FR 44105, Sept. 24, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9507, 75 FR 75903, Dec. 7, 2010]
§ 31.6302-3
Federal tax deposit rules for amounts withheld under the backup withholding requirements of section 3406 for payments made after December 31, 1992.
(a)
General rule.
The rules of § 31.6302-1 shall apply to determine the time and manner of making deposits of amounts withheld under the backup withholding requirements of section 3406.
(b)
Treatment of backup withholding amounts separately.
A taxpayer that withholds income tax under section 3406 with respect to reportable payments made after December 31, 1992, and before January 1, 1994, may, in accordance with the instructions provided with Form 941, deposit such tax under the rules of § 31.6302-1 without taking into account the other taxes described in paragraph (e) of § 31.6302-1 for purposes of determining when tax withheld under section 3406 must be deposited. A taxpayer that treats backup withholding amounts separately with respect to reportable payments made after December 31, 1992, and before January 1, 1994, shall not take tax withheld under section 3406 into account for purposes of determining when the other taxes described in paragraph (e) of § 31.6302-1 must otherwise be deposited under that section. See § 31.6302-4 for rules regarding the deposit of income tax withheld under section 3406 with respect to reportable payments made after December 31, 1993.
(c)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this section.

# Example.
For the last two calendar quarters of 1991 and the first two calendar quarters of 1992, Bank
A
reports employment taxes with respect to wages paid totalling in excess of $50,000. For the same four quarters, pursuant to section 3406,
A
withholds income tax with respect to dividend payments in an amount aggregating less than $50,000. For deposit and reporting purposes,
A
treated the backup withholding amounts separately from the employment taxes with respect to wages paid. Accordingly, for calendar year 1993, if
A
chooses to treat the items separately,
A
must use the Semi-Weekly rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(2) to deposit taxes with respect to wages paid but may use the Monthly rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(1) for the deposit of backup withholding amounts. If
A
chooses not to treat the items separately, the Semi-Weekly rule would apply to the combined amount of both the taxes with respect to wages paid and the backup withholding amounts.
[T.D. 8436, 57 FR 44106, Sept. 24, 1992, as amended by T.D. 8504, 58 FR 68035, Dec. 23, 1993]
§ 31.6302-4
Deposit rules for withheld income taxes attributable to nonpayroll payments.
(a)
General rule.
With respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes attributable to nonpayroll payments made after December 31, 1993, a taxpayer is either a monthly or a semi-weekly depositor based on an annual determination. Except as provided in this section, the rules of § 31.6302-1 shall apply to determine the time and manner of making deposits of nonpayroll withheld taxes as though they were employment taxes. Paragraph (b) of this section defines nonpayroll withheld taxes. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining whether a taxpayer is a monthly or a semi-weekly depositor.
(b)
Nonpayroll withheld taxes defined.
For purposes of this section, effective with respect to payments made after
December 31, 1993,
nonpayroll withheld taxes
means—
(1) Amounts withheld under section 3402(q), relating to withholding on certain gambling winnings;
(2) Amounts withheld under section 3402 with respect to amounts paid as retirement pay for service in the Armed Forces of the United States;
(3) Amounts withheld under section 3402(o)(1)(B), relating to certain annuities;
(4) Annuities withheld under section 3405, relating to withholding on pensions, annuities, IRAs, and certain other deferred income; and
(5) Amounts withheld under section 3406, relating to backup withholding with respect to reportable payments.
(c)
Determination of deposit status
—(1)
Rules for calendar years 1994 and 1995.
On January 1, 1994, a taxpayer's depositor status for nonpayroll withheld taxes is the same as the taxpayer's status on January 1, 1994, for taxes reported on Form 941 under § 31.6302-1. A taxpayer generally retains that depositor status for nonpayroll withheld taxes for all of calendar years 1994 and 1995. However, a taxpayer that under this paragraph (c) is a monthly depositor for 1994 and 1995 will immediately lose that status and become a semi-weekly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes if the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) is triggered with respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes. See paragraph (d) of this section for a special rule regarding the application of the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) to nonpayroll withheld taxes.
(2)
Rules for calendar years after 1995
—(i)
In general.
For calendar years after 1995, the determination of whether a taxpayer is a monthly or a semi-weekly depositor for a calendar year is based on an annual determination and generally depends on the aggregate amount of nonpayroll withheld taxes reported by the taxpayer for the lookback period as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
(ii)
Monthly depositor.
A taxpayer is a monthly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes for a calendar year if the amount of nonpayroll withheld taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) is $50,000 or less. A taxpayer ceases to be a monthly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes on the first day after the taxpayer is subject to the One-Day rule in § 31.6302-1(c)(3) with respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes. At that time, the taxpayer immediately becomes a semi-weekly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes for the remainder of the calendar year and the succeeding calendar year. See paragraph (d) of this section for a special rule regarding the application of the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) to nonpayroll withheld taxes.
(iii)
Semi-weekly depositor.
A taxpayer is a semi-weekly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes for a calendar year if the amount of nonpayroll withheld taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) exceeds $50,000.
(iv)
Lookback period.
For purposes of this section, the lookback period for nonpayroll withheld taxes is the second calendar year preceding the current calendar year. For example, the lookback period for calendar year 1996 is calendar year 1994. A new taxpayer is treated as having nonpayroll withheld taxes of zero for any calendar year in which the taxpayer did not exist.
(d)
Special rules.
A taxpayer must treat nonpayroll withheld taxes, which are reported on Form 945, “Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax,” separately from taxes reportable on Form 941, “Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return” (or any other return, for example, Form 943, “Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees”). Taxes reported on Form 945 and taxes reported on Form 941 are not combined for purposes of determining whether a deposit of either is due, whether the One-Day rule of § 31.6302-1(c)(3) applies, or whether any safe harbor is applicable. In addition, taxes reported on Form 945 and taxes reported on Form 941 must be deposited separately. (
See
paragraph (b) of § 31.6302-1 for rules for determining an employer's deposit status for taxes reported on Form 941.) Taxes reported on Form 945 for one calendar year must be deposited separately from taxes reported on Form 945 for another calendar year.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
Section 31.6302-4(d) applies to deposits and payments made after December 31, 2010.

§ 31.6302(c)-1
Use of Government depositories in connection with taxes under Federal Insurance Contributions Act and income tax withheld for amounts attributable to payments made before January 1, 1993.
(a)
Requirement for calendar months beginning after December 31, 1980, but before January 1, 1993
—(1)
In general.
(i) In the case of a calendar month which begins after December 31, 1980, but before April 1, 1991—
(
a
) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and hereinafter in this subdivision (i), if at the close of any calendar month the aggregate amount of undeposited taxes (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section) is $500 or more, the employer shall deposit the undeposited taxes in a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution (see paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section) within 15 calendar days after the close of such calendar month.
However, this (
a
) of subdivision (i) shall not apply if the employer was required to make a deposit of taxes pursuant to (
b
) of this subdivision (i) with respect to an eighth-monthly period which occurred during the calendar month.
(
b
) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and except in the case of first-time 3-banking-day depositors, if at the close of any eighth-monthly period the aggregate amount of undeposited taxes is $3,000 or more, the employer shall deposit the undeposited taxes in a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution within 3 banking days after the close of such eighth-monthly period. For purposes of determining the amount of undeposited taxes at the close of an eighth-monthly period, undeposited taxes with respect to wages paid during a prior eighth-monthly period shall not be taken into account if the employer has made a deposit with respect to such prior eighth-monthly period. An employer will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(
b
) for a deposit with respect to the close of an eighth-monthly period if—
(
1
) His deposit is not less than 95 percent (90 percent before January 1, 1982) of the aggregate amount of the taxes with respect to wages paid during the period for which the deposit is made, and
(
2
) If such eighth-monthly period occurs in a month other than the last month of a period for which a return is required to be filed (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as a return period), he deposits any underpayment with his first deposit which is otherwise required by this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(
b
) to be made after the 15th day of the following month.
For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(
b
), a “first-time 3-banking-day depositor” is an employer who establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that he was not required (but for this exception) to make a deposit pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(
b
) (or pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(
b
) of this section) with respect to each period in any preceding month of the current calendar quarter and with respect to each period in the 4 calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter. An employer may in no event qualify as a “first-time 3-banking-day depositor” with respect to any eighth-monthly period if the undeposited taxes at the close of that period are $10,000 or more.
The excess (if any) of a deposit over the actual taxes for a deposit period shall be applied in order of time to each of the employer's succeeding deposits with respect to the same return period, until exhausted, to the extent that the amount by which the taxes for a subsequent deposit period exceed the deposit for such subsequent deposit period. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(i), “eighth-monthly period” means the
first 3 days of a calendar month, the 4th day through the 7th day of a calendar month, the 8th day through the 11th day of a calendar month, the 12th day through the 15th day of a calendar month, the 16th day through the 19th day of a calendar month, the 20th day through the 22nd day of a calendar month, the 23rd day through the 25th day of a calendar month, or the portion of a calendar month following the 25th day of such month.
(
c
) The periods within which taxes must be desposited under this section are determined, in the case of employers paying advance earned income credit amounts, by reference to the amount of taxes required to be deposited after reduction for advance amounts paid to employees.
(ii) In the case of a calendar month which begins after March 31, 1991, but before January 1, 1993—
(
a
) Except as provided in § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(ii) (
b
) or (
c
), or § 31.6302(c)-1(b), if with respect to any calendar month the aggregate amount of taxes (as defined in § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(iii)) accumulated with respect to wages paid is $500 or more, but less than $3,000, then the employer shall deposit that aggregate amount in a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution within 15 calendar days after the close of that calendar month. Taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid in a prior calendar month within the same return period shall not be taken into account in determining the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated if a deposit was required to be made under this section with respect to such tax amounts. Deposits made during the calendar month of taxes with respect to wages paid during that month do not reduce the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated for purposes of determining the deposit requirement (if any) for that month. However, this paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(
a
) shall not apply if the employer was required to make a deposit of taxes pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(
b
) of this section with respect to an eighth-month period which occurred during the calendar month.

# Example 1.
Employer
A
's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid in April 1991 is $800. Since that amount is in excess of $500, but less than $3,000,
A
must deposit the $800 in a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution by May 15, 1991.

# Example 2.
Employer
B
's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid in April 1991 is $400. Since that amount is less than $500,
B
has no deposit obligation for the month of April. In May 1991
B
's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid during the month is $450. Since the $400 in taxes in April was not required to be deposited, that amount is taken into account in determining if a deposit is required for May. The aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid for the two months is in excess of $500, thus requiring a deposit. Since June 15, 1991, is a Saturday,
B
must deposit the $850 in a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution by Monday, June 17, 1991, pursuant to section 7503 of the Code.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that
B
deposits the $400 in taxes from April on May 15, 1991. Because the $400 was not required to be deposited, that amount is taken into account in determining if a deposit obligation exists for May. Since the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid for the two months, $850, is in excess of $500, a deposit in the aggregate amount of $850 is required by Monday, June 17, 1991. Since $400 was previously deposited,
B
must deposit an additional $450 by June 17, 1991.

# Example 4.
On Friday, April 5, 1991, a payroll date, Employer
C
accumulates $450 in taxes with respect to wages paid on that date. Although not required to do so,
C
deposits the $450 in an authorized depository. On Friday, April 19, 1991,
C
accumulates an additional $450 in taxes with respect to wages paid. The aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid during the calendar month is $900.
C
has a deposit obligation of $900 for the calendar month and must deposit an additional $450 in an authorized depository by May 15, 1991.

)), if with respect to any eighth-monthly period (as defined in § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i)(
b
)) the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is $3,000 or more, but less than $100,000, the employer shall deposit that aggregate amount in a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution within 3 banking days after the close of that eighth-monthly period. Taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid during a prior eighth-monthly period
shall not be taken into account if a deposit was required to be made under this section with respect to such tax amounts. Deposits made during the eighth-monthly period of taxes with respect to wages paid during that eighth-monthly period do not reduce the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated for purposes of determining the deposit requirement (if any) for that eighth-monthly period. Solely for purposes of the examples in this paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(
b
) and paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(
c
), (
d
), and (
f
) of this section, “banking days” are assumed to include all calendar days except Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays.

# Example 1.
For the eighth-monthly period April 1-3, 1991, Employer
D
's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is $3,500. Since that amount is in excess of $3,000, but less than $100,000,
D
has a deposit obligation of $3,500 that must be satisfied by April 8, 1991, the third banking day after the close of the eighth-monthly period.

# Example 2.
For the eighth-monthly period April 1-3, 1991, Employer
E
's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is $3,500.
E
has a deposit obligation of $3,500 that must be satisfied by April 8, 1991, three banking days after the close of the April 1-3 eighth-monthly period. For the eighth-monthly period April 4-7, 1991,
E
's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is $2,800. Since
E
was required to make a deposit for the April 1-3 eighth-monthly period, that $3,500 amount is not taken into account in determining any obligations that arise in subsequent eighth-monthly periods.
E
does not have an eighth-monthly deposit obligation with respect to the April 4-7 period.

# Example 3.
For the eighth-monthly period April 1-3, 1991, Employer
F
's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is $2,800. Since that amount is less than $3,000, no deposit is required with respect to that eighth-monthly period. For the eighth-monthly period April 4-7, 1991,
F
's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is $2,500. Since
F
was not required to deposit the $2,800 in taxes from the April 1-3 eighth-monthly period, that amount is taken into account in determining
F
's deposit obligation for the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period. The aggregate amount of taxes accumulated for the two eighth-monthly periods is $5,300.
F
has a deposit obligation of $5,300 that must be satisfied by April 10, 1991, three banking days after the close of the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
except that
F
deposits the $2,800 from the April 1-3 eighth-monthly period on April 4, 1991. Because the $2,800 was not required to be deposited, that amount is taken into account in determining
F
's deposit obligation for the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period. The aggregate amount of taxes accumulated for the two eighth-monthly periods is $5,300. Since that amount is in excess of $3,000, a deposit obligation exists after the close of the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period. As $2,800 of that amount was previously deposited,
F
has a deposit obligation of $2,500 that must be satisfied by April 10, 1991, three banking days after the close of the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period.

# Example 5.
On Friday, April 12, 1991, the beginning of an eighth-monthly period (April 12-15),
G
accumulates $3,500 in taxes with respect to wages paid and deposits the $3,500 in an authorized depository on that date although a deposit of the $3,500 was not required to be made on that date. On Monday, April 15, 1991, the end of the April 12-15 eighth-monthly period,
G
accumulates an additional $2,000 in taxes with respect to wages paid. The aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid during the April 12-15 eighth-monthly period of $5,500.
G
has a deposit obligation for the eighth-monthly period of $5,500. Since $3,500 of that amount was previously deposited,
G
has a remaining deposit obligation of $2,000 that must be satisfied by Thursday, April 18, 1991, three banking days after the close of the eighth-monthly period.
(
c
) If on any day within an eighth-monthly period the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is $100,000 or more, the employer shall deposit that aggregate amount in a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution on the first banking day after that day. Taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid prior to that day shall not be taken into account if a deposit was required under this section with respect to such tax amounts. Taxes deposited on any given day with respect to wages paid on that day do not reduce the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated on that day for purposes of determining the deposit requirement (if any) for that day.

# Example 1.
On Thursday, April 4, 1991, the beginning of the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period, Employer
H
accumulates $55,000 in taxes with respect to wages paid on that
date. On Saturday, April 6, 1991,
H
accumulates an additional $50,000 in taxes with respect to wages paid.
H
has a deposit obligation of $105,000 that must be satisfied by Monday, April 8, the next banking day after Saturday, April 6.

# Example 2.
On Friday, April 12, 1991, the beginning of the April 12-15 eighth-monthly period,
J
accumulates $60,000 in taxes with respect to wages paid and deposits the $60,000 in an authorized depository on that date although a deposit of the $60,000 was not required to be made on that date. On Monday, April 15, 1991, the last day in the April 12-15 eighth-monthly period,
J
accumulates an additional $50,000 in taxes with respect to wages paid. On Monday, April 15, the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid during the eighth-monthly period to date totals $110,000.
J
has a $110,000 deposit obligation that must be satisfied by the next banking day after the $100,000 threshold is reached. Since $60,000 of the $110,000 was already deposited,
J
has a remaining deposit obligation of $50,000 that must be satisfied by Tuesday, April 16, 1991, the next banking day following April 15th.

# Example 3.
On Monday, April 1, 1991, Employer
K
accumulates $105,000 in taxes with respect to wages paid on that date. On that same day,
K
deposits in an authorized depository $10,000 of the $105,000 accumulated.
K
has a $105,000 deposit obligation that must be satisfied by the next banking day, April 2, 1991. The $10,000 deposited on April 1 cannot be used to reduce the aggregate amount of accumulated taxes with respect to that date.
K
has a remaining deposit obligation of $95,000 that must be satisfied by April 2, 1991.
(
d
) If, with respect to any eighth-monthly period, an employer incurs an obligation to deposit in accordance with § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(ii)(
c
), and later, within the same eighth-monthly period, accumulates with respect to wages paid taxes of $3,000 or more, but less than $100,000, an additional deposit is required in accordance with § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(ii)(
b
). However, if the amount of taxes is $100,000 or more, an additional deposit is required in accordance with § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(ii)(
c
).

# Example.
On Tuesday, April 2, 1991, Employer
L
accumulates $110,000 in aggregate taxes with respect to wages paid. In accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(
c
) of this section,
L
has a $110,000 deposit obligation that must be satisfied by Wednesday, April 3, 1991, the next banking day following April 2. On Wednesday, April 3, 1991,
L
accumulates an additional $10,000 in taxes with respect to wages paid that date. In accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(
b
) of this section,
L
now has an additional deposit obligation of $10,000 that must be satisfied by Monday, April 8, 1991, the 3rd banking day following the close of the April 1-3 eighth-monthly period. The obligation to deposit the $10,000 is separate and distinct from the obligation to deposit the $110,000.
(
e
) An employer will be considered to have satisfied the deposit obligation imposed by paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) (
b
), (
c
) and (
d
) of this section if—
(
1
) The deposit that is made is not less than 95 percent of the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid during the period for which the deposit is made, and
(
2
) If the eighth-monthly period (or, in the case of a deposit required under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(
c
) of this section, the day on which the obligation arose) is in a month other than the last month of the return period, the employer deposits any remaining amount due with the first deposit otherwise required to be made after the fifteenth day of the following month. In the case of the last month of the return period, see § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(iv).
(
f
) Any excess of a deposit over the actual taxes required to be deposited to date (overdeposit) during the return period shall be applied in order of time to each of the employer's succeeding deposit obligations within the same return period. In the determination of the aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid in succeeding deposit periods, the overdeposit does not reduce the aggregate amount accumulated although the overdeposit is credited to the depositor's account.

# Example.
Employer
M
's deposit obligation for the eighth-monthly period April 1-3, 1991, is $3,200. On April 8, 1991, three banking days after the close of the eighth-monthly period,
M
deposits $4,000 in an authorized depository, $800 in excess of the amount required to be deposited. During the eighth-monthly period April 4-7, 1991,
M
accumulates $3,750 in taxes with respect to wages paid during such period. Although the $800 overdeposit for the April 1-3 eighth-monthly period is credited to
M
's account, it may not be used to determine whether a deposit obligation exists for the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period. The two deposit obligations are separate and distinct. Since the amount of taxes accumulated with respect to the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period is an amount greater than $3,000, a deposit is required under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(
b
) of this section within three banking days
after the close of the period.
M
has a remaining deposit obligation of $2,950 ($3,750 accumulated less $800 overdeposit) that must be satisfied by April 10, 1991, three banking days after the close of the period.
(
g
) The periods within which taxes must be deposited under this section are determined, in the case of employers paying advance earned income credit amounts, by reference to the amount of taxes required to be deposited after reduction for advance amounts paid to employees.
(
h
) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(ii), the term “wages paid” includes all amounts included in wages, e.g., under section 3121(v) of the Code, regardless of whether they have actually been paid.
(iii) As used in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, the term “taxes” means—
(
a
) The employee tax withheld under section 3102,
(
b
) The employer tax under section 3111, and
(
c
) The income tax withheld under section 3402, including amounts withheld with respect to qualified State individual income taxes,
Exclusive of taxes with respect to wages for domestic service in a private home of the employer or, if paid before April 1, 1971, wages for agricultural labor. In addition, with respect to wages paid after December 31, 1970, and before April 1, 1971, for agricultural labor, any taxes described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section which are not required under such subparagraph to be deposited, and any income tax (including qualified State individual income tax) withheld under section 3402 with respect to such wages, shall be deemed to be “taxes” on and after April 1, 1971. For the requirements relating to the deposit and payment of withheld tax and with respect to qualified State individual income taxes, see paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of § 301.6361-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
(iv) If the aggregate amount of taxes reportable on a return (other than a return on Form 942) for a return period exceeds the total amount deposited by the employer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section for such return period (
a
) by $500 or more in the case of a return period which ends after December 31, 1980, or (
b
) by more than $200 in the case of a return period which ends after December 31, 1970, and before January 1, 1981, the employer shall, on or before the last day of the first calendar month following the return period, deposit with a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution an amount equal to the amount by which the taxes reportable on the return exceed the total deposits (if any) made pursuant to subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph for such period. As used in this subdivision, the term “taxes” shall have the meaning assigned to such term in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, except that the term shall include the taxes referred to in (
a
), (
b
), and (
c
) of such subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph with respect to any wages for domestic service in a private home of the employer which the employer elects to report on a quarterly return other than a quarterly return made on Form 942.
(v) If the aggregate amount of taxes reportable on Form CT-1, the return relating to an employer's railroad retirement tax payments, for a return period exceeds the total amount deposited by the employer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for such return period by $100 or more, the employer shall, on or before the last day of the second calendar month following the return period, deposit with a Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution an amount equal to the amount by which the taxes reportable on Form CT-1 exceed the total deposits (if any) of such taxes made pursuant to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph for such period.
(2)
Depositary forms
—(i)
In general.
A deposit required to be made by this section shall be made separately from a deposit required by any other section. An employer may make one, or more than one, remittance of the amount required to be deposited. However, a deposit for a period in one calendar quarter shall be made separately from any deposit for a period in another calendar quarter. An amount of tax which is not required to be deposited may nevertheless be deposited if the employer so desires.
(ii)
Deposits.
Each remittance of amounts required to be deposited under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be accompanied by a Federal Tax Deposit form. Such form shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto. The remittance, together with the Federal Tax Deposit form, shall be forwarded to a financial institution authorized as a depositary for Federal taxes in accordance with 31 CFR Part 214 or, at the election of the employer, to a Federal Reserve bank. For procedures governing the deposit of Federal taxes at a Federal Reserve bank, see 31 CFR Part 214.7. The timeliness of the deposit will be determined by the date stamped on the Federal Tax Deposit form by the Federal Reserve bank or the authorized financial institution or, if section 7502(e) applies, by the date the deposit is treated as received under section 7502(e). Each employer making deposits under this section shall report on the return, for the period with respect to which such deposits are made, information regarding such deposits according to the instructions that apply to such return and pay at that time (or deposit by the due date of such return) the balance, if any, of the taxes due for such period.
(iii)
Time deemed paid.
In general, amounts deposited under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be considered as paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return in respect of such tax (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing such return), or at the time deposited, whichever is later. For purposes of section 6511 and the regulations thereunder, relating to period of limitation on credit or refund, if an amount is so deposited prior to April 15th of a calendar year immediately succeeding the calendar year which contains the period for which such amount was so deposited, such amount shall be considered as paid on such April 15th.
(3)
Procurement of prescribed form.
Copies of the Federal Tax Deposit form will so far as possible be furnished employers. An employer will not be excused from making a deposit, however, by the fact that no form has been furnished to it. An employer not supplied with the Federal Tax Deposit form should make application therefor in ample time to make the required deposits within the time prescribed. The employer may secure the form or additional forms by application therefor; such application shall supply the employer's name, identification number, address, and the taxable period to which the deposits will relate.
(b)
Exceptions
—(1)
Monthly returns.
The provisions of this section are not applicable with respect to taxes for the month in which the employer receives notice that returns are required under § 31.6011(a)-5 (or for any subsequent month for which such a return is required), if those taxes are also required to be deposited under the separate accounting procedures provided in § 301.7512-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) (which procedures are applicable if notification is given of failure to comply with certain employment tax requirements). In cases in which a monthly return is required under § 31.6011(a)-5 but the taxes are not required to be deposited under the separate accounting procedures provided in § 301.7512-1, the provisions of this section shall apply except that paragraph (a)(1)(iv) shall not authorize the deferral of any deposit to a date after the date on which the return is required to be filed.
(2)
Wages paid in nonconvertible foreign currency.
The provisions of this section are not applicable with respect to taxes paid in nonconvertible foreign currency pursuant to § 301.6316-7 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).

(b)
Depositary forms
—(1)
In general.
A deposit required to be made by this section shall be made separately from a deposit required by any other section. An employer may make one, or more than one remittance of the amount required to be deposited. An amount of tax which is not required to be deposited may nevertheless be deposited if the employer so desires. If the aggregate amount of the taxes deposited is in excess of the taxes shown on the return, a credit or refund may be obtained; and in the event the excess is applied as a credit against such taxes for a subsequent return period, the employer shall reduce the amount of one
or more of the deposits otherwise required for such subsequent return period by the amount of such credit.
(2)
Deposits.
Each remittance of amounts required to be deposited shall be accompanied by a Federal Tax Deposit form which shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the remittance, together with the form, shall be forwarded to a financial institution authorized as a depositary for Federal taxes in accordance with 31 CFR part 214 or, at the election of the employer, to a Federal Reserve bank. For procedures governing the deposit of Federal taxes at a Federal Reserve bank, see 31 CFR part 214.7. The timeliness of the deposit will be determined by the date stamped on the Federal Tax Deposit form by the Federal Reserve bank or the authorized financial institution or, if section 7502(e) applies, by the date the deposit is treated as received under section 7502(e). Each employer making deposits under this section shall report on the return, for the period with respect to which such deposits are made, information regarding such deposits according to the instructions that apply to such return and pay at that time (or deposit by the due date of such return) the balance, if any, of the taxes due for such period.
(3)
Time deemed paid.
In general, amounts deposited under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall be considered as paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return in respect of such tax (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing such return), or at the time deposited, whichever is later. For purposes of section 6511 and the regulations thereunder, relating to period of limitation on credit or refund, if an amount is so deposited prior to April 15th of a calendar year immediately succeeding the calendar year in which occurs the period for which such amount was so deposited, such amount shall be considered as paid on such April 15th.
(c)
Procurement of prescribed form.
Copies of the Federal Tax Deposit form will so far as possible be furnished employers. An employer will not be excused from making a deposit, however, by the fact that no form has been furnished to it. An employer not supplied with the form should make application therefor in ample time to make the required deposits within the time prescribed. The employer may secure the form or additional forms by applying therefor and supplying its name, identification number, address, and the taxable period to which the deposits will relate. Copies of the Federal Tax Deposit form may be secured by application therefor.

§ 31.6402(a)-2
Credit or refund of tax under Federal Insurance Contributions Act or Railroad Retirement Tax Act.
(a)
Claim by person who paid tax to IRS
—(1)
In general.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, any person may file a claim for credit or refund for an overpayment (except to the extent that the overpayment must be credited pursuant to § 31.3503-1) if the person paid to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) more than the correct amount of employee Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax under section 3101 or employer FICA tax under section 3111, employee Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) tax under section 3201, employee representative RRTA tax under section 3211, or employer RRTA tax under section 3221, or interest, addition to the tax, additional amount, or penalty with respect to any such tax.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the claim for credit or refund must be made in the manner and subject to the conditions stated in this section. The claim for credit or refund must be filed on the form prescribed by the IRS and must designate the return period to which the claim relates, explain in detail the grounds and facts relied upon to support the claim, and set forth such other information as may be required by this section and by the instructions relating to the form used to make such claim. No refund or credit pursuant to this section for employer tax will be allowed unless the employer has first repaid or reimbursed its employee or has secured the employee's consent to the allowance of the claim for refund and includes a claim for the refund of such employee tax. However, this requirement does not apply to the extent that the taxes were not withheld from the employee or, after the employer makes reasonable efforts to repay or reimburse the employee or secure the employee's consent, the employer cannot locate the employee or the employee will not provide consent. No refund or credit of employee FICA or RRTA tax overcollected in an earlier year will be allowed if the employee has claimed a refund or credit of the amount of the overcollection which has not been rejected or if the employee has taken the amount of such tax into account in claiming a credit against or refund of the employee's income tax, including instances in which the employee has included an overcollection of employee FICA or RRTA tax in computing a special refund (see § 31.6413(c)-1).
(iii)
Additional Medicare Tax.
No refund or credit to the employer will be allowed for the amount of any overpayment of Additional Medicare Tax imposed under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) (as calculated under section 3101(b)(2)), which the employer deducted or withheld from an employee.
(iv) For adjustments without interest of overpayments of FICA or RRTA taxes, including Additional Medicare Tax, see § 31.6413(a)-2.
(v) For corrections of FICA and RRTA tax paid under the wrong chapter, see § 31.6205-1(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) and § 31.3503-1.
(vi) For provisions related to furnishing employee statements and corrected employee statements reporting wages and withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-1. For provisions relating to filing information returns and corrected information returns reporting wages and withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-2.
(vii) For the period of limitations on credit or refund of taxes, see § 301.6511(a)-1.
(2)
Statements supporting employer's claims for employee tax.
(i) Every employer who files a claim for refund or credit of employee FICA tax under section 3101 or employee RRTA tax under section 3201 collected from an employee must certify as part of the claim process that the employer has repaid or reimbursed the tax to its employee or has secured the employee's written consent to allowance of the filing of the claim for refund except to the extent that the taxes were not withheld from the employee. The employer must retain as part of its
records the written receipt of the employee showing the date and amount of the repayment, evidence of reimbursement, or the written consent of the employee, whichever is used in support of the claim.
(ii) Every employer who files a claim for refund or credit of employee FICA tax under section 3101 or employee RRTA tax under section 3201 collected from an employee in a calendar year prior to the year in which the credit or refund is claimed, also must certify as part of the claim process that the employer has obtained the employee's written statement that the employee has not claimed refund or credit of the amount of the overcollection, or if so, such claim has been rejected, and that the employee will not claim refund or credit of the amount. The employer must retain the employee's written statement as part of the employer's records.
(b)
Claim by employee
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in (b)(3) of this section, if more than the correct amount of employee tax under section 3101 or section 3201 is collected by an employer from an employee and paid to the IRS, the employee may file a claim for refund of the overpayment if—
(i) The employee does not receive repayment or reimbursement in any manner from the employer and does not authorize the employer to file a claim and receive refund or credit,
(ii) The overcollection cannot be corrected under § 31.3503-1, and
(iii) In the case of overpaid employee social security tax due to having received wages or compensation from multiple employers, the employee has not taken the overcollection into account in claiming a credit against, or refund of, his or her income tax, or if so, such claim has been rejected. See § 31.6413(c)-1.
(2)
Statements supporting employee's claim.
(i) Except as provided in (b)(3) of this section, each employee who makes a claim under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall submit with such claim a statement setting forth (a) the extent, if any, to which the employer has repaid or reimbursed the employee in any manner for the overcollection, and (b) the amount, if any, of credit or refund of such overpayment claimed by the employer or authorized by the employee to be claimed by the employer. The employee shall obtain such statement, if possible, from the employer, who should include in such statement the fact that it is made in support of a claim against the United States to be filed by the employee for refund of employee tax paid by such employer to the IRS. If the employer's statement is not submitted with the claim, the employee shall make the statement to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, and shall include therein an explanation of his or her inability to obtain the statement from the employer.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, each individual who makes a claim under paragraph (b)(1) of this section also shall submit with such claim a statement setting forth whether the individual has taken the amount of the overcollection into account in claiming a credit against, or refund of, his or her income tax, and the amount, if any, so claimed (see § 31.6413(c)-1).
(3)
Additional Medicare Tax.
(i) If more than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) (as calculated under section 3101(b)(2)), is collected by an employer from an employee and paid to the IRS, the employee may file a claim for refund of the overpayment and receive a refund or credit if the overcollection cannot be corrected under § 31.3503-1 and if the employee has not received repayment or reimbursement from the employer in the context of an interest-free adjustment. The claim for refund shall be made on Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,” by taking the overcollection into account in claiming a credit against, or refund of, tax. The form to be used by residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands is Form 1040-SS, “U.S. Self-Employment Tax Return (Including Additional Child Tax Credit for Bona Fide Residents of Puerto Rico).” The form to be used by residents of Puerto Rico is either Form 1040-SS or Form 1040-PR, “Planilla para la Declaración de la Contribución Federal sobre el Trabajo por Cuenta Propia (Incluyendo el Crédito Tributario Adicional por Hijos para
Residentes Bona Fide de Puerto Rico).” The employee may not authorize the employer to claim the credit or refund for the employee. See § 31.6402(a)-2(a)(1)(iii).
(ii) In the case of an overpayment of Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) for a taxable year of an individual for which a Form 1040 (or other applicable return in the Form 1040 series) has been filed, a claim for refund shall be made by the individual on Form 1040X, “Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.”

§ 31.6413(a)-1
Repayment or reimbursement by employer of tax erroneously collected from employee.
(a)
Federal Insurance Contributions Act and Railroad Retirement Tax Act
—(1)
Overcollection ascertained before return is filed.
(i) If an employer during any return period collects from an employee more than the correct amount of employee Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax under section 3101 or employee Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) tax under section 3201, and if the employer ascertains the error before filing the return on which the employee tax is required to be reported, repays or reimburses the amount of the overcollection to the employee before filing the return for such return period, and obtains and keeps as part of its records the written receipt of the employee showing the date and amount of the repayment or evidence of reimbursement, the employer shall not report on any return or pay to the IRS the amount of the overcollection.
(ii) Any overcollection not repaid or reimbursed to the employee as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section shall be reported and paid to the IRS on the return for reporting such tax for the return period in which the overcollection is made. However, the reporting and payment of the overcollection may subsequently be treated as an overpayment error ascertained after the return is filed for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(iii) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1), an error is ascertained when the employer has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it.
(2)
Error ascertained after return is filed.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, if an employer files a return for a return period on which FICA tax or RRTA tax is reported, collects from an employee and pays to the IRS more than the correct amount of the employee FICA or RRTA tax, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return and within the applicable period of limitations on credit or refund, the employer shall repay or reimburse the employee in the amount of the overcollection prior to the expiration of such limitations period. However, this paragraph (a)(2) does not apply to the extent that, after
reasonable efforts, the employer cannot locate the employee, or the employee does not provide the employer with the written statement required by § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(2)(iv). This paragraph (a)(2) has no application in any case in which an overcollection is made the subject of a claim by the employer for refund or credit under the procedure provided in § 31.6402(a)-2.
(ii) If an employer files a return for a return period on which Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) is reported, collects from an employee and pays to the IRS more than the correct amount of Additional Medicare Tax required to be withheld from wages or compensation, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return but before the end of the calendar year in which the wages or compensation were paid, the employer shall repay or reimburse the employee in the amount of the overcollection prior to the end of the calendar year. However, this paragraph does not apply to the extent that, after reasonable efforts, the employer cannot locate the employee.
(iii) If the employer repays the amount of the overcollection to an employee, the employer shall obtain and keep as part of its records the written receipt of the employee, showing the date and amount of the repayment.
(iv) If the employer reimburses the amount of the overcollection to an employee, the employer shall keep as part of its records evidence of reimbursement. However, for purposes of overcollected Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a), the employer shall reimburse the employee by applying the amount of the overcollection against the employee FICA or RRTA tax which attaches to wages or compensation paid by the employer to the employee in the calendar year in which the overcollection is made. The employer shall reimburse the employee by applying the amount of the overcollection against the employee FICA or RRTA tax which attaches to wages or compensation paid by the employer to the employee prior to the expiration of the applicable period of limitations on credit or refund. If the amount of the overcollection exceeds the amount so applied against such employee tax, the excess amount shall be repaid to the employee as required by this section.
(v) If, in any calendar year, an employer repays or reimburses an employee in the amount of an overcollection of employee FICA or RRTA tax that was collected from the employee in a prior calendar year, the employer shall obtain from the employee and keep as part of its records a written statement that the employee has not claimed refund or credit of the amount of the overcollection, or if so, such claim has been rejected, and that the employee will not claim refund or credit of such amount. For this purpose, a claim for refund or credit by the employee includes instances in which the employee has included an overcollection of employee FICA or RRTA tax in computing a special refund (see § 31.6413(c)-1). This paragraph (a)(2)(v) does not apply for purposes of overcollected Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) which must be repaid or reimbursed to the employee in the calendar year in which the overcollection is made.
(vi) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2), an error is ascertained when the employer has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it.
(vii) For the period of limitations on credit or refund of taxes, see § 301.6511(a)-1.
(viii) For corrections of FICA and RRTA tax paid under the wrong chapter, see § 31.6205-1(b)(2)(ii) and (iii) and § 31.3503-1.
(b)
Income tax withheld from wages
—(1)
Overcollection ascertained before return is filed.
(i) If an employer during any return period collects from an employee more than the correct amount of tax required to be withheld from wages under section 3402, and if the employer ascertains the error before filing the return on which such tax is required to be reported, repays or reimburses the amount of the overcollection to the employee before filing the return for such return period and before the end of the calendar year in which the overcollection was made, and obtains and keeps as part of its records the written receipt of the employee showing the date and amount of the repayment or
evidence of reimbursement, the employer shall not report on any return or pay to the IRS the amount of the overcollection.
(ii) Any overcollection not repaid or reimbursed to the employee as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be reported and paid to the IRS on the return for reporting such tax for the return period in which the overcollection is made. However, the reporting and payment of the overcollection may subsequently be treated as an overpayment error ascertained after the return is filed for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(iii) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), an error is ascertained when the employer has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it.
(2)
Error ascertained after return is filed.
(i) If an employer files a return for a return period on which tax required to be withheld from wages is reported, collects from an employee and pays to the IRS more than the correct amount of the tax required to be withheld from wages, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return but before the end of the calendar year in which the wages were paid, the employer shall repay or reimburse the employee in the amount of the overcollection prior to the end of the calendar year. However, this paragraph does not apply to the extent that, after reasonable efforts, the employer cannot locate the employee.
(ii) If the employer repays the amount of the overcollection to an employee, the employer shall obtain and keep as part of its records the written receipt of the employee, showing the date and amount of the repayment.
(iii) If the employer reimburses the amount of the overcollection to an employee, the employer shall keep as part of its records evidence of reimbursement. The employer shall reimburse the employee by applying the amount of the overcollection against the tax under section 3402, which otherwise would be required to be withheld from wages paid by the employer to the employee in the calendar year in which the overcollection is made. If the amount of the overcollection exceeds the amount so applied against such tax, the excess amount shall be repaid to the employee as required by this section.
(iv) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), an error is ascertained when the employer has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (a) of this section applies to adjusted returns filed on or after November 29, 2013.
[T.D. 9405, 73 FR 37380, July 1, 2008, as amended by T.D. 9645, 78 FR 71475, Nov. 29, 2013]
§ 31.6413(a)-2
Adjustments of overpayments.
(a)
In general.
(1) An employer who has overcollected or overpaid employee Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax under section 3101 or employer FICA tax under section 3111, employee Railroad Retirement Tax (RRTA) tax under section 3201 or employer RRTA tax under section 3221, or income tax required under section 3402 to be withheld, and has repaid or reimbursed the amount of the overcollection of such tax to the employee, shall correct such error as provided in this section. However, this section only applies to overcollected or overpaid Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a) if the employer has repaid or reimbursed the amount of the overcollection of such tax to the employee in the year in which the overcollection was made. Such correction may constitute an interest-free adjustment as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
(2) Every correction under this section of an overpayment of tax shall be made on the form prescribed by the IRS that corresponds to the return being corrected. The form, filed in accordance with this section and the instructions, will constitute an adjusted return for the return period being corrected.
(3) Every adjusted return on which an overpayment is corrected pursuant to this section shall certify that the employer has repaid or reimbursed its employee, except where taxes were not withheld from the employee or where, after reasonable efforts, the employer cannot locate the employee. Every adjusted return shall designate the return period in which the error was ascertained and the return period being
corrected, explain in detail the grounds and facts relied upon to support the correction, and set forth such other information as may be required by this section and § 31.6413(a)-1 and by the instructions relating to the adjusted return. Every adjusted return, filed by an employer, for overpayment of employee FICA tax under section 3101 or employee RRTA tax under section 3201 collected from an employee in a calendar year prior to the year in which the adjusted return is filed, must also certify that the employer has obtained the employee's written statement that the employee has not claimed refund or credit of the amount of the overcollection, or if so, such claim has been rejected, and that the employee will not claim refund or credit of the amount.
(4) For purposes of this section, an error is ascertained when the employer has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it.
(5) For provisions related to furnishing employee statements and corrected employee statements reporting wages and withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-1. For provisions relating to filing information returns and corrected information returns reporting wages and withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-2.

—(1)
Overcollection ascertained before return is filed.
If an employer collects more than the correct amount of employee FICA or RRTA tax from an employee, and if the employer ascertains the error before filing the return on which the employee tax with respect to such wages or compensation is required to be reported, and repays or reimburses the employee under § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(1), the employer shall not report on any return or pay to the IRS the amount of the overcollection. If the employer does not repay or reimburse the amount of the overcollection under § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(1) before filing the return, the employer must report the amount of the overcollection on the return. However, the payment of the overcollection may subsequently be treated as an overpayment error ascertained after the return is filed for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2)
Error ascertained after return is filed
—(i)
Employee tax.
If an employer files a return for a return period on which FICA tax or RRTA tax is required to be reported and reports on the return more than the correct amount of employee FICA or RRTA tax, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, and repays or reimburses the employee the amount of the overcollection of employee tax, as provided in § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(2), the employer may correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. The employer shall adjust the overpayment of tax by reporting the overpayment on an adjusted return for the return period in which the wages or compensation was paid, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the adjusted return as required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. However, for purposes of Additional Medicare Tax under section 3101(b)(2) or section 3201(a), if the amount of the overcollection is not repaid or reimbursed to the employee under § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(2)(ii), there is no overpayment to be adjusted under this section and the employer may only adjust an overpayment of such tax attributable to an administrative error, that is, an error involving the inaccurate reporting of the amount withheld, pursuant to this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the reporting of the overpayment on an adjusted return constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the adjusted return is filed before the expiration of the period of limitations on credit or refund. The employer shall take the adjusted amount as a credit towards payment of employment tax liabilities for the return period in which the adjusted return is filed unless the IRS notifies the employer that the adjustment is not permitted under paragraph (d) of this section.
(ii)
Employer tax.
If an employer files a return for a return period on which FICA or RRTA tax is required to be reported and reports on the return more than the correct amount of employer FICA or RRTA tax, and if the employer
ascertains the error after filing the return, the employer may correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. The employer must first repay or reimburse the employee the amount of any overcollection of employee tax, if any, as required by § 31.6413(a)-1(a)(2), before making the adjustment for the employer tax. The employer shall adjust the overpayment of tax by reporting the overpayment on an adjusted return for the return period in which the wages or compensation was paid, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the adjusted return as required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the reporting of the overpayment on an adjusted return constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section only if the adjusted return is filed before the expiration of the period of limitations on credit or refund. The employer shall take the adjusted amount as a credit towards payment of employment tax liabilities for the return period in which the adjusted return is filed unless the IRS notifies the employer that the adjustment is not permitted under paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)
Income tax withheld from wages
—(1)
Overcollection ascertained before return is filed.
If an employer collects more than the correct amount of income tax required to be withheld from wages, and if the employer ascertains the error before filing the return on which the tax is required to be reported, and repays or reimburses the employee under § 31.6413(a)-1(b)(1), the employer shall not report on any return or pay to the IRS the amount of the overcollection. If the employer does not repay or reimburse the amount of the overcollection under § 31.6413(a)-1(b)(1) before filing the return, the employer must report the amount of the overcollection on the return. However, the reporting and payment of the overcollection may subsequently be treated as an overpayment error ascertained after the return is filed for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Error ascertained after return is filed.
If an employer files a return for a return period on which income tax required to be withheld from wages is required to be reported and reports on the return more than the correct amount of income tax required to be withheld, and if the employer ascertains the error after filing the return, and repays or reimburses the employee in the amount of the overcollection as provided in § 31.6413(a)-1(b)(2), the employer may correct the error through an interest-free adjustment as provided in this section. The employer shall adjust the overpayment of tax by reporting the overpayment on an adjusted return for the return period in which the wages were paid, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the amount being reported on the adjusted return as required in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the reporting of the overpayment on an adjusted return constitutes an adjustment within the meaning of this section. If the amount of the overcollection is not repaid or reimbursed to the employee under § 31.6413(a)-1(b)(2), there is no overpayment to be adjusted under this section. However, the employer may adjust an overpayment of tax attributable to an administrative error, that is, an error involving the inaccurate reporting of the amount withheld, pursuant to this section. The employer shall take the adjusted amount as a credit towards payment of employment tax liabilities for the return period in which the adjusted return is filed unless the IRS notifies the employer that the adjustment is not permitted under paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Adjustments not permitted
—(1)
In general.
If an adjustment cannot be made, a claim for refund or credit may be filed in accordance with § 31.6402(a)-2 or § 31.6414-1.

90-day exception.
No adjustment in respect of an overpayment may be made if the overpayment relates to a return period for which the period of limitations on credit or refund of such overpayment will expire within 90 days of filing the adjusted return.
(3)
No adjustment after claim for refund filed.
No adjustment in respect of an overpayment may be made after the filing of a claim for credit or refund of such overpayment under § 31.6402(a)-2.

§ 31.6413(a)-3
Repayment by payor of tax erroneously collected from payee.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Erroneous withholding under section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Code.
If a payor or broker withholds under section 3406 from a payee in error or withholds more than the proper amount of the tax under section 3406, the payor or broker may refund the amount erroneously withheld as provided in section 6413 and this section. A payor or broker will be considered to have withheld erroneously under section 3406 only if the amount is withheld because of an error by the payor or broker (e.g., an error in flagging or identifying an account that is subject to withholding under section 3406). The payor or broker may, in its discretion, treat the amount withheld as an amount erroneously withheld and refund it to the payee if—
(i) The payor or broker requires a payee described in § 31.3406(g)-1(a) or described in a provision of the Internal Revenue Code requiring the reporting of a payment subject to withholding under section 3406 to certify that it is an exempt recipient, the payee fails to make the required certification, and the payor or broker subsequently withholds under section 3406 from a payment to the payee;
(ii) The payor or broker does not require the payee to certify concerning its exempt status and the payor or broker withholds under section 3406;
(iii) The payor or broker withholds under section 3406 from a payee after the payee provides a taxpayer identification number or required certification (including the documentation described in § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii), 1.6045-1(g)(3), or 1.6049-5(c) of this chapter) to the payor, but before the payor or broker treats the number or required certification as having been received under § 31.3406(e)-1(b); or
(iv) The amount is withheld because a payor imposed backup withholding on a payment made to a person because the payee failed to furnish the documentation described in § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) of this chapter and the payee subsequently furnishes, completes, or corrects the documentation. The documentation must be furnished, completed, or corrected prior to the end of the calendar year in which the payment is made and prior to the time the payor furnishes a Form 1099 to the payee with respect to the payment for which the withholding erroneously occurred.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section (other than erroneous withholding occurring under the circumstances described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section), if a payor or broker withholds because the payor or broker has not received a taxpayer identifying number or required certification and the payee subsequently provides a taxpayer identifying number or a required certification to the payor, the payor or broker may not refund the amount to the payee.
(b)
Refunding amounts erroneously withheld
—(1)
Time and manner.
If a payor or broker withholds under section 3406 from a payee in error (including withholding more than the correct amount, as described in paragraph (a) of this section), the payor or broker may refund the amount erroneously withheld to the payee if the refund is made prior to the end of the calendar year and prior to the time the payor or broker furnishes a Form 1099 to the payee with respect to the payment for which the erroneous withholding occurred. If the amount of the erroneous withholding is refunded to the payee, the payor or broker must—
(i) Keep as part of its records a receipt showing the date and amount of refund and must provide a copy of the receipt to the payee (a canceled check or an entry in a statement is sufficient, provided that the check or statement contains a specific notation that it is a refund of tax erroneously withheld);
(ii) Not report on a Form 1099 as tax withheld any amount which the payor or broker has refunded to a payee; and
(iii) Not deposit the amount erroneously withheld if the payor or broker has not deposited the amount of the tax prior to the time that the refund is made to the payee.
(2)
Adjustment after the deposit of the tax
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, if the amount erroneously withheld has been deposited prior to the time that the refund is made to the payee, the payor or broker may adjust any subsequent deposit of the tax collected under chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code that the payor or broker is required to make in the amount of the tax that has been refunded to the payee.
(ii)
Erroneous withholding from a payee that is a foreign person.
Where a payor withholds in error from a payee that is a nonresident alien or foreign person, as described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, the payor may refund some or all of the amount subject to backup withholding under section 3406. A refund may be paid in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) where the documentation is furnished, completed, or corrected prior to the end of the calendar year in which the payment is made and prior to the time the payor furnishes a Form 1099 to the payee with respect to the payment for which the withholding erroneously occurred. The amount of the refund will be the amount erroneously withheld less the amount of tax required to be withheld, if any, under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations under that chapter. With respect to the amount of the payment to the foreign person and the amount of tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (and the regulations thereunder), returns must be made in accordance with the requirements of § 1.1461-1 (b) and (c) of this chapter.

§ 31.6413(b)-1
Overpayments of certain employment taxes.
For provisions relating to the adjustment of overpayments of tax imposed by section 3101, 3111, 3201, 3221, or 3402, see § 31.6413(a)-2. For provisions relating to refunds of tax imposed by section 3101, 3111, 3201, or 3221, see §§ 31.6402(a)-1 and 31.6402(a)-2. For provisions relating to refunds of tax imposed by section 3402, see §§ 31.6402(a)-1 and 31.6414-1.
§ 31.6413(c)-1
Special refunds.
(a)
Who may make claims
—(1)
In general.
(i) If an employee receives wages, as defined in section 3121(a), from two or more employers in any calendar year:
(
a
) After 1954 and before 1959 in excess of $4,200,
(
b
) After 1958 and before 1966 in excess of $4,800,
(
c
) After 1965 and before 1968 in excess of $6,600,
(
d
) After 1967 and before 1972 in excess of $7,800,
(
e
) After 1971 and before 1973 in excess of $9,000,
(
f
) After 1972 and before 1974 in excess of $10,800,
(
g
) After 1973 and before 1975 in excess of $13,200, or
(
h
) After 1974 in excess of the contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act) which is effective with respect to such year,
the employee shall be entitled to a special refund of the amount, if any, by which the employee tax imposed by section 3101 with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom (whether or not paid) exceeds the employee tax with respect to the amount specified in (
a
) through (
h
) of this subdivision for the calendar year in question. Employee tax imposed by section 3101 with respect to tips reported by an employee to his employer and collected by the employer from funds turned over by the employee to the employer (see section 3102(c)) shall be treated, for purposes of this paragraph, as employee tax deducted from wages received by the employee. If the employee is required to file an income tax return for such calendar year (or for his last taxable year beginning in such calendar year) he may obtain the benefit of the special refund only by claiming credit as provided in § 1.31-2 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations).
(ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Employee A in the calendar year 1968 receives taxable wages in the amount of $5,000 from each of his employers, B, C, and D, for services performed during such year (or at any time after 1936), or a total of $15,000. Employee tax (computed at 4.4 percent, the aggregate employee tax rate in effect in 1968) is deducted from A's wages in the amount of $220 by B and $220 by C, or a total of $440. Employer D pays employee tax in the amount of $220 without deducting such tax from A's wages. The employee tax with respect to the first $7,800 of such wages is $343.20. A is entitled to a special refund of $96.80 ($440 minus $343.20). The $5,000 of wages received from employer D and the $220 of employee tax paid with respect thereto have no bearing in computing A's special refund since such tax was not deducted from his wages.

# Example 2.
Employee E in the calendar year 1968 performs services for employers F and G, for which E is entitled to wages of $7,800 from each employer, or a total of $15,600. On account of such services, E in 1967 received an advance payment of $1,800 of wages from F; and in 1968, receives wages in the amount of $6,000 from F and $7,800 from G. Employee tax was deducted as follows: In 1967, $79.20 ($1,800 × 4.4 percent, the aggregate employee tax rate in effect in 1967) by employer F; and in 1968, $264.00 ($6,000 × 4.4 percent, the aggregate employee tax rate in effect in 1968) by employer F, and $343.20 ($7,800 × 4.4 percent) by employer G. Thus, E in the calendar year 1968 received $13,800 in wages from which $607.20 of employee tax was deducted. The amount of employee tax with respect to the first $7,800 of such wages received in 1968 is $343.20. E is entitled to a special refund of $264.00 ($607.20 minus $343.20). The $1,800 advance of wages received in 1967 from F, and the $79.20 of employee tax with respect thereto, have no bearing in computing E's special refund for 1968, because the wages were not received in 1968. Such amounts could not form the basis for a special refund unless E during 1967 received from F and at least one more employer wages totaling more than $6,600.
(2)
Federal employees.
For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, each head of a Federal agency or of a wholly owned instrumentality of the United States who makes a return pursuant to section 3122 (and each agent designated by a head of a Federal agency or instrumentality who makes a return pursuant to such section) is considered a separate employer. For such purposes, the term “wages” includes the amount which each such head (or agent) determines to constitute wages paid an employee, but not in excess of the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) (
a
) through (
h
) of this section for the calendar year in question. For example, if wages received by an employee during calendar year 1974 are reportable by two or more agents of one or more Federal agencies and the amount of such wages is in excess of $13,200 the employee shall be entitled to a special refund of the amount, if any, by which the employee tax imposed with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee tax with respect to the first $13,200 of such wages. Moreover, if an employee receives wages during any calendar year from an agency or wholly owned instrumentality of the United States and from one or more other employers, either private or governmental, the total amount of such wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions.
(3)
State employees.
For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, the term “wages” includes such remuneration for services covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 218 of the Social Security Act, relating to voluntary agreements for coverage of employees of State and local governments, as would be wages if such services constituted employment (see § 31.3121(a)-1, relating to wages); the term “employer” includes a State or any political subdivision thereof, or any instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing; and the term “tax” or “tax imposed by section 3101” includes an amount equivalent to the employee tax which would be imposed by section 3101 if such services constituted employment. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are applicable whether or not any amount deducted from an employee's remuneration as a result of an agreement made pursuant to section 218 of the Social Security Act has been paid pursuant to such agreement. Thus, the special refund provisions are applicable to amounts equivalent to employee tax deducted from employees' remuneration by States, political subdivisions, or instrumentalities by reason of agreements made under section 218 of
the Social Security Act. Moreover, if during any calendar year an employee receives remuneration for services covered by such an agreement and during the same calendar year receives wages from one or more other employers, either private or governmental, the total amount of such remuneration and wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions.
(4)
Employees of certain foreign corporations.
For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, the term “wages” includes such remuneration for services covered by an agreement made pursuant to section 3121(l), relating to agreements for coverage of employees of certain foreign corporations, as would be wages if such services constituted employment (see § 31.3121(a)-1, relating to wages); the term “employer” includes any domestic corporation which has entered into an agreement pursuant to section 3121(l); and the term “tax” or “tax imposed by section 3101” includes, in the case of services covered by an agreement entered into pursuant to section 3121(l), an amount equivalent to the employee tax which would be imposed by section 3101 if such services constituted employment. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are applicable whether or not any amount deducted from the employee's remuneration by reason of such agreement has been paid to the district director. Thus, the special refund provisions are applicable to amounts equivalent to employee tax deducted from employees' remuneration by reason of agreements made under section 3121(l). A domestic corporation which enters into an agreement pursuant to section 3121(l) shall, for purposes of this paragraph, be considered an employer in its capacity as a party to such agreement separate and distinct from its identity as an employer employing individuals on its own account (see section 3121(l)(9)). If during any calendar year an employee receives remuneration for services covered by such an agreement and during the same calendar year receives wages for services in employment, the total amount of such remuneration and wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions. For provisions relating to agreements entered into under section 3121(l), see the regulations in part 36 of this chapter (Regulations on Contract Coverage of Employees of Foreign Subsidiaries).
(5)
Governmental employees in American Samoa.
For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, the Governor of American Samoa and each agent designated by him who makes a return pursuant to section 3125(b) (see § 31.3125) is considered a separate employer. For such purposes, the term “wages” includes the amount which the Governor (or any agent) determines to constitute wages paid an employee, but not in excess of the amount specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) (
a
) through (
h
) of this section for the calendar year in question. For example, if wages received by an employee during calendar year 1974 are reportable by two or more agents pursuant to section 3125(b) and the total amount of such wages is in excess of $13,200, the employee shall be entitled to a special refund of the amount, if any, by which the employee tax imposed with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee tax with respect to the first $13,200 of such wages. Moreover, if an employee receives wages during any calendar year from the Government of American Samoa, from a political subdivision thereof, or from any wholly-owned instrumentality of such government or political subdivision and from one or more other employers, either private or governmental, the total amount of such wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions.
(6)
Governmental employees in the District of Columbia.
For purposes of special refunds of employee tax, the Commissioner of the District of Columbia (or, prior to the transfer of functions pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (81 Stat. 948), the Commissioners of the District of Columbia) and each agent designated by him who makes a return pursuant to section 3125(c) (see § 31.3125) is considered a separate employer. For such purposes, the term “wages” includes the amount which the Commissioner (or any agent) determines to constitute wages paid an employee, but not in excess of the
amount specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) (
a
) through (
h
) of this section for the calendar year in question. For example, if wages received by an employee during calendar year 1974 are reportable by two or more agents pursuant to section 3125(c) and the total amount of such wages is in excess of $13,200 the employee shall be entitled to a special refund of the amount, if any, by which the employee tax imposed with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee tax imposed with respect to such wages and deducted therefrom exceeds the employee tax with respect to the first $13,200 of such wages. Moreover, if an employee receives wages during any calendar year from the Government of the District of Columbia or from a wholly-owned instrumentality thereof and from one or more other employers, either private or governmental, the total amount of such wages shall be taken into account for purposes of the special refund provisions.
(b)
Claims for special refund
—(1)
In general.
An employee who is entitled to a special refund under section 6413(c) may claim such refund under the provisions of this section only if the employee is not entitled to claim the amount thereof as a credit against income tax as provided in § 1.31-2 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations). Each claim under this section shall be made with respect to wages received within one calendar year (regardless of the year or years after 1936 during which the services were performed for which such wages are received), and shall be filed after the close of such year.
(2)
Form of claim.
Each claim for special refund under this section shall be made on Form 843, in accordance with the regulations in this subpart and the instructions relating to such form. In the case of a claim filed prior to April 15, 1968, the claim shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the employee resides or, if the employee does not reside in any internal revenue district, with the District Director, Baltimore, Md. 21202. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), in the case of a claim filed after April 14, 1968, the claim shall be filed with the service center serving such internal revenue district. However, in the case of an employee who does not reside in any internal revenue district and who is outside the United States, the claim shall be filed with the Director of International Operations, U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. 20225, unless the employee resides in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, in which case the claim shall be filed with the Director of International Operations, U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Hato Rey, P.R. 00917. The claim shall include the employee's account number and the following information with respect to each employer from whom he received wages during the calendar year: (i) The name and address of such employer, (ii) the amount of wages received during the calendar year to which the claim relates, and (iii) the amount of employee tax collected by the employer from the employee with respect to such wages. Other information may be required but should be submitted only upon request.
(3)
Period of limitation.
For the period of limitation upon special refund of employee tax imposed by section 3101, see § 301.6511(a)-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
(c)
Special refunds with respect to compensation as defined in the Railroad Retirement Tax Act
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any individual who, during any calendar year after 1967, receives wages (as defined by section 3121(a)) from one or more employers and also receives compensation (as defined by section 3231(e)) which is subject to the tax imposed on employees by section 3201 or the tax imposed on employee representatives by section 3211 such compensation shall, solely for purposes of applying section 6413(c)(1) and this section with respect to the hospital insurance tax imposed by section 3101(b), be treated as wages (as defined by section 3121(a)) received from an employer with respect to which the hospital insurance tax imposed by section 3101(b) was deducted. For purposes of this section, compensation received shall be determined under the principles provided in chapter 22 of the Code and the regulations thereunder (see section 3231(e)
and § 31.3231(e)-1). Therefore, compensation paid for time lost shall be deemed earned and received for purposes of this section in the month in which such time is lost, and compensation which is earned during the period for which a return of taxes under chapter 22 is required to be made and which is payable during the calendar month following such period shall be deemed to have been received for purposes of this section during such period only. Further, compensation is deemed to have been earned and received when an employee or employee representative performs services for which he is paid, or for which there is a present or future obligation to pay, regardless of the time at which payment is made or deemed to be made.
(2)
Example.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
Employee A rendered services to X during 1973 for which he was paid compensation at the monthly rate of $650 which was taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act. A was paid $550 by X in January 1973 which was earned and deemed received in December 1972 and $650 in January of 1974 which was earned and deemed received in December of 1973. A also earned and received wages in 1973 from employer Y, which were subject to the employee tax under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, in the amount of $6,000. A paid hospital insurance tax on $13,800 ($7,800 compensation from X including $650 earned and deemed received in December 1973 but paid in January 1974 and not including $550 paid in January 1973 but earned and deemed received in December 1972, $6,000 compensation from Y) received or deemed received or earned in 1973.

§ 31.6414-1
Credit or refund of income tax withheld from wages.
(a)
In general.
(1) Any employer who pays to the IRS more than the correct amount of income tax required to be withheld from wages under section 3402 or interest, addition to the tax, additional amount, or penalty with respect to such tax, may file a claim for refund of the overpayment in the manner and subject to the conditions stated in this section on the form prescribed by the IRS. The claim for refund must designate the return period to which the claim relates, explain in detail the grounds and facts relied upon to support the claim, and set forth such other information as may be required by the regulations in this section and by the instructions relating to the form used to make such claim. No refund to the employer will be allowed under this section for the amount of any overpayment of tax which the employer deducted or withheld from an employee.
(2) For provisions related to furnishing employee statements and corrected employee statements reporting wages and withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-1. For provisions relating to filing information returns and corrected information returns reporting wages and withheld taxes, see sections 6041 and 6051 and §§ 1.6041-2 and 31.6051-2.
(3) For interest-free adjustments of overpayments of income tax withheld from wages, see § 31.6413(a)-2.
(b)
Period of limitation.
For the period of limitation upon credit or refund of taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, see § 301.6511(a)-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).

§ 31.6652(c)-1
Failure of employee to report tips for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.
(a)
In general.
In the case of failure by an employee to furnish, pursuant to the provisions of section 6053(a), to his employer a report of tips received by him in the course of his employment, which constitute wages (as defined in section 3121(a)), there shall be paid by the employee, in addition to the tax imposed by section 3101 with respect to the amount of tips which he so failed
to report, an amount equal to 50 percent of such tax. The additional amount imposed for such failure shall be paid in the same manner as tax upon notice and demand by the district director.
(b)
Reasonable cause.
Payment of an amount equal to 50 percent of the tax imposed by section 3101 with respect to the tips which the employee failed to report will not be required if it is established to the satisfaction of the district director or the director of the regional service center that such failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. An affirmative showing of reasonable cause must be made in the form of a written statement, containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, setting forth all the facts alleged as a reasonable cause. An employee's reluctance to disclose to his employer the amount of tips received by him will not establish that the employee's failure to report tips to his employer was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.
[T.D. 7001, 34 FR 1005, Jan. 23, 1969]
§ 31.6674-1
Penalties for fraudulent statement or failure to furnish statement.
Any person required to furnish a statement to an employee under the provisions of section 6051 or 6053(b) is subject to a civil penalty for willful failure to furnish such statement in the manner, at the time, and showing the information required under such section (or § 31.6051-1 or § 31.6053-2), or for willfully furnishing a false or fraudulent statement to an employee. The penalty for each such violation is $50, which shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as the tax imposed on employers under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. See section 7204 for criminal penalty.
[T.D. 7001, 34 FR 1006, Jan. 23, 1969]
§ 31.6682-1
False information with respect to withholding.
(a)
Civil penalty.
If any individual makes a statement under section 3402 (relating to income tax collected at source) which results in a lesser amount of income tax actually deducted and withheld than is properly allowable under section 3402 and, at the time the statement was made, there was no reasonable basis for the statement, the individual shall pay a penalty of $500 for the statement. There was a reasonable basis for a statement of the number of exemptions an individual claimed on a Form W-4, if the individual properly completed the Form W-4 by taking into account only allowable amounts for items which are allowable and by computing the number of exemptions in accordance with the instructions on the Form W-4. This penalty is in addition to any criminal penalty provided by law. This penalty may be assessed at any time after the statement is made, until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
(b)
Deficiency procedures not to apply.
The civil penalty imposed by section 6682 may be assessed and collected without regard to the deficiency procedures provided by Subchapter B of Chapter 63 of the Code.

# PART 32—TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT TAX REGULATIONS UNDER THE ACT OF DECEMBER 29, 1981 (PUB. L. 97-123)
Sec.
32.1
Social security taxes with respect to payments on account of sickness or accident disability.
32.2
Railroad retirement taxes with respect to payments on account of sickness or accident disability.

# Authority:
95 Stat. 1662 and 1663, 26 U.S.C. 3121(a) and 3231(e)(4); 68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C. 7805.
§ 32.1
Social security taxes with respect to payments on account of sickness or accident disability.
(a)
General rule.
The amount of any payment on or after January 1, 1982, made to, or on behalf of, an employee or any of his dependents on account of sickness or accident disability is not excluded from the term wages as defined in section 3121(a)(2)(A) unless such payment is—
(1) Received under a workmen's compensation law (as defined in § 31.3121(a)(2)-1(d)(3) for payments made on or after December 15, 2005), or
(2) Made by a third party pursuant to a contractual agreement between the employer and third party entered into prior to December 14, 1981, but then only if—
(i) The third party's coverage for that employee's group ceases prior to March 1, 1982,
(ii) No third party payment is made to such employee under that contract after February 28, 1982, and
(iii) The cessation of the third party's coverage for that employee's group indefinitely terminates the contractual relationship between the third party and the employer as to sickness and accident disability benefits for that employee's group.
See section 3121(a)(4) and § 31.3121(a)(4)−1 for the exclusion from the term “wages” of any payment on account of sickness or accident disability made after the expiration of 6 calendar months following the last calendar month in which the employee worked.
(b)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Company Q enters into a contract on August 31, 1981, with Insurance Company R to provide sickness and accident disability payments to Q's employees. The contract expires on February 28, 1982. On March 1, 1982, Q enters into a new contract with R to provide sickness and accident disability payments to Q's employees. Payments made by R pursuant to the contract expiring February 28, 1982, are included in “wages” as defined in section 3121(a)(2)(B).

# Example 2.
Company S enters into a contract on November 15, 1981, with Insurance Company T to provide sickness and accident disability payments to S's employees. The contract expires on February 15, 1982, and is not renewed. A, one of S's employees, has been receiving sickness payments from T since December 1, 1981. T makes its final payment to A on February 22, 1982. The payments made by T to A pursuant to its contract with S are not included in “wages” as defined in section 3121(a)(2)(B).
(c)
Workmen's compensation laws.
(1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a payment made under a workmen's compensation law does not include a payment made pursuant to a State temporary disability insurance law.
(2) If an employee receives a payment on account of sickness or accident disability which is not made under a workmen's compensation law and which must be repaid if the employee receives a workmen's compensation award with respect to the same period of absence from work, such payment is not excluded from the term “wages” as defined in section 3121(a)(2)(B).
(d)
Sickness or accident disability.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a payment made on account of sickness or accident disability includes any payment for personal injuries or sickness includible in gross income under section 105(a) and the regulations thereunder and thus does not include—
(1) Any amount which is expended for medical care as described in section 105(b) and § 1.105-2,
(2) Any payment which is unrelated to absence from work as described in section 105(c) and § 1.105-3, or
(3) Any payment or a portion thereof which is attributable to a contribution by the employee as determined in paragraphs (d) and (e) of § 1.105-1.
A payment made on account of sickness or accident disability does not include any payment which is excludable from gross income under section 104(a) (2), (4), or (5).
An employee who elects to reduce his compensation or to forgo an increase in his compensation under a salary reduction agreement with an employer will not be deemed to have made employee contributions to the sickness or accident disability plan or system if the employee is not subject to income or social security taxes on the reduction in compensation.
A tax which is paid by an employee to fund a State temporary disability insurance program is considered a contribution by the employee for purposes of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(e)
Payments by third parties.
(1) Any third party making a payment on account of sickness or accident disability which payment is not excluded from the term “wages” under paragraph (a) of this section shall be treated as the employer with respect to such wages, except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. Accordingly, such third party must withhold from such payment the tax imposed on the employee by section 3101, pay the tax imposed on employers by section 3111, deposit such taxes pursuant to section 6302 and § 31.6302(c)-1(a), and provide the receipts required by section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2.
(2) If any third party who is treated as the employer solely by reason of the applicability of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph promptly—
(i) Withholds the tax imposed on the employee by section 3101,
(ii) Deposits such tax pursuant to section 6302 and § 31.6302(c)-1(a), and
(iii) Notifies the employer for whom services are normally rendered of the amount of the wages paid on which tax was withheld and deposited,
then the employer (and not the third party) shall be required to pay the tax imposed by section 3111 and to comply with the requirements of section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2 with respect to the wages. For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the taxes described in subdivision (i) shall be treated by the third party as if included in the term “taxes” as defined in § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(iii). For purposes of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, the notice must be provided by the third party within the time required for the deposit of the tax under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For the purpose of providing the notice, the rules of section 7502(a), relating to timely mailing being treated as timely filing, shall apply. The employer, if notified pursuant to subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph by a third party who has complied with the requirements of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, must deposit the tax imposed by section 3111 in accordance with § 31.6302(c)-1(a). For purposes of § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(iii)(
b
), with respect to the employer for whom services are normally rendered the term “taxes” shall not include any tax imposed on employers by section 3111 that is required to be paid by a third party under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph until the employer receives notification from the third party under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph (2).
(3) A third party making a payment on account of sickness or accident disability to an employee as agent for the employer or making such a payment directly to the employer shall not be treated as the employer under subparagraph (1) with respect to such payment unless the agency agreement so provides. The determining factor as to whether a third party is an agent of the employer is whether the third party bears any insurance risk. If the third party bears no insurance risk and is reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is an agent of the employer even if the third party is responsible for making determinations of the eligibility of individual employees of the employer for payments on account of sickness or accident disability. If the
third party is paid an insurance premium and not reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is not an agent of the employer, but the third party is treated as the employer as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (e).
(4) In order to avoid overpayment of taxes which would result from paying taxes—
(i) On remuneration which exceeds the annual contribution and benefit base (as described in section 3121(a)(1)),
(ii) With respect to a period of time which exceeds the 6-calendar-month period described in section 3121(a)(4), or
(iii) On a payment or a portion thereof which is attributable to a contribution by the employee,
the third party may request information from the employer as to the total wages earned by the employee for the calendar year in which the third party is making payments, as to the last date on which the employee worked for the employer during such year, and as to the amount of any contribution by the employee. Except if the third party has reason not to believe any information supplied by the employer as the result of a request made pursuant to the preceding sentence, the third party may rely on such information in complying with the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (e). The third party may not rely on representations of the employee as to the information which may be requested of the employer in complying with the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (e).
(5) The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Pursuant to an agreement with Company U, Insurance Company V makes payments on account of sickness or accident disability to U's employees. Such payments are not made under a workmen's compensation law. U reimburses V for all such payments and pays V a fee for its expenses of administering the payments. V is not treated as the employer with respect to such payments.

# Example 2.
Pursuant to an agreement with Company W, Insurance Company X indemnifies W for the amount of any payments which W must make to an employee on account of sickness or accident disability. Such payments are not made under a workmen's compensation law. X makes its indemnity payments directly to W. W makes the payments to its employees. X is not treated as the employer with respect to such payments.

# Example 3.
Pursuant to an agreement with Company Y (which is not an agency agreement described in subparagraph (3) of this § 32.1(e)), Insurance Company Z makes payments on account of sickness or accident disability to Y's employees. Such payments are not made under a workmen's compensation law. Z does not notify Y of the amount of such payments. Z is treated as the employer with respect to such payments.
(f)
Penalties and interest on payments made from January 1, 1982, to June 30 1982.
No penalty under section 6656(a) or interest under section 6601 will be assessed for the failure to make timely payments to the tax imposed by section 3101 or section 3111 on payments made on account of sickness or accident disability, which payments of tax are made after December 31, 1981, and before July 1, 1982, to the extent that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.
(g)
Special rules.
(1) For purposes of subdivision (iii) of paragraph (e)(2), the last employer for whom the employee worked prior to becoming sick or disabled or for whom the employee was working at the time he became sick or disabled shall be deemed to be the employer for whom services are normally rendered, provided that such employer made contributions on behalf of such employee to the plan or system under which the employee is being paid.
(2) The application of the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (g) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
B is employed by Company M. B becomes sick and is absent from work for 3 months. While B is absent from work, he receives sick pay from Insurance Company N pursuant to a plan established by M and to which M has made contributions on behalf of B. M is the employer for whom services are normally rendered by B.

# Example 2.
C is employed by Company O and is also employed on a part-time basis by Company Q. C becomes sick while at work at Q's place of business. C is absent from work for 3 months. While C is absent from work he receives sick pay from Insurance Company P pursuant to a plan established by O and to which O has made contributions on behalf of C. O is the employer for whom services are normally rendered by C.

# Example 3.
D is a member of a labor union whose members receive health and welfare benefit payments from a trust fund which is supported by the contributions of the various employers who employ the labor union's members. D has been employed by Company R for 4 days when he becomes sick and is absent from work for 3 months. While D is absent form work he receives sick pay from his union's trust fund to which R has made contributions on D's behalf. R is the employer for whom services are normally rendered by D.
(3) For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, in the case of payments on account of sickness or accident disability made to employees by a third party insurer pursuant to a contract of insurance with a multiemployer plan which is obligated to make payments on account of sickness or accident disability to such employees pursuant to a collectively bargained agreement, if the third party insurer making the payments complies with the requirements of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (2) of paragraph (e) and notifies the plan of the amount of wages paid on which tax was withheld and deposited within the time required for notification of the employer under subparagraph (2) of paragraph (e), then the plan (and not the third party insurer) shall be required to pay the tax imposed by section 3111 and to comply with the requirements of section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2 with respect to such payments unless, within 6 business days of the receipt of such notification, the plan notifies the employer for whom services are normally rendered of the amount of the wages on which tax was withheld and deposited. If the plan provides such notice to the employer, the employer (and not the plan) shall be required to pay the tax imposed by section 3111 and to comply with the requirements of section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2 with respect to the wages.
[T.D. 7823, 47 FR 29225, July 6, 1982, as amended by T.D. 7867, 48 FR 793, Jan. 7, 1983; T.D. 9233, 70 FR 74199, Dec. 15, 2005]
§ 32.2
Railroad retirement taxes with respect to payments on account of sickness or accident disability.
(a)
General rule.
Notwithstanding the provisions of § 31.3231(e)-1(a)(3)(i), the amount of any payment on or after January 1, 1982, made to, or on behalf of, an employee or any of his dependents on account of sickness or accident disability is not excluded from the term “compensation” as defined in section 3231(e)(1) (for purposes of applying sections 3201(b) and 3221(b) (and so much of section 3211(a) as relates to the rates of the taxes imposed by sections 3101 and 3111)) unless such payment is—
(1) Received under a workmen's compensation law,
(2) Received as a benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974,
(3) Made after the expiration of 6 calendar months following the last calendar month in which such employee worked,
(4) Made by a third party pursuant to a contractual agreement between the employer and third party entered into prior to December 14, 1981, but then only if—
(i) The third party's coverage for that employee's group ceases prior to March 1, 1982,
(ii) No third party payment is made to such employee under that contract after February 28, 1982, and
(iii) The cessation of the third party's coverage for that employee's group terminates indefinitely the contractual relationship between the third party and the employer as to sickness and accident disability benefits for that employee's group; or
(5) Made under section 2(a) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act for days of sickness, to the extent that such sickness (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Railroad Retirement Board) is the result of on-the-job injury.
The 6-calendar-month provision described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph shall be applied in a manner comparable to the 6-calendar-month provision described in § 31.3121(a)(4)-1.
(b)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of subparagraph (4) of paragraph (a) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.

# Example 2.
Company S enters into a contract on November 15, 1981 with Insurance Company T to provide sickness and accident disability payments to S's employees. The contract expires on February 15, 1982, and is not renewed. A, one of S's employees, has been receiving sickness payments from T since December 1, 1981. T makes its final payment to A on February 22, 1982. The payments made by T to A pursuant to its contract with S are not included in “compensation” as defined in section 3231(e)(1).

(1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a payment made under a workmen's compensation law does not include a payment made pursuant to a State temporary disability insurance law.
(2) If an employee receives a payment on account of sickness or accident disability which is not excluded from the term “compensation” under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section and which must be repaid if the employee receives a workmen's compensation award with respect to the same period of absence from work, such payment is not excluded from the term “compensation” as defined in section 3231(e)(1).
(d)
Sickness or accident disability.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a payment made on account of sickness or accident disability includes any payment for personal injuries or sickness includible in gross income under section 105(a) and the regulations thereunder and thus does not include—
(1) Any amount which is expended for medical care as described in section 105(b) and § 1.105-2,
(2) Any payment which is unrelated to absence from work as described in section 105(c) and § 1.105-3, or
(3) Any payment or a portion thereof which is attributable to a contribution by the employee as determined in paragraphs (d) and (e) of § 1.105-1.
A payment made on account of sickness or accident disability does not include any payment which is excludable from gross income under section 104(a) (4) or (5).
An employee who elects to reduce his compensation or to forgo an increase in his compensation under a salary reduction agreement with an employer will not be deemed to have made employee contributions to the sickness or accident disability plan or system if the employee is not subject to income or railroad retirement taxes on the reduction in compensation.
A tax which is paid by an employee to fund a State temporary disability insurance program is considered a contribution by the employee for purposes of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(e)
Payments by third parties.
(1) Any third party making a payment on account of sickness or accident disability which payment is not excluded from the term “compensation” under paragraph (a) of this section shall be treated as the employer with respect to such compensation, except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. Accordingly, such third party must withhold from such payment the tax imposed on the employee by section 3201 and the tax imposed on the employee representative by section 3211, if applicable, pay the tax imposed on employers by section 3221, deposit such taxes pursuant to section 6302 and § 31.6302(c)-2(a), and provide the receipts required by section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2.
(2) If any third party who is treated as the employer solely by reason of the applicability of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph promptly—
(i) Withholds the tax imposed on the employee by section 3201 and the tax imposed on the employee representative by section 3211, if applicable,
(ii) Deposits such tax pursuant to section 6302 and § 31.6302(c)-2(a), and
(iii) Notifies the employer for whom services are normally rendered of the amount of the compensation paid on which tax was withheld and deposited,
then the employer (and not the third party) shall be required to pay the tax imposed by section 3221 and to comply with the requirements of section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2 with respect to the compensation. For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the tax described in subdivision (i) shall be treated by the third party
as if included in the employee tax described in § 31.6302(c)-2(a)(1)(i). For purposes of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, the notice must be provided by the third party within the time required for the deposit of the tax under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For the purpose of providing the notice, the rules of section 7502(a), relating to timely mailing being treated as timely filing, shall apply. The employer, if notified pursuant to subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph by a third party who has complied with the requirements of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, must deposit the tax imposed by section 3221 in accordance with § 31.6302(c)-(2)(a). For purposes of § 31.6302(c)-2(a)(1)(ii), with respect to the employer for whom services are normally rendered the term “taxes” shall not include any tax imposed on employers by section 3111 that is required to be paid by a third party under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph until the employer receives notification from the third party under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph (2).
(3) A third party making a payment on account of sickness or accident disability to an employee as agent for the employer or making such a payment directly to the employer shall not be treated as the employer under subparagraph (1) with respect to such payment unless the agency agreement so provides. The determining factor as to whether a third party is an agent of the employer is whether the third party bears any insurance risk. If the third party bears no insurance risk and is reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is an agent of the employer even if the third party is responsible for making determinations of the eligibility of individual employees of the employer for payments on account of sickness or accident disability. If the third party is paid an insurance premium and not reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is not an agent of the employer, but the third party is treated as the employer as provided in paragraph (1) of this paragraph (e).
(4) In order to avoid overpayment of taxes which would result from paying taxes—
(i) On remuneration which exceeds one-twelfth of the annual contribution and benefit base (as described in section 3121(a)(1)) each month,
(ii) With respect to a period of time which exceeds the 6-calendar-month period described in subparagraph (3) of paragraph (a) of this section, or
(iii) On a payment or a portion thereof which is attributable to a contribution by the employee,
the third party may request information from the employer as to the total wages earned by the employee for the calendar month in which the third party is making payments, as to the last date on which the employee worked for the employer, and as to the amount of any contribution by the employee. Except if the third party has reason not to believe any information supplied by the employer as the result of a request made pursuant to the preceding sentence, the third party may rely on such information in complying with the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (e). The third party may not rely on representations of the employee as to the information which may be requested of the employer in complying with the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (e).
(5) The application of the provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Pursuant to an agreement with Company U, Insurance Company V makes payments on account of sickness or accident disability to U's employees. Such payments are not made under a workmen's compensation law, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, or the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act for days of sickness. U reimburses V for all such payments and pays V a fee for its expenses of administering the payments. V is not treated as the employer with respect to such payments.

# Example 2.
Pursuant to an agreement with Company W, Insurance Company X indemnifies W for the amount of any payments which X must make to an employee on account of sickness or accident disability. Such payments are not made under a workmen's compensation law, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, or the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act for days of sickness. X makes its indemnity payments directly to W. W makes the payments to its employees. X is not treated as the employer with respect to such payments.

# Example 3.
Pursuant to an agreement with Company Y (which is not an agency agreement described in subparagraph (3) of this § 32.2(e)), Insurance Company Z makes payments on account of sickness or accident disability to Y's employees. Such payments are not made under a workmen's compensation law, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, or the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act for days of sickness. Z does not notify Y of the amount of such payments. Z is treated as the employer with respect to such payments.
(f)
Penalties and interest on payments made from January 1, 1982 to June 30, 1982.
No penalty under section 6656(a) or interest under section 6601 will be assessed for the failure to make timely payments of the tax imposed by section 3201, 3211, or 3221 on payments made on account of sickness or accident disability, which payments of tax are made after December 31, 1981, and before July 1, 1982, to the extent that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.
(g)
Special rules.
(1) For purposes of subdivision (iii) of paragraph (e)(2), the last employer for whom the employee worked prior to becoming sick or disabled or for whom the employee was working at the time he became sick or disabled shall be deemed to be the employer for whom services are normally rendered, provided that such employer made contributions on behalf of such employee to the plan or system under which the employee is being paid.
(2) The application of the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (g) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
B is employed by Company M. B becomes sick and is absent from work for 3 months. While B is absent from work, he receives sick pay from Insurance Company N pursuant to a plan established by M and to which M has made contributions on behalf of B. M is the employer for whom services are normally rendered by B.

# Example 2.
C is employed by Company O and is also employed on a part-time basis by Company Q. C becomes sick while at work at Qs place of business. C is absent from work for 3 months. While C is absent from work, he receives sick pay from Insurance Company P pursuant to a plan established by O and to which O has made contributions on behalf of C. O is the employer for whom services are normally rendered by C.

# Example 3.
D is a member of a labor union whose members receive health and welfare benefit payments from a trust fund which is supported by the contributions of the various employers who employ the labor union's members. D has been employed by Company R for 4 days when he becomes sick and is absent from work for 3 months. While D is absent from work he receives sick pay from his union's trust fund to which R has made contributions on D's behalf. R is the employer for whom services are normally rendered by D.
(3) For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, in the case of payments on account of sickness or accident disability made to employees by a third party insurer pursuant to a contract of insurance with a multiemployer plan which is obligated to make payments on account of sickness or accident disability to such employees pursuant to a collectively bargained agreement, if the third party insurer making the payments complies with the requirements of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (2) of paragraph (e) and notifies the plan of the amount of compensation paid on which tax was withheld and deposited within the time required for notification of the employer under subparagraph (2) of paragraph (e), then the plan (and not the third party insurer) shall be required to pay the tax imposed by section 3221 and to comply with the requirements of section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2 with respect to such payments unless, within 6 business days of the receipt of such notification, the plan notifies the employer for whom services are normally rendered of the amount of the compenation on which tax was withheld and deposited. If the plan provides such notice to the employer, the employer (and not the plan) shall be required to pay the tax imposed by section 3221 and to comply with the requirements of section 6051 and §§ 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2 with respect to the compensation.

§ 35.3405-1T
Questions and answers relating to withholding on pensions, annuities, and certain other deferred income (temporary regulations).
The following questions and answers relate to withholding on pensions, annuities, and other deferred income under section 3405 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as added by section 334 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Tax Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-248) (TEFRA):

# a. In general
a-1. Q. How did TEFRA change the law on withholding requirements for pensions, annuities, and other deferred income?
A. TEFRA amended the Internal Revenue Code to impose withholding requirements on designated distributions paid after December 31, 1982. Further, although under prior law individuals could elect to have Federal income tax withheld from certain pension and annuity payments, TEFRA requires withholding on all designated distributions unless the payee elects not to have withholding apply.
a-2. Q. What type of payment is a designated distribution that is subject to the new withholding rules?
A. A designated distribution is any distribution or payment from or under an employer deferred compensation plan, an individual retirement plan (as defined in section 7701(a)(37)), or a commercial annuity. However, a designated distribution does not include any portion of a distribution which it is reasonable to believe is not includible in the gross income of the payee. For rules concerning when it is reasonable to believe that all or part of a distribution is not includible in the gross income of the recipient, see questions a-24 through a-33. In addition, a payment or distribution that is treated as wages under section 3401(a) is not a designated distribution subject to the new withholding rules. For examples of these payments, see questions a-18 through a-23.
a-3 Q. What is an employer deferred compensation plan for purposes of the new withholding rules?
A. An employer deferred compensation plan is any pension, annuity, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or other plan that defers the receipt of compensation.
a-4. Q. What is a commercial annuity for purposes of the new withholding rules?
A. A commercial annuity is an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract issued by an insurance company licensed to do business under the laws of any State. See, also, question f-21.
a-5. Q. When does the new law take effect?
A. In general, withholding is required on any designated distribution made after December 31, 1982. In the case of periodic payments beginning before January 1, 1983, the first payment after December 31, 1982 is treated as the first periodic payment for purposes of the withholding requirements. The Secretary has authority to delay (but not beyond June 30, 1983) the application of these withholding provisions to any payor if the payor can establish that it is impossible to comply with these provisions without undue hardship. Additionally, no penalty will be imposed for failure to withhold on periodic payments if the failure occurs before July 1, 1983, and if a good faith attempt is made to comply.
Procedures for requesting a delay in implementation of the withholding provisions are under consideration.
a-6. Q. What effect does the new law have on the old law provisions relating to withholding of tax from annuity payments by request?
A. If payment is part of a designated distribution, the rules of section 3402(o) (relating to voluntary withholding on certain payments) do not apply. Therefore, a payee receiving amounts that are subject to withholding under the new provisions described in this regulation may not choose to use the voluntary withholding system of section 3402(o) with respect to those amounts. Also, if a payee had a fixed amount withheld by request, a different amount will probably be withheld when the new provisions take effect unless the rule provided in question a-7 applies. However, section 3402(o) will continue to apply to annuity payments that are not designated distributions, to sick pay, and to supplemental unemployment benefits.
a-7. Q. If a recipient of a pension or annuity has previously elected voluntary withholding under section 3402(o), is the Form W-4P effective for withholding on payments after December 31, 1982?
A. Yes, if the plan administrator or payor wishes to honor it; the Form W-4P can be treated by the plan administrator or payor as an election to withhold the flat dollar amount specified on the form if the payee, is notified of his right to elect out of withholding and if he is notified that his previously filed W-4P will remain effective unless he elects out of withholding or files a new withholding certificate. If these requirements are met the plan administrator or payor may treat the Form W-4P as a voluntary withholding agreement under section 3402(p). See, also, section 3402(i). These amounts withheld should be reported in the same manner as amounts withheld under section 3405.
a-8. Q. What amount of Federal income tax will be withheld from designated distributions?
A. The amount to be withheld by any payor (or, in certain cases, a plan administrator) depends upon whether the payment is a periodic payment, a nonperiodic distribution other than a qualified total distribution, or a qualified total distribution. However, the maximum amount to be withheld cannot exceed the sum of the amount of money and the fair market value of property (other than employer securities as defined in section 402(a)(3)) received in the distribution.
a-9. Q. What is a periodic payment?
A. A periodic payment is an annuity or similar periodic payment whether paid by a licensed life insurance company, a financial institution, or a plan. The term “annuity” means a series of payments payable over a period greater than one year and taxable under section 72 as amounts received as an annuity, whether or not the payments are variable in amount.
a-10.
[Reserved]
a-11. Q. How will Federal income tax be withheld from a “qualified total distribution?”
A. A “qualified total distribution” means any designated distribution which it is reasonable to believe is made within one taxable year of the payee, is made from or under a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or section 403(a), and consists of the balance to the credit of the employee under the plans. For additional questions and answers concerning qualified total distributions, see part c. The amount to be withheld on qualified total distributions will be determined under tables prescribed by the Secretary that approximate the tax that would be imposed under section 402(e) if the payee elected to treat the distribution as a lump sum distribution within the meaning of section 402(e)(4)(A). See, in this respect, question c-8.
a-12. Q. What amount of Federal income tax will be withheld from a designated distribution that is not a periodic payment or a qualified total distribution?
A. If a designated distribution is not a periodic payment or a qualified total distribution, the amount to be withheld is computed by multiplying the amount of the designated distribution by 10 percent.
a-13. Q. Who must withhold?
A. Generally, the payor of a designated distribution must withhold, and is liable for payment of, the tax required to be withheld. However, in the case of a distribution from a plan described in section 401(a) (relating to pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans), section 403(a) (relating to certain annuity plans), or section 301(d) of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 (relating to certain employee stock ownership plans, sometimes called “TRASOP's”), the plan administrator must withhold, and is liable for payment of, the withheld tax unless he directs the payor to withhold the tax and furnishes the payor with any information that may be required by the Secretary in forms or regulations. This provision applies to qualified plans as well as once qualified plans that are no longer qualified. For a description of the material that the plan administrator must furnish to the payor, see question e-3.
a-14. Q. Who is a plan administrator?
A. Under section 414(g), the plan administrator is the person specifically designated as the plan administrator by the terms of the plan or trust. If the plan or trust does not specifically designate the plan administrator (as provided in § 1.414(g)-1(a) of the Income Tax Regulations), then the plan administrator is generally determined as follows:
(1) In the case of a plan maintained by a single employer, the employer is the plan administrator.
(2) In the case of a plan maintained by two or more employers or jointly by one or more employers and one or more employee organizations, the association, committee, joint board of trustees, or other similar group of representatives who maintain the plan is the plan administrator.
(3) In the case in which (1) or (2) does not apply, the person actually responsible for the control, disposition, or management of the assets is the plan administrator.
a-15. Q. If a bank trustee, regulated investment company, or insurance company makes a periodic payment to a payee solely at the direction of an employer sponsored individual retirement account (IRA), is the bank trustee, regulated investment company or insurance company a payor subject to the pension withholding provisions?
A. Yes. the term “payor” generally means the person actually paying the annuity or other payment (even if the person is acting as an agent). Because this is not a payment from a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a), responsibility for withholding is on the bank trustee, regulated investment company, or insurance company and not on the employer who sponsors the account.
a-16. Q. If a bank trustee transfers plan funds to the employer who sponsors a plan described in section 401(a) and the employer makes the designated distributions, is the employer a payor?
A. Yes. The employer is a payor because it acts as an agent for the bank trustee. Even though the plan administrator has transferred liability to the bank trustee under section 3405(c)(2),
the transfer of funds to the employer does not relieve the bank trustee of its liability for withholding because the rule on transfer of liability only applies to plan administrators. Therefore, if the employer fails to withhold on designated distributions, either the employer or the bank trustee may be liable for failure to withhold. Note, however, that the plan administrator could transfer liability for withholding to the employer as payor under section 3405(c)(2). See, in this respect, questions e-2 and e-3.
a-17. Q. Do the withholding provisions apply to annuities paid from an employer deferred compensation plan, an individual retirement plan, or a commercial annuity to the surviving spouse or other beneficiary of a deceased payee?
A. Yes.
a-18. Q. Do these withholding provisions apply to designated distributions under all nonqualified employer deferred compensation plans?
A. No. The withholding provisions relating to pensions and annuities do not apply to any amounts that are wages without regard to these provisions. Wages to which the general wage withholding rules apply mean any remuneration paid by an employer for services performed by an employee unless the amount paid falls within one of the exceptions of section 3401(a). For example, wages do not include remuneration paid to, or on behalf of, an employee or beneficiary from or to a trust qualified under section 401(a) and tax-exempt under section 501(a). There is no exception for contributions to, or benefits paid from, some nonqualified plans. In general, any contributions to, or benefits from, a nonqualified plan that are taxable under section 83 are subject to wage withholding at the time that they are includible in the recipient's gross income.
a-19. Q. Do these withholding provisions apply to designated distributions from a bond purchase plan described in section 405(a)?
A. Yes. Although a bond purchase plan is not a qualified plan, section 3402(a) does not apply to contributions to, or distributions from, such a plan. Therefore, designated distributions from a bond purchase plan are subject to the new withholding rules of section 3405. Similarly, the new withholding rules apply to designated distributions of an individual retirement bond described in section 409 or from an annuity plan described in section 403(a). For purposes of the withholding provisions of section 3405, a designated distribution from a bond purchase plan described in section 405(a) or an individual retirement bond described in section 409 occurs when an individual redeems a bond.
a-20. Q. Do these withholding provisions apply to designated distributions from a tax-sheltered annuity described in section 403(b)?
A. Yes. Section 31.3401(a)-1(b)(1)(i) of the Employment Tax Regulations provides that there is no withholding required under the wage withholding provisions to the extent that any amounts are taxable under the rules of section 72 or 403. Because designated distributions are not subject to the general wage withholding provisions, the new provisions of section 3405 apply to these designated distributions.
a-21. Q. An employer maintains a nonqualified deferred compensation plan such as a supplemental executive retirement (“top hat”) plan. Payments under the plan are made in the form of a single sum payment at retirement. Amounts paid at retirement are includible in income as compensation in the year received. Must the payor withhold on these amounts according to the rules in section 3405?
A. No. Section 3405(d)(1)(B)(i) provides that a designated distribution on which withholding is required does not include amounts that are wages without regard to the rules of section 3405. Therefore, withholding on payments that are includible in income as compensation are based on the rules for withholding on wages contained in section 3402.
a-22. Q. Do the withholding provisions of section 3405 apply to a retirement plan maintained by a State or local government on behalf of its employees?
A. Yes. A retirement plan maintained by a State or local government on behalf of its employees is a plan that defers the receipt of compensation. The fact that a plan deferring the receipt of compensation is maintained by a governmental unit does not make the withholding provisions inapplicable.
Thus, annuity payments and other distributions under the Federal Civil Service Retirement System or under the plan of any State or municipality are subject to withholding.
a-23. Q. Are payments from a state or local plan of deferred compensation described in section 457 subject to the withholding requirements of section 3405?
A. No. Amounts paid from a plan described in section 457 are paid from a plan that defers the receipt of compensation. However, amounts paid from a deferred compensation plan described in section 457 are wages under section 3401(a). Therefore, the general wage withholding rules, not the special rules of section 3405, apply to these payments.
a-24. Q. An individual retires and begins receiving periodic payments under a commercial annuity contract that was distributed to him from a contributory qualified plan. The insurance company is the payor and is liable for withholding because the plan administrator has transferred liability under the rules of section 3405(c)(2). Must the payor determine whether the employee's investment in the contract is recoverable within three years?
A. Yes. Under section 72(d), if the annuity payments during the first three years equal or exceed the amount contributed by the employee to the plan, no amounts are includible in income until the employee's contributions are recovered. Because the application of section 72(d) may affect the extent to which it is reasonable to believe that amounts are not includible in income and, therefore, not subject to withholding, the payor must determine whether section 72(d) applies to the annuity payments. As a general rule, the information necessary to determine the employee's investment in the contract must be provided to the payor by the plan administrator. See, however, questions a-27 and a-33.
a-25. Q. If the payor in question a-24 determines that the employee's investment in the contract is not recoverable within 3 years, must the payor compute the exclusion ratio under section 72(b) to calculate the amount of each payment that is not includible in gross income?
A. Yes. The operation of section 72(b) affects the extent to which it is reasonable to believe that amounts are not includible in gross income. Therefore, the payor must compute the exclusion ratio to determine what portion of each payment is subject to withholding under section 3405. As a general rule, the information necessary to determine the employee's exclusion ratio must be provided to the payor by the plan administrator. See, however, questions a-27 and a-33.
a-26. Q. In questions a-24 and a-25, may the payor (i.e., the insurance company) rely on the information furnished by the plan administrator to determine the amounts that are includible in gross income?
A. In the absence of information to the contrary supplied by the payee, the payor may rely on the information furnished by the plan administrator. See, with respect to the plan administrator's duty to report to the payor, questions e-2 and e-3.
a-27. Q. What is the result in questions a-24 and a-25 if the plan administrator fails to provide the payor with any information concerning the amount of employee contributions?
A. Until the earlier of December 31, 1983, or the date on which the plan administrator provides the payor with information concerning the amount of employee contributions, it is reasonable for the payor to assume that the employee's investment in the annuity contract is zero unless the payor has independent specific knowledge of the amount of employee contributions. Additionally, if the payee notifies the payor of the amount of employee contributions, the payor must compute the taxable portion of the payment based on the information supplied by the payee. If the plan administrator fails to provide the payor with this information on or before December 31, 1983, the plan administrator will be liable for failure to withhold and pay the tax due. See questions e-2 through e-5 for rules on the plan administrator's ability to transfer liability for withholding to the payor. See also question a-33 with respect to the plan administrator's failure to provide the necessary information prior to December 31, 1983.
a-28. Q. If a beneficiary receives the balance to the credit of an employee from an annuity described in section 403(b) on
account of the employee's death, is it reasonable to believe that the $5,000 death benefit exclusion of section 101(b) is not includible in gross income?
A. Yes. Although the amount of the death benefit exclusion allowable may be limited by section 101(b)(2)(B)(iii), the payor, for withholding purposes, may use the maximum death benefit exclusion ($5,000) in computing the amount of the distribution that is subject to withholding. See also, in this respect, question c-3.
a-29. Q. What is the appropriate treatment of a distribution (whether periodic or nonperiodic) that includes employer securities?
A. Employer securities are significant in the calculation of amounts subject to withholding in two respects. First, the maximum amount to be withheld cannot exceed the sum of the amount of money plus the fair market value of property received,
except
employer securities. In other words, a payor will not be forced to dispose of employer securities in order to meet withholding tax liability. Thus, for example, if an individual receives a distribution from a stock bonus plan that includes $1,000 worth of employer stock and $5 in cash for payment of fractional shares of stock, all of the cash, but none of the stock, may be retained by the payor to satisfy the withholding obligation. Second, under certain circumstances, the net unrealized appreciation in employer securities is not includible in gross income. See, in this respect, the rules of sections 402(a)(1) and 402(e)(4)(J).
a-30. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that all net unrealized appreciation from employer securities is not includible in gross income in the case of a qualified total distribution?
A. Yes. Although a qualified total distribution may include a distribution that is not a lump sum distribution, it is reasonable to believe that all net unrealized appreciation from employer securities is not includible in gross income.
a-31. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that a distribution is not includible in gross income if the distribution consists of employee contributions from a plan described in section 401(a) and the amount distributed is not specifically designated as accumulated deductible employee contributions?
A. Yes. Employee contributions to a plan described in section 401(a) are not deductible from gross income when contributed unless they are deductible employee contributions under section 72(o)(5). Unless the payor has specific knowledge that employee contributions distributed from a plan described in section 401(a) are accumulated deductible employee contributions, it is reasonable to assume that the amounts are excludible from gross income in the year when received.
a-32. Q. In the case of disability payments paid under a noncontributory plan to a disability retiree who has not attained age 65, is it reasonable to believe that all amounts paid to the payee are includible in gross income?
A. Yes. Whether or not all or part of the disability payments paid under a noncontributory plan to a permanently disabled retiree who has not attained age 65 are includible in gross income depends on the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer and on whether the taxpayer is permanently and totally disabled. In this situation, it is reasonable for the payor to assume that all amounts paid to the payee are includible in gross income unless the payor has specific independent knowledge that all or part of the periodic payments are not includible in gross income. Additionally, if the payee notifies the payor of the amount excludible from gross income, the payor must compute the taxable portion of the payment based on information provided by the payee.
a-33. Q. In the case of a periodic payment, is it reasonable to believe that all amounts paid to the payee are includible in gross income?
A. Yes. As an alternative to the general rule that a designated distribution does not include amounts which it is reasonable to believe are not includible in gross income, the payor of any periodic payment may assume that the entire amount of the payment is includible in gross income. The wage withholding tables must be used without adjustment for the fact that Federal income tax is being withheld on the gross amount. If the payor uses this alternative method of calculating the
amount of the designated distribution, he must include with the notice of the election not to have withholding apply the following additional statements:
(1) Tax will be withheld on the gross amount of the payment even though the payee may be receiving amounts that are not subject to withholding because they are excludible from gross income;
(2) This withholding procedure may result in excess withholding on the payment; and
(3) The payee may adjust the allowances claimed on the withholding certificate if he wants a lesser amount withheld from each payment or he may provide the payor with the information necessary to calculate the taxable portion of each payment.
This alternative will not apply to periodic payments made after the earlier of December 31, 1983, or the date on which the plan administrator supplies the payor with the information necessary to calculate the taxable portion of the distribution.
See, also, questions e-3, e-4, and e-5.
a-34. Q. May the payor rely on a plan administrator's computation of the amount to be withheld?
A. Yes. Although the plan administrator is not required to compute the amount to be withheld in order to transfer liability for withholding to the payor, the plan administrator may provide such information to the payor, and the payor may rely on such computations unless the payor knows or has reason to know that the computations are incorrect.
a-35. Q. Under the plans of certain States, individuals may receive payments from more than one retirement system, such as payments from the state's teacher's retirement plan and from the state's regular retirement plan. Must these payments be aggregated for purposes of providing a single notice and election to a payee or for purposes of determining whether the floor on withholding tax (i.e., $5,400 for a married individual claiming three allowances) has been reached?
A. No. However, if it is feasible to aggregate payments under more than one retirement system, the payor is permitted to do so for these purposes.
a-36. Q. If a payment is made by one check to more than one beneficiary, such as a surviving spouse and a minor child, how is the amount to be withheld computed?
A. The payor may compute the withholding on a payment made by one check to more than one beneficiary as if the payment were made to only one beneficiary. In this case, the payor must base withholding for the total amount of the designated distribution on the withholding certificate of the payee to whom the election was sent.
Alternatively, if each payee files a withholding certificate and the payor knows the amount of the payment of which each payee is entitled, the payor may determine the amount to be withheld with respect to each payee. If the payor does not know the amount of the payment to which each payee is entitled, he may treat the payment as being made pro-rata to each payee. If only one withholding certificate is received, the payor must base withholding for the total amount of the designated distribution on the withholding certificate of one of the payees, such as the surviving spouse's certificate. Thus, if notice of the election not to have withholding apply is supplied to each payee at the times required in section 3405(c) (10) and only one payee makes the election or files a certificate, the payor must assume that the election or filing was made by the payee on behalf of the other payees.
a-37. Q. If a payor makes an error in computing the amount of a designated distribution that is subject to withholding, must the payor make a retroactive correction of the error?
A. No, provided the error was a reasonable one. Thus, if a payor either underwithholds or overwithholds because the amount of the designated distribution (
i.e.,
the taxable portion of the payment) was incorrectly calculated, no retroactive make-up is required if one of the following applies: (1) The payor reasonably relied on information furnished by the plan administrator (including the computation of the amount to be withheld), (2) the payor relied on a payee's representations on the withholding certificate, (3) the payor reasonably relied on the rules of this regulation, or (4) the payor made a mathematical error in computations. However, if the amount
of the designated distribution is correctly computed, but the payor makes an error in applying the withholding tables, the normal rules concerning failure to withhold and pay the tax will apply.

# b. Withholding on Periodic Payments
b-1. Q. Is the payor of periodic payments required to aggregate such payments with a payee's compensation to determine the amount of tax to be withheld under section 3405(a)(1)?
A. No. Although the payor must withhold from any periodic payment the amount that has to be withheld if the payment were a payment of wages by an employer to an employee for a payroll period, the amount to be withheld under section 3405(a)(1) is calculated separately of any amounts that actually are wages to the payee for the same period.
b-2. Q. Can either the percentage method (section 3402(b)) or the wage bracket method (section 3402(c)) be used to determine the withholding liability on a periodic payment?
A. Yes. Withholding on a periodic payment is accomplished by treating the payment as if it were wages. Therefore, unless the employee has elected not to have withholding apply, any method of withholding that is an appropriate method for withholding on wages is also an appropriate method for withholding on periodic payments. Refer to the Employer's Tax Guide (Circular E) and Publication 493, Alternative Tax Withholding Methods and Tables for the general procedures on withholding, deposit, payment, and reporting of Federal income tax withheld. Note, however, that any specific procedures contained in this regulation take precedence over any contrary rules in Circular E and Publication 493.

b-5. Q. May a payor determine whether payments to an individual are subject to withholding based on the amount of the first periodic payment for the year?
A. No. Periodic payments can vary during a calendar year because of make-up of past due payments, variable rates of payments, or cost-of-living adjustments, so that withholding based on the first payment within a year may be an inaccurate measure of withholding on total payments for the year. Therefore, the amount to be withheld is determined each payment period in the same manner as applies to withholding on wages. See, in this respect, Circular E and the regulations under section 3402.
b-6. Q. If a payment period is specified as by the terms of a commercial annuity contract, must this period be used as the appropriate period for determining the amount to be withheld?
A. Yes. Similarly, if the payment period is designated in a plan administrator's report or on an individual retirement account payout schedule agreed to by payor and payee, this period must be used as the appropriate payment period.
b-7. Q. If the payor received no report from the plan administrator or beneficiary concerning the payment period, but knows the frequency of payments, can the known frequency be used as the appropriate payment period?
A. Yes. However, if no report is received and the payor has no knowledge of the frequency of payments, then he must treat the distribution as a nonperiodic distribution. Therefore, a distribution cannot be a periodic payment unless the frequency of payments is known. See, in this respect, questions b-8 and c-2. For rules concerning the plan administrator's failure to provide this information, see questions e-2 and e-3.
b-8. Q. If a payee receives a one-time payment that is a make-up payment resulting from an insurance company's incorrect calculation of a monthly annuity amount, is the one-time payment part of a series of periodic payments?
A. Yes. Because the one-time payment is a catch-up of prior amounts due as periodic payments, it is treated as part of a series of periodic payments. These payments are treated for withholding purposes in a manner similar to the treatment of supplemental wage payments in § 31.3402(g)-1 of the Employment Tax Regulations.

# c. Withholding on Nonperiodic Distributions
c-1. Q. Must an individual receive a lump-sum distribution within the meaning
of section 402(e)(4) to have a qualified total distribution?
A. No. A “qualified total distribution” is any distribution that (i) is a designated distribution, (ii) is reasonable to believe is made within one taxable year of the recipient, (iii) is made under a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a), and (iv) consists of the balance to the credit of the employee under such plan. Thus, a distribution from a plan described in section 401(a) that does not meet the requirements (such as the minimum 5-year period of participation in section 402(e)(4)(H)) for a lump sum distribution within the meaning of section 402(e)(4) may still be a qualified total distribution for purposes of withholding.
c-2. Q. If a class year plan permits annual withdrawal of participants' vested amounts, are these withdrawals considered periodic payments?
A. No. A class year plan is a plan under which amounts contributed by an employer for a year become vested a number of years (
e.g.,
five years) after the year in which the amounts are contributed. Generally, class year plans permit withdrawals each year of amounts that have vested during the year. However, these distributions are not made with respect to an established frequency of payments, so the withdrawals must be treated as nonperiodic distributions, subject to withholding at the 10 percent rate.
c-3. Q. If a beneficiary receives the balance to the credit of a payee from an annuity contract on account of the payee's death, is this final payment a nonperiodic distribution?
A. Yes. The lump sum death benefit in this situation is a one-time payment that cannot be characterized as a periodic payment. The payment may be a qualified total distribution if the requirements of section 3405(c)(4) are satisfied, but otherwise it will be treated as a nonperiodic distribution other than a qualified total distribution.
c-4. Q. Is it permissible to assume that an individual is a calendar year taxpayer for purposes of determining whether a distribution is a “qualified total distribution?”
A. Yes, unless the payor or plan administrator has reason to believe that the payee is not a calendar year taxpayer. The payor or plan administrator has reason to believe that the payee is not a calendar year taxpayer if the payee tells the payor or plan administrator that he is not a calendar year taxpayer.
c-5. Q. Is a distribution of accumulated deductible employee contributions with earnings that is paid on account of an employee's separation from service treated as a qualified total distribution?
A. Yes. As long as the other requirements for a qualified total distribution are met, a distribution of accumulated deductible employee contributions with earnings is eligible for withholding at the rate applicable to qualified total distributions even though the distribution could never be a lump sum distribution. Because accumulated deductible employee contributions are treated separately in determining whether a distribution is a qualified total distribution, the answer would be the same even if the recipient received none (or a portion) of the vested employer contributions in his account.
c-6. Q. What is meant by the “balance to the credit” of an employee under a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a)?
A. In general, the balance to the credit of an employee includes any amount credited to the employee under the plan on the date the distribution commences. The balance to the credit of an employee includes an amount credited after the date the distribution commences if it is attributable to services performed before that date or is attributable to earnings on an amount credited to the employee before that date. Additionally, the balance to the credit of an employee includes any amount payable as an annuity with respect to the employee under the plan. Amounts that have been placed in a separate account for the funding of medical benefits under section 401(h) or amounts that are forfeitable under the plan are not included in the balance to the credit of an employee. Finally, accumulated deductible employee contributions (within the meaning of section 72(o)(5)(B)) are not included in the balance to the credit of an employee for the purposes of determining whether a distribution is a “qualified total distribution.”
c-7. Q. Can a payor rely on a plan administrator's report in determining whether a distribution consists of the balance to the credit of an employee under a plan?
A. Yes. If the plan administrator does not inform the payor that the distribution consists of the balance to the credit of the employee, the payor may not assume that the distribution is a qualified total distribution and must treat the distribution as a nonperiodic distribution that is not a qualified total distribution. However, the payor may rely on the payee's representations that a distribution does consist of the balance to the credit of the employee under the plan.
c-8. Q. What table must be used to calculate the amount to be withheld from a “qualified total distribution?”
A. The table to be used for withholding on “qualified total distributions” will be published by the Secretary in the near future.

# d. Notice and Election Procedures
d-1. Q. May a payee elect not to have Federal income tax withheld from a designated distribution?
A. Yes. Withholding is not required on any periodic payment or nonperiodic distribution if the payee elects not to have withholding apply. If the payee makes this election, it is effective until revoked. The payor is required to provide each payee with notice of the right to elect not to have withholding apply and of the right to revoke the election.
d-2. Q. In the case of a designated distribution made on account of the death of an employee, who makes the election not to have withholding apply?
A. The election may be made by the beneficiary of plan benefits specified by the decedent in accordance with plan procedures or, if there is no designated beneficiary, by the beneficiary specified under the terms of the plan. If there is not a designated beneficiary and the terms of the plan do not specify a beneficiary, then the election may be made by the executor or the personal representative of the decedent.
d-3. Q. Who is required to provide notice to the payee of the payee's right not to have withholding apply?
A. Section 3405(d)(10)(B) requires the payor to provide notice to the payee of the payee's right to elect not to have withholding apply. Thus, even if the plan administrator has failed to transfer liability for withholding to the payor, the payor must provide notice to the payees.
d-4. Q. When must notice of the right to elect not to have withholding apply be given for periodic payments?
A. In the case of periodic payments, notice of the election must be provided not earlier than six months before the first payment and not later than when making the first payment. However, even if notice is provided at a date before the first payment,notice must also be given when making the first payment. Thereafter, notice must be provided at least once each calendar year of the right to make the election and to revoke the election.
d-5. Q. Must notice of the right to elect not to have withholding apply be provided to those payees whose annual payments are less than $5,400?
A. Yes. However, under the statute, notice is only required to be provided when making the first payment. Therefore, a payor may provide notice to a payee with annual payments less than $5,400 by indicating to the payee when making the first payment that no Federal income tax will be withheld unless the payee chooses to have withholding apply by filing a withholding certificate, if the payor also provides information concerning where a withholding certificate may be obtained.
d-6. Q. Must notice of the right to elect not to have withholding apply be provided in the same manner to all payees?
A. No. If the payor provides notice to all payees when making the first payment, the payor may, in addition, provide earlier notice as provided in section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(I) to selected groups of payees, such as those payees whose annual payments are over $5,400.
d-7. Q. Must notice be attached to the first payment to satisfy the requirement that notice be provided “when making” the first payment?
A. No. Because many payees utilize electronic funds transfer to deposit their pension or annuity checks, notice does not have to be attached physically to the check.
d-8. Q. If a payee utilizes electronic funds transfer and notice is mailed directly to the payee at the same time the check is issued, is the notice requirement satisfied even though the payee receives the notice fifteen days after the check is deposited?
A. Yes. Although it is desirable that the notice reach the payee immediately prior to or concurrent with receipt of the check, the notice requirement is deemed to be satisfied if the payee receives the notice within 15 days before or after receipt of the first payment.
d-9. Q. When is the payor required to notify the payee of his right to elect not to have withholding apply to a nonperiodic distribution?
A. Section 3405(d)(10)(B)(ii) requires that notice must be provided to the payee at the time of a nonperiodic distribution. Since notice provided at the time of the distribution could result in delay of receipt of the benefit check if the payee elects out of withholding, notice for nonperiodic distributions should be given not earlier than six months prior to the distribution and not later than the time that will give the payee reasonable time to elect not to have withholding apply and to reply to the payor with the election information. What is reasonable time depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.
d-10. Q. What is a “reasonable time” for notice with respect to a nonperiodic distribution from a qualified plan?
A. The “reasonable time” requirement is satisfied with respect to a nonperiodic distribution if the notice is included in the basic claim for benefits application that is provided to the participant by the plan administrator.
d-11. Q. If the payor of a periodic payment provides notice of the election not to have withholding apply within the time specified by section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(I), may the payor specify a time prior to distribution by which the election must be made?
A. Yes. The election not to have withholding apply is generally given effect as provided in section 3402(f)(3) for a certificate filed to replace an existing certificate. However, the payor may require that the election is made up to 30 days before the first payment to be effective for the first payment. See question b-3.
d-12. Q. If the payor of a nonperiodic distribution provides notice of the election not to have withholding apply within a reasonable time prior to the distribution, may the payor specify a time prior to distribution by which the election must be made?
A. No. The payee has the right to make or revoke an election at any time prior to the distribution. Therefore, the payor may place a deadline on the time to elect without delaying payment of the distribution, but must accept any election or revocation made up to the time of distribution.
d-13. Q. What is a “reasonable time” for notice with respect to a distribution from an individual retirement account?
A. A payor may provide notice of the election not to have withholding apply at the time the beneficiary requests a withdrawal from his individual retirement account. This rule also applies to distributions from bank sponsored prototype plans and other plans that permit withdrawals on request.
d-14. Q. If notice is provided to a payee prior to the first payment of a periodic payment, why must it also be provided at the time of the first payment or distribution?
A. Section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(II) of the Internal Revenue Code requires such notice. In addition, because the payee has the right to make an election or to revoke a prior election at any time prior to the beginning of the payment period, notice must be provided when making the first payment in order to offer the payee ample opportunity to make or revoke an election not to have withholding apply even if the election will not be effective until later payments.
d-15. Q. If a payee who has been receiving periodic payments is rehired by the same employer, has his benefits suspended, and then recommences receiving periodic payments, must notice again be provided to the payee?
A. Yes. Upon recommencement of benefits, the first payment thereafter is treated as the first payment for purposes of the notice requirements.
d-16. Q. Must a payor provide notice if it is reasonable to believe that the entire
amount payable is excludible from the payee's gross income?
A. No. Amounts which it is reasonable to believe are not includible in gross income are not designated distributions. Therefore, no notice is required of the ability to elect not to have withholding apply.
d-17. Q. If the payor of a periodic payment under a qualified plan knows that an employee's investment in an annuity contract will be recovered within three years, must he provide notice of the right to elect out of withholding at the time the first payment is made?
A. No. The first payment is not a designated distribution, and, therefore, is not a periodic payment subject to the notice requirements of section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i). There is no withholding obligation until the employee's investment in the contract is recovered because those amounts that equal the investment in the contract are not includible in gross income and, therefore, are not designated distributions. Therefore, the first payment after the employee's investment in the contract is recouped is the first payment for purposes of the notice requirements.
d-18. Q. What information concerning the election not to have withholding apply must be provided by the payor to the payee?
A. Notice to a payee must contain the following information:
(1) Notice of the payee's right to elect not to have withholding apply to any payment or distribution and how to make that election,
(2) Notice of the payee's right to revoke such an election at any time and a statement that the election remains effective until revoked,
(3) A statement to advise payees that penalties may be incurred under the estimated tax payment rules if the payments of estimated tax are not adequate and sufficient tax is not withheld from the payment or distribution.
In the event that the payor does not know what part of a distribution is includible in gross income and treats these payments as provided in question a-33, the following additional statements must be included with the notice:
(1) Tax will be withheld on the gross amount of the payment even though the payee may be receiving amounts that are not subject to withholding because they are excludible from gross income,
(2) This withholding procedure may result in excess withholding on the payment, and
(3) The payee may adjust his allowances claimed on the withholding certificate if he wants a lesser amount withheld from each payment or he may provide the payor with the information necessary to calculate the taxable portion of each payment.
d-19. Q. Is there any information that, although not required, it is desirable to include in the notice to payees?
A. It is desirable to include a statement in the notice to payees that the election not to have withholding apply is prospective only and that any election made after a payment or distribution to the payee is not an election with respect to that payment or distribution.
d-20. Q. May the plan administrator provide the notice to payees on behalf of the payor?
A. The plan administrator may provide notice on behalf of the payor. However, the payor has sole responsibility for providing this notice whether or not the plan administrator has shifted liability for withholding to the payor, and if the plan administrator fails to provide adequate notice, the payor is responsible.
d-21. Q. Is there a sample notice that can be used to satisfy the notice requirement for periodic payments?
A. Yes. Any payor who uses the following sample notice is deemed to satisfy the notice requirement if notice is timely provided:

# Notice of Withholding on Periodic Payments
Beginning on January 1, 1983, the [pension] OR [annuity] payments you receive from the [insert name of plan or company] will be subject to Federal income tax withholding unless you elect not to have withholding apply. Withholding will only apply to the portion of your [pension] OR [annuity] payment that is already included in your income subject to Federal income tax and will be like wage withholding. Thus, there will be no withholding on the return of your own nondeductible contributions to the [plan] OR [contract].
You may elect not to have withholding apply to your [pension] OR [annuity] payments by returning the signed and dated election [manner may be specified] to [insert name and address]. Your election will remain in effect until you revoke it. You may revoke your election at any time by returning the signed and dated revocation to [insert appropriate name or address]. Any election or revocation will be effective no later than the January 1, May 1, July 1, or October 1 after it is received, so long as it is received at least 30 days before that date. You may make and revoke elections not to have withholding apply as often as you wish. Additional elections may be obtained from [insert name and address].
If you do not return the election by [insert date], Federal income tax will be withheld from the taxable portion of your [pension] OR [annuity] payments as if you were a married individual claiming three withholding allowances. As a result, no Federal income tax will be withheld if the taxable portion of your annual [pension] OR [annuity] payments are less than $5,400.
If you elect not to have withholding apply to your [pension] OR [annuity] payments, or if you do not have enough Federal income tax withheld from your [pension] OR [annuity] payments, you may be responsible for payment of estimated tax. You may incur penalties under the estimated tax rules if your withholding and estimated tax payments are not sufficient.
d-22. Q. Is there sample language that may be used to elect not to have withholding apply or to revoke a prior election not to have withholding apply?
A. Yes. A payee may elect not to have withholding apply or revoke a prior election in any manner that clearly shows the payee's intent. The following language would suffice:

# Election for Recipients of Periodic Payments
Instructions:
Check Box A if you do not want any Federal income tax withheld from your [pension] OR [annuity]. Check Box B to revoke an election not to have withholding apply. Return the signed and dated election to [insert name and address].
Even if you elect not to have Federal income tax withheld, you are liable for payment of Federal income tax on the taxable portion of your [pension] OR [annuity]. You also may be subject to tax penalties under the estimated tax payment rules if your payments of estimated tax and withholding, if any, are not adequate.
A ☐ I do not want to have Federal income tax withheld from my [pension] OR [annuity].
B ☐ I want to have Federal income tax withheld from my [pension] OR [annuity].
Signed:
(Name)
Date:
Return your completed election to: [insert name and address]
d-23. Q. May the payee's election be combined with a withholding certificate?
A. Yes. The payor may provide a single statement for the payee to fill out and return that would enable the payee to elect not to have withholding apply or to revoke a previous election and, at the same time, would enable the payee to claim the number of withholding allowances and, also, the dollar amount the payee wants withheld.
d-24. Q. Will a notice mailed to the last known address of the payee fulfill the notice requirement of section 3405(d)(10)(B)?
A. Yes.
d-25. Q. Is there a sample notice that can be used to satisfy the notice requirement for nonperiodic distribution?
A. Yes. Any payor who uses the following sample notice is deemed to satisfy the notice requirement if notice is timely provided:

# Notice of Withholding on Distributions or Withdrawals From Annuities, IRA's, Pension, Profit Sharing, Stock Bonus, and Other Deferred Compensation Plans
The [distributions] OR [withdrawals] you receive from the [insert name of plan or company] are subject to Federal income tax withholding unless you elect not to have withholding apply. Withholding will only apply to the portion of your [distribution] OR [withdrawal] that is included in your income subject to Federal income tax. Thus, for example, there will be no withholding on the return of your own nondeductible contributions to the [plan] OR [contract].
You may elect not to have withholding apply to your [distribution] OR [withdrawal] payments by signing and dating the attached election and returning it [manner may be specified] to [insert name and address].
If you do not return the election by [insert date] receipt of your payments may be delayed. If you do not respond by the date your [distribution] OR [withdrawal] is scheduled to begin, Federal income tax will be withheld from the taxable portion of your [distribution] OR [withdrawal]. [Insert information on rates if desired].
If you elect not to have withholding apply to your [distribution] OR [withdrawal] payments, or if you do not have enough Federal income tax withheld from your [distribution] OR [withdrawal], you may be responsible for
payment of estimated tax. You may incur penalties under the estimated tax rules if your withholding and estimated tax payments are not sufficient.
d-26. Q. Is there sample language that may be used for payees of nonperiodic distributions to elect not to have withholding apply?
A. Yes. A payee of a nonperiodic distribution may elect not to have withholding apply in any manner that clearly shows the payee's intent. The following language would suffice:

# Election For Payees of Nonperiodic Payments
Instructions:
If you do not want any Federal income tax withheld from your [distribution] OR [withdrawal], sign and date this election and return it to [insert name and address].
Even if you elect not to have Federal income tax withheld, you are liable for payment of Federal income tax on the taxable portion of your [distribution] OR [withdrawal]. You also may be subject to tax penalties under the estimated tax payment rules if your payments of estimated tax and withholding, if any, are not adequate.
I do not want to have Federal income tax withheld from my [distribution] OR [withdrawal].

Return your completed election to: [insert name and address]
d-27. Q. If the payor provides notice prior to making the first payment, can an abbreviated notice be used to satisfy the notice requirement of section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(II)?
A. Yes. It is permissible to provide with the payment a statement that the payee has the right to elect out of withholding. For example, the following sample notice could be used to satisfy the notice requirement if the payor has provided notice previously:
If Federal income taxes have been withheld from the [pension] OR [annuity] payments you are receiving and if you do not wish to have taxes withheld, you should notify [insert name and address]. However, if you elect not to have withholding apply to your [pension] OR [annuity] payments, or if you do not have enough Federal income tax withheld from your [pension] OR [annuity] payment, you may be responsible for payment of estimated tax. You may incur penalties under the estimated tax rules if your withholding and estimated tax payments are not sufficient.
If Federal income taxes are not being withheld from your [pension] OR [annuity] payment because you have elected not to have withholding apply and if you wish to revoke that election and have Federal income taxes withheld from your [pension] OR [annuity] payments, you should notify [insert name and address].
d-28. Q. Must an employee who receives a distribution from a plan described in section 401(a) that includes amounts attributable to employer contributions and to accumulated deductible employee contributions make two elections not to have withholding apply?
A. No. Although accumulated deductible employee contributions are treated separately in determining whether a distribution is a qualified total distribution, an employee needs to make only one election not to have withholding apply to any distributions occurring at the same time from or under the same plan. However, the plan administrator could require the employee to make separate elections with respect to the distributions.
d-29. Q. If the administrator of a plan described in section 401(a) makes a qualified total distribution to an employee out of funds contained in two or more trusts, must the employee make a separate election not to have withholding apply with respect to the distribution from each trust?
A. No. The fact that a plan may use several trusts does not eliminate treatment of the distribution as a single qualified total distribution for which only one election is necessary.
d-30. Q. Is it permissible to provide notice to persons already in pay status on January 1, 1983, in a newsletter of the plan administrator?
a. Yes, provided that this notice is received by the payee within 15 days of the payee's receipt of the first periodic payment after December 31, 1982, and such notice provides the means to make an election and instructions for electing not to have withholding apply. It is desirable that payees be afforded the maximum opportunity to make the election provided by section 3405(a)(2). Payors are encouraged to give payees notice of their election opportunities
at least 30 days before the first periodic payment after December 31, 1982.
d-31. Q. Is it permissible to provide the annual notice required by section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(III) on January 1, 1984, December 31, 1985, and January 1, 1986?
A. No. The annual notice required by section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(III) should be provided at approximately the same time each calendar year.
d-32. Q. Under what circumstances may an election made with respect to a nonperiodic distribution apply to subsequent distributions?
A. Generally, any election not to have withholding apply to a nonperiodic distribution may apply to any subsequent payment or distribution from or under the same plan or arrangement. However, the payor must still provide notice of the election and revocation procedures upon each subsequent distribution and must include the statement concerning liability for payment of estimated tax if the payee does not have withholding applied.
d-33. Q. How may a payee who intends to make a qualifying rollover (as defined in section 402(a)(5) or section 408(d)(3)) of a distribution elect not to have Federal income tax withheld from the distribution?
A. The payee may elect not to have withholding apply by making the election on the form provided by the payor. Alternatively, if the payee directs the payor to pay over the distribution to a qualified plan or an individual retirement account, the payor may treat this direction as an election not to have withholding apply.
d-34. Q. If a payee claims more than 14 withholding allowances on a withholding certificate, must the payor remit a copy of the withholding certificate to the Internal Revenue Service?
A. No. Because a payee may, at any time, elect out of withholding, the rules of § 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g) of the Employment Tax Regulations do not apply. Therefore, a payee may claim more than 14 allowances and the payor need not remit the withholding certificate to the Internal Revenue Service.

# e. Reporting and Recordkeeping
e-1. Q. If designated distributions are made from or under a plan described in section 401(a), who has responsibility for making the returns and reports required by section 6047(e)?
A. Generally, the plan administrator, as defined in section 414(g), is responsible for maintaining the records and making the reports required by section 6047(e). However, if the plan administrator fails to keep the required records and make the required reports, the employer maintaining the plan is responsible for the reports and returns.
e-2. Q. How may a plan administrator of a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) transfer his duty to withhold to a payor?
A. A plan administrator of a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) may transfer the liability for withholding by (1) directing the payor in writing to withhold the tax and (2) providing the payor with any required information. This direction is presumed to remain in effect until the plan administrator revokes it in writing.
e-3. Q. What information must the plan administrator provide to the payor in order to transfer his liability for withholding?
A. The general rule is that the plan administrator must provide the payor with all information necessary to compute correctly the withholding tax liability. To satisfy this requirement, the plan administrator must explicitly inform the payor of the information that would be reportable on the Form W-2P or 1099R or that such information is not applicable to a particular payee or to any payments under the plan. For example, if the plan administrator is silent with respect to any employee contributions, he has not satisfied his reporting obligation even if there are no employee contributions to the plan. Thus, the plan administrator is expected to provide the payor with the following minimum information:
(1) The name, address, and social security number of the payee and the payee's spouse or other beneficiary if applicable,
(2) The existence and amount of any employee contributions,
(3) The amount of accumulated deductible employee contributions, if any,
(4) The payee's cost basis in any employer securities and the current fair market value of the securities,
(5) The existence and amount of any premiums paid for the current cost of life insurance that were previously includible in income,
(6) A statement of the reason (
e.g.,
death, disability, retirement) for the payment or distribution,
(7) The date on which payments commence and the amount and frequency of payments,
(8) The age of the payee and of the payee's spouse or designated beneficiary if applicable, and
(9) Any other information required by Form W-2P or 1099R.
If, prior to December 31, 1983, the plan administrator fails to provide the payor with the information required in items (2) through (5) the payor is liable for withholding. However, the payor may withhold on the payment as if all amounts are includible in gross income. See question a-33.
e-4. Q. If, after December 31, 1983, the plan administrator does not notify the payor of the amount of employee contributions with respect to one payee, has withholding liability shifted to the payor?
A. Yes. The plan administrator satisfies the requirements of question e-3 as to the information that must be supplied to the payor so long as the failure to provide the required information occurs on an infrequent basis or the plan administrator informs the payor in writing that he has made a good faith effort to supply all the required information but the amount of employee contributions as to a particular payee is unavailable.
e-5. Q. If, after December 31, 1983, the plan administrator fails to supply the payor with any information concerning the existence or amount of any employee contributions, has withholding liability shifted to the payor?
A. No. The plan administrator has not satisfied his reporting obligation as required in question e-3 as to employee contributions even if there are no employee contributions unless he affirmatively states that there are no employee contributions or states that the reporting of this item is not applicable in determining the payee's tax liability.
e-6. Q. Is it permissible to satisfy the requirements of section 6047(e) by maintaining records necessary to provide the information contained on Form W-2P and 1099R?
A. Section 6047(e) will be satisfied if, in addition to the information necessary to complete Forms W-2P and 1099R, the following information is maintained:
(1) Payee's date of birth (if known), and date of spouse's or designated beneficiary's birth (if applicable and known);
(2) Plan administrator's name, address, and employer identification number (EIN);
(3) Plan's name and identification number and sponsor's name, address, and EIN; and
(4) Date on which payments commence and amount and frequency of payments.
e-7. Q. If the interim method of withholding on periodic payments (i.e., withholding on the gross amount) is used, must the employer, plan administrator, or issuer of any contract still maintain the information required by Form W-2P?
A. Yes. Even if this interim method is used, the recipient must be provided with the information that will enable him to determine his tax liability and adjust his claimed exemptions or claim a credit or refund.
e-8. What events trigger the reporting requirements of section 6047(e)?
A. Reporting is required any time there is a designated distribution to which section 3405 applies. Therefore, the old law rule that distributions of less than $600 per year do not require reporting no longer applies. Additionally, an exchange of insurance contracts under which any designated distribution (including a tax-free exchange under section 1035) may be made is a reportable event even though a designated distribution does not occur. To insure proper reporting when a designated distribution is made under the new contract, it is anticipated that the issuer of the contract to be exchanged will provide the information necessary to compute the amount to be withheld to the policyholder and to the issuer of the new contract.
e-9. Q. Will the reporting requirement be satisfied if Form W-2P or Form 1099R is filed?
A. Yes. In the absence of other forms or regulations, the reporting requirement is satisfied if Form W-2P or Form 1099R is filed with respect to each payee.
e-10. Q. How should the payor or plan administrator remit payments of amounts withheld under section 3405?
A. The payor or plan administrator must deposit the amount withheld under section 3405 an authorized financial institution in accordance with the provisions of § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i) of the Procedure and Administration Regulations, which provides the procedures for depositing employment taxes. For purposes of applying these procedures to amounts withheld under section 3405, the term “taxes” as defined in § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(iii) includes the income tax withheld under section 3405 with respect to designated distributions. A payor or plan administrator who remits these amounts in accordance with those rules must report the amounts deposited on the same Form 941 or 941E, whichever is appropriate, that he uses to report the employment taxes he had deposited under § 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i).

# f. Other
f-1. Q. If a plan administrator or other payor distributes property other than cash to payees, is it permissible to use the value of the property as of the last preceding valuation date to determine the amount of Federal income tax that must be withheld from each distribution?
A. Yes. In many situations, the plan administrator or payor will not be able to determine the value of property to be distributed as of the date of distribution without delaying payment to the payee. In these cases, the plan administrator or payor may determine the value of the property to be distributed as of the last preceding valuation date prior to the date of distribution, as long as the valuation is made at least once each year. If the most recent valuation date occurred within the 90 days immediately preceding the date of distribution, the next most recent valuation date may be used.
f-2. Q. How is withholding accomplished if a payee receives only property other than employer securities?
A. A payor or plan administrator must satisfy the obligation to withhold on distributions of property other than employer securities even if this requires selling all or part of the property and distributing the cash remaining after Federal income tax is withheld. However, the payor or plan administrator may instead permit the payee to remit to the payor or plan administrator sufficient cash to satisfy the withholding obligation. Additionally, if a distribution of property other than cash includes property that is not includible in a designated distribution, such as the distribution of U.S. Savings Bonds or an annuity contract, such property need not be sold or redeemed to meet any withholding obligation.
f-3. Q. If a designated distribution includes cash and property other than employer securities, is it permissible to satisfy the withholding obligation with respect to the entire distribution by using the cash distributed, provided the cash distributed is sufficient to satisfy the withholding obligation?
A. Yes, as long as there is sufficient cash to satisfy the withholding obligation for the entire distribution. There is no requirement that tax be withheld from each type of property in portion to its value.
f-4. Q. If a loan from a qualified plan is treated as a distribution under section 72(p), is the amount of the loan subject to withholding under section 3405?
A. Yes. If, and to the extent that, the loan is treated as a distribution when made, withholding is accomplished by withholding tax from the amount of the loan that is treated as a distribution. Thus, for example, if a loan of $12,000 that must be repaid within 5 years is made to a common law employee with a vested account balance of $5,000, $2,000 is treated as a distribution under section 72(p), and the payor or plan administrator must withhold tax from the $2,000.
f-5. Q. Is a loan that is treated as a distribution under section 72(p) a nonperiodic distribution other than a qualified total distribution?
A. Yes.
f-6. Q. Must a payor or plan administrator withhold tax on a nonperiodic distribution (including a qualified total distribution) if the amount of the distribution is less than $200?
A. No. However, all amounts received within one taxable year of the payee from the payor or plan administrator under the same plan or arrangement must be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the $200 floor is reached. If the payor or plan administrator does not know at the time a first payment of $200 or less is made whether there will be additional payments during the year for which aggregation is required, the payor or plan administrator need not withhold from the first payment. If distributions are made within one taxable year under more than one plan of an employer, the plan administrator or payor may, but need not, aggregate the distributions for purposes of determining whether the $200 floor is reached.
f-7. Q. If a nonperiodic distribution (including a qualified total distribution) to a payee will be less than $200, must the payor provide notice to the payee of the right to elect not to have withholding apply?
A. No.
f-8. Q. How is withholding accomplished if a qualified total distribution is paid in installments during one taxable year of the payee?
A. Withholding can be accomplished on a qualified total distribution that is paid in installments within one taxable year by either one of the following methods:
Under Option 1, the tax on the first installment is calculated under the qualified total distribution table. The tax on each subsequent installment is calculated by finding the tax under the table on the cumulative amount of the installments for the year and subtracting the amount of tax already withheld from the tax due with respect to the cumulative amount of the installments.
Under Option 2, the payor or plan administrator can withhold the tax on all installments except the final installment at a 10 percent rate. The tax on the final installment may be calculated by finding the tax under the qualified total distribution table on the cumulative amount of the installments for the year and subtracting the amount of tax already withheld from the installments. Option 2 may be used even if the amount of the tax that should be withheld from the final installment under the qualified total distribution tables exceeds the amount of the final installment. The plan administrator or payor will not be subject to penalties under section 6651 with respect to the difference between the tax that should have been withheld from the final installment under the qualified total distribution tables and the amount of the final installment.
The effect of these alternatives is illustrated by the following example:
An individual receives within one taxable year the balance to his credit under a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a). The balance to his credit is paid in three installments of $1,000, $10,000, and $60,000. The amount of tax to be withheld from the installments may be calculated under Option 1 or Option 2.
Option 1—Withholding on each installment computed by finding tax under qualified total distribution tables on the cumulative amount of the distribution and subtracting the tax already withheld.
I.:
1. Amount of installment 1
$1,000
2. Withholding obligation on installment 1
50
II.:
1. Amount of installments 1 and 2
11,000
2. Withholding obligation on installments 1 and 2
550
3. Withholding paid on installment 1
50
4. Withholding obligation on installment 2 (2 minus 3)
500
III.:
1. Amount of installments 1, 2, and 3
71,000
2. Withholding obligation on installments 1, 2, and 3
9,580
3. Withholding paid on installments 1 and 2
550
4. Withholding obligation on installment 3 (2 minus 3)
9,030
Total withholding obligation
9,580
Option 2—Withholding computed by withholding at 10 percent rate for all but the final installment. Withholding on the final installment computed by finding tax under qualified total distribution table for the cumulative amount of the distribution and subtracting the amount of tax already withheld:
I.:
1. Amount of installment 1
$1,000
2. Withholding obligation on installment 1
100
II.:
1. Amount of installment 2
10,000
2. Withholding obligation on installment 2
1,000
III.:
1. Amount of installments 1, 2, and 3
71,000
2. Withholding obligation on installments 1, 2, and 3
9,580
3. Withholding paid on installments 1 and 2
1,100
4. Withholding obligation on installment 3 (2 minus 3)
8,480
Total withholding obligation
9,580
f-9. Q. A plan described in section 401 (a) invests in life insurance contracts for its participants. Each year the current cost of the life insurance element (PS 58 cost) is taxable to the participants under section 72. Is withholding required on this amount even though there is no amount actually distributed to the participant?
A. No. Because the PS 58 costs are not distributed or deemed to be distributed, they are not designated distributions for which withholding is required.
f-10. Q. The plan administrator or payor of a plan described in section 401 (a) has been properly reporting distributions on a multiple contract basis for purposes of section 72. How should the plan administrator or payor determine the amount of each payment that is includible in gross income for withholding purposes?
A. In the absence of revenue rulings or regulations to the contrary, the plan administrator or payor of a plan that properly reports distributions on a multiple contract basis should use that method to determine the taxable portion of a payment for withholding purposes.
f-11. Q. The plan administrator or payor of a plan described in section 401 (a) has been reporting distributions on a multiple contract basis for purposes of section 72 and has properly switched to the single contract method for reporting distributions. How should the plan administrator or payor determine the amount of each payment that is includible in gross income for withholding purposes?
A. If a plan has properly switched from the multiple contract basis to the single contract basis for reporting distributions, the plan administrator or payor may assume that all amounts prior to the year of switch were reported by the payees on a multiple contract basis. Therefore, for example, in the case of an individual whose annuity payments have not commenced prior to the date of the switch to a single contract basis, the payee's investment in the contract can be assumed to have been recovered on a multiple contract basis prior to the year of the switch and on a single contract basis thereafter for purposes of determining the amount of each payment that is includible in gross income for withholding purposes. This rule applies even though payees may have amended their income tax returns for prior years to report all payments on a single contract basis.
f-12. Q. If a plan that makes payments subject to the withholding and notice requirements of section 3405 makes separate payments to the same individual as a retired participant and as a surviving spouse of a retired participant, must the two payments be aggregated for withholding purposes?
A. No, unless the payor wishes to aggregate them.
f-13. Q. An insurance company makes payments under certain variable annuity contracts. The Investment Company Act of 1940 (section 22(e)) applies to these variable annuity contracts and requires that the insurance company make a pay-out within 7 days after a payee requests a withdrawal from his contract. Under these circumstances, how may notice be provided to a payee of his right to elect out of withholding for a nonperiodic distribution?
A. In this situation, the insurance company has only seven days in which to notify a payee of his right to elect out of withholding. It is not feasible for the insurance company to secure an election in writing unless the payee supplies the written election at the time he requests a withdrawal. Therefore, the notice and election can be provided in the following manner: (1) The insurance company may mail a notice to a payee on the day the request for withdrawal is received and (2) the notice may specify that unless the payee calls the company at a toll-free telephone number supplied on the notice within seven days of the date the request was received, the company will withhold from the distribution. Notice provided in this manner is deemed to satisfy the “reasonable time” requirement of question d-9. Insurance companies that encounter this problem are encouraged to supply an election form to a payee at the time an annuity contract is purchased. If a payee supplies an election with the request for withdrawal, notice still must be given but the insurance company may honor the
election received if no other communication is received after notice is provided to the payee.
f-14. Q. If an individual receives periodic payments from two or more plans of one member of a controlled group of corporations, separate periodic payments from two members of a controlled group of corporations out of one plan, or periodic payments from separate plans of two members of a controlled group, must the periodic payments be aggregated for withholding purposes?
A. No, unless the plan administrator or payor wishes to aggregate the payments. Section 414(b) does not require that plans of a controlled group of corporations be aggregated for withholding purposes. The same rule applies to a group of trades or businesses under common control or an affiliated service group described in section 414 (c) or (m).
f-15. Q. How is withholding applied to a designated distribution from an individual retirement account (IRA) described in section 408(a) that is payable upon demand even though payments are scheduled to be made over a period certain greater than one year?
A. Distributions from IRAs that are payable upon demand are not periodic payments taxable under section 72 because they do not constitute annuity contracts within the meaning of section 408(d)(2). Therefore, designated distributions from an IRA that are payable upon demand are treated as nonperiodic distributions subject to withholding at the 10% rate even if the distributions are paid over a period certain.
f-16. Q. Under the rules of section 72, a portion of certain payments that may vary because of investment experience, cost of living indices, or similar criteria is treated as not received as an annuity. For withholding purposes, must these amounts be treated as nonperiodic distributions even though part of each payment is a periodic payment?
A. No. For withholding purposes, amounts will be considered periodic payments even though a portion of each payment is treated as an amount not received as an annuity under § 1.72-2(b)(3) of the Income Tax Regulations.
f-17. Q. Is the payor of distributions under a funded nonqualified deferred compensation plan that are payable as an annuity and taxable under section 72 required to withhold under section 3405?
A. Yes. Section 31.3401(a)-1(b)(1)(i) of the Employment Tax Regulations provides that any amounts received as an annuity and taxable under section 72 are excepted from the general definition of wages. Therefore, to the extent that section 402(b) requires that distributions from nonqualified plans which are received as an annuity are taxable under the rules of section 72, section 3405 will apply. See, however, question a-18 for the rules relating to distributions from a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that are taxable under section 83. Therefore, whether the payor or plan administrator of a nonqualified plan is required to withhold under section 3402 or section 3405 depends upon what section of the Code governs the taxation of amounts contributed or distributed.
f-18. Q. Are amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete surrender or upon the maturity or endowment of a commercial annuity subject to the new withholding rules?
A. Yes. Amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete surrender or upon the maturity or endowment of a commercial annuity are subject to the new withholding rules to the extent that they are designated distributions. Thus, withholding is required on the complete or partial surrender of an annuity, life insurance or endowment contract to the extent they are designated distributions.
f-19. Q. Are amounts paid in connection with a partial surrender of a commercial annuity periodic payments?
A. Generally, no. Unless the amount paid in connection with the partial surrender is one of a series of payments payable over a period of greater than one year and taxable under section 72 as an amount received as an annuity, the amount paid is not a periodic payment.
f-20. Q. Are amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete surrender of an annuity contract subject to the new withholding rules?
A. Yes. Amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete surrender of an annuity contract are subject to the
new withholding rules to the extent that they are designated distributions.
f-21. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that amounts distributed in connection with a commercial annuity that was acquired on or before August 13, 1982, or are otherwise described in section 72(e)(5), which are not treated as amounts received as an annuity under section 72, will not be includible in the gross income of the recipient?
A. Generally, yes. Under the rules of section 72(e) prior to the passage of TEFRA, amounts not received as an annuity were not taxable until the investment in the contract was recovered. Thus, for distributions that are not received as an annuity under a commercial annuity contract acquired on or before August 13, 1982, it is reasonable to believe that amounts distributed are not includible in the payee's gross income to the extent they represent unrecovered investment in the contract. The special transitional rule of question a-33, available for plan administrators, may be used until December 31, 1983, by payors of commercial annuities who lack records with regard to the payee's unrecovered investment in the contract.
f-22. Q. For commercial annuity contracts entered into after August 13, 1982, which are not described in section 72(e)(5), is it reasonable to believe that amounts distributed, which are not amounts received as an annuity under section 72, are not includible in gross income?
A. Generally, no. TEFRA amended section 72(e) to provide that amounts not received as an annuity will be includible in gross income until all earnings or other amounts that are not part of the investment in the contract have been distributed. Thus, it is not reasonable to believe that amounts distributed in connection with a commercial annuity contract entered into after August 13, 1982, are excludible from gross income until all earnings or other amounts that are not part of the investment in the contract have been distributed. This new rule does not apply to distributions from commercial annuities described in section 72(e)(5). Question f-21 provides the proper rule with respect to distributions from commercial annuities described in section 72(e)(5).
f-23. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that amounts involved solely in connection with an exchange of commercial annuities under section 1035 of the Code will not be includible in the gross income of the recipient?
A. Yes. Designated distributions include only amounts that it is reasonable to believe are includible in the gross income of the recipient. In the case of a commercial annuity exchange under section 1035 in which no cash or other property is exchanged, it is reasonable to believe that no portion is includible in the gross income of a recipient. An annuity exchange includes an exchange of annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts issued by a life insurance company licensed to do business under the laws of any State. Thus, such exchanges are not subject to the withholding rules of section 3405. However, see question e-8 concerning recordkeeping requirements with respect to the nontaxable exchange of commercial annuity contracts under section 1035.
f-24. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that amounts distributed in connection with a surrender of a life insurance or endowment contract, or in connection with an exchange of life insurance or endowment contracts in which cash or other property is distributed, will not be includible in gross income?
A. Generally, no. Amounts distributed in connection with the surrender of a life insurance or endowment contract, or in connection with an exchange of life insurance or endowment contracts in which cash or other property is distributed are includible in income to the extent that the amount received exceeds the policyholder's investment in the contract. However, if a life insurance or endowment contract issued before August 13, 1982, is surrendered within ten years of the date of its issuance, or is exchanged within ten years of the date of its issuance, the payor may assume that no amounts are includible in the gross income of the policyholder if the cash or other property received by the policyholder in connection with the surrender or exchange of the life insurance or endowment contract does not exceed $10,000. If a life insurance or endowment contract issued before August 13, 1982, is
surrendered or exchanged ten years or more after the date of its issuance, the payor may assume that no amounts are includible in the gross income of the policyholder if the cash or other property received by the policyholder in connection with the surrender or exchange of the life insurance or endowment contract does not exceed $5,000. If the payor utilizes the special rule in the two preceding sentences, the payor must notify the policyholder, at the time described in question d-4, that all or part of the amount distributed may be includible in the policyholder's gross income. See question f-23 for additional rules concerning certain exchanges of annuity contracts.
f-25. Q. Do the requirements of section 3405(d)(10), relating to the time at which notice must be provided, also apply to the time at which an election out of withholding may be made?
A. Generally, yes. For example, an individual may not at commencement of employment execute an election out of withholding to be honored by a plan administrator or payor when the individual terminates employment and receives a distribution from a deferred compensation plan. See, however, question f-13 for a special rule applicable to certain annuity contracts.
f-26. Q. If a payor provided notice prior to January 1, 1983, but failed to include all of the information required by question d-18, may the abbreviated notice of question d-27 be supplied when making the first payment?
A. Yes, as long as the abbreviated notice contains all of the information required by question d-18 that was not supplied with the earlier notice.
f-27. Q. When must notice of the right to elect not to have withholding apply be given as to designated distributions from an individual retirement account (IRA) described in section 408(a) that is payable on demand even though payments are scheduled to be made over a period greater than one year?
A. Under question f-15, designated distributions from an IRA that are payable upon demand are treated as nonperiodic distributions subject to withholding at the 10 percent rate even if the distributions are paid over a certain period. Section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i) requires the payor of a nonperiodic distribution to transmit to the payee notice, at the time of the distribution or at such earlier time as may be provided in regulations, of the right to elect not to have withholding apply. If distributions from an IRA have begun and are scheduled to be made at quarterly or more frequent intervals, then, in lieu of providing a notice at the time of each distribution, the payor may furnish a blanket notice applicable to all such distributions that are expected to be made to the payee from the account during a calendar year. Such a blanket notice must be furnished at a reasonable time before the first payment made in the calendar year to which the notice relates, except that a blanket notice relating to distributions from an IRA during 1983 may be made by the later of October 1, 1983, or the date of the first designated distribution from the IRA.

# g. Delay Procedures
g-1. Q. When does the new law take effect?
A. In general, withholding is required on any designated distributions made after December 31, 1982.
g-2. Q. Is there a penalty for failure to withhold under section 3405 on designated distributions made after December 31, 1982?
A. Yes. In general, section 6651 governs the failure to file a return and to withhold tax under section 3405.
g-3. Q. Are there any circumstances under which the withholding and notice requirements of section 3405 may be delayed to a date later than January 1, 1983?
A. Yes. The Secretary has authority to delay, but not beyond June 30, 1983, the application of these withholding provisions to any payor or plan administrator if the payor or plan administrator can establish that he is unable to comply with these provisions without undue hardship.
g-4. Q. Under what circumstances may a payor or plan administrator who is experiencing undue hardship in complying with section 3405 delay implementation of the notice and withholding requirements?
A. For those payors and plan administrators who experience undue hardship in complying with the provisions
of section 3405, the withholding and notice requirements of section 3405 may be delayed so long as undue hardship exists up to July 1, 1983.
g-5. Q. Must approval be obtained from the Internal Revenue Service to be entitled to the delay referred to in question g-4 if the delay will be no later than April 1, 1983?
A. No. If a payor or plan administrator can establish that undue hardship would result if required to comply with the provisions of this section before April 1, 1983, prior approval from the Internal Revenue Service is not required and should not be requested. For purposes of this delay up to April 1, 1983, undue hardship will be presumed to exist, in the absence of bad faith, as long as the payor or plan administrator can establish that at least one of the conditions listed in question g-6 is present. The payor or plan administrator should prepare and retain a statement of undue hardship as described in question g-9 and should maintain any documents necessary to support the representations made in that statement.
g-6. Q. What constitutes undue hardship?
A. For purposes of these delay procedures, the term “undue hardship” generally means more than an inconvenience or increased costs to the payor or plan administrator. In the case of a payor or plan administrator who complies with the notice and withholding requirements of section 3405 on or before April 1, 1983, undue hardship will be presumed to exist if one or more of the following conditions is present:
(1) The payor or plan administrator encounters significant delay or other substantial difficulty in obtaining authorization for funds to develop forms, to mail notices, to process responses, to develop new computer programs, or to obtain and train personnel to implement withholding.
(2) The payor or plan administrator incurs substantial increases in unbudgeted costs to develop forms, to mail notices, to process responses, to develop new computer programs, or to obtain and train personnel.
(3) There is difficulty in obtaining trained personnel, including professional or semi-professional individuals, whose skills are necessary to implement withholding.
(4) Training new or present employees or hiring new employees to implement withholding would cause substantially increased costs or would disrupt the payor's or plan administrator's operations, and such disruption or increased costs would not occur if withholding were implemented at a later date.
(5) Plan benefits change due to a collective bargaining agreement concluded between October 1, 1982, and April 1, 1983.
(6) A payor who provided notice prior to January 1, 1983, receives a substantial number of inquiries from payees. These inquiries indicate the payees' lack of understanding of the new withholding provisions and the payor cannot answer all questions and receive responses by January 1, 1983.
(7) The payor or plan administrator is unable to implement withholding on account of the occurrence of an event, such as fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, or strike, beyond the control of the payor or plan administrator.
(8) The payor or plan administrator is scheduled to install a new data processing hardware package or system between December 1, 1982, and July 1, 1983, that will be used for the process of pension withholding.
An examble of a circumstance not considered as resulting in undue hardship would be changes in the withholding tables effective July 1, 1983.
The following examples illustrate situations in which an undue hardship that will permit delay in implementation of the notice and withholding provisions exists:

# Example 1.
A is the payor and plan administrator of a deferred compensation plan that is the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. The collectively bargained plan has fewer than 100 participants receiving annuity payments. All of A's available budget is scheduled to be used to pay plan benefits and administrative costs, and no funds are available to implement the new withholding requirements. A must obtain authorization to expend funds to implement withholding. Meetings at which A can obtain such authorization are held August 1 and February 1 of each year. After obtaining authorization on February 1, 1983, A will need to develop and mail withholding notices and elections, process responses and determine the amount to
be withheld from each payee's annuity payment. A can implement withholding on April 1, 1983, without substantially disrupting its operations, but earlier implementation would disrupt its normal operations. Under these facts, A experiences undue hardship until at least April 1, 1983, as a result of the circumstances described in items (1) and (4) of question g-6.

# Example 2.
B, a bank, is a payor of pensions and annuities under plans described in section 401(a). The plan administrators of all these plans have transferred liability to B for withholding under section 3405. After T.D. 7839, relating to withholding from pensions, annuities and other deferred income, was published in the
Federal Register
on October 14, 1982, B determines that the withholding provisions can be implemented before April 1, 1983, on a reasonaable schedule, without substantial increases in costs or disruption of daily bank operations, according to the following schedule:
(a) B's counsel analyzes regulations and reports requirements to operations personnel; operations personnel develop new Forms, which are reviewed and revised by management and legal personnel; new forms are printed; personnel begin reprogramming computers, 8 weeks (Dec 9, 1982).
(b) Forms distributed to branch offices, 1 week (Dec 16, 1982).
(c) Forms mailed to payees, 1 week (Dec 23, 1982).
(d) Time allowed for response to mailing of notices, answering questions, mailing follow-up notices to payees, 6 weeks (Feb 3, 1983).
(e) Withholding calculated and entered into payment system, 6 weeks (Mar 17, 1983).
Total: 22 weeks.
Implementation is scheduled to begin March 17, 1983. Implementation prior to March 17, 1983, would substantially increase costs and would disrupt B's operations.
Under these facts, B experiences undue hardship under item (4) of question g-6, up to March 17, 1983, the scheduled date of implementation.
g-7. Q. If a payor or plan administrator qualifies for the delay described in question g-5, is there a procedure for requesting an additional delay up to July 1, 1983?
A. Yes. However, any request made for this additional delay will be considered on a case-by-case basis. It is anticipated these requests will be carefully scrutinized and generally will be granted only in circumstances where the payor or plan administrator can reasonably expect that more than one of the conditions described in question g-6 will exist on or after April 1, 1983, and up to July 1, 1983.
g-8. Q. How may a payor or plan administrator request this additional delay of up to 3 months for undue hardship?
A. The payor or plan administrator may request an additional delay of up to 3 months by filing in duplicate a written statement of undue hardship signed under penalties of perjury with the director of the service center where the payor or plan administrator files Form 941 or Form 941E. This written request must state on the envelope and at the top of the letter “PENSION WITHHOLDING: Undue Hardship” and must include all the information required in a statement of undue hardship as described in question g-9.
g-9. Q. What information must the statement of undue hardship include?
A. The statement of undue hardship must include the following information:
(1) The name, address, and taxpayer indentification number of the payor or plan administrator.
(2) A complete statement of the facts upon which the payor is relying to show why a delay beyond April 1, 1983, is warranted. This statement must include as many of the conditions of undue hardship listed in question g-6 as pertain to the payor or plan administrator.
(3) A schedule or plan of implementation showing dates on which the payor will implement the provisions of this section, with no date later than July 1, 1983. This schedule should provide a complete timetable that includes such items as development of forms, mailing of notices, time for responses, programming computers, and calculation of withholding.
(4) An explanation of the steps taken which demonstrate the payor's or plan administrator's good faith attempt to comply with these notice and withholding requirements.
g-10. Q. When must the plan administrator or payor file this request for delay and statement of undue hardship?
A. Payors or plan administrators must file the statement of undue hardship on or before March 1, 1983. However, no request for delay may be filed with the Internal Revenue Service before January 1, 1983.
g-11. Q. Who must request the delay?
A. The delay should be requested by the payor or plan administrator who is actually liable for withholding. Therefore, generally the payor should request the delay. However, in the case of a distribution from a plan described in section 401(a), section 403(a), or section 301(d) of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, the plan administrator is liable for withholding and should request the delay unless the plan administrator has transferred liability for withholding to the payor under section 3405(c).
g-12. Q. If a plan administrator has not yet transferred liability for withholding under section 3405(c) or has inadequately transferred liability, and the payor requests a delay, will the request for delay be treated as if the plan administrator had requested it?
A. Yes.
g-13. Q. If a plan administrator and a payor both file requests for delay and statements of undue hardship with respect to the same plan, will there be two separate three-month extensions?
A. No. A request for delay will delay the effective date only up to three months and in no case will it extend it past July 1, 1983.
g-14. Q. What are the consequences for failure to file the request for delay and statement of undue hardship in a timely manner?
A. If the request for delay and statement of undue hardship are not filed in a timely manner, the payor or plan administrator will not be entitled to any delay beyond the delay to which he may be entitled under question g-5. This rule will not apply in the case of an event such as strike, fire, flood, earthquake, or explosion that occurs after March 1, 1983, if compliance with the withholding provisions would have been possible absent the occurrence of the event.
g-15. Q. Will a payor or plan administrator receive a response from the Internal Revenue Service as to whether a delay after April 1, 1983, has been granted?
A. Yes. Since these requests for delay will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, the payor or plan administrator will receive a response by April 1, 1983, as to whether or not a requested delay has been granted. If the request for delay is denied by the director of the service center, the payor or plan administrator is required to begin withholding by the later of April 1, 1983, or 10 days from the date on the response. No penalties will be imposed under section 6651 for failure to withhold between April 1, 1983, and the day 10 days from the date on the response.
g-16. Q. If the director of the service center grants a delay up to July 1, 1983, must the payor or plan administrator retain a copy of the response from the Internal Revenue Service?
A. Yes. In addition, the payor or plan administrator must attach a copy of the response to the first Form 941 or 941E filed after the response is received.
g-17. Q. If a plan administrator or payor begins withholding before April 1, 1983, or July 1, 1983, can the payee request a refund from the plan administrator or payor of the amounts withheld?
A. No. Because plan administrators and payors are required to comply with the withholding and notice requirements as soon as they no longer experience undue hardship, they cannot refund any amounts withheld to a payee, except as provided in the regulations under section 6413 (in the case of a mistake by the payor or plan administrator).
g-18. Q. If a payor or plan administrator properly files the statement of undue hardship and receives a delay as provided in question g-7, will withholding from payments made after the delay period be required to make up for amounts that would have been withheld if there had been no delay granted?
A. No. No catch-up withholding is required for plan administrators or payors who are entitled to a delay up to April 1, 1983, as provided in question g-5 or granted a delay up to July 1, 1983, as provided in question g-7. However, if a payor or plan administrator who is entitled to a delay up to April 1, 1983, as provided in question g-5, is not granted a delay up to July 1, 1983, but is unable to implement withholding until July 1, 1983, despite a good faith effort to comply, no penalties will be imposed under section 6651 if the payor or plan administrator withholds between July 1, 1983, and December 31, 1983, both the amounts required to be withheld during that period and the
amounts that should have been withheld between April 1, 1983, and June 30, 1983.
g-19. Q. If a payor or plan administrator does not receive and is not otherwise entitled to a delay under these regulations, will withholding from future payments be required to make up for amounts that would have been withheld if there had been no delay?
A. Yes, to the extent possible. An example of a situation in which a payor or plan administrator would not be able to withhold enough from subsequent payments to satisfy pre-July 1, 1983, withholding obligations is one where the recipient of a single life annuity died on July 1, 1983, before the payor or plan administrator began to withhold income tax from the annuity. In addition, a payor or plan administrator would not be able to satisfy the pre-July 1, 1983, withholding requirements if the payee elects out of withholding before all of the make-up withholding has been accomplished.
g-20. Q. What are the consequences if the payor or plan administrator cannot establish undue hardship and does not comply on January 1, 1983?
A. In general, if the payor or plan administrator cannot establish undue hardship and fails to withhold beginning January 1, 1983, the payor or plan administrator will be liable for the tax that should have been withheld and, in addition, the penalties provided in section 6651 will apply. However, the payor or plan administrator will not be liable for penalties for failure to file a return and for failure to pay the tax if a good faith effort is made to comply, and if, to the extent possible, withholding from post-implementation payments is sufficient to satisfy the pre-implementation withholding obligation. Whether the payor or plan administrator has made a good faith effort to comply depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. The facts and circumstances that will be considered include, but are not limited to, those conditions listed in question g-6.
g-21. Q. If a payor or plan administrator is required to make up amounts that should have been withheld, must he withhold from the first subsequent payment the entire amount that should have been previously withheld?
A. No. A payor or plan administrator may withhold a proportional amount out of each subsequent payment made before January 1, 1984.
g-22. Q. Will the notice requirements of section 3405 apply before July 1, 1983, with respect to recipients of periodic payments that total less than $5400 per year?
A. No.
g-23. Q. Will the notice and withholding requirements of section 3405 apply before July 1, 1983, with respect to payments to nonresident alien individuals?
A. No.
g-24. Q. Does a payor or plan administrator who requested a delay prior to the publication of these procedures in the
Federal Register
need to resubmit the request in light of these procedures?
A. Yes. In order to be entitled to a delay, payors and plan adminstrators must follow the procedures required by these temporary regulations.
g-25. Q. Will the notice and withholding requirements of section 3405 apply before January 1, 1984, with respect to the exchange or complete or partial surrender of a commercial annuity under which the recipient had not irrevocably chosen, prior to January 1, 1984, to receive payments in the form of an annuity?
A. In the case of the exchange or complete or partial surrender of a commercial annuity under which the recipient had not irrevocably chosen, prior to January 1, 1984, to receive payments in the form of an annuity, the application of the notice and withholding provisions of this section may be delayed, so long as undue hardship exists, up to January 1, 1984. Prior approval from the Internal Revenue Service is not required for such delay, and should not be requested. For purposes of this delay, undue hardship will be presumed to exist, in the absence of bad faith, so long as the payor can establish that at least one of the conditions in question g-6 is present. The payor should prepare and retain a statement of undue hardship as described in question g-9 and should maintain any documents necessary to
support the representations made in that statement.

# PART 35a—TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT TAX REGULATIONS UNDER THE INTEREST AND DIVIDEND TAX COMPLIANCE ACT OF 1983

# Authority:
26 U.S.C. 7805; § 35a.3406-2 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 3406(c)(3)(D) and 3406(i).
§ 35a.3406-2
Imposition of backup withholding for notified payee underreporting of reportable interest or dividend payments.
(a)
Requirement that a payor backup withhold due to a notified payee underreporting
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) applies to any reportable interest or dividend payment (as defined in section 3406(b)(2) and paragraph (a)(4) of this section) made to a payee, if the Internal Revenue Service or a broker (as defined in section 3406(h)(5) and paragraph (a)(7) of this section and pursuant to section 3406(d)(2)(B)(ii)(III)) notifies a payor (as defined in section 3406(h)(4) and in paragraph (a)(6) of this section) that the payee is subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section). The payor is required under section 3406(c)(4) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section to inform the payee that backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) has begun. The requirements for the notice that a payor must send to a payee are set forth in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section. The period for which backup withholding is required due to a notified payee underreporting is described in section 3406(e)(3)(A) and in paragraph (e) of this section. See section 3406(c)(3) and paragraph (g) of this section for the rules regarding how a payee may obtain a determination from the Internal Revenue Service that withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) be stopped or not started.
(2)
Definition of notified payee underreporting.
The term “notified payee underreporting” means that the Internal Revenue Service has—
(i) Determined that there was a payee underreporting as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section,
(ii) Mailed at least four notices to the payee (over a period of at least 120 days) with respect to the underreporting as prescribed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and
(iii) Assessed any deficiency attributable to the underreporting in the case of any payee who has filed a return.
(3)
Definition of a payee underreporting.
The term “payee underreporting” means that the Internal Revenue Service has determined, for a taxable year, that—
(i) A payee failed to include in his return of tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code for such year any portion of a reportable interest or dividend payment required to be shown on such tax return, or
(ii) A payee may be required to file a return for such year and to include a reportable interest or dividend payment in such return, but failed to file such return.
See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for certain payments to be taken into account in determining whether there is payee underreporting even though those payments may not be defined as reportable interest or dividend payments in paragraph (a)(4) of this section or even though backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) may not apply to such payments.
(4)
Definition of a reportable interest or dividend payment
—(i)
In general.
See section 3406(b)(2), A-2 of § 35a.9999-1, A-5 of § 35a.9999-3, and A-15 of § 35a.9999-2 for the definition of reportable interest or dividend payment.
(ii)
Exceptions
—(A)
Patronage dividends.
Patronage dividends are treated as reportable interest or dividend payments for purposes of backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) only if 50 percent or more of the reportable amount is paid in money or by qualified check (as defined in section
1388(c)(4)), and then only to the extent that the payment is in money or by qualified check. See the second paragraph in A-10 of § 35a.9999-3 for an example of how this rule applies.
(B)
Window payments.
Pursuant to section 3406(b)(7), window payments as defined in A-42 of § 35a.9999-1 and A-9 of § 35a.9999-2 are not treated as reportable interest or dividend payments for purposes of backup withholding under section ­3406(a) (1)(C).
(5)
Reportable interest or dividend payments excluded from backup withholding.
The following reportable interest or dividend payments are not subject to backup withholding:
(i)
Certain dividends.
Certain dividend payments as defined in A-9 of § 35a.9999-3.
(ii)
Minimal payments.
Minimal payments as defined in A-19 of § 36a.9999-2 if the payor elects not to impose backup withholding on such amounts.
(iii)
Original issue discount.
Original issue discount as defined in section 1273, unless there is a payment in cash. See A-15 of § 35a.9999-2.
(iv)
Payments subject to other withholding.
Payments already subject to withholding under another provision of the Internal Revenue Code.
Reportable minimal payments (to the extent reported on an information return), patronage dividends, original issue discount, and window payments shall be taken into account in determining whether underreporting (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) has occurred, even though those payments may not be defined as reportable interest or dividend payments under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or even though backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) may not apply to such payments.
(6)
Definition of payor.
See section 3406(h)(4), A-41 of § 35a.9999-1, and A-1 of § 35a.9999-3 for the definition of payor. The term payor includes a broker who holds an instrument in street name.
(7)
Definition of broker.
See section 3406(h)(5) for the definition of broker.
(b)
Notice to payors and brokers regarding backup withholding
—(1)
Notice from the Internal Revenue Service.
The Internal Revenue Service will notify—
(i) Payors to begin backup withholding on reportable interest or dividend payments due to a notified payee underreporting pursuant to section 3406(a)(1)(C); and
(ii) Brokers pursuant to section 3406(c)(5) that a payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C).
(2)
Notice from a broker.
A broker who receives a notice from the Internal Revenue Service that a payee is subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting and through whom the payee subsequently acquires a readily tradable instrument (as defined in section 3406(h)(6)) with respect to which the broker is not the payor is required to notify the payor of that instrument that the payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) in the time and manner provided in A-41 of § 35a.9999-1.
(3)
Accounts subject to backup withholding.
(i)
In general.
After receiving notice from the Internal Revenue Service or from a broker, as provided in section 3406(d)(2)(B) and paragraphs (b) (1)(i) and (2) of this section, that a payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C), payors are required to withhold 20 percent of all reportable interest or dividend payments subject to backup withholding made with respect to all accounts of the payee.
(ii)
Joint accounts.
Payors are required to withhold on joint accounts if the payee subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) is the first person listed on the account at the time the payor receives the notice to begin backup withholding. Backup withholding shall continue to apply to reportable interest and dividend payments made to that account even if the order of the names on the account is subsequently changed, provided that the name of the payee subject to backup withholding remains on the account.
(iii)
Exception.
Payors are not requied to withhold on reportable interest or dividend payments made with respect to an account of the payee that could not be located with reasonable care. The payor will be considered to have exercised reasonable care if the payor
uses the name and taxpayer identification number (or names and taxpayer identification numbers if a joint return was filed by the payees) provided on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or from a broker as prescribed in paragraphs (b) (1)(i) and (2) of this section and in certain circumstances identified in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) any account numbers provided by the Internal Revenue Service in locating all accounts of a payee or payees. If a payee uses a different name on an account than the name stated on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or from a broker (for instance, due to marriage or adoption) and the payor can associate both names with the payee using records kept in the ordinary course of business, the payor will be treated as exercising reasonable care if the payor uses both names to locate accounts of the payee. If the taxpayer identification number is not provided to the payor or broker by the Internal Revenue Service, or if the taxpayer identification number provided by the Internal Revenue Service does not match the taxpayer identification number of the payee on the records that the payor or broker maintains in the ordinary course of business, the payor or broker is required to use any account numbers provided by the Internal Revenue Service to identify the payee and the payee's taxpayer identification number. This information must be used by the payor to locate other accounts of the payee and by the broker to locate the payors with respect to whom the payee subsequently acquires a readily tradable instrument through that broker.
(c)
Notice from payors of backup withholding due to a payee underreporting
—(1)
In general.
A payor is required under section 3406(c)(4) to notify the payee in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section that backup withholding has begun because of a notified payee underreporting. Payors who are notified by a broker that a payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) are also required to send the notice in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. As a result, the notice requirements provided in A-39 of § 35a.9999-1 and in the appendix to § 35a.9999-2 shall not apply to those payors notified by a broker that a payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). The payor must send the notice required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section to the payee no later than 15 days after the date that the payor makes the first payment subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). The payor must send the notice of backup withholding by first-class mail to the payee at his last known address. Rules similar to the rules in A-17, A-18, A-19, and A-20 of § 35a.9999-1 shall apply to the requirement to provide notice by first-class mail.
(2)
Form of the notice to the payee with respect to notified payee underreporting.
The notice to the payee required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section must state—
(i) That the Internal Revenue Service has given notice that the payee has underreported reportable interest or dividends;
(ii) That, as a result of such underreporting, the payor is required under section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code to withhold 20 percent of reportable interest and dividend payments made to the payee no later than the close of the day 30 days after the date that the payor received the notice;
(iii) The date that the payor received the notice to begin backup withholding under 3406(a)(1)(C);
(iv) That the payee must obtain a determination from the Internal Revenue Service in order to stop the backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C); and
(v) That while he is subject to backup withholding due to payee underreporting, the payee may not certify to a payor making reportable interest or dividend payments (or to a broker acquiring a readily tradable instrument for the payee) that he is not subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). See section 3406(a)(1)(D) for the backup withholding rules with respect to a payee's failure to make the certification under section 3406(a)(1)(D).
(3)
Exceptions.
A notice provided to a payee on or before April 23, 1987, will be deemed to satisfy the provisions of
paragraph (c)(2) of this section if it informs the payee that the payor has been instructed by the Internal Revenue Service to start backup withholding on reportable interest or dividend payments to the payee. If a payor who has started backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting on or before April 23, 1987, has not provided adequate notice to the payee on or before April 23, 1987, then the payor must provide notice to the payee in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the date that is 45 days after April 23, 1987.
(d)
Notice to stop backup withholding
—(1)
In general.
The Internal Revenue Service will provide written certification to the payee that backup withholding is to stop and will notify the payors who were contacted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section to stop withholding after the Internal Revenue Service makes a determination under paragraph (g) of this section that backup withholding with respect to a payee should stop. The Internal Revenue Service will also notify the brokers who were contacted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section that the payee is no longer subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) and that the brokers are no longer obligated to provide notices to payors under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. A broker who receives certification under this section from the Internal Revenue Service is not required to provide the certification to any payors to which the broker has previously provided the notice required under paragraph (b)(2).
(2)
Date notice to stop withholding will be provided
—(i)
Underreporting corrected or bona fide dispute.
If the Internal Revenue Service makes a determination as set forth in paragraph (g)(1) (ii) or (iv) of this section during the 12-month period ending on October 15, of any calendar year, the Internal Revenue Service will provide the certification or notice required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section no later than December 1 of such calendar year.
(ii)
No underreporting or undue hardship.
If the Internal Revenue Service makes a determination as set forth in paragraph (g)(1) (i) or (iii), the Internal Revenue Service will provide the notices required by paragraph (d)(1) of this paragraph no later than the 45th day after the day on which the Internal Revenue Service makes its determination.
(e)
Period during which withholding is required
—(1)
In general.
Upon receiving notice from the Internal Revenue Service after April 23, 1987, to begin backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) or notification from a broker stating that the payee is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C), the payor must impose backup withholding on all reportable interest and dividend payments made to the payee during the period beginning after the close of the 30th day after the day on which the payor receives the notice provided in paragraph (b) (1)(i) or (2) of this section and ending as of the close of the day before the stop date (as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section). Pursuant to section 3406(e)(5)(C), the payor may elect to begin backup withholding at any time during the 30-day period described in this paragraph.
(2)
Stop date
—(i)
Underreporting corrected or bona fide dispute.
In the case of a determination that the underreporting has been corrected or that a bona fide dispute exists (as defined in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) or (iv) of this section), the stop date is—
(A) January 1 following the 12-month period ending on October 15th of any calendar year in which the determination has been made or, if later,
(B) The day that is 30 days after the earlier of—
(
1
) The date on which the payor receives written notification from the Internal Revenue Service (under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) that withholding is to stop; or
(
2
) The date on which the payor receives a copy of the written certification provided to the payee by the Internal Revenue Service that withholding is to stop.
(ii)
No underreporting or undue hardship.
In the case of a determination that no payee underreporting occurred or that an undue hardship exists or could exist (as defined in paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (iii) of this section), the stop date is that date specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(iii)
Payor election to shorten or eliminate grace period.
The payor with respect to any payee may elect to determine the stop date without regard to the grace period provided in section 3406(e)(5)(B) (
i.e.,
without regard to the words “the day that is 30 days after” in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section) or by substituting a shorter grace period.
(iv)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(i) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The Internal Revenue Service makes a determination by October 15, 1987, that any underreporting with respect to A has been corrected. X, a payor who has been notified to backup withhold on payments of interest to A due to notified payee underreporting, receives written notice from the Internal Revenue Service on December 1, 1987, informing X that A is no longer subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) and that X must stop backup withholding as of the close of December 31, 1987, or if later, the earlier of the close of the day 30 days after receipt of the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or receipt of the copy of the written certification provided to the payee by the Internal Revenue Service. The stop date, as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, is January 1, 1988, and the payor must stop backup withholding as of the close of December 31, 1987.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that X, due to a change of address or for other reasons, does not receive the notice from the Internal Revenue Service to stop backup withholding until December 15, 1987. In addition, A does not provide X with a copy of the certification that was provided to A by the Internal Revenue Service until December 15, 1987. The stop date, as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, is January 14, 1988 (30 days after December 15, 1987), because that date is later than January 1, 1988. However, if a payor elects pursuant to section 3406(e)(5)(C) and paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section to determine the stop date without regard to that 30-day grace period, the stop date is January 1, 1987.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2
except that on December 10, 1987 (rather than on December 15, 1987), A provides X with a copy of the certification from the Internal Revenue Service. The stop date, as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, is January 9, 1988 (30 days after December 10, 1987), because that date is earlier than January 14, 1988 (30 days after the day X received notice from the Internal Revenue Service), but later than January 1, 1988.
(f)
Notice to payees from the Internal Revenue Service
—(1)
Notice period.
After the Internal Revenue Service determines that a payee underreporting exists as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to section 3406(c)(1)(B), will mail to the payee at least four notices over a period of at least 120 days (hereafter referred to as the “notice period”) before payors and brokers will be notified that the payee is subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The notices may be incorporated with other notices provided to the payee by the Internal Revenue Service.
(2)
Payee subject to withholding.
After the Internal Revenue Service provides the notices described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will send the notices required by paragraph (b) of this section unless—
(i) A payee obtains a determination under paragraph (g) of this section, or
(ii) In the case of a payee who has filed a tax return, the Internal Revenue Service has not assessed the deficiency attributable to the underreporting.
(3)
Disclosure of names of payors and brokers.
The Internal Revenue Service pursuant to section 3406(c)(5) may require a payee subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting to disclose the names of all of his payors of reportable interest or dividend payments and the names of all of the brokers with whom the payee has accounts which may involve reportable interest or dividend payments. To the extent required in the request from the Internal Revenue Service, the payee shall also provide his account numbers and other information necessary to identify the payee's accounts.
(4)
Backup withholding certification.
Once a payee receives a final notice from the Internal Revenue Service notifying him that his reportable interest or dividend payments are subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting under section 3406(a)(1)(C), the payee shall not certify to any payor or broker, under penalties of perjury, that he is not subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C). See paragraph (k)(2) of this section for the penalties that will
apply to a payee who makes a false certification. The payee may not make the certification until the payee receives the certification provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section from the Internal Revenue Service advising the payee that he is no longer subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) (as provided in A-33 of § 35a.9999-1). See A-37 of § 35a.9999-1 for the rule applicable to a payor who makes reportable interest or dividend payments to a payee who fails to certify that he is not subject to backup withholding due to notified payee underreporting.
(g)
Determination by the Internal Revenue Service that backup withholding should not start or should be stopped
—(1)
In general.
A payee may prevent backup withholding from starting or stop it once it has started if, for the taxable year with respect to which there is a notified payee underreporting and any other taxable payee—
(i) Shows that there was no payee underreporting (as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section);
(ii) Corrects any payee underreporting (as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section);
(iii) Shows that backup withholding will cause or is causing an undue hardship (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) and that it is unlikely that the payee will underreport interest or dividend payments again; or
(iv) Shows that a bona fide dispute exists as to whether any underreporting has occurred (as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section).
(2)
No underreporting.
A payee may show that no underreporting of interest or dividends exists by presenting receipts or other satisfactory documentation to the Internal Revenue Service showing that all taxes relating to such payments were reported and paid timely or evidence showing that the payee did not have to file a return for the taxable year in question or that the underreporting determination is based upon a factual, clerical, or other mistake.
(3)
Correcting any payee underreporting
—(i)
Before issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency.
Before a statutory notice of deficiency is issued to a payee pursuant to section 6212, the payee may correct underreporting by filing a return if one was not previously filed and paying taxes, penalties, and interest due with respect to any underreported interest or dividend payments.
(ii)
After issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency.
After a statutory notice of deficiency is issued to a payee, the payee may correct underreporting at any time by filing a return if one was not previously filed and paying the entire deficiency and any other taxes including penalties and interest attributable to any payee underreporting of interest or dividend payments. Thus, for example, a payee may correct underreporting after assessment of a deficiency by paying the entire assessment with respect to that deficiency and any other taxes including penalties and interest attributable to any payee underreporting of interest or dividend payments for other taxable years.
(4)
Undue hardship.
A determination of undue hardship will be based on the overall impact to the payee of having 20 percent of reportable interest and dividend payments withheld. Factors that will be considered in determining whether backup withholding causes undue hardship include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) Whether estimated tax payments, and other credits for current tax liabilities, or amounts withheld on employee wages or pensions, in addition to backup withholding, would cause significant over-withholding;
(ii) The payee's health, including the payee's ability to pay foreseeable medical expenses;
(iii) The extent of the payee's reliance on interest and dividend payments to meet necessary living expenses and the existence, if any, of other sources of income;
(iv) Whether other income of the payee is limited or fixed (
e.g.,
social security, pension, and unearned income);
(v) The payee's ability to sell or liquidate stocks, bonds, bank accounts, trust accounts, or other assets, and the consequences of doing so;
(vi) Whether the payee reported and timely paid the most recent year's tax liability, including interest and dividend income; and
(vii) Whether the payee has filed a bankruptcy petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court.
In addition to the above factors, the Internal Revenue Service must conclude that it is unlikely that any payee underreporting will occur again.
(5)
Bona fide dispute.
The Internal Revenue Service may make a determination under this paragraph if there is a dispute between the payee and the Internal Revenue Service on a question of fact or law that is material to a determination under paragraph (g)(1)(i) and, based upon all the facts and circumstances, the Internal Revenue Service finds that the dispute is asserted in good faith by the payee and there is a reasonable basis for the payee's position. See the example provided in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section for an illustration of this provision.
(h)
Requests for determinations
—(1)
In general.
A payee may request a determination under one or more of the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section. Following its review of a request for a determination under paragraph (g) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will either provide the payee with a written certification as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section if the evidence presented warrants the requested determination or will provide the payee with a written notice informing him that a determination was not made.
(2)
Determinations made during the notice period.
In general, if a determination is made during the notice period as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, then the payee will not be subject to backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting with respect to any taxable year for which a determination was made.
(3)
Determinations made after the notice period.
If a determination is made after the notice period, as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will provide a notice to payors and brokers, and a certification to the payee as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Payees filing a joint return
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 3406(a)(1)(C), if payee underreporting is found to exist with respect to a joint return filed by a husband and wife, then the provisions of this section shall apply to the payees collectively. As a result, both payees will be subject to backup withholding on accounts in their individual names as well as accounts in their joint names. Either or both payees may satisfy the criteria for a determination that no payee underreporting exists, that the underreporting has been corrected, or that a bona fide dispute exists (as provided in paragraphs (g)(1) (i), (ii), or (iv) of this section). Both payees, however, must satisfy the criteria for a determination that backup withholding will cause or is causing undue hardship (as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section).
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Innocent spouse.
A spouse who files a joint return may obtain a determination that withholding should stop or not start with respect to payments made to his or her individual accounts, if the spouse—
(A) Shows that he or she did not underreport income because he or she is an innocent spouse as described in section 6013(e), or
(B) Shows that there is a bona fide dispute as to whether he or she is an innocent spouse and hence did not underreport income.
(ii)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (j)(2)(i) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
H and W filed a joint return in 1986 on which H failed to include $2,000 of interest income. In 1987, the Internal Revenue Service determined that a payee underreporting exists with respect to H and W for the 1986 tax year. After properly notifying H and W of the underreporting and assessing the tax, the Internal Revenue Service sent notices to payors to begin backup withholding on the joint and individual accounts of H and W and to brokers informing them that H and W are subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) on their joint and individual accounts. W claims that she is an innocent spouse and requests a determination that she did not underreport interest or dividend income so that her individual accounts will not be subject to backup withholding.
The Internal Revenue Service questions her status as an innocent spouse. If the Internal Revenue Service determines, based upon all the facts and circumstances, that there is a reasonable basis for W's claim to be an innocent spouse and that the claim is made in good faith, W will have a bona fide dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.
Consequently, the individual accounts of W will not be subject to further backup withholding due to a notified payee underreporting as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section.
The Internal Revenue Service will notify payors to stop backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) and brokers that W is no longer subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) on W's individual accounts. Backup withholding will not restart on those accounts unless the Internal Revenue Service ultimately determines that W is not an innocent spouse. In that event the Internal Revenue Service will notify the payors to start backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) and the brokers that W is subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) with respect to the individual accounts of W.
(iii)
Divorced or legally separated payee.
A payee who, at the time of the request for a determination under paragraph (g) of this section, is divorced or legally separated under state law may obtain a determination that undue hardship exists (or would exist) under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section with respect to reportable interest and dividend payments made to his or her individual accounts if the divorced or legally separated payee satisfies the criteria for a determination under paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
(k)
Penalties
—(1)
Failure to withhold.
See A-2 of § 35a.9999-3 for rules relating to penalties applicable to a payor who fails to withhold on reportable interest and dividend payments made to a payee subject to backup withholding.
(2)
False certification
—(i)
Criminal penalty under section 7205(b).
If any individual willfully makes a false certification under section 3406(d) (1) or (2), then that individual shall, in addition to any other penalty provided by law, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.
(ii)
Civil penalty under section 6682
—(A)
In general.
In addition to any criminal penalty provided by law, if any individual makes a statement under section 3406 which results in a decrease in the amounts deducted and withheld under chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code and, as of the time the statement was made, there was no reasonable basis for the statement, the individual shall pay a penalty of $500 for the statement. The penalty is due upon notice and demand and pursuant to section 6682 collection is not subject to the deficiency procedures of subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code. See section 6682.
(B)
Waiver of penalty.
The payee may obtain a waiver (in whole or part) of the penalty imposed under section 6682(a) and paragraph (k)(2)(ii)(A) of this section if it is established to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service that the taxes imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the payee for the taxable year in which the false certification was made are equal to or less than the sum of—
(
1
) The credits against taxes allowed by part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, and
(
2
) The payments of estimated tax which are considered payments on account of such taxes.
(C)
Procedure for seeking a waiver.
To request a waiver under section 6682(b) and paragraph (k)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the payee must submit to the Internal Revenue Service a written statement with supporting documents to establish all the facts necessary in order to obtain the waiver. The statement must be signed by the person that otherwise would be subject to the penalty imposed by section 6682(a) and paragraph (k)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and must contain a declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury.
(3)
Delay of assessment.
If a payee institutes or maintains a suit with the United States Tax Court primarily to delay assessment and the payee's position is frivolous or groundless, or the payee unreasonably failed to pursue available administrative remedies, the court may award up to $5,000 in damages under section 6673. The damages will be assessed against and collected from the payee in the same manner as the underlying tax.
(l)
Effective Date.
This section is effective until December 31, 1996.

§ 36.3121(l)-0
Introduction.
(a) The regulations in this part deal with the circumstances under which a domestic corporation may enter into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service for the purpose of extending the insurance system established by title II of the Social Security Act to certain services performed outside the United States by citizens of the United States as employees of a foreign subsidiary of the domestic corporation, and with the obligations of a domestic corporation which enters into such an agreement. The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, to which the regulations in this part pertain are contained in section 3121(1). The liabilities assumed under an agreement entered into pursuant to such section are based on the remuneration for services covered by the agreement. Such agreement may not be effective prior to January 1, 1955.
(b) Although the obligations incurred under an agreement entered into pursuant to section 3121(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, must be distinguished from the obligations imposed on employers with respect to the taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, the two are similar in many respects. Accordingly, the regulations in this part are prescribed as a supplement to the regulations (26 CFR (1954), Part 31, Subpart B) relating to the employee tax and the employer tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. The terms used in the regulations in this part have the same meaning, unless otherwise provided, as when used in the regulations relating to the taxes imposed by such act.
(c) The regulations in this part constitute Part 36 of title 26 of the Code of Federal Regulations. As used in the regulations in this part, the word “Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and the term “Federal Insurance Contributions Act” means chapter 21 of such Code. All references to sections of law are references to the Code unless otherwise indicated. The number of each section of the regulations begins with 36 followed by a decimal point (36.). Numbers which do not begin with 36 followed by a decimal point are numbers of sections of law unless otherwise indicated. In identifying sections of regulations, the symbol “§” is used.
[T.D. 6145, 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7012, 34 FR 7693, May 15, 1969; T.D. 7665, 45 FR 6090, Jan. 25, 1980]
§ 36.3121(l)(1)-1
Agreements entered into by domestic corporations with respect to foreign subsidiaries.
(a)
In general.
(1) Any domestic corporation having one or more foreign subsidiaries may request the Internal Revenue Service to enter into an agreement for the purpose of extending the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance system established by title II of the Social Security Act to certain services performed outside the United States by all citizens of the United States who are employees of any such foreign subsidiary. See § 36.3121(l)(8)-1, relating to the definition of foreign subsidiary. Except as
provided in § 36.3121(l)(5)-1, relating to the effect of the termination of an agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of section 3121(l), the Internal Revenue Service shall, at the request of a domestic corporation enter into such agreement on Form 2032 in any case where a Form 2032 is executed, and submitted by the domestic corporation in the manner prescribed in this section. A domestic corporation may not have in effect at the same moment of time more than one agreement on Form 2032.
(2) An agreement authorized in section 3121(l)(1) may not be made applicable to any services performed outside the United States which would not constitute employment, for purposes of the taxes imposed under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, if the services were performed within the United States. Thus, such an agreement shall have no application with respect to any services performed outside the United States which, if performed within the United States, would be specifically excepted from employment under any of the numbered paragraphs of section 3121(b), or which, although not so excepted, would be deemed not to be employment by application of section 3121(c), relating to included and excluded services. Further, an agreement may not be made applicable with respect to any services performed outside the United States which constitute employment, as defined in section 3121(b). Thus, an agreement may not be made applicable to services for any employer performed by any employee on or in connection with an American vessel or American aircraft when outside the United States, if (i) performed under a contract of service which is entered into within the United States or (ii) during the performance of which and while the employee is employed on the vessel or aircraft it touches at a port in the United States, because such services constitute employment as defined in section 3121(b). An agreement may not be made applicable to remuneration which would not constitute wages, as defined in section 3121(a), even if the services to which such remuneration is attributable had constituted employment.
(3) The terms “corporation”, “domestic”, and “foreign”, as used in the regulations in this part, have the meaning assigned by paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), respectively, of section 7701(a). Section 701(a) (3), (4), and (5) provides as follows:
Sec. 7701.
Definitions.
(a) When used in this title [Internal Revenue Code of 1954], where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof—
(3)
Corporation.
The term “corporation” includes associations, joint-stock companies, and insurance companies.
(4)
Domestic.
The term “domestic” when applied to a corporation * * * means created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any State or Territory.
(5)
Foreign.
The term “foreign” when applied to a corporation * * * means a corporation * * * which is not domestic.
(b)
Form and contents of agreement.
Form 2032 is the form prescribed for the agreement authorized in section 3121(l)(1). The agreement shall include provisions substantially as follows:
(1) That the agreement shall apply to all services performed outside the United States by all citizens of the United States who are in the employ of the foreign subsidiary or subsidiaries to which the agreement is made applicable, but only to the extent that the remuneration paid each employee for such services would constitute wages if paid by one employer for services performed in the United States;
(2) That the agreement shall not apply to any services which constitute employment within the meaning of section 3121;
(3) That the agreement shall become effective on the first day of the calendar quarter in which the Form 2032 is signed by the district director or director of the service center or on the first day of the next succeeding calendar quarter, whichever is specified in the agreement;
(4) That the domestic corporation will pay, as required by the regulations in this part, amounts equivalent to the sum of the taxes which would be imposed by sections 3101 and 3111, respectively, if the remuneration for the
services covered by the agreement constituted wages;
(5) That the domestic corporation will pay, in accordance with written notification and demand therefor to the domestic corporation, amounts equivalent to the interest, additions to the taxes, additional amounts, and penalties which would be applicable if the remuneration for services covered by the agreement constituted wages; and
(6) That the domestic corporation will comply with all provisions of the regulations in this part.
(c)
Execution and filing of Form 2032.
The request of any domestic corporation that the Internal Revenue Service enter into an agreement with the corporation on Form 2032 shall be signified by the corporation by executing and filing Form 2032 in triplicate. Such form shall be executed and filed in accordance with the regulations in this part and the instructions relating to the form. Each copy of the form shall be signed and dated by the officer of the corporation authorized to enter into the agreement, shall show the title of such officer, and shall have the corporate seal affixed thereto. A certified copy of the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors of the domestic corporation, or other evidence, showing the authority of such officer so to act shall accompany the form. Form 2032 executed and filed as provided in this paragraph shall be signed and dated by the district director or director of the service center and, upon such signing, the Form 2032 so executed and filed will constitute the agreement authorized in section 3121(l)(1). The Internal Revenue Service will return one copy of the agreement to the domestic corporation, will transmit one copy of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and will retain one copy (together with all related papers).
[T.D. 6145, 20 FR 6577, Sept. 8, 1955, as amended by T.D. 7012, 34 FR 7693, May 15, 1969]
§ 36.3121(l)(1)-2
Amendment of agreement.
(a) An agreement entered into by a domestic corporation as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1 may be amended so as to be made applicable, in the same manner and under the same conditions, with respect to any one or more of the foreign subsidiaries of the domestic corporation not previously named in the agreement. See § 36.3121(l)(2)-1(b), relating to the effective period of an amendment of an agreement.
(b) Form 2032 Supplement is the form prescribed for use in amending an agreement entered into by a domestic corporation as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1.
(c) A domestic corporation shall signify its desire to amend an agreement entered into by the corporation as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1 by executing and filing Form 2032 Supplement in triplicate.
(d) Form 2032 Supplement shall be executed and filed in the manner and in conformity with the requirements prescribed in the instructions relating to such form and in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1(c) in respect of an agreement on Form 2032. Form 2032 Supplement executed and filed as provided in this paragraph shall be signed and dated by the district director or director of the service center, and, upon such signing, the Form 2032 Supplement so executed and filed will constitute an amendment of the agreement entered into on Form 2032. The Internal Revenue Service will return one copy of the amendment to the domestic corporation, will transmit one copy to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and will retain one copy (together with all related papers).

§ 36.3121(l)(1)-3
Effect of agreement.
(a)
Liability for amounts equivalent to tax
—(1)
In general.
A domestic corporation which has entered into an agreement (as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1, or any amendment thereof (as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-2, incurs liability under the agreement in respect of certain remuneration paid by each foreign subsidiary named in the agreement, or any amendment thereof. Liability is incurred in respect of the remuneration paid to all those employees of the foreign subsidiaries who are citizens of the United States and who perform services outside the United States (other than services which constitute
employment) for the foreign subsidiaries. However, liability is incurred only with respect to that portion of such remuneration paid by the foreign subsidiary which is attributable to services performed during the period for which the agreement is in effect with respect to such subsidiary, and then only to the extent that the remuneration would constitute wages if the services to which the remuneration is attributable were performed in the United States. Liability with respect to such remuneration is incurred in an amount equivalent to the sum of the employee and employer taxes which would be imposed by sections 3101 and 3111, respectively, if such remuneration constituted wages. If an individual performs services for more than one of the foreign subsidiaries named in an agreement, including any amendment thereof, such services are regarded as being performed in the employ of a single employer for purposes of determining the amount of the remuneration for such services which would constitute wages if the services were performed in the United States. See § 36.3121(l)(9)-1, relating to the treatment of a domestic corporation as a separate entity in its capacity as a party to an agreement.
(2)
Examples.
The application of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
P. a domestic corporation, has entered into an agreement as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1, effective with respect to services performed on and after January 1, 1955. Three foreign subsidiaries, S-1, S-2, and S-3 are named in the agreement. A, a citizen of the United States, is employed during 1955 by S-1, S-2, and S-3, for the performance outside the United States of services covered by the agreement. In 1955 A is paid remuneration of $2,500 for such services by each of the foreign subsidiaries. The circumstances are such that the entire $7,500 would constitute wages if the services has been performed in the United States. However, only $4,200 of such remuneration would constitute wages if the services had been performed in the United States for a single employer, and it is with respect to this amount only that P incurs liability under its agreement.

# Example 2.
On August 1, 1955, P, the domestic corporation in the preceding example, amends its agreement to include therein its foreign subsidiary S-4. The amendment is in effect with respect to S-4 for the period beginning with October 1, 1955. B, a citizen of the United States, is employed by S-4 throughout 1955 for the performance of services outside the United States. B is paid remuneration of $500 in each month of 1955 for these services. The circumstances are such that the first $4,200 of such remuneration would constitute wages if the services had been performed in the United States, and, except for the $4,200 limitation, the remainder of such remuneration would constitute wages if the services had been so performed. P incurs no liability with respect to remuneration paid B for services performed for S-4 prior to October 1, 1955. However, P incurs liability under its agreement with respect to the $1,500 paid B in October, November, and December 1955, for services performed in these months. Since the remuneration paid to B for services performed during the first nine months of 1955 is not covered by the agreement, such remuneration is not taken into account in computing the $4,200 limitation or the liability under the agreement.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example 2 except that B's services for S-4 during December 1955 are of a character which if performed within the United States would be excepted from employment. Accordingly, P incurs no liability under the agreement with respect to the $500.00 paid in December 1955 for such services.
(3)
Determination of liability.
The amount of the liability referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section incurred by a domestic corporation for any period shall be determined in the same manner as liability for the employee tax and for the employer tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act is determined, pursuant to regulations relating to the taxes under such act as in effect for the same period, with respect to wages paid by an employer to an employee.
(b)
Liability for amounts equivalent to interest or penalties.
A domestic corporation which has entered into an agreement as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1 also incurs liability under the agreement for amounts equivalent to the amount of interest, additions to the taxes, additional amounts, and penalties which would be applicable if the remuneration for services covered by the agreement constituted wages.
(c)
Deductions from employees' remuneration.
There is no obligation to deduct, or cause to be deducted, from the remuneration of any employee of a foreign subsidiary any part of the amount due from a domestic corporation under its agreement. Whether such deduction
shall be made is a matter for settlement between the employee and the domestic corporation or such other person as may be concerned.
(d)
Cross reference.
For other obligations of a domestic corporation under an agreement, see § 36.3121(l)(1)-1.
[T.D. 6145, 20 FR 6577, Sept. 8, 1955, as amended by T.D. 6390, 24 FR 4831, June 13, 1959]
§ 36.3121(l)(2)-1
Effective period of agreement.
(a)
In general.
An agreement entered into as provided in § 36.3121(l) (1)-1 shall be in effect for the period beginning with the first day of the calendar quarter in which the agreement is signed by the district director or director of the service center, or the first day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the agreement is signed by the district director or director of the service center, whichever is specified in the agreement. In no case, however, shall the agreement be effective for any calendar quarter which begins prior to January 1, 1955.
(b)
Amendment of agreement.
If an amendment on Form 2032 Supplement (filed by a domestic corporation to include in its agreement services performed for a foreign subsidiary not previously named therein) is signed by the district director or director of the service center, within the quarter for which the agreement is first effective or within the first calendar month following such quarter, the agreement shall be effective with respect to the subsidiary named in the amendment as of the date such agreement first became effective. However, if the amendment is signed by the district director or director of the service center after the last day of the fourth month for which the agreement is in effect, such agreement shall be in effect with respect to the subsidiary named in the amendment for the period beginning with the first day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the amendment is signed by the district director or director of the service center.

[T.D. 6145, 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7012, 34 FR 7694, May 15, 1969]
§ 36.3121(l)(4)-1
Termination of agreement by Commissioner.
(a)
Notice of termination.
The period for which an agreement entered into with a domestic corporation as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1 is in effect may be terminated by the Commissioner, with the prior concurrence of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, upon a finding by the Commissioner that the domestic corporation has failed to comply substantially with the terms of the agreement.

§ 36.3121(l)(5)-1
Effect of termination.
(a)
Termination of entire agreement.
(1) If the effective period of an agreement entered into by a domestic corporation as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1 is terminated by the domestic corporation, pursuant to § 36.3121(l)(3)-1(a), with respect to all foreign subsidiaries named in the agreement, including any amendment thereof, an agreement may not again be entered into by the domestic corporation under the provisions of section 3121(l)(1).
(2) If the effective period of an agreement entered into by a domestic corporation as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1 is terminated by the Commissioner, pursuant to § 36.3121(l)(4)-1 (a), an agreement may not again be entered into by the domestic corporation under the provisions of section 3121(l)(1).

(2) If the effective period of an agreement entered into by a domestic corporation as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1 is terminated automatically by reason of a change in stock ownership (see § 36.3121(l)(3)-1(b)) with respect to a foreign corporation which has ceased to be a foreign subsidiary of the domestic corporation, but the period for which the agreement is in effect continues with respect to one or more other foreign subsidiaries, the agreement may not thereafter be amended to include such foreign corporation even though the foreign corporation may again become a foreign subsidiary of the domestic corporation.
§ 36.3121(l)(7)-1
Overpayments and underpayments.
(a)
Adjustments
—(1)
In general.
Errors in the payment of amounts for which liability equivalent to the employee and employer taxes with respect to any payment of remuneration is incurred by a domestic corporation pursuant to its agreement are adjustable by the domestic corporation in certain cases without interest. However, not all corrections made under this section constitute adjustments within the meaning of the regulations in this part. The various situations in which such corrections constitute adjustments are set forth in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section. All corrections in respect of underpayments and all adjustments or credits in respect of overpayments made under this section must be reported on a return filed by the domestic corporation under the regulations in this part and not on a return filed with respect to the employee and employer taxes imposed by sections 3101 and 3111, respectively. Every return on which such a correction (by adjustment, credit, or otherwise) is reported pursuant to this section must have securely attached as a part thereof a statement explaining the error in respect of which the correction is made, designating the calendar quarter in which the error was ascertained, and setting forth such other information as
would be required if the correction were in respect of an overpayment or underpayment of taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. An error is ascertained when the domestic corporation has sufficient knowledge of the error to be able to correct it. An underpayment may not be corrected under this section after receipt from the district director or director of the service center of written notification of the amount due and demand for payment thereof, but the amount shall be paid in accordance with such notification.
(2)
Underpayments.
If a domestic corporation fails to report, on a return filed under the regulations in this part, all or any part of the amount for which liability equivalent to the employee and employer taxes is incurred under its agreement with respect to any payment of remuneration, the domestic corporation shall adjust the underpayment by reporting the additional amount due as an adjustment on a return or supplemental return filed on or before the last day on which the return for the return period in which the error is ascertained is required to be filed. The amount of each underpayment adjusted in accordance with this subparagraph shall be paid, without interest, at the time fixed for reporting the adjustment. If an adjustment is reported pursuant to this subparagraph but the amount thereof is not paid when due, interest thereafter accrues.
(3)
Overpayments.
If a domestic corporation pays more than the amount for which liability equivalent to the employee and employer taxes is incurred under its agreement with respect to any payment of remuneration, the domestic corporation may correct the error, subject to the requirements and under the conditions stated in this paragraph, by deducting the amount of the overpayment from the amount of liability reported on a return filed by the domestic corporation, except that—
(i) A correction may not be made in respect of any part of an overpayment which was collected from an individual by reason of the agreement unless the domestic corporation (a) has repaid the amount so collected to the individual, has secured the written receipt of the individual showing the date and amount of the repayment, and retains such receipt as a part of its records, or (b) has reimbursed the individual by reducing the amounts which otherwise should have been deducted from his remuneration by reason of the agreement; and
(ii) A correction may not be made in one calendar year in respect of any part of an overpayment which was collected from an individual in a prior calendar year unless the domestic corporation has secured the written statement of the individual showing that he has not claimed and will not claim refund or credit of the amount so collected, and retains such receipt as a part of its records. See § 31.6413(c)-1 of this chapter, relating to claims for special credit or refund.
The correction constitutes an adjustment under this subparagraph only if it is reported on the return for the period in which the error is ascertained or on the return for the next following period, and then only if the correction is reported within the statutory period of limitation upon refund or credit of overpayments of amounts due under the agreement. See paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section relating to such statutory period. A claim for credit or refund may be filed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section for any overpayment of an amount due under the agreement which is not adjusted under this subparagraph.
(b)
Errors not adjustable
—(1)
Underpayments.
If a domestic corporation fails to report all or any part of the amount for which liability equivalent to the employee and employer taxes is incurred under its agreement with respect to any payment of remuneration, and such underpayment is not reported as an adjustment within the time prescribed by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the amount of such underpayment shall be reported on the domestic corporation's next return, or shall be reported immediately on a supplemental return for the return period in which such payment of remuneration was made. The reporting of an underpayment under this subparagraph does not constitute an adjustment without interest.
(2)
Overpayments.
(i) If more than the correct amount due from a domestic corporation pursuant to its agreement (including the amount of any interest or addition) is paid and the amount of the overpayment is not adjusted under paragraph (a) (3) of this section, the domestic corporation may file a claim for refund or credit. Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, such claim shall be made in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as to allowance of the claim as would be the case if the claim were in respect of an overpayment of taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. Refund or credit of an amount erroneously paid by a domestic corporation under its agreement may be allowed only to the domestic corporation.
(ii) Any claim filed under this subparagraph shall be plainly marked “Claim under section 3121(1).”
(iii) No refund or credit of an overpayment of the amount due from a domestic corporation under its agreement will be allowed after the expiration of 2 years after the date of payment of such overpayment, except upon one or more of the grounds set forth in a claim filed prior to the expiration of such 2-year period.
(c)
Deductions from employees' remuneration.
If a domestic corporation deducts, or causes to be deducted, from the remuneration of an individual for services covered by the agreement amounts which are more or less than the employee tax which would be deductible therefrom if such remuneration constituted wages, any repayment to the individual (except to the extent otherwise provided in this section), or further collection from the individual, in respect of such deduction is a matter for settlement between the individual and the domestic corporation or such other person as may be concerned.
[T.D. 6145, 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7012, 34 FR 7694, May 15, 1969]
§ 36.3121(l)(8)-1
Definition of foreign subsidiary.
(a)
Prior to August 1, 1956.
(1) For the period January 1, 1955 to July 31, 1956, inclusive, a foreign corporation is a foreign subsidiary of a domestic corporation, within the meaning of the regulations in this part, if—
(i) More than 50 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation is owned by the domestic corporation; or
(ii) More than 50 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation is owned by a second foreign corporation and more than 50 percent of the voting stock of the second foreign corporation is owned by the domestic corporation.
(2) The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
P, a domestic corporation, owns 51 percent of the voting stock of S-1, a foreign corporation. S-1 owns 51 percent of the voting stock of S-2, a foreign corporation. S-2 owns 51 percent of the voting stock of S-3, a foreign corporation. S-1 and S-2 are foreign subsidiaries of P for purposes of the regulations in this part. Since neither P nor S-1 owns more than 50 percent of the voting stock of S-3, S-3 is not a foreign subsidiary of P within the meaning of the regulations in this part.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as those stated in example
1
except that 25 percent of the voting stock of S-2 is transferred by S-1 to P. P owns no other voting stock of S-2. Accordingly, after the transfer, P and S-1 together own more than 50 percent of the voting stock of S-2, but neither P nor S-1 alone owns more than 50 percent of such stock. S-2 ceases to be a foreign subsidiary of P when such transfer is effected.
(b)
On or after August 1, 1956.
(1) Beginning August 1, 1956, a foreign corporation is a foreign subsidiary of a domestic corporation, within the meaning of the regulations in this part, if—
(i) Not less than 20 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation is owned by the domestic corporation; or
(ii) More than 50 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation is owned by a second foreign corporation and not less than 20 percent of the voting stock of the second foreign corporation is owned by the domestic corporation.
(2) The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
P, a domestic corporation owns 20 percent of the voting stock of S-1, a foreign corporation. S-1 is, therefore, a foreign subsidiary of P. S-1 owns 51 percent and P owns 15 percent of the voting stock of S-2, a
foreign corporation. S-2 is also a foreign subsidiary of P, and this would be so even if P owned none of the voting stock of S-2. S-2 owns 51 percent, S-1 owns 39 percent, and P owns 10 percent of the voting stock of S-3, a foreign corporation. Since P owns less than 20 percent of the voting stock of S-2 and less than 20 percent of the voting stock of S-3, and since S-1 owns not more than 50 percent of the voting stock of S-3, S-3 is not a foreign subsidiary of P within the meaning of the regulations in this part.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as those stated in example
1
except that 4 percent of the voting stock of S-2 is transferred by S-1 to P. After, as well as before, the transfer of 66 percent of the voting stock of S-2 is owned by P and S-1 together. After the transfer, however, P owns less than 20 percent and S-1 owns not more than 50 percent of the voting stock of S-2. When such transfer is effected S-2 ceases to be a foreign subsidiary of P for purposes of the regulations in this part.
(c)
Transfer of stock ownership.
The transfer of the voting stock of a foreign corporation which is a foreign subsidiary of a domestic corporation within the meaning of section 3121(l)(8) will not affect the status of the foreign corporation as such a foreign subsidiary if at all times either of the percentage tests stated in section 3121(l)(8), relating to ownership of the voting stock of such foreign corporation, is met.
(d)
Meaning of “stock”.
The term “stock”, as used in the regulations in this part, has the meaning assigned by paragraph (7) of section 7701(a). Section 7701(a)(7) provides as follows:
Sec. 7701.
Definitions.
(a) When used in this title [Internal Revenue Code of 1954], where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof—
(7)
Stock.
The term “stock” includes shares in an association, joint-stock company, or insurance company.
[T.D. 6390, 24 FR 4831, June 13, 1959]
§ 36.3121(l)(9)-1
Domestic corporation as separate entity.
A domestic corporation which enters into an agreement as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1 shall, for purposes of the regulations in this part and for purposes of section 6413(c)(2)(C), relating to special credits or refunds, be considered an employer in its capacity as a party to such agreement separate and apart from its identity as an employer incurring liability for the employee tax and employer tax on the wages of its own employees. Thus, if a citizen of the United States performs services in employment for the domestic corporation and at any time within the same calendar year performs services covered by the agreement as an employee of one or more foreign subsidiaries named therein, the limitation on wages provided in section 3121(a) (1) has application separately as to the wages for employment performed in the employ of the domestic corporation and as to the remuneration for services covered by the agreement performed in the employ of such foreign subsidiary or subsidiaries. All services covered by the agreement whether performed in the employ of one or more than one such foreign subsidiary are regarded for purposes of the wage limitation as having been performed in the employ of the domestic corporation in its separate capacity as a party to the agreement. Similarly, any remuneration for such services which, if the services were performed in the United States, would be excluded from wages unless a certain amount of such remuneration is paid by a single employer within a specified period (for example, remuneration for agricultural labor) is regarded, for purposes of determining whether the domestic corporation incurs liability under its agreement with respect to such remuneration, as having been paid by the domestic corporation in its separate capacity as a party to the agreement. All remuneration received by an employee for services covered by the agreement is deemed, for purposes of the special credit or refund provisions contained in section 6413(c), to have been received from the domestic corporation as an employer in its separate capacity as a party to the agreement.
§ 36.3121(l)(10)-1
Requirements in respect of liability under agreement.
To the extent not inconsistent with, or otherwise provided in, the regulations in this part, the requirements and duties (relating to identification number, account numbers, wage information statements to employees, record keeping, etc.) imposed on an employer for any period with respect to
the taxes imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act are hereby made applicable to a domestic corporation with respect to its obligations and liabilities, for the same period, under an agreement entered into as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1.
§ 36.3121(l)(10)-2
Identification.
(a)
Domestic corporation.
A domestic corporation which has secured, or is required to secure, an identification number as an employer having in its employ one or more individuals in employment for wages is not required to secure an identification number under the regulations in this part.
(b)
Employees.
Every employee performing services covered by an agreement shall have the same duties in respect of an account number as would be the case if the employee were performing services in employment for the domestic corporation.
§ 36.3121(l)(10)-3
Returns.
(a) The forms prescribed for use in making returns of the taxes imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (except any forms particularly prescribed for use by household employers or by employers filing returns in Puerto Rico) shall be used by a domestic corporation in making returns of its liability under an agreement entered into as provided in § 36.3121(l)(1)-1. Returns of such liability shall be made separate and apart from any returns required of the domestic corporation in respect of the taxes imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. The domestic corporation shall plainly mark “3121(l) Agreement” at the top of each return, each detachable schedule thereof, and each paper or document constituting a part of the return, filed by the domestic corporation pursuant to the regulations in this part. Returns required under the regulations in this part shall be made by the domestic corporation as if all services covered by the agreement, whether performed in the employ of one or more than one foreign subsidiary, were performed in the employ of the domestic corporation as an employer in its separate capacity as a party to the agreement.
(b) Each return required under the regulations in this part must be filed on or before the last day of the month following the period for which the return is made.
[T.D. 6145, 20 FR 6577, Sept. 8, 1955, as amended by T.D. 6390, 24 FR 4832, June 13, 1959]
§ 36.3121(l)(10)-4
