The converting coowner may remove his or her name from the registration and transfer the bond to either the account of the non-converting coowner or to the account of a third party. The consent of the non-converting coowner is required. The transaction will not be conducted through the registered owner's TreasuryDirect account. The bond will be transferred in the single owner form of registration. Once the transfer is completed, the bond will be treated as a bond originally issued as a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect, and will be subject to subpart C of this part. The owner may then perform any transaction available for book-entry bonds purchased in the TreasuryDirect system.

§ 363.170
What transactions can I conduct in a savings bond that I converted on which I am not registered as the owner, either coowner, or owner with beneficiary?
The only transaction that you may conduct on a savings bond that you converted on which you are not registered as the owner, either coowner, or owner with beneficiary is to deliver the converted bond to the TreasuryDirect ® account of the registered owner.
§ 363.171
How do I redeem a converted savings bond?
(a)
Before final maturity
—(1)
Savings bond of any series registered in the single owner, owner with beneficiary, or entity form of registration.
You may redeem your converted savings bond of any series registered either in the single owner, owner with beneficiary, or entity form of registration any time prior to final maturity after the minimum holding period through your TreasuryDirect ® account.
(2)
Savings bond of any series registered in the coowner form of registration.
The converting coowner may redeem the converted savings bond of any series registered in the coowner form of registration at any time prior to final maturity after the minimum holding period through his or her TreasuryDirect account. The non-converting coowner may redeem the converted savings bond at any time prior to final maturity after the minimum holding period provided that he or she has been granted transaction rights in the converted bond by the converting coowner.
(b)
Upon final maturity
—(1)
Savings bond of any series registered in the single owner, owner with beneficiary, coowner, or entity forms of registration.
If you have not previously redeemed or transferred your converted savings bond of any series registered in the single owner, owner with beneficiary, coowner, or entity forms of registration, it will be automatically redeemed for you at final maturity.

# Subpart F—Marketable Treasury Securities

# Source:
70 FR 57444, Sept. 30, 2005, unless otherwise noted.
§ 363.200
What Treasury securities does this subpart govern?
This subpart provides the rules for holding marketable Treasury bills, notes, and bonds in book-entry form in TreasuryDirect ®.
§ 363.201
What other regulations govern book-entry marketable book-entry Treasury bills, notes, and bonds?
(a) 31 CFR part 356 governs the sale and issue of marketable book-entry Treasury securities on or after March 1, 1993, whether held in TreasuryDirect ®, Legacy Treasury Direct, or the commercial book-entry system.
(b) 31 CFR part 357 governs holding marketable book-entry Treasury bills, notes, and bonds in the Legacy Treasury Direct system and in the commercial book-entry system.
§ 363.202
What marketable Treasury securities may I purchase and hold through my TreasuryDirect ® account?
(a)
Purchase.
(1)
Advance purchase.
You may purchase any marketable Treasury security that is available for purchase through the TreasuryDirect ® website. One day each week, marketable securities that are scheduled for auction within 8 weeks will be made available on the TreasuryDirect website for scheduling an advance purchase, and are the only marketable securities that you can schedule for advance purchase.
(2)
Purchases scheduled prior to May 15, 2010, with an effective issue date on or after May 15, 2010.
(i) Any marketable security purchase scheduled prior to May 15, 2010, and with an effective issue date of May 15, 2010, through July 9, 2010, will be treated as a new purchase, even if the transaction would have been treated as a reinvestment under the rules in effect prior to May 15, 2010.
(ii) Any marketable security purchase scheduled prior to May 15, 2010, with an effective issue date after July 9, 2010, will be canceled.
(b)
Hold.
You may transfer into the system and maintain in your TreasuryDirect account any eligible marketable book-entry Treasury bill, note, or bond.
[70 FR 57444, Sept. 30, 2005, as amended at 75 FR 26090, May 11, 2010]
§ 363.203
After I purchase my marketable Treasury security in TreasuryDirect ®, is there a period of time during which I may not transfer the security?
Once you purchase a marketable Treasury security in TreasuryDirect, you may not transfer that security for a period of 45 calendar days after the issue date of the security, or the term of the security, whichever is less.
§ 363.204
What registrations are available for my marketable Treasury securities held in TreasuryDirect ®?
You may register your marketable Treasury securities in any form of registration permitted by § 363.20 of this part.
§ 363.205
How do I reinvest the proceeds of a maturing security held in TreasuryDirect ®?
(a)
Method for reinvesting a maturing security.
The only method of reinvesting a maturing marketable security in TreasuryDirect ® is through the automatic reinvestment option available in your TreasuryDirect account. Purchasing a security by directing that the proceeds of a maturing security be used to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness, and then scheduling the purchase of a new security
using the redemption proceeds of the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness, is not a reinvestment.
(b)
When a reinvestment can be scheduled, edited, or canceled.
You can schedule your reinvestment either at the time of purchase or after the security is issued into your TreasuryDirect account. You cannot schedule, edit, or cancel a reinvestment when the maturing security goes into a closed book period, or when a noncompetitive bid for the replacement security is no longer accepted, whichever comes first.
(c)
What securities can be reinvested.
Any marketable security can be reinvested.
(d)
Limits on scheduling reinvestments.
Reinvestments will be limited at any one time to 25 times for a 4-week bill, 7 times for a 13-week bill, 3 times for a 26-week bill, and once for all other marketable security types.
(e)
Canceling reinvestments.
If there is no security available for reinvestment with an issue date that coincides with the maturity date or call date, if invoked, of the maturing security, and with the same type and term, the scheduled reinvestment will be canceled and the proceeds of the maturing security will be returned to the customer.
(f)
Procedure if there are insufficient funds from the maturing security to pay the full purchase price of the replacement security.
If there are insufficient funds from the maturing security to pay the full purchase price of the replacement security, we will either debit your primary account at a financial institution or pay the additional funds using the redemption proceeds of your zero-percent certificate of indebtedness.
(1)
Debit from primary account at financial institution.
If the maturing security is purchased on or after May 15, 2010, we will pay the additional funds by a debit from your primary account at a financial institution if the maturing security was purchased within TreasuryDirect by a debit from a financial institution account or if the maturing security was received through a transfer. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from your primary account at a financial institution, the reinvestment will be canceled and we will refund the proceeds of the maturing security.
(2)
Withdrawal of funds from zero-percent certificate of indebtedness.
If the maturing security is purchased on or after May 15, 2010, we will pay the additional funds using the redemption proceeds of your zero-percent certificate of indebtedness if the purchase of the maturing security was made using the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness. If the amount available from a redemption of the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness is insufficient to pay the additional amount, the reinvestment will be canceled and we will refund the proceeds of the maturing security.
(3)
Special rules if the maturing security was purchased prior to May 15, 2010.
If the maturing security was purchased within TreasuryDirect or received through a transfer prior to May 15, 2010, we will debit your primary account at a financial institution for the additional funds. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from your primary account at a financial institution, the reinvestment will be canceled and we will refund the proceeds of the maturing security.
[75 FR 26090, May 11, 2010]
§ 363.206
How can I transfer my marketable Treasury security into my TreasuryDirect ® account from another book-entry system?
(a)
Legacy Treasury Direct to TreasuryDirect.
31 CFR part 357, subpart C, governs the transfer of a marketable book-entry Treasury security from your Legacy Treasury Direct account into TreasuryDirect.
(b)
Commercial book-entry system to TreasuryDirect.
You may transfer your marketable Treasury security from the commercial book-entry system by contacting the financial institution or broker that handles your commercial book-entry account.
(c)(1)
Individuals.
When a security is transferred into the TreasuryDirect account of an individual, it will be transferred in the name of the individual account owner in the single owner form of registration, regardless of the form of registration prior to the transfer. After the transfer is completed, you can change the registration to any
form of registration permitted by these regulations.
(2)
Entities.
When a security is transferred into the TreasuryDirect account of an entity, the security will be transferred in the name of the entity, regardless of the form of registration prior to the transfer.
(d)
Amounts transferred.
You can only transfer in increments of $1000.
[70 FR 57444, Sept. 30, 2005, as amended at 74 FR 19421, Apr. 29, 2009]
§ 363.207
Can I transfer my marketable Treasury security from my TreasuryDirect ® account to another TreasuryDirect account?
After the initial 45-calendar day holding period for your marketable Treasury security (see § 363.203) you can transfer your security to another TreasuryDirect account in increments of $1000.
§ 363.208
Can I transfer my marketable Treasury security from my TreasuryDirect ® account to an account in another book-entry system?
After the initial 45-calendar day holding period for your marketable Treasury security (see § 363.203) you can transfer your security to an account in the commercial book-entry system in increments of $1000.
[70 FR 57444, Sept. 30, 2005, as amended at 76 FR 18064, Apr. 1, 2011]
§ 363.209
[Reserved]
§ 363.210
Is there any period of time during which I will be unable to process certain transactions regarding my security?
A closed book period will be in effect for four business days prior to the date a marketable security interest and/or redemption payment is made. During the closed book period, you cannot change the registration of the security, change the payment destination of the proceeds, change the view or transaction rights, make transfers, or schedule, edit, or cancel a reinvestment. We will hold transactions requiring submission of a form for processing until the closed book period ends.

# Subpart A—General Information
§ 370.0
What does this part cover?
(a)
Scope.
This part applies to the transfer of funds by the Automated Clearing House method as used by us in connection with United States securities. This part also provides regulations for the electronic submission of transaction requests through us, except as varied by agreement or as otherwise provided. This part does not apply to transactions for the sale of United States Savings Bonds accomplished through savings bond issuing agents generally, except and to the extent we direct otherwise.
(b)
Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association and Regulations of the Financial Management Service.
The Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association generally apply to these transactions. However, the Operating Rules do not apply to the extent that the Operating Rules are preempted entirely and excluded specifically by application of Financial Management Service regulations in part 210 of this chapter. In the event of any inconsistencies between this part 370 and either the Operating Rules or part 210, this part 370 applies.
(c)
Regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.
To the extent that Regulation E (12 CFR part 205) and Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System apply to transactions authorized by this part, those Federal laws are unaffected by this part 370.
(d)
Variance by agreement.
The terms of this part may be varied by agreement.
§ 370.1
What special terms do I need to know to understand this part?
Automated Clearing House (ACH) entry
means a transaction in accordance with the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, as modified by these regulations and other law. The regulations in this part control in the event of any inconsistencies with the applicable Operating Rules.
Credit entry
means an ACH entry for the payment of money to a deposit account.
Debit entry
means an ACH entry for the collection of money from a deposit account.
Deposit account
means a demand deposit (checking), savings, or asset account (other than an occasional or incidental credit balance in a credit plan) held directly or indirectly by a financial institution.
Digital signature
means a type of electronic signature. A signer creates a digital signature by using public-key encryption to transform a message digest of an electronic message. If a recipient of the digital signature has an electronic message, message digest function, and the signer's public key, the recipient can verify:
(1) Whether the transformation was accomplished with the private key that corresponds to the signer's public key; and
(2) Whether the electronic message has been altered since the transformation was made.
Electronic message
means information that is stored in an electronic medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.
Electronic signature
means a signature of an electronic message that:
(1) Identifies and authenticates a particular person as the source of the electronic message; and
(2) Indicates such person's approval of the information contained in the electronic message.
Financial institution
means:
(1) Any insured bank as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813) or any bank that is eligible to make application to become an insured bank under section 5 of such Act (12 U.S.C. 1815);
(2) Any mutual savings bank as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813) or any bank that is eligible to make application to become an insured bank under section 5 of such Act (12 U.S.C. 1815);
(3) Any savings bank as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813) or any bank that is eligible to make application to become an insured bank under section 5 of such Act (12 U.S.C. 1815);
(4) Any insured credit union as defined in section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1752) or any credit union that is eligible to make application to become an insured credit union pursuant to section 201 of such Act (12 U.S.C. 1781);
(5) Any savings association as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813) that is an insured depository institution as defined in that act or is eligible to apply to become an insured depository institution under that act; and
(6) Any Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank as defined in section 1(b) of the International Banking Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3101).
Investor account
is our record of your
TreasuryDirect
holdings, including a list of your total security holdings, the exact form of registration of your account, your mailing address, your
TreasuryDirect
account number, your social security account number or employer identification number, and your deposit account instructions.
Message digest function
means an algorithm that transforms an electronic message into a seemingly unintelligible, generally smaller, result called the message digest. A message digest function has these qualities:
(1) The same electronic message yields the same message digest every time the algorithm is executed;
(2) It is computationally infeasible that an electronic message can be derived from the message digest result produced by the algorithm; and
(3) it is computationally infeasible that two electronic messages can be found that produce the same message digest using the algorithm.
Payment
means, for the purpose of this part, funds paid by us to you.
Person
means any natural person or organization.
Public-key encryption
means a cryptographic process which generates and employs a key pair, consisting of a public key and a different but mathematically related private key. One use of the public key is to verify a digital signature created by the private key.
Security
means an obligation offered by the Secretary of the Treasury.
Settlement date
means the date an exchange of funds with respect to an ACH entry is reflected on the books of the Federal Reserve Bank(s).
Signature
means any symbol or method executed or adopted by a person with present intention to be bound.
We (or “us”)
refers to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary's delegates at the Treasury Department and Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The term also extends to any fiscal or financial agent acting on behalf of the United States when designated to act by the Secretary or the Secretary's delegates. The term does not extend to United States Savings Bond issuing and paying agents.
You
means a deposit account owner, in subparts B and C, unless stated otherwise. The word “you” means a person who electronically submits transaction requests through us, in subpart D.

# Subpart B—Credit ACH Entries
§ 370.5
How can I appoint a financial institution to receive payments on my behalf?
You must name a financial institution to receive payments through credit entries using the ACH method. You also must identify the deposit account to which payments are to be made. To do this, you must use a form approved by us.
§ 370.6
What requirements apply to a financial institution that handles a credit entry?
A financial institution that accepts and handles a credit entry initiated by us agrees to the provisions of this subpart, and warrants that it will comply with all requirements imposed upon Receiving Depository Financial Institutions under the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, as modified by these regulations and other law.
§ 370.7
How can my financial institution change my designated deposit account?
If your financial institution requests us to make a change in your deposit account number or type of your account, we will change the information without requiring any confirmation from you. The request from the financial institution must be made following the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association. The financial institution's request will be deemed an agreement by the institution to indemnify us and you for any loss resulting from the requested change.
§ 370.8
Are there any requirements related to a prenotification entry?
(a)
Use of prenotification in our discretion.
In our discretion, we may initiate a prenotification entry to a financial institution before we send a credit entry. We may also send a prenotification message whenever there is a change in the payment instructions. If we send a prenotification message, we will follow the time frames as established by the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association. A prenotification is a zero-dollar ACH entry that can help us determine whether there might be problems with sending a subsequent credit entry.
(b)
Requirements placed upon financial institution that receives a prenotification.
A financial institution must respond to a prenotification within the time frame for such responses as established by the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association. If the receiving financial institution does not respond to the prenotification message within the specified time period, we may interpret the nonresponsiveness as the financial institution's agreement to this subpart. Furthermore, a financial institution warrants by its nonresponsiveness that the deposit account number and the type of account contained in the prenotification entry message was accurate as of the moment the financial institution received it.
§ 370.9
How can my payment instructions be changed?
Your payment instructions will continue to apply until either you or your financial institution requests us to make a change.
§ 370.10
What can cause my payments to be suspended?
(a)
Change in deposit account.
We will suspend payments if we receive notice that your deposit account has been closed, that someone named on your deposit account is dead or has been declared legally incompetent, that there is a change in the title of your deposit account that alters your interests; or, if a corporation is the owner, that it has been dissolved.
(b)
Change in status of owner.
We will suspend payments when we receive notice that an owner of a bond, security, or investor account is dead or has been declared legally incompetent, or in any case where we receive notice of a change in the name or status of an organization or representative named on a bond, security, or investor account.
(c)
Continuation of suspension.
Payments will continue to be suspended until we receive satisfactory evidence as to who is authorized or entitled to receive payments.
§ 370.11
What must my financial institution do when it receives a payment?
An institution which receives a payment on behalf of its customer must:
(a) Upon receipt, make the payment available to you on the payment date. If a scheduled payment date is not a business day for the Federal Reserve Bank of the district in which the institution is located, payment will be made on the next-succeeding business day. If the institution is unable to make a credit entry to the designated account, it must return the payment in accordance with the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association.
(b) Promptly notify us when your account has been closed, or when it is on notice of the death or legal incapacity of you or any other individual named on your account, or when it is on notice of the dissolution of a corporation in whose name the deposit account is held. The institution must return all payments received along with an explanation for the return.
§ 370.12
What happens if an error is made in a credit entry, or if a duplicate credit entry is made?
If we make an erroneous credit entry under this part, we will make a corrected credit entry to your account. We will then take action to recover the erroneous credit entry, or any duplicate credit entry, as follows:
(a)
Return of amount of erroneous or duplicate credit entry by financial institution.
We will send a notice to the financial institution to which the erroneous or duplicate credit entry was sent. When it receives this notice, the financial institution must immediately return to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank an amount equal to the credit entry. If the institution is unable to do this, the institution must immediately notify us, and provide any information that it has about the matter. We reserve the right to request the return of a partial amount of an erroneous or duplicate credit entry.
(b)
Collection of amount of unreturned erroneous or duplicate credit entry.
Where the erroneous or duplicate credit entry has not been returned, we will undertake any other actions that are appropriate. To the extent permitted by law, the collection action may include deducting the amount owed from future credit entries made to the deposit account to which the erroneous or duplicate credit entry was made.
(c)
Authorization of Debit to collect unreturned dulicate or erroneous credit entry.
If a financial institution has not responded within 60 calendar days of the notice, its acceptance of the credit entry will be considered an authorization for a debit in the amount of the entry. The debit will be made from the account maintained or utilized by the financial institution at the Federal Reserve Bank to which the entry was made. An institution designated by a financial institution to receive payment on its behalf, in permitting the usage, is deemed to have authorized a debit. The debit will be made from its account maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank to which the entry was made. The institution to which the
credit entry has been directed is deemed to have agreed to provide information and assistance to recover any erroneous or duplicate entry. You are also deemed to have agreed to provide information and assistance, and to take any action provided by law to recover an erroneous or duplicate credit entry.
§ 370.13
Can time limits for taking an action on a credit entry be extended?
If we or your financial institution are delayed beyond applicable time limits in taking any action with respect to a credit entry because of circumstances beyond our control, then the time for taking that action will be extended as necessary until the cause of the delay ends.
§ 370.14
Can substitute payment procedures be used?
We may use substitute payment procedures, instead of ACH, if we consider it to be necessary. Any such action is final.
§ 370.15
What limitations exist on liability?
(a) We may rely on the information provided by you or anyone else authorized to provide information concerning your financial institution or deposit account to which payments are to be made. We do not need to verify this information. We are not liable for any action we may take in reliance on the information furnished.
(b) Our liability does not extend beyond the amount of the payment due.
(c) When you name a financial institution to receive payments on your behalf, you are appointing that institution as your agent for the receipt of payments. When a credit entry is made to your financial institution for deposit to your account following your instructions, we no longer have any further responsibility for that payment. Where your financial institution has arranged with the Federal Reserve Bank to have payments made through another financial institution, the crediting of your payment to that institution relieves us of any further responsibility for that payment.

# Subpart C—Debit Entries
§ 370.20
What requirements apply if I want to authorize a debit entry to my deposit account?
(a)
General.
You may pay for a security and related fees by authorizing us to initiate one or more debit entries to your deposit account. For a purchase of a book-entry security to be held in an investor account maintained by us, you must be named on the investor account. The authorization must be accomplished only through forms or means approved by us.
(b)
Single-entry and recurring debit entries.
You only may authorize single-entry debits for purchases of book-entry securities held in
TreasuryDirect.
You only may authorize recurring debit entries for purchases of definitive savings bonds.
(c)
Credit entries to be made to same deposit account.
To the extent that payments by us with respect to a security are to be made through credit entries, you must receive debit and credit entries in the same deposit account.
(d)
Signature.
The authorization must have your signature and that of any other person whose signature is required to withdraw funds from the deposit account. We need not verify your identity or the authenticity of your signature.
§ 370.21
Are there any requirements related to a prenotification entry?
(a)
Use of prenotification in our discretion.
In our discretion, we may initiate a prenotification entry to a financial institution prior to sending a debit entry. A prenotification is a zero-dollar ACH entry that can help us determine whether there might be problems with sending a subsequent debit entry.
(b)
Requirements placed upon financial institution that receives a prenotification.
If sent, a financial institution must respond to a prenotification within the time frame for such responses as established by the National Automated Clearing House Association. If the receiving financial institution does not respond to the prenotification message within the specified time period, we may interpret the nonresponsiveness as the financial institution's agreement
to this subpart. Furthermore, a financial institution warrants by its nonresponsiveness that the deposit account number and the type of account contained in the prenotification entry message was accurate as of the moment the financial institution received it.
§ 370.22
What requirements apply to a financial institution that debits a deposit account?
A financial institution that debits a deposit account upon receiving a debit initiated by us agrees to the provisions of this subpart. A financial institution that does so also warrants that it has the authority to receive debit entries.
§ 370.23
What other requirements apply to a financial institution?
The financial institution warrants that it will comply with all requirements imposed upon Receiving Depository Financial Institutions under the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, as modified by these regulations and other law.
§ 370.24
What right does the Bureau of the Fiscal Service have to terminate or suspend debit entries?
We may terminate or suspend the availability of one or more debit entries in any case or class of cases, and may do so without notice at any time. A decision to terminate or suspend the availability of debit entries is in our sole discretion and is final.
§ 370.25
What rights do I have to terminate or suspend debit entries?
(a)
General.
If you are an investor account owner or deposit account owner, you generally may terminate or suspend one or more debit entries by notifying us orally or in writing at least three business days before the scheduled date of a transfer. In response to an oral notice, we may require you to give written notice, to be received by us within fourteen days of an oral notice. An oral notice ceases to be binding after fourteen days if you fail to provide the required written confirmation. A suspension will remain in effect for the duration you specify, but for no more than six months. The termination and suspension methods need not be recited in the authorization. These termination or suspension rights are in addition to those that you may have through your financial institution under Regulation E of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 205).
(b)
Exception.
If you submit a debit entry authorization in conjunction with a Treasury auction tender for the purchase of a book-entry security, you cannot terminate or suspend a debit entry after the auction closes.
§ 370.26
What limitations exist on liability?
If we sustain a loss because a financial institution fails to handle an entry in accordance with this part, the financial institution is liable to us for the loss, but not beyond the amount of the debit entry. In no instance does our liability extend beyond the amount of the debit entry.

# Subpart D—Electronic Submission of Transaction Requests Through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service
§ 370.35
Does the Bureau of the Fiscal Service accept all electronically signed transaction requests?
An electronic signature will not be accepted if it has not been accomplished through a method that has been approved for specific purposes by us.
§ 370.36
When does a transaction request become effective?
Except for auction bids of U.S. securities or unless otherwise agreed, a transaction request becomes effective at the moment we send a confirmation message. In no instance does a transaction request become effective before we actually receive the request.
§ 370.37
Where is the point of transaction for an electronically submitted transaction request?
For jurisdiction and venue purposes, the point of transaction for a transaction request handled pursuant to this subpart is Parkersburg, West Virginia, regardless of from where the transaction request is transmitted or where
the transaction request is actually processed.
§ 370.38
What is the legal effect of an electronic signature?
An electronic signature and any electronic message to which it is affixed or attached may not be denied legal effect, including legal effect as a signature, a writing, or an original, solely because the signature or record is in electronic form.
§ 370.39
To what extent is a digital signature admissible in any civil litigation or dispute?
In asserting a digital signature against you in any civil litigation or dispute, extrinsic evidence of authenticity as a condition precedent of admissibility (such as testimony about the scientific validity of digital signatures) is not necessary to establish:
(a) That a digital signature corresponds to a specific public key pair, and;
(b) That an electronic message to which the digital signature is affixed has not been altered from its original form.
§ 370.40
Can I be held accountable if my negligence contributes to a forged signature?
(a)
General.
If your failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributes to the submission of a forged signature, then you cannot claim that the signature is a forgery. However, we cannot invoke this section against you if we cannot first establish that we were reasonable in relying upon the signature. If we can do so, you bear the burden of production and the burden of persuasion in establishing your exercise of ordinary care. If you cannot do so, then you cannot claim that the signature is a forgery.
(b)
Exception.
This section has no application in any dispute involving a debit authorization or credit card transaction.
§ 370.41
What limitations exist on liability?
In no instance does our liability extend beyond the amount of the transaction.

# Subpart E—Additional Provisions
§ 370.45
What is the status of a security if the remittance cannot be collected?
If we cannot promptly collect all of the remittance for a security, we may in our discretion cancel the security unless it has been legally transferred for value to a third person who had no knowledge of the improper debit entry at the time of the transfer.
§ 370.46
Are there any situations in which the Bureau of the Fiscal Service may waive these regulations?
We reserve the right, in our discretion, to waive any provision of these regulations in any case or class of cases. We may do so if such action is not inconsistent with law and will not subject the United States to substantial expense or liability.
§ 370.47
To what extent may the Bureau of the Fiscal Service change these regulations?
Any aspect of this part may be changed at any time and without notice. You assume the risk that a change may terminate a provision that was to your advantage. Nothing in this part creates vested rights in your favor.

For the purposes of this part, we will refer to these outstanding obligations as “securities”.

# Subpart B—Offering, Certifications, and Delivery
§ 375.10
What is the purpose of the redemption operation announcement?
We provide public notice that we are redeeming Treasury securities by issuing a redemption operation announcement. This announcement lists the details of each proposed redemption operation, including the maximum redemption amount, the range of maturities of eligible securities, descriptions of the securities that fall within that maturity range, and the redemption operation and settlement dates. The redemption operation announcement and this part specify the terms and conditions of a redemption operation. If anything in the redemption operation announcement differs from anything in this part, the redemption operation announcement will apply. Accordingly, you should read the applicable redemption operation announcement along with this part.
§ 375.11
Who may participate in a redemption operation?
(a)
Submitters.
To be a submitter, you must be an institution that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has approved to conduct open market transactions with the Bank.

A person or entity other than a submitter may participate only if it arranges to have an offer or offers submitted on its behalf by a submitter.
§ 375.12
How do I submit an offer?
As a submitter, you must submit an offer in a tender to the Treasury via the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. You must submit any tenders in an approved format and the Bank must receive them prior to the closing time stated in the redemption operation announcement. If we do not receive your tenders timely, we will reject them. Your tenders are binding on you after the closing time specified in the redemption operation announcement. You are responsible for ensuring that we receive your tenders on time. We will not be responsible in any way for any unauthorized tender submissions or for any delays, errors, or omissions in submitting tenders.
§ 375.13
What requirements apply to offers?

(b)
Price format.
You must express offered prices in terms of price per $100 of par with three decimals, e.g., 102.172. The first two decimals represent fractional 32nds of a dollar. The third decimal represents eighths of a 32nd of a
dollar, and must be a 0, 2, 4, or 6. For example, an offer of 102.172 means one hundred two and seventeen 32nds and two eighths of a 32nd, or in decimals, 102.5390625.
(c)
Maximum number of offers.
There is no limit on the number of offers you may make for each eligible security. There is also no limit on the number of eligible securities you may offer.
§ 375.14
Do I have to make any certifications?
By submitting a tender offering a security or securities for sale, you certify that you are in compliance with this part and the redemption operation announcement.
§ 375.15
Who is responsible for delivering securities?
As a submitter, you are responsible for delivering any securities we accept in the redemption operation, including any securities for which you submitted offers on behalf of others. (See § 375.23.) All securities you deliver must be free and clear of all liens, charges, claims, and any other restrictions.

# Subpart C—Determination of Redemption Operation Results; Settlement

We will determine which offers or portions of offers to accept after the closing time for receipt of tenders. All such determinations will be final.
§ 375.21
When and how will the Treasury announce the redemption operation results?
We will make an official announcement of the redemption operation results through a press release. For each security we redeem, the press release will include such information as the amounts offered and accepted, the highest price accepted, and the remaining privately held amount outstanding.
§ 375.22
Will I receive confirmations and, if I am submitting offers for others, do I have to provide confirmations?
(a)
Confirmations to submitters.
We will provide a confirmation of acceptance or rejection in the form of a results message to submitters of offers by the close of the business day of the redemption operation.
(b)
Confirmation of customer offers.
If you submit a successful offer for a customer, you are responsible for notifying that customer of the impending redemption.
§ 375.23
How does the securities delivery process work?
If any of the offers you submitted are accepted, you must transfer the correct book-entry Treasury securities in the correct par amount against the correct settlement amount on the settlement date. You must deliver the securities to the account specified in the redemption operation announcement.

# Subpart D—Miscellaneous Provisions
§ 375.30
Does the Treasury have any discretion in this process?
(a) We have the discretion to:
(1) Accept or reject any offers or tenders submitted in a redemption operation;
(2) Redeem less than the amount of securities specified in the redemption operation announcement;
(3) Add to, change, or waive any provision of this part; or
(4) Change the terms and conditions of a redemption operation.
(b) Our decisions under this part are final. We will provide a public notice if we change any redemption operation provision, term or condition.
§ 375.31
What could happen if someone does not fully comply with the redemption operation rules or fails to deliver securities?
(a)
General.
If a person or entity fails to comply with any of the redemption operation rules in this part, we will consider the circumstances and take what we deem to be appropriate action. This could include barring the person or entity from participating in future redemption operations under this part and future auctions under 31 CFR part 356. We also may refer the matter to an appropriate regulatory agency.
(b)
Liquidated damages.
If you fail to deliver securities on time, we may require you to pay liquidated damages of up to 1% of your projected settlement amount.

# Source:
50 FR 6344, Feb. 15, 1985, unless otherwise noted.
§ 391.0
Scope of regulations.
These regulations apply to the waiver of late charges on claims due the Bureau of the Fiscal Service as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3717(h). They are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards on interest, administrative costs, and penalties prescribed jointly by the General Accounting Office and the Department of Justice and set forth in 4 CFR 102.13. The term “claim” as used in this part refers to an amount of money or property that has been determined to be owed to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service from any person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency. The term “late charges” as used in this part includes interest, administrative costs, and penalties. When applying the following regulations, a distinction shall be drawn between an adjustment and a waiver. An adjustment is an account correction under any circumstances where the Bureau records a claim or accrues late charges to which it is not legally entitled. An adjustment may be made without the promulgation of regulations. A waiver applies whenever the Bureau accrues late charges it is entitled to assess and later relinquishes that right. Two examples of an adjustment are: (a) Where the underlying claim is without merit, and (b) where the debtor is not notified of the claim as required by 31 U.S.C. 3717. The latter includes being misinformed as to the amount of the charges or the time of their commencement.
§ 391.1
General.
(a)
Waiver of late charges.
Late charges may be waived:
(1) When the underlying claim is compromised in accordance with 4 CFR part 103;
(2) Where the underlying claim is not compromised but it is appropriate to waive late charges under the criteria of 4 CFR part 103 relating to enforcement policy;
(3) When collection of the underlying claim is terminated in accordance with 4 CFR part 104;
(4) When a claim is suspended in accordance with 4 CFR part 104.
(5) Where the cost of collecting the unpaid late charges would approach or exceed the amount of unpaid late charges to be collected and the amount of late charges does not qualify for referral to a collection agency or the Department of Justice;
(6) Where the late charges pertain to claims involving savings bonds and notes arising under 31 U.S.C. 3105 and 3106 which are replaced pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3126;
(7) For reasons of equity or good conscience as provided in § 391.2.
(b)
Partial waiver.
Late charges may be waived in full or in part.
§ 391.2
Equitable considerations.
For reasons of equity and good conscience, late charges may be waived under the circumstances identified in this section.
(a) Where, without fault or bad faith, the debtor could not submit payment within 30 days of the interest accrual date, the mandatory waiver provision in 4 CFR 102.13(g) may be extended. Such waiver will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Examples include, but are not limited to:
(1) Postal service delays in forwarding the notice of indebtedness to a new address; and
(2) Late receipt of the notice of indebtedness where the debtor was away from home on an extended vacation or hospitalized.
(b) Where an installment plan is contemplated and the amount of the late charges in relation to the amount of reasonably affordable installment payments is so large that the debt may never be paid, late charges may be waived.
§ 391.3
Resolution of disputes.
(a) To avoid the accrual of additional late charges during the resolution of a dispute, a debtor has the option of paying the amount of the claim and filing a request for a refund together with a request for review of the claim.
(b) Where the claim is a result of the Bureau's administrative error, late charges accruing during the review period may be waived unless the Bureau's actions would have placed a reasonable person on notice that the Bureau erred and that the person should inquire further.
(c) Where the claim is a result of the debtor's error or negligence and the administrative review is unreasonably protracted, late charges accruing during the protracted portion of the review period may be waived.
(d) The period for administrative review begins on the date the request for review is received and ends 10 days after the final determination is mailed to the debtor. This paragraph shall not apply if the request for review is made in bad faith or for purposes of delay.
§ 391.4
Documentary evidence.
(a) When late charges are waived, the debtor's administrative file shall be properly documented with a memorandum. The memorandum shall contain a brief narrative statement describing the circumstances leading to the waiver and the reason(s) for granting the waiver.
(b) A credit report or a financial statement sworn to by the debtor may be required before waiver of late charges is approved for a compromise, suspension, or termination, except where the cost of obtaining such a report or statement exceeds the late charges due.
§ 391.5
Waiver approval.
Waivers of late charges shall be approved by the Commissioner of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service or designee, except that compromises and terminations of the underlying claim shall be upon the recommendation of the Chief Counsel in accordance with 31 CFR 5.3.

Such placing in custody shall be effected by immediate notification of the appropriate District Director of Customs of the seizure, together with a statement of the facts including a description of the vessel, vehicle, or aircraft, and the holding by the seizing officer of such vessel, vehicle, or aircraft subject to the instructions of the said district director of customs.
§ 401.3

With respect to every vessel, vehicle, and aircraft seized and placed in the custody of a district director of customs pursuant to the said act of August 9, 1939, and the regulations in this part, the appropriate officials of the Bureau of Customs are hereby authorized and designated as the officers who shall perform such administrative duties in connection with—
