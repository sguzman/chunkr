This subpart describes the actions you must take to reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) if you own or operate a facility that performs metal coil surface coating operations and is a major source of HAP. This subpart establishes emission standards and states what you must do to comply. Certain requirements apply to all who must comply with the subpart; others depend on the means you use to comply with an emission standard.
§ 63.5090
Does this subpart apply to me?
(a) The provisions of this subpart apply to each facility that is a major source of HAP, as defined in § 63.2, at which a coil coating line is operated, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section.
(b) This subpart does not apply to any coil coating line that meets the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) A coil coating line that is part of research or laboratory equipment.
(2) A coil coating line on which at least 85 percent of the metal coil coated, based on surface area, is less than 0.15 millimeter (0.006 inch) thick, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) If you operate a coating line subject to subpart JJJJ of this part that also meets the criteria in either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and you choose to comply with the requirements of this subpart, then such compliance constitutes compliance with subpart JJJJ. The coating line for which you choose this option is, therefore, included in the affected source for this subpart as defined in § 63.5110 and shall not be included in the affected source for subpart JJJJ as defined in § 63.3300.
(1) The coating line is used to coat metal coil of thicknesses both less than and greater than or equal to 0.15 millimeter (0.006 inch) thick, regardless of the percentage of surface area of each thickness coated.
(2) The coating line is used to coat only metal coil that is less than 0.15 millimeter (0.006 inch) thick and the coating line is controlled by a common control device that also receives organic HAP emissions from a coil coating line that is subject to the requirements of this subpart.
(d) Each coil coating line that does not comply with the provisions of this subpart because it meets the criteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that for any rolling 12-month period fails to meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(2) would from that point forward become subject to the provisions of this subpart. After becoming subject to the provisions of this subpart, the coil coating line would no longer be eligible to use the criteria of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, even if in subsequent 12-month periods at least 85 percent of the metal coil coated, based on surface
area, is less than 0.15 millimeter (0.006 inch) thick.
(e) This subpart does not apply to the application of incidental markings (including letters, numbers, or symbols) that are added to bare metal coils and that are used for only product identification or for product inventory control. The application of letters, numbers, or symbols to a coated metal coil is considered a coil coating process and part of the coil coating affected source.

Operate continuous emission monitors and perform a quarterly audit (§ 63.5150(a)(2)).
(a) To demonstrate continuing compliance with the standards, you must monitor and inspect each capture system and each control device required to comply with § 63.5120 following the date on which the initial performance test of the capture system and control device is completed. You must install and operate the monitoring equipment as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section. On and after August 24, 2020, you must also maintain the monitoring equipment at all times in accordance with § 63.5140(b) and keep the necessary parts readily available for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.
(1)
Bypass monitoring.
If you operate coil coating lines with intermittently-controllable work stations, you must follow at least one of the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section for each curing oven associated with these work stations to monitor
for potential bypass of the control device:
(i)
Flow control position indicator.
Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow control position indicator that provides a record indicating whether the exhaust stream from the curing oven is directed to the control device or is diverted from the control device. The time and flow control position must be recorded at least once per hour, as well as every time the flow direction is changed. The flow control position indicator must be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the exhaust stream away from the control device to the atmosphere.
(ii)
Car-seal or lock-and-key valve closures.
Secure any bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration when the control device is in operation; a visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism will be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve or damper is maintained in the closed position, and the exhaust stream is not diverted through the bypass line.
(iii)
Valve closure continuous monitoring.
Ensure that any bypass line valve or damper is in the closed position through continuous monitoring of valve position when the control device is in operation. The monitoring system must be inspected at least once every month to verify that the monitor will indicate valve position.
(iv)
Automatic shutdown system.
Use an automatic shutdown system in which the coil coating line is stopped when flow is diverted away from the control device to any bypass line when the control device is in operation. The automatic shutdown system must be inspected at least once every month to verify that it will detect diversions of flow and shut down operations.
(2)
Continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS).
If you are demonstrating continuous compliance with the standards in § 63.5120(a)(1) or (2) through continuous emission monitoring of a control device, you must install, calibrate, operate, and maintain continuous emission monitors to measure the total organic volatile matter concentration at both the control device inlet and outlet, and you must continuously monitor flow rate. If you are demonstrating continuous compliance with the outlet organic HAP concentration limit in § 63.5120(a)(3), you must install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a continuous emission monitor to measure the total organic volatile matter concentration at the control device outlet.
(i) All CEMS must comply with performance specification 8 or 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, as appropriate for the detection principle you choose. The requirements of 40 CFR part 60, procedure 1, appendix F must also be followed. In conducting the quarterly audits of the monitors as required by procedure 1, appendix F, you must use compounds representative of the gaseous emission stream being controlled.
(ii) As specified in § 63.8(c)(4)(ii), each CEMS and each flow rate monitor must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. Information which must be determined for recordkeeping purposes, as required by § 63.5190(a)(1)(i) includes:
(A) The hourly average of all recorded readings;
(B) The daily average of all recorded readings for each operating day; and
(C) The monthly average for each month during the semiannual reporting period.
(3)
Temperature monitoring of oxidizers.
If you are complying with the requirements of the standards in § 63.5120 through the use of an oxidizer and demonstrating continuous compliance through monitoring of an oxidizer operating parameter, you must comply with paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate temperature monitoring equipment according to manufacturer's specifications. The calibration of the chart recorder, data logger, or temperature indicator must be verified every 3 months; or the chart recorder, data logger, or temperature indicator must be replaced. You must replace the equipment either if you choose not to perform the calibration, or if the
equipment cannot be calibrated properly. Each temperature monitoring device must be equipped with a continuous recorder. The device must have an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being monitored in degrees Celsius, or ±1 °Celsius, whichever is greater.
(ii) For an oxidizer other than a catalytic oxidizer, to demonstrate continuous compliance with the operating limit established according to § 63.5160(d)(3)(i), you must install the thermocouple or temperature sensor in the combustion chamber at a location in the combustion zone.
(iii) For a catalytic oxidizer, if you are demonstrating continuous compliance with the operating limit established according to § 63.5160(d)(3)(ii)(A) and (B), then you must install the thermocouples or temperature sensors in the vent stream at the nearest feasible point to the inlet and outlet of the catalyst bed. Calculate the temperature difference across the catalyst. If you are demonstrating continuous compliance with the operating limit established according to § 63.5160(d)(3)(ii)(C) and (D), then you must install the thermocouple or temperature sensor in the vent stream at the nearest feasible point to the inlet of the catalyst bed.
(4)
Capture system monitoring.
If you are complying with the requirements of the standards in § 63.5120 through the use of a capture system and control device, you must develop a capture system monitoring plan containing the information specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section. You must monitor the capture system in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. You must make the monitoring plan available for inspection by the permitting authority upon request.
(i) The monitoring plan must identify the operating parameter to be monitored to ensure that the capture efficiency measured during compliance tests is maintained, explain why this parameter is appropriate for demonstrating ongoing compliance, and identify the specific monitoring procedures.
(ii) The plan also must specify operating limits at the capture system operating parameter value, or range of values, that demonstrates compliance with the standards in § 63.5120. The operating limits must represent the conditions indicative of proper operation and maintenance of the capture system.
(iii) You must conduct monitoring in accordance with the plan.
(b) If an operating parameter monitored in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section is out of the allowed range specified in Table 1 to this subpart it will be considered a deviation from the operating limit.

(1)
Method 311.
You may test the material in accordance with Method 311 of appendix A of this part. The Method 311 determination may be performed by the manufacturer of the material and the results provided to you. The organic HAP content must be calculated according to the criteria and procedures in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Count only those organic HAP in Table 3 to this subpart that are measured to be present at greater than or equal to 0.1 weight percent and greater than or equal to 1.0 weight percent for other organic HAP compounds.
(ii) Express the weight fraction of each organic HAP you count according to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.3791).
(iii) Calculate the total weight fraction of organic HAP in the tested material by summing the counted individual organic HAP weight fractions and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763).
(2)
Method 24 in appendix A-7 of part 60.
For coatings, you may determine the total volatile matter content as weight fraction of nonaqueous volatile matter and use it as a substitute for organic HAP, using Method 24 in appendix A-7 of part 60. As an alternative to using Method 24, you may use ASTM D2369-10 (2015), “Test Method for Volatile Content of Coatings” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). The determination of total volatile matter content using a method specified in this paragraph (b)(2) or as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be performed by the manufacturer of the coating and the results provided to you.

You must determine the density of each coating using ASTM D1475-13 “Standard Test Method for Density of Liquid Coatings, Inks, and Related Products” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) or ASTM D2111-10 (2015) “Standard Test Methods for Specific Gravity and Density of Halogenated Organic Solvents and Their Admixtures” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). The solids determination using ASTM D2697-03(2014) or ASTM D6093-97 (2016) and the density determination using ASTM D1475-13 or ASTM 2111-10 (2015) may be performed by the manufacturer of the material and the results provided to you. Alternatively, you may rely on formulation data provided by material providers to determine the volume solids. In the event of any inconsistency between test data obtained with the ASTM test methods specified in this section and formulation data, the test data will govern.
(d)
Control device destruction or removal efficiency.
If you are using an add-on control device, such as an oxidizer, to comply with the standard in § 63.5120, you must conduct performance tests according to Table 1 to § 63.5160 to establish the destruction or removal efficiency of the control device or the outlet HAP concentration achieved by the oxidizer, according to the methods and procedures in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. During performance tests, you must establish the operating limits required by § 63.5121 according to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(1) Performance tests conducted to determine the destruction or removal efficiency of the control device must be performed such that control device inlet and outlet testing is conducted simultaneously. To determine the outlet organic HAP concentration achieved by the oxidizer, only oxidizer outlet testing must be conducted. The data must be reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (ix).
(i) Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is used for sample and velocity traverses to determine sampling locations.

(iii) Method 3, 3A, or 3B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, used for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight. You may also use as an alternative to Method 3B, the manual method for measuring the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide content of exhaust gas, ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
(iv) Method 4 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is used to determine stack gas moisture.
(v) Methods for determining gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular weight, and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during each test run, as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of this section.
(vi) Method 25 or 25A in appendix A-7 of part 60 is used to determine total gaseous non-methane organic matter concentration. You may use Method 18 in appendix A-6 of part 60 to subtract methane emissions from measured total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon. Use the same test method for both the inlet and outlet measurements, which must be conducted simultaneously. You must submit notification of the intended test method to the Administrator for approval along with notification of the performance test required under § 63.7 (b). You must use Method 25A if any of the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(1)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section apply to the control device.
(A) The control device is not an oxidizer.
(B) The control device is an oxidizer, but an exhaust gas volatile organic matter concentration of 50 ppmv or less is required to comply with the standards in § 63.5120; or
(C) The control device is an oxidizer, but the volatile organic matter concentration at the inlet to the control system and the required level of control are such that they result in exhaust gas volatile organic matter concentrations of 50 ppmv or less; or
(D) The control device is an oxidizer, but because of the high efficiency of the control device, the anticipated volatile organic matter concentration at the control device exhaust is 50 ppmv or less, regardless of inlet concentration.
(vii) Each performance test must consist of three separate runs, except as provided by § 63.7(e)(3); each run must be conducted for at least 1 hour under the conditions that exist when the affected source is operating under normal operating conditions. For the purpose of determining volatile organic matter concentrations and mass flow rates, the average of the results of all runs will apply. If you are demonstrating compliance with the outlet organic HAP concentration limit in § 63.5120(a)(3), only the average outlet volatile organic matter concentration must be determined.

On and after August 24, 2020, you must conduct the performance test under representative operating conditions for the coating operation. Operations during periods of start-up, shutdown, or nonoperation do not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record
the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.

You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
(B) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the performance test. This average combustion temperature is the minimum operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.
(ii)
Catalytic oxidizer.
If your add-on control device is a catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) or paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section.

These are the minimum operating limits for your catalytic oxidizer.
(C) As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.

(iii)
Other types of control devices.
If you use a control device other than an oxidizer or a solvent recovery system for which you choose to comply by
means of a monthly liquid-liquid material balance, or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under § 63.8(f).

Capture efficiency.
If you are required to determine capture efficiency to meet the requirements of § 63.5170(e)(2), (f)(1) and (2), (g)(2) through (4), or (i)(2) and (3), you must determine capture efficiency using the procedures in paragraph (e)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, as applicable.
(1) For an enclosure that meets the criteria for a PTE, you may assume it achieves 100 percent capture efficiency. You must confirm that your capture system is a PTE by demonstrating that it meets the requirements of section 6 of EPA Method 204 of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M (or an EPA approved alternative method), and that all exhaust gases from the enclosure are delivered to a control device.
(2) You may determine capture efficiency, CE, according to the protocols for testing with temporary total enclosures that are specified in Method 204A through F of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M. You may exclude never-controlled work stations from such capture efficiency determinations.
(3) As an alternative to the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section, if you are required to conduct a capture efficiency test, you may use any capture efficiency protocol and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the Data Quality Objective or the Lower Confidence Limit approach as described in appendix A to subpart KK of this part. You may exclude never-controlled work stations from such capture efficiency determinations.

How do I demonstrate compliance with the standards?
You must include all coating materials (as defined in § 63.5110) used in the affected source when determining compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.5120. To make this determination, you must use at least one of the four compliance options listed in Table 1 of this section. You may apply any of the compliance options to an individual coil coating line, or to multiple lines as a group, or to the entire affected source. You may use different compliance options for different coil coating lines, or at different times on the same line. However, you may not use different compliance options at the same time on the same coil coating line. If you switch between compliance options for any coil coating line or group of lines, you must document this switch as required by § 63.5190(a), and you must report it in the next semiannual compliance report required in § 63.5180.

To assert a claim of EPA system outage, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) You must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems.
(2) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date that the submission is due.
(3) The outage may be planned or unplanned.
(4) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting.
(5) You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:
(i) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;
(ii) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage;
(iii) Measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(iv) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.
(6) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(7) In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.
(e) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. To assert a claim of force majeure, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (h)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) You may submit a claim if a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage).

# Standards
§ 63.5305
What emission standards must I meet?
The emission standards limit the number of pounds of HAP lost per square foot of leather processed. You must meet each emission limit in Table 1 of this subpart that applies to you.

# Compliance Requirements
§ 63.5320
How does my affected major source comply with the HAP emission standards?
(a) All affected sources must be in compliance with the requirements of this subpart at all times.
(b) At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the affected source.
(c) You must perform all of the items listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (10) of this section:
(1) Submit the necessary notifications in accordance with § 63.5415.
(2) Develop and implement a plan for demonstrating compliance in accordance with § 63.5325.
(3) Submit the necessary reports in accordance with § 63.5420.
(4) Keep a finish inventory log, as specified at § 63.5335(b), to record monthly the pounds of each type of finish applied for each leather product process operation and the mass fraction of HAP in each applied finish. You may be required to start recordkeeping
prior to the compliance dates specified at § 63.5295.
(5) Keep an inventory log, as specified at § 63.5430(f), to record monthly the surface area of leather processed in 1,000's of square feet for each product process operation. You may be required to start recordkeeping prior to the compliance dates specified at § 63.5295.
(6) Determine the actual HAP loss from your affected source in accordance with § 63.5335.
(7) Determine the allowable HAP loss for your affected source in accordance with § 63.5340.
(8) Determine the compliance ratio for your affected source each month as specified at § 63.5330. The compliance ratio compares your actual HAP loss to your allowable HAP loss for the previous 12 months.
(9) Maintain the compliance ratio for your affected source at or below 1.00 in accordance with § 63.5330.
(10) Maintain all the necessary records you have used to demonstrate compliance with this subpart in accordance with § 63.5430.
[67 FR 9162, Feb. 27, 2002, as amended at 84 FR 3320, Feb. 12, 2019]
§ 63.5325
What is a plan for demonstrating compliance and when must I have one in place?
(a) You must develop and implement a written plan for demonstrating compliance that provides the detailed procedures you will follow to monitor and record data necessary for demonstrating compliance with this subpart. Procedures followed for quantifying HAP loss from the source and amount of leather processed vary from source to source because of site-specific factors such as equipment design characteristics and operating conditions. Typical procedures include one or more accurate measurement methods such as weigh scales and volumetric displacement. Because the industry does not have a uniform set of procedures, you must develop and implement your own site-specific plan for demonstrating compliance not later than the compliance date for your source. You must also incorporate the plan for demonstrating compliance by reference in the source's title V permit. The plan for demonstrating compliance must include the items listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section:
(1) The name and address of the owner or operator.
(2) The physical address of the leather finishing operation.
(3) Provide a detailed description of all methods of measurement your source will use to determine your finish usage, HAP content of each finish, quantity of leather processed, and leather product process operation type.
(4) Specify when each measurement will be made.
(5) Provide examples of each calculation you will use to determine your compliance status. Include examples of how you will convert data measured with one parameter to other terms for use in compliance determination.
(6) Provide example logs of how data will be recorded.
(7) Provide a quality assurance/quality control plan to ensure that the data continue to meet compliance demonstration needs.
(b) You may be required to revise your plan for demonstrating compliance. We may require reasonable revisions if the procedures lack detail, are inconsistent, or do not accurately determine finish usage, HAP content of each finish, quantity of leather processed, or leather product process operation type.
§ 63.5330
How do I determine the compliance ratio?
(a) When your source has processed leather for 12 months, you must determine the compliance ratio for your affected source by the fifteenth of each month for the previous 12 months.
(b) You must determine the compliance ratio using Equation 1 of this section as follows:
ER27FE02.003
Where:
Actual HAP Loss = Pounds of actual HAP loss for the previous 12 months, as determined in § 63.5335.
Allowable HAP Loss = Pounds of allowable HAP loss for the previous 12 months, as determined in § 63.5340.
(1) If the value of the compliance ratio is less than or equal to 1.00, your affected source was in compliance with the applicable HAP emission limits of this subpart for the previous month.
(2) If the value of the compliance ratio is greater than 1.00, your affected source was deviating from compliance with the applicable HAP emission limits of this subpart for the previous month.
§ 63.5335
How do I determine the actual HAP loss?
(a) This section describes the information and procedures you must use to determine the actual HAP loss from your leather finishing operation. By the fifteenth of each month, you must determine the actual HAP loss in pounds from your leather finishing operation for the previous month.
(b) Use one of the procedures listed in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section for determining the actual HAP loss from your affected sources. Regardless of which procedure is used to determine HAP loss, each source is still required to maintain a written or printed log that documents the total quantity of solvents/finishes used each month in the process and the mass fraction of HAP in each solvent/finish.
(1)
Measure Finish as Applied.
Use a finish inventory log to record the pounds of each type of finish applied for each leather product process operation and the mass fraction of HAP in each applied finish. Figure 1 of this subpart shows an example log for recording the minimum information necessary to determine your finish usage and HAP loss. The finish inventory log must contain, at a minimum, the information for each type of finish applied listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section:
(i) Finish type;
(ii) Pounds (or density and volume) of each finish applied to the leather;
(iii) Mass fraction of HAP in each applied finish;
(iv) Date of the recorded entry;
(v) Time of the recorded entry;
(vi) Name of the person recording the entry;
(vii) Product process operation type.
(2)
Chemical Inventory Mass Balance.
Determine the actual monthly HAP loss from your affected source through mass balance calculations. You must follow your detailed mass balance procedures and calculations in your plan for demonstrating compliance in accordance with § 63.5325. The HAP mass balance must be based on a detailed inventory of stored chemicals at the beginning and end of each month, and business purchasing records to indicate additions to the inventory of chemical supplies. The net loss of chemicals used for finish applications is determined by subtracting the end of the month chemical inventory from the beginning of the month chemical inventory and adding the quantities of all chemicals purchased during the same 1-month period. In situations when an excess amount of finish is formulated, you must have documented procedures on how the excess amount is accounted for in the mass balance.
(c) To determine the pounds of HAP loss for the previous month, you must first determine the pounds of HAP loss from each finish application according to paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) For facilities not using add-on emission control devices, the entire HAP content of the finishes are assumed to be released to the environment. Using the finish inventory log, multiply the pounds of each recorded finish usage by the corresponding mass fraction of HAP in the finish. The result is the HAP loss in pounds from
each finish application. Sum the pounds of HAP loss from all finish applications recorded during the previous month to determine the total monthly HAP loss in pounds from your finishing operation.
(2) For facilities using add-on emission control devices, the finish inventory log and the emission reduction efficiency of the add-on capture and control devices can be used to determine the net HAP loss in pounds. The emission reduction efficiency for a control device must be determined from a performance test conducted in accordance with §§ 63.5375 and 63.5380. Using the finish inventory log, multiply the pounds of each recorded finish usage by the corresponding mass fraction of HAP in the finish. The result is the gross HAP loss in pounds from each finish application prior to the add-on control device. Multiply the gross HAP loss by the percent emission reduction achieved by the add-on control device and then subtract this amount from the gross HAP loss. The result is the net HAP loss in pounds from each finish application. Sum the pounds of net HAP loss from all finish applications recorded during the previous month to determine the total monthly net HAP loss in pounds from your finishing operation.
(d) After collecting HAP loss data for 12 months, you must also determine by the fifteenth of each month the annual HAP loss in pounds by summing the monthly HAP losses for the previous 12 months. The annual HAP loss is the “actual HAP loss,” which is used in Equation 1 of § 63.5330 to calculate your compliance ratio, as described in § 63.5330.
[67 FR 9162, Feb. 27, 2002, as amended at 70 FR 6360, Feb. 7, 2005]
§ 63.5340
How do I determine the allowable HAP loss?
(a) By the fifteenth of each month, you must determine the allowable HAP loss in pounds from your leather finishing operation for the previous month.
(b) To determine the allowable HAP loss for your leather finishing operation, you must select the appropriate HAP emission limit, expressed in pounds of HAP loss per 1,000 square feet of leather processed, from Table 1 of this subpart, for each type of leather product process operation performed during the previous 12 months. Under the appropriate existing or new source column, select the HAP emission limit that corresponds to each type of product process operation performed during the previous 12 months. Next, determine the annual total of leather processed in 1,000's of square feet for each product process operation in accordance with § 63.5400. Then, multiply the annual total of leather processed in each product process operation by the corresponding HAP emission limit to determine the allowable HAP loss in pounds for the corresponding leather product process operation. Finally, sum the pounds of HAP loss from all leather product process operations performed in the previous 12 months. Equation 1 of this section illustrates the calculation of allowable HAP loss as follows:
ER27FE02.004
Where:
Annual Total of Leather Processed = 1,000's of square feet of leather processed in the previous 12 months in product process operation “i”.
HAP Emission Limit = From Table 1 of this subpart, the HAP emission limit in pounds of HAP loss per 1,000 square feet of leather processed for product process operation “i”.
n = Number of leather product process operation types performed during the previous 12 months.
(c) The resulting “allowable HAP loss” is used in Equation 1 of § 63.5330
to calculate your compliance ratio, as described in § 63.5330.
§ 63.5345
How do I distinguish between the two upholstery product process operations?
(a) Product process operations that finish leather for use in automobile and furniture seat coverings are categorized as an upholstery product process operation. There are two upholstery product process operations subject to the requirements of this subpart—operations with less than 4 grams of finish add-on per square foot, and operations with 4 grams or more of finish add-on per square foot. You must distinguish between the two upholstery product process operations so that you can determine which HAP emission limit in Table 1 of this subpart applies to your affected source.
(b) You must determine finish add-on by calculating the difference in mass before and after the finishing process. You may use an empirical method to determine the amount of finish add-on applied during the finishing process, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section:
(1) Weigh a one square foot representative section of polyester film, paper, cardstock, or equivalent material substrate to be finished. This will provide an initial mass and surface area prior to starting the finishing process.
(2) Use a scale with an accuracy of at least 5 percent of the mass in grams of the representative section of substrate.
(3) Upon completion of these measurements, process the representative section of substrate on the finishing line as you would for a typical section of leather.
(4) After the finishing and drying process, weigh the representative section of substrate to determine the final mass. Divide the net mass in grams gained on the representative section by its surface area in square feet to determine grams per square foot of finish add-on. Equation 1 of this section illustrates this calculation, as follows:
ER27FE02.005
Where:
Finish Add-On = Grams per square foot of finish add-on applied to a representative section of polyester film or equivalent material substrate.
Final Mass = Final mass in grams of representative section of polyester film or equivalent material substrate, after finishing and drying.
Initial Mass = Initial mass in grams of representative section of polyester film or equivalent material substrate, prior to finishing.
Surface Area = Surface area in square feet of a representative section of polyester film or equivalent material substrate.
(c) Any appropriate engineering units may be used for determining the finish add-on. However, finish add-on results must be converted to the units of grams of finish add-on per square foot of leather processed. If multiple representative leather sections are analyzed, then use the average of these measurements for selecting the appropriate product process operation.
(d) For each leather product with a unique finish application, you must maintain records to support how the leather product was categorized to a product process operations type. You must repeat the leather product categorization to a product process operation type no less frequently than once every 5 years if the applied finish chemical characteristics of the leather product have not changed, or when the applied finish chemical characteristics of the leather product change, whichever is sooner.
[67 FR 9162, Feb. 27, 2002, as amended at 70 FR 6360, Feb. 7, 2005]
§ 63.5350
How do I distinguish between the water-resistant/specialty and nonwater-resistant leather product process operations?
(a) Product process operations that finish leather for nonupholstery use are categorized as either water-resistant/specialty or nonwater-resistant product process operations. You must distinguish between the water-resistant/specialty and nonwater-resistant product process operations so that you can determine which HAP emission limit in Table 1 of this subpart applies to your affected source. Water-resistant and nonwater-resistant product process operations for nonupholstery use can be distinguished using the methods described in paragraph (b) of this section. Specialty leather product process operations for nonupholstery use can be distinguished using the criteria described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b) To determine whether your product process operation produces water-resistant or nonwater-resistant leather, you must conduct the Maeser Flexes test method according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Designation D2099-00 (incorporated by reference-see § 63.14) or a method approved by the Administrator.
(1) Statistical analysis of initial water penetration data performed to support ASTM Designation D2099-00 indicates that poor quantitative precision is associated with this testing method. Therefore, at a minimum, 36 leather substrate samples (
i.e.,
three sections of leather substrate from at least 12 sides of leather), must be tested to determine the water-resistant characteristics of the leather. You must average the results of these tests to determine the final number of Maeser Flexes prior to initial water penetration.
(2) Results from leather samples indicating an average of 5,000 Maeser Flexes or more is considered a water-resistant product process operation, and results indicating less than 5,000 Maeser Flexes is considered a nonwater-resistant product process operation. However, leather samples resulting in less than 5,000 Maeser Flexes may be categorized as specialty leather in paragraph (c) of this section.
(3) For each leather product with a unique finish application, you must maintain records to support how the leather product was categorized to a product process operations type. You must repeat the leather product categorization to a product process operation type no less frequently than once every 5 years if the applied finish chemical characteristics of the leather product have not changed, or when the applied finish chemical characteristics of the leather product do change, whichever is sooner.
(c) To determine whether your product process operation produces specialty leather, you must meet the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2), or (c)(3) of this section:
(1) The leather must be a select grade of chrome tanned, bark retanned, or fat liquored leather.
(2) The leather must be retanned through the application of grease, waxes, and oil in quantities greater than 12 percent of the dry leather weight. Specialty leather is also finished with higher solvent-based finishes that provide rich color, luster, or an oily/tacky feel. Specialty leather products may include, but are not limited to, specialty shoe leather and top grade football leathers.
(3) The leather must be a high-quality dress or performance shoe leather that can withstand one of the visual tests in paragraph (c)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section:
(i) Moisture injection into the leather using vacuum mulling without signs of blistering.
(ii) Prolonged ironing at 200 °F for smoothing out surface roughness without finish lift off.
(4) For each leather product with a unique finish application, you must maintain records to support how the leather product was categorized to a product process operations type. You must repeat the leather product categorization to a product process operation type no less frequently than once every 5 years if the applied finish chemical characteristics of the leather product have not changed, or when the applied finish chemical characteristics
of the leather product do change, whichever is sooner.

§ 63.5355
How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?
(a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section.
(b) You must collect data at all required intervals as specified in your plan for demonstrating compliance as specified at § 63.5325.
(c) For emission control devices, except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must monitor continuously (or collect data at all required intervals) at all times that the affected source is operating.
(d) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities in data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating levels, nor may such data be used in fulfilling a minimum data availability requirement, if applicable. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the compliance ratio, and, if an emission control device is used, in assessing the operation of the control device.
§ 63.5360
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission standards?
(a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission standards in § 63.5305 by following the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section:
(1) You must collect and monitor data according to the procedures in your plan for demonstrating compliance as specified in § 63.5325.
(2) If you use an emission control device, you must comply with § 63.982(a)(2) (subpart SS of this part) and collect the monitoring data as specified therein.
(3) You must maintain your compliance ratio less than or equal to 1.00, as specified at § 63.5330.
(b) You must report each instance in which you did not meet the emission standards in § 63.5305. These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in § 63.5420(b).
(c) You must conduct the initial compliance demonstration before the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.5295.

# Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements
§ 63.5375
When must I conduct a performance test or initial compliance demonstration?
You must conduct performance tests after the installation of any emission control device that reduces HAP emissions and will be used to comply with the HAP emission requirements of this subpart. You must complete your performance tests not later than 60 calendar days before the end of the 12-month period used in the initial compliance determination.
[84 FR 3321, Feb. 12, 2019]
§ 63.5380
How do I conduct performance tests?
(a) Each performance test must be conducted according to the requirements in § 63.7(e)(2) through (4) and the procedures of § 63.997(e)(1) and (2).
(b) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(c) You must conduct three separate test runs for each performance test required in this section, as specified in § 63.7(e)(3). Each test run must last at least 1 hour.

§ 63.5385
How do I measure the quantity of finish applied to the leather?
(a) To determine the amount of finish applied to the leather, you must measure the mass, or density, and volume of each applied finish.
(b) Determine the mass of each applied finish with a scale calibrated to an accuracy of at least 5 percent of the amount measured. The quantity of all finishes used for finishing operations must be weighed or have a predetermined weight.
(c) Determine the density and volume of each applied finish according to the criteria listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section:
(1) Determine the density of each applied finish in pounds per gallon in accordance with § 63.5395. The finish density will be used to convert applied finish volumes from gallons into mass units of pounds.
(2) Volume measurements of each applied finish can be obtained with a flow measurement device. For each flow measurement device, you must perform the items listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (v) of this section:
(i) Locate the flow sensor and other necessary equipment such as straightening vanes in or as close to a position that provides a representative flow.
(ii) Use a flow sensor with a minimum tolerance of 2 percent of the flow rate.
(iii) Reduce swirling flow or abnormal velocity distributions due to upstream and downstream disturbances.
(iv) Conduct a flow sensor calibration check at least semiannually.
(v) At least monthly, inspect all components for integrity, all electrical connections for continuity, and all mechanical connections for leakage.
(3) Volume measurements of each applied finish can be obtained with a calibrated volumetric container with an accuracy of at least 5 percent of the amount measured.
§ 63.5390
How do I measure the HAP content of a finish?
(a) To determine the HAP content of a finish, the reference method is EPA Method 311 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63. You may use EPA Method 311, an alternative method approved by the Administrator, or any other reasonable means for determining the HAP content. Other reasonable means of determining HAP content include, but are not limited to, a material safety data sheet (MSDS) or a manufacturer's hazardous air pollutant data sheet. If the HAP content is provided on a MSDS or a manufacturer's data sheet as a range of values, then the highest HAP value of the range must be used for the determination of compliance to this standard. This value must be entered on the finish log for each type of finish applied. You are not required to test the materials that you use, but the Administrator may require a test using EPA Method 311 (or another approved method) to confirm the reported HAP content. However, if the results of an analysis by EPA Method 311 are different from the HAP content determined by another means, the EPA Method 311 results will govern compliance determinations.
(b) You may use the weighted average of the HAP content analysis as determined in paragraph (a) of this section for each finish when you perform one of the actions listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:
(1) Mix your own finishes on site.
(2) Mix new quantities of finish with previous quantities of finish that may have a different HAP content.
§ 63.5395
How do I measure the density of a finish?
(a) To determine the density of a finish, the reference method is EPA Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. You may use EPA Method 24, an alternative method approved by the Administrator, or any other reasonable means for determining the density of a finish. Other reasonable means of determining density include, but are not limited to, an MSDS or a manufacturer's hazardous air pollutant data sheet. If the density is provided on a MSDS or a manufacturer's data sheet as a range of values, then the highest density
value of the range must be used for the determination of compliance to this standard. This value must be entered on the finish log for each type of finish applied. You are not required to test the materials that you use, but the Administrator may require a test using EPA Method 24 (or another approved method) to confirm the reported density. However, if the results of an analysis by EPA Method 24 are different from the density determined by another means, the EPA Method 24 results will govern compliance determinations.
(b) You may use the weighted average of finish densities as determined in paragraph (a) of this section for each finish when you perform one of the actions listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:
(1) Mix your own finishes on site.
(2) Mix new quantities of finish with previous quantities of finish that may have different densities.
(c) Equation 1 of this section may be used to determine the weighted average of finish densities, as follows:
ER27FE02.006
Where:
Average Weighted Density = The average weighted density of applied finishes in pounds per gallon.
Mass = Pounds of finish “i” applied.
Density = The density of finish “i” in pounds per gallon.
n = Number of finish types applied.
§ 63.5400
How do I measure the quantity of leather processed?
(a) This section describes the information and procedures you must use to determine the quantity of leather processed at your affected source.
(1) To determine the surface area (i.e., quantity) of leather substrate processed each month at your source for each product process operation, follow the procedures in your plan for demonstrating compliance. You must consistently measure the surface area of processed leather substrate at one of the manufacturing locations listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section:
(i) Measure the surface area of processed leather upon exiting the leather finishing operation.
(ii) Measure the surface area of processed leather upon shipment from the source.
(2) By the fifteenth of each month, you must determine the quantity of leather processed in 1,000's of square feet for each product process operation during the previous month. After collecting data on the amount of leather processed for 12 months, you must also determine by the fifteenth of each month the annual total of leather processed in 1,000's of square feet for each product process operation by summing the monthly quantities of leather processed in each product process operation for the previous 12 months. The “annual total of leather processed” in each product process operation is used in Equation 1 of § 63.5340 to calculate your allowable HAP loss as described in § 63.5340. Your allowable HAP loss is then subsequently used to calculate your compliance ratio as described in § 63.5330.
(b) To determine the surface area of leather processed at your source for each product process operation, you must use one of the methods listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:

) at the time of the test, you must submit the results of the performance test to the EPA via the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI). The CEDRI Interface can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
). Performance test data must be submitted in a file format generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file format consistent with the extensible markup language (XML) schema listed on the EPA's ERT website.
(2) For data collected using test methods that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT website at the time of the test, you must submit the results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13
unless the Administrator agrees to or specifies an alternate reporting method.
(3) If you claim that some of the performance test information being submitted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is confidential business information (CBI), you must submit a complete file generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT website, including information claimed to be CBI, on a compact disc, flash drive or other commonly used electronic storage medium to the EPA. The electronic medium must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAQPS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT or alternate file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(4) If you are required to electronically submit a report through the CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, and due to a planned or actual outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the submission is due, you will be or are precluded from accessing CEDRI or CDX and submitting a required report within the time prescribed, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying the date, time and length of the outage; a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved. The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(5) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX and a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date the submission is due, the owner or operator may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage). If you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs. The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting
deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.

§ 63.5460
What definitions apply to this subpart?
Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, § 63.2, and in this section as follows:
Area source
means any stationary source of hazardous air pollutants that is not a major source as defined in this part.
Compliance ratio
means the ratio of the actual HAP loss from the previous 12 months to the allowable HAP loss from the previous 12 months. Equation 1 in § 63.5330 is used to calculate this value. If the value is less than or equal to 1.00, the source is in compliance. If the value is greater than 1.00, the source is deviating from compliance.
Deviation
means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including, but not limited to, any emission limits or work practice standards.
Drying
means the process of removing all but equilibrium moisture from the leather. Drying methods currently in use include: toggling, hanging, pasting, and vacuum drying.
Finish add-on
means the amount of solid material deposited on the leather substrate due to finishing operations. Typically, the solid deposition is a dye or other chemical used to enhance the color and performance of the leather. Finish add-on is quantified as mass per surface area of substrate, such as grams of finish add-on per square foot of leather substrate.
Hazardous air pollutants (HAP)
means any substance or mixture of substances listed as a hazardous air pollutant
under section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act.
Leather
means the pelt or hide of an animal which has been transformed by a tanning process into a nonputrescible and useful material.
Leather finishing
means a single process or group of processes used to adjust and improve the physical and aesthetic characteristics of the leather surface through the multistage application of a coating comprised of dyes, pigments, film-forming materials, and performance modifiers dissolved or suspended in liquid carriers.
Leather substrate
means a nonputrescible leather surface intended for the application of finishing chemicals and materials. The leather substrate may be a continuous piece of material such as side leather or may be a combination of smaller leather pieces and leather fibers, which when joined together, form an integral composite leather material.
Leather tanning
means the processes, commonly referred to as wet operations, used to purify and stabilize the collagen content of the hide. Wet operations are divided into three phases, the beamhouse (includes soaking and unhairing); the tanyard (includes bating, pickling, tanning, trimming/siding, and splitting); and the coloring department (includes retanning, coloring, and atliquoring operations).
Month
means that all references to a month in this subpart refer to a calendar month.
Nonwater-resistant leather
means nonupholstery leather that is not treated with any type of waterproof finish and, thus, cannot withstand 5,000 Maeser Flexes with a Maeser Flex Testing Machine or a method approved by the Administrator prior to initial water penetration. This leather is typically used for dress shoes, handbags, and garments.
Product process operation
means any one of the four leather production classifications developed for ease of compliance with this subpart. The four leather product process operations are as follows: upholstery leather with greater than or equal to 4 grams finish add-on per square foot, upholstery leather with less than 4 grams finish add-on per square foot, water-resistant/specialty leather, and nonwater-resistant leather.
Specialty leather
means a select grade of chrome tanned, bark retanned, or fat liquored leather that is retanned through the application of grease, waxes, and oil in quantities greater than 12 percent of the dry leather weight or high-quality dress or performance shoe leather that can withstand one or more of the following visual tests: moisture injection into the leather using vacuum mulling without signs of blistering, or prolonged ironing at 200 °F for smoothing out surface roughness without finish lift off. Specialty leather is also finished with higher solvent-based finishes that provide rich color, luster, or an oily/tacky feel. Specialty leather products are generally low volume, high-quality leather, such as specialty shoe leather and top grade football leathers.
Upholstery leather (greater than or equal to 4 grams finish add-on per square foot)
means an upholstery leather with a final finish add-on to leather ratio of 4 or more grams of finish per square foot of leather. These types of finishes are used primarily for automobile seating covers. These finishes tend to be aqueous-based.
Upholstery leather (less than 4 grams finish add-on per square foot)
means an upholstery leather with a final finish add-on to leather ratio of less than 4 grams of finish per square foot of leather. These types of finishes are typically used for furniture seating covers. The finishes tend to be solvent-based and leave a thinner, softer, and more natural leather texture.
Vacuum mulling
means the injection of water into the leather substrate using a vacuum process to increase the moisture content of the leather.
Water-resistant leather
means nonupholstery leather that has been treated with one or more waterproof finishes such that the leather can withstand 5,000 or more Maeser Flexes with a Maeser Flex Testing Machine or a method approved by the Administrator prior to initial water penetration. This leather is used for outerwear, boots and outdoor applications.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.5480
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from cellulose products manufacturing operations. Carbon disulfide, carbonyl sulfide, ethylene oxide, methanol, methyl chloride, propylene oxide, and toluene
are the HAP emitted in the greatest quantities from cellulose products manufacturing operations. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards.
§ 63.5485
Am I subject to this subpart?
You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a cellulose products manufacturing operation that is located at a major source of HAP emissions.
(a) Cellulose products manufacturing includes both the Miscellaneous Viscose Processes source category and the Cellulose Ethers Production source category. The Miscellaneous Viscose Processes source category includes all of the operations that use the viscose process. These operations include the cellulose food casing, rayon, cellulosic sponge, and cellophane operations, as defined in § 63.5610. The Cellulose Ethers Production source category includes all of the cellulose ether operations, as defined in § 63.5610, that use the cellulose ether process.
(b) A major source of HAP is any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.1 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) (10 tons per year (tpy)) or more or any combination of HAP at a rate of 23 Mg/yr (25 tpy) or more.
(c) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to research and development facilities, as defined in section 112(b)(7) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), regardless of whether the facilities are located at the same plant site as an operation subject to the provisions of this subpart.
(d) For cellulose ether operations, the applicability provisions in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section apply.
(1) The applicability provisions in §§ 63.100(a) through (f) and 63.160 apply if you are complying with the equipment leak provisions of subpart H of this part.
(2) The applicability provisions in § 63.1019 apply if you are complying with the equipment leak provisions in subpart UU of this part.
(e) For cellulose ether operations, the applicability provisions in §§ 63.100(a) through (f) and 63.110(a), (e) and (h) apply if you are complying with the wastewater provisions in subparts F and G of this part.

# Continuous Compliance Requirements
§ 63.5555
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards?
(a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission limit, operating limit, and work practice standard in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart that applies to you according to methods specified in Tables 5 and 6 to this subpart.
(b) You must report each instance in which you were not in continuous compliance (as specified in Tables 5 and 6 to this subpart) with each emission limit, each operating limit, and each work practice standard that apply to you. This includes periods of startup,
shutdown, and malfunction. These instances are deviations from the emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards in this subpart. These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in § 63.5580.
(c) [Reserved]
(d) For each affected source that commenced construction or reconstruction before September 9, 2019, on or before December 29, 2020, deviations that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating in accordance with § 63.5515(b). The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur on or before December 29, 2020, and during a period you identify as a startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations, according to the provisions in § 63.5515(b). This section no longer applies after December 30, 2020. For new sources that commence construction or reconstruction after September 9, 2019, this section does not apply.
[67 FR 40055, June 11, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 20466, Apr. 20, 2006; 85 FR 39995, July 2, 2020]
§ 63.5560
How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?
(a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section.
(b) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must monitor continuously (or collect data at all required intervals) at all times that the affected source is operating, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
(c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, required quality assurance or control activities, and periods of no flow for all or a portion of an affected source in data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating levels, nor may such data be used in fulfilling a minimum data availability requirement, if applicable. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.
(d) All terms in this subpart that define a period of time for completing required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually) refer to the standard calendar periods.
(1) You may change time periods specified in this subpart for completing required tasks by mutual agreement with the Administrator, as specified in subpart A of this part. For example, a period could begin on the compliance date or another date, rather than on the first day of the standard calendar period. For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period must remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.
(2) Where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the period, then you must comply according to the schedule specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.
(i) You must comply before the end of the standard calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that must be performed quarterly, or at least 3 months for tasks that must be performed annually; or
(ii) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires completing a task during each of multiple successive periods, you may perform the required task at any time during the specified period, provided that the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.

# Subpart VVVV—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Boat Manufacturing

# Source:
66 FR 44232, Aug. 22, 2001, unless otherwise noted.

# What the Subpart Covers
§ 63.5680
What is the purpose of this subpart?
(a) This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) for new and existing boat manufacturing facilities with resin and gel coat operations, carpet and fabric adhesive operations, or aluminum recreational boat surface coating operations. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission standards.
§ 63.5683
Does this subpart apply to me?
(a) This subpart applies to you if you meet both of the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) You are the owner or operator of a boat manufacturing facility that builds fiberglass boats or aluminum recreational boats.
(2) Your boat manufacturing facility is a major source of HAP either in and of itself, or because it is collocated with other sources of HAP, such that all sources combined constitute a major source.
(b) A boat manufacturing facility is a facility that manufactures hulls or decks of boats from fiberglass or aluminum, or assembles boats from premanufactured hulls and decks, or builds molds to make fiberglass hulls or decks. A facility that manufactures only parts of boats (such as hatches, seats, or lockers) or boat trailers is not considered a boat manufacturing facility for the purpose of this subpart.
(c) A major source is any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or can potentially emit, considering controls, in the aggregate, 9.1 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year of a single HAP or 22.7 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year of a combination of HAP.
(d) This subpart does not apply to aluminum coating operations on aluminum boats intended for commercial or military (nonrecreational) use, antifoulant coatings, assembly adhesives, fiberglass hull and deck coatings, research and development activities,
mold sealing and release agents, mold stripping and cleaning solvents, and wood coatings as defined in § 63.5779. This subpart does not apply to materials contained in handheld aerosol cans.
§ 63.5686
How do I demonstrate that my facility is not a major source?
You can demonstrate that your facility is not a major source by using the procedures in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
(a)
Emission option.
You must demonstrate that your facility does not emit, and does not have the potential to emit as defined in § 63.2, considering federally enforceable permit limits, 9.1 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year of a single HAP or 22.7 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year of a combination of HAP. To calculate your facility's potential to emit, you must include emissions from the boat manufacturing facility and all other sources that are collocated and under common ownership or control with the boat manufacturing facility.
(b)
Material consumption option.
This option can be used if you manufacture either fiberglass boats or aluminum recreational boats at your facility. You must meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section and comply with the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section. If you initially rely on the limits and criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section to become an area source, but then exceed the relevant limit (without first obtaining and complying with other limits that keep your potential to emit HAP below major source levels), your facility will then become a major source, and you must comply with all applicable provisions of this subpart beginning on the compliance date specified in § 63.5695. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude you from limiting your facility's potential to emit through other federally enforceable mechanisms available through your permitting authority.
(1) If your facility is primarily a fiberglass boat manufacturing facility, you must demonstrate that you consume less than 45.4 megagrams per rolling 12-month period of all combined polyester-and vinylester-based resins and gel coats (including tooling and production resins and gel coats, and clear gel coats), and you must demonstrate that at least 90 percent of total annual HAP emissions at the facility (including emissions from aluminum recreational boat manufacturing or other source categories) originate from the fiberglass boat manufacturing materials.
(2) If your facility is primarily an aluminum recreational boat manufacturing facility, you must demonstrate that it consumes less than 18.2 megagrams per rolling 12-month period of all combined surface coatings, aluminum wipedown solvents, application gun cleaning solvents, and carpet and fabric adhesives; and you must demonstrate that at least 90 percent of total annual HAP emissions at the facility (including emissions from fiberglass boat manufacturing or other source categories) originate from the aluminum recreational boat manufacturing materials.
(3) If your facility is a fiberglass boat or an aluminum recreational boat manufacturing facility, you must demonstrate that the boat manufacturing materials consumed per rolling 12-month period contain a total of less than 4.6 megagrams of any single HAP and less than 11.4 megagrams of all combined HAP, and you must demonstrate that at least 90 percent of total annual HAP emissions at the facility (including emissions from other source categories) originate from these boat manufacturing materials.
(c) If you use the material consumption option described in paragraph (b) of this section to demonstrate that you are not a major source, you must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) If your facility has HAP emissions that do not originate from boat manufacturing operations or materials described in paragraph (b), then you must keep any records necessary to demonstrate that the 90 percent criterion is met.
(2) A rolling 12-month period includes the previous 12 months of operation. You must maintain records of the total amount of materials described in paragraph (b) of this section used each
month, and, if necessary, the HAP content of each material and the calculation of the total HAP consumed each month. Because records are needed for a 12-month period, you must keep records beginning no later than 12 months before the compliance date specified in § 63.5695. Records must be kept for 5 years after they are created.
(3) In determining whether the 90 percent criterion included in paragraph (b) of this section is met, you do not need to include materials used in routine janitorial, building, or facility grounds maintenance; personal uses by employees or other persons; or products used for maintaining motor vehicles operated by the facility.
§ 63.5689
What parts of my facility are covered by this subpart?
The affected source (the portion of your boat manufacturing facility covered by this subpart) is the combination of all of the boat manufacturing operations listed in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.
(a) Open molding resin and gel coat operations (including pigmented gel coat, clear gel coat, production resin, tooling gel coat, and tooling resin).
(b) Closed molding resin operations.
(c) Resin and gel coat mixing operations.
(d) Resin and gel coat application equipment cleaning operations.
(e) Carpet and fabric adhesive operations.
(f) Aluminum hull and deck coating operations, including solvent wipedown operations and paint spray gun cleaning operations, on aluminum recreational boats.
§ 63.5692
How do I know if my boat manufacturing facility is a new source or an existing source?
(a) A boat manufacturing facility is a new source if it meets the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) You commence construction of the affected source after July 14, 2000.
(2) It is a major source.
(3) It is a completely new boat manufacturing affected source where no other boat manufacturing affected source existed prior to the construction of the new source.
(b) For the purposes of this subpart, an existing source is any source that is not a new source.
§ 63.5695
When must I comply with this subpart?
You must comply with the standards in this subpart by the compliance dates specified in Table 1 to this subpart.

# Demonstrating Compliance for Open Molding Operations Controlled by Add-On Control Devices
§ 63.5715
What operating limits must I meet?
(a) For open molding operations on which you use a thermal oxidizer as an add-on control device, you must meet the operating limits specified in Table 4 to this subpart that apply to the emission capture system and thermal oxidizer. You must establish the operating limits during the performance test according to the procedures in § 63.5725. You must meet the operating limits at all times after you establish them.
(b) If you use an add-on control device other than a thermal oxidizer, or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under § 63.8(f).
§ 63.5716
When must I conduct a performance test?
(a) If your source is an existing source, you must complete the add-on control device performance test no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.5695.
(b) If your source is a new source, you must complete the add-on control device performance test no later than 180 days after the compliance date specified in § 63.5695.
(c) You must conduct a performance test every 5 years as part of renewing your 40 CFR part 70 or 71 operating permit.
§ 63.5719
How do I conduct a performance test?
(a) You must capture the emissions using a permanent enclosure (such as a spray booth or similar containment device) and direct the captured emissions to the add-on control device.
(b) You must measure emissions as specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) If the enclosure vented to the control device is a permanent total enclosure as defined in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51, then you may measure emissions only at the outlet of the control device.
(2) If the permanent enclosure vented to the control device is not a total enclosure, you must build a temporary total enclosure, as defined in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51, around the permanent enclosure. You must then simultaneously measure emissions from the control device outlet and the emissions from the temporary total enclosure outlet. You determine compliance from the combined emissions from the control device outlet and the temporary total enclosure outlet.
(c) You must conduct the control device performance test using the emission measurement methods specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) Use either Method 1 or 1A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to select the sampling sites.
(2) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F or 2G of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.
(3) Use Method 18 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to measure organic HAP emissions or use Method 25A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to measure total gaseous organic emissions as a surrogate for total organic HAP emissions. If you use Method 25A, you must assume that all gaseous organic emissions measured as carbon are organic HAP emissions. If you use Method 18 and the number of organic HAP in the exhaust stream exceeds five, you must take into account the use of multiple chromatographic columns and analytical techniques to get an accurate measure of at least 90 percent of the total organic HAP mass emissions. Do not use Method 18 to measure organic HAP emissions from a combustion device; use instead Method 25A and assume that all gaseous organic mass
emissions measured as carbon are organic HAP emissions.
(4) You may use American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6420-99 (available for purchase from at least one of the following addresses: 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959; or University Microfilms International, 300 North Zeeb Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48106.) in lieu of Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, under the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) If the target compound(s) is listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99 and the target concentration is between 150 parts per billion by volume and 100 parts per million by volume.
(ii) If the target compound(s) is not listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99, but is potentially detected by mass spectrometry, an additional system continuing calibration check after each run, as detailed in Section 10.5.3 of ASTM D6420-99, must be followed, met, documented, and submitted with the performance test report even if you do not use a moisture condenser or the compound is not considered soluble.
(iii) If a minimum of one sample/analysis cycle is completed at least every 15 minutes.
(d) The control device performance test must consist of three runs and each run must last at least 1 hour. The production conditions during the test runs must represent normal production conditions with respect to the types of parts being made and material application methods. The production conditions during the test must also represent maximum potential emissions with respect to the organic HAP content of the materials being applied and the material application rates.
(e) During the test, you must also monitor and record separately the amounts of production resin, tooling resin, pigmented gel coat, clear gel coat, and tooling gel coat applied inside the enclosure that is vented to the control device.
§ 63.5722
How do I use the performance test data to demonstrate initial compliance?
Demonstrate initial compliance with the open molding emission limit as described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section:
(a) Calculate the organic HAP limit you must achieve using equation 1 of § 63.5698. For determining initial compliance, the organic HAP limit is based on the amount of material used during the performance test, in megagrams, rather than during the past 12 months. Calculate the limit using the megagrams of resin and gel coat applied inside the enclosure during the three runs of the performance test and equation 1 of § 63.5698.
(b) Add the total measured emissions, in kilograms, from all three of the 1-hour runs of the performance test.
(c) If the total emissions from the three 1-hour runs of the performance test are less than the organic HAP limit calculated in paragraph (a) of this section, then you have demonstrated initial compliance with the emission limit in § 63.5698 for those operations performed in the enclosure and controlled by the add-on control device.
§ 63.5725
What are the requirements for monitoring and demonstrating continuous compliance?
(a) You must establish control device parameters that indicate proper operation of the control device.
(b) You must install, operate, and maintain a continuous parameter monitoring system as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section.
(1) The continuous parameter monitoring system must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period. You must have a minimum of four successive cycles of operation to have a valid hour of data.
(2) You must have valid data from at least 90 percent of the hours during which the process operated.
(3) You must determine the average of all recorded readings for each successive 3-hour period of the emission capture system and add-on control device operation.
(4) You must maintain the continuous parameter monitoring system at all times and have available necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.
(5) You must operate the continuous parameter monitoring system and collect emission capture system and add-on control device parameter data at all times that a controlled open molding operation is being performed, except during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, if applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments).
(6) You must not use emission capture system or add-on control device parameter data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities when calculating data averages. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating the data averages for determining compliance with the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits.
(7) You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.
(8) Any period for which the monitoring system is out-of-control, as defined in § 63.7(d)(7), or malfunctioning, and data are not available for required calculations is a deviation from the monitoring requirements. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the continuous parameter monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
(c)
Enclosure bypass line.
You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section for each emission capture system enclosure that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
(1) You must monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism controlling the bypass line in a nondiverting position in such a way that the valve or closure mechanism cannot be opened without creating a record that the valve was opened. The method used to monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism must meet one of the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i)
Flow control position indicator.
Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow control position indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes and provides a record indicating whether the emissions are directed to the add-on control device or diverted from the add-on control device. The time of occurrence and flow control position must be recorded, as well as every time the flow direction is changed. The flow control position indicator must be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
(ii)
Car-seal or lock-and-key valve closures.
Secure any bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. You must visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position, and the emissions are not diverted away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
(iii)
Valve closure continuous monitoring.
Ensure that any bypass line valve is in the closed (non-diverting) position through monitoring of valve position at least once every 15 minutes. You must inspect the monitoring system at least once every month to verify that the monitor will indicate valve position.
(iv)
Automatic shutdown system.
Use an automatic shutdown system in which the open molding operation is stopped when flow is diverted by the bypass line away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere when the open molding operation is running. You must inspect the automatic shutdown system at least once every month to verify that it will detect diversions of flow and shut down the open molding operation.
(2) If any bypass line is opened, you must include a description of why the bypass line was opened and the length of time it remained open in the semiannual compliance reports required in § 63.5764(d).
(d)

add-on control device, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (6) of this section.
(1) You must install a combustion temperature monitoring device in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or incinerator, or in the duct immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs. You must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (d)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section for each temperature monitoring device.
(i) Locate the temperature sensor in a position that provides a representative temperature.
(ii) Use a temperature sensor with a minimum tolerance of 2.2 °C or 0.75 percent of the temperature value, whichever is larger.
(iii) Shield the temperature sensor system from electromagnetic interference and chemical contaminants.
(iv) If a chart recorder is used, it must have a sensitivity in the minor division of at least 10 °C.
(v) Perform an electronic calibration at least semiannually according to the procedures in the manufacturer's owners manual. Following the electronic calibration, you must conduct a temperature sensor validation check in which a second or redundant temperature sensor placed nearby the process temperature sensor must yield a reading within 16.7 °C of the process temperature sensor's reading.
(vi) Conduct calibration and validation checks any time the sensor exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating temperature range or install a new temperature sensor.
(vii) At least monthly, inspect all components for integrity and all electrical connections for continuity, oxidation, and galvanic corrosion.
(2) Before or during the performance test, you must conduct a performance evaluation of the combustion temperature monitoring system according to § 63.8(e). Section 63.8(e) specifies the general requirements for continuous monitoring systems and requirements for notifications, the site-specific performance evaluation plan, conduct of the performance evaluation, and reporting of performance evaluation results.
(3) During the performance test required by § 63.5716, you must monitor and record the combustion temperature and determine the average combustion temperature for the three 1-hour test runs. This average temperature is the minimum operating limit for the thermal oxidizer.
(4) Following the performance test, you must continuously monitor the combustion temperature and record the average combustion temperature no less frequently than every 15 minutes.
(5) You must operate the incinerator or thermal oxidizer so that the average combustion temperature in any 3-hour period does not fall below the average combustion temperature recorded during the performance test.
(6) If the average combustion temperature in any 3-hour period falls below the average combustion temperature recorded during the performance test, or if you fail to collect the minimum data specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, it is a deviation for the operating limit in § 63.5715.
(e)
Other control devices.
If you are using a control device other a thermal oxidizer, then you must comply with alternative monitoring requirements and operating limits approved by the Administrator under § 63.8(f).
(f)
Emission capture system.
For each enclosure in the emission capture system, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) You must install a device to measure and record either the flow rate or the static pressure in the duct from each enclosure to the add-on control device.
(2) You must install a device to measure and record the pressure drop across at least one opening in each enclosure.
(3) Each flow measurement device must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (f)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.

You must also establish an operating limit for pressure drop across at least one opening in each enclosure according to paragraphs (f)(5)(iii) and (iv) of this section. The operating limits for a permanent total enclosure are specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
(i) During the emission test required by § 63.5716 and described in § 63.5719, you must monitor and record either the gas volumetric flow rate or the duct static pressure for each separate enclosure in your emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs at a point in the duct between the enclosure and the add-on control device inlet.
(ii) Following the emission test, calculate and record the average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure for the three test runs for each enclosure. This average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure is the minimum operating limit for that specific enclosure.
(iii) During the emission test required by § 63.5716 and described in § 63.5719, you must monitor and record the pressure drop across the opening of each enclosure in your emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.

# Methods for Determining Hazardous Air Pollutant Content
§ 63.5758
How do I determine the organic HAP content of materials?
(a)
Determine the organic HAP content for each material used.
To determine the organic HAP content for each material used in your open molding resin and gel coat operations, carpet and fabric adhesive operations, or aluminum recreational boat surface coating operations, you must use one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section.
(1)
Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63).
You may use Method 311 for determining the mass fraction of organic HAP. Use the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when determining organic HAP content by Method 311.
(i) Include in the organic HAP total each organic HAP that is measured to be present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is measured to be 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not need to include it in the organic HAP total. Express the mass fraction of each organic HAP you measure as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1234).
(ii) Calculate the total organic HAP content in the test material by adding up the individual organic HAP contents and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.123).
(2)
Method 24 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60).
You may use Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of non-aqueous volatile matter of aluminum coatings and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP.
(3)
ASTM D1259-85 (Standard Test Method for Nonvolatile Content of Resins).
You may use ASTM D1259-85 (available for purchase from ASTM) to measure the mass fraction of volatile matter of resins and gel coats for open molding operations and use that value as a substitute for mass fraction of organic HAP.
(4)
Alternative method.
You may use an alternative test method for determining mass fraction of organic HAP if you obtain prior approval by the Administrator. You must follow the procedure in § 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.
(5)
Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material.
You may rely on information other than that generated by the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section, such as manufacturer's formulation data, according to paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Include in the organic HAP total each organic HAP that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to include it in the organic HAP total.
(ii) If the organic HAP content is provided by the material supplier or manufacturer as a range, then you must use the upper limit of the range for determining compliance. If a separate measurement of the total organic HAP content using the methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section exceeds the upper limit of the range of the total organic HAP content provided by the material supplier or
manufacturer, then you must use the measured organic HAP content to determine compliance.
(iii) If the organic HAP content is provided as a single value, you may assume the value is a manufacturing target value and actual organic HAP content may vary from the target value. If a separate measurement of the total organic HAP content using the methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section is less than 2 percentage points higher than the value for total organic HAP content provided by the material supplier or manufacturer, then you may use the provided value to demonstrate compliance. If the measured total organic HAP content exceeds the provided value by 2 percentage points or more, then you must use the measured organic HAP content to determine compliance.
(6)
Solvent blends.
Solvent blends may be listed as single components for some regulated materials in certifications provided by manufacturers or suppliers. Solvent blends may contain organic HAP which must be counted toward the total organic HAP content of the materials. When detailed organic HAP content data for solvent blends are not available, you may use the values for organic HAP content that are listed in Table 5 or 6 to this subpart. You may use Table 6 to this subpart only if the solvent blends in the materials you use do not match any of the solvent blends in Table 5 to this subpart and you know only whether the blend is either aliphatic or aromatic. However, if test results indicate higher values than those listed in Table 5 or 6 to this subpart, then the test results must be used for determining compliance.
(b)
Determine the volume fraction solids in aluminum recreational boat surface coatings.
To determine the volume fraction of coating solids (liters of coating solids per liter of coating) for each aluminum recreational boat surface coating, you must use one of the methods specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. If the results obtained with paragraphs (b)(2) or (3) of this section do not to agree with those obtained according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must use the results obtained with paragraph (b)(1) of this section to determine compliance.
(1)
ASTM Method D2697-86(1998) or D6093-97.
You may use ASTM Method D2697-86(1998) or D6093-97 (available for purchase from ASTM) to determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating. Divide the nonvolatile volume percent obtained with the methods by 100 to calculate volume fraction of coating solids.
(2)
Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material.
You may obtain the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating from the supplier or manufacturer.
(3)
Calculation of volume fraction of coating solids.
You may determine it using equation 1 of this section:
ER22AU01.019
Where:
Solids = volume fraction of coating solids, liters coating solids per liter coating.
m
volatiles = Total volatile matter content of the coating, including organic HAP, volatile organic compounds, water, and exempt compounds, determined according to Method 24 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, grams volatile matter per liter coating.
D
avg
= average density of volatile matter in the coating, grams volatile matter per liter volatile matter, determined from test results using ASTM Method D1475-90 (available for purchase from ASTM), information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material, or reference sources providing density or specific gravity data for pure materials. If there is disagreement between ASTM Method D1475-90 test results and other information sources, the test results will take precedence.
(c)
Determine the density of each aluminum recreational boat wipedown solvent and surface coating.
Determine the density of all aluminum recreational boat wipedown solvents, surface coatings, thinners, and other additives from test results using ASTM Method D1475-90, information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material, or reference sources providing density or specific gravity data for pure materials. If there is disagreement between ASTM Method D1475-90 test results and other information sources, you must
use the test results to demonstrate compliance.

# Subpart WWWW—National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Reinforced Plastic Composites Production

# Source:
68 FR 19402, Apr. 21, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.5780
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for reinforced plastic composites production. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions standards.
§ 63.5785
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a reinforced plastic composites production facility that is located at a major source of HAP emissions. Reinforced plastic composites production is limited to operations in which reinforced and/or nonreinforced plastic composites or plastic molding compounds are manufactured using thermoset resins and/or gel coats that contain styrene to produce plastic composites. The resins and gel coats may also contain materials designed to enhance the chemical, physical, and/or thermal properties of the product. Reinforced plastic composites production also includes cleaning, mixing, HAP-containing materials storage, and repair operations associated with the production of plastic composites.
(b) You are not subject to this subpart if your facility only repairs reinforced plastic composites. Repair includes the non-routine manufacture of individual components or parts intended to repair a larger item as defined in § 63.5935
(c) You are not subject to this subpart if your facility is a research and development facility as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
(d) You are not subject to this subpart if your reinforced plastic composites operations use less than 1.2 tons per year (tpy) of thermoset resins and gel coats that contain styrene combined.
§ 63.5787
What if I also manufacture fiberglass boats or boat parts?
(a) If your source meets the applicability criteria in § 63.5785, and is not subject to the Boat Manufacturing NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV), you are subject to this subpart regardless of the final use of the parts you manufacture.
(b) If your source is subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV, and all the reinforced plastic composites you manufacture are used in manufacturing your boats, you are not subject to this subpart.
(c) If you are subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV, and meet the applicability criteria in § 63.5785, and produce reinforced plastic composites that are not used in fiberglass boat manufacture at your facility, all operations associated with the manufacture of the reinforced plastic composites parts that are not used in fiberglass boat manufacture at your facility are subject to this subpart, except as noted in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d) Facilities potentially subject to both this subpart and 40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV may elect to have the
operations in paragraph (c) of this section covered by 40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV, in lieu of this subpart, if they can demonstrate that this will not result in any organic HAP emissions increase compared to complying with this subpart.
§ 63.5790
What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
(a) This subpart applies to each new or existing affected source at reinforced plastic composites production facilities.
(b) The affected source consists of all parts of your facility engaged in the following operations: Open molding, closed molding, centrifugal casting, continuous lamination, continuous casting, polymer casting, pultrusion, sheet molding compound (SMC) manufacturing, bulk molding compound (BMC) manufacturing, mixing, cleaning of equipment used in reinforced plastic composites manufacture, HAP-containing materials storage, and repair operations on parts you also manufacture.
(c) The following operations are specifically excluded from any requirements in this subpart: application of mold sealing and release agents; mold stripping and cleaning; repair of parts that you did not manufacture, including non-routine manufacturing of parts; personal activities that are not part of the manufacturing operations (such as hobby shops on military bases); prepreg materials as defined in § 63.5935; non-gel coat surface coatings; application of putties, polyputties, and adhesives; repair or production materials that do not contain resin or gel coat; research and development operations as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the CAA; polymer casting; and closed molding operations (except for compression/injection molding). Note that the exclusion of certain operations from any requirements applies only to operations specifically listed in this paragraph. The requirements for any co-located operations still apply.
(d) Production resins that must meet military specifications are allowed to meet the organic HAP limit contained in that specification. In order for this exemption to be used, you must supply to the permitting authority the specifications certified as accurate by the military procurement officer, and those specifications must state a requirement for a specific resin, or a specific resin HAP content. Production resins for which this exemption is used must be applied with nonatomizing resin application equipment unless you can demonstrate this is infeasible. You must keep a record of the resins for which you are using this exemption.
[68 FR 19402, Apr. 21, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 50124, Aug. 25, 2005]
§ 63.5795
How do I know if my reinforced plastic composites production facility is a new affected source or an existing affected source?
(a) A reinforced plastic composites production facility is a new affected source if it meets all the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) You commence construction of the source after August 2, 2001.
(2) You commence construction, and no other reinforced plastic composites production source exists at that site.
(b) For the purposes of this subpart, an existing affected source is any affected source that is not a new affected source.
[70 FR 50124, Aug. 25, 2005]

# Calculating Organic HAP Emissions Factors for Open Molding and Centrifugal Casting
§ 63.5796
What are the organic HAP emissions factor equations in Table 1 to this subpart, and how are they used in this subpart?
Emissions factors are used in this subpart to determine compliance with certain organic HAP emissions limits in Tables 3 and 5 to this subpart. You may use the equations in Table 1 to this subpart to calculate your emissions factors. Equations are available for each open molding operation and centrifugal casting operation and have units of pounds of organic HAP emitted per ton (lb/ton) of resin or gel coat applied. These equations are intended to provide a method for you to demonstrate compliance without the need to conduct for a HAP emissions test. In lieu of these equations, you can elect
to use site-specific organic HAP emissions factors to demonstrate compliance provided your site-specific organic HAP emissions factors are incorporated in the facility's air emissions permit and are based on actual facility HAP emissions test data. You may also use the organic HAP emissions factors calculated using the equations in Table 1 to this subpart, combined with resin and gel coat use data, to calculate your organic HAP emissions.
§ 63.5797
How do I determine the organic HAP content of my resins and gel coats?
In order to determine the organic HAP content of resins and gel coats, you may rely on information provided by the material manufacturer, such as manufacturer's formulation data and material safety data sheets (MSDS), using the procedures specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, as applicable.
(a) Include in the organic HAP total each organic HAP that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for Occupational Safety and Health Administration-defined carcinogens, as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other organic HAP compounds.
(b) If the organic HAP content is provided by the material supplier or manufacturer as a range, you must use the upper limit of the range for determining compliance. If a separate measurement of the total organic HAP content, such as an analysis of the material by EPA Method 311 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 63, exceeds the upper limit of the range of the total organic HAP content provided by the material supplier or manufacturer, then you must use the measured organic HAP content to determine compliance.
(c) If the organic HAP content is provided as a single value, you may use that value to determine compliance. If a separate measurement of the total organic HAP content is made and is less than 2 percentage points higher than the value for total organic HAP content provided by the material supplier or manufacturer, then you still may use the provided value to demonstrate compliance. If the measured total organic HAP content exceeds the provided value by 2 percentage points or more, then you must use the measured organic HAP content to determine compliance.
§ 63.5798
What if I want to use, or I manufacture, an application technology (new or existing) whose organic HAP emissions characteristics are not represented by the equations in Table 1 to this subpart?
If you wish to use a resin or gel coat application technology (new or existing), whose emission characteristics are not represented by the equations in Table 1 to this subpart, you may use the procedures in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section to establish an organic HAP emissions factor. This organic HAP emissions factor may then be used to determine compliance with the emission limits in this subpart, and to calculate facility organic HAP emissions.
(a) Perform an organic HAP emissions test to determine a site-specific organic HAP emissions factor using the test procedures in § 63.5850.
(b) Submit a petition to the Administrator for administrative review of this subpart. This petition must contain a description of the resin or gel coat application technology and supporting organic HAP emissions test data obtained using EPA test methods or their equivalent. The emission test data should be obtained using a range of resin or gel coat HAP contents to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology under the different conditions, and to demonstrate that the technology will be effective at different sites. We will review the submitted data, and, if appropriate, update the equations in Table 1 to this subpart.
§ 63.5799
How do I calculate my facility's organic HAP emissions on a tpy basis for purposes of determining which paragraphs of § 63.5805 apply?
To calculate your facility's organic HAP emissions in tpy for purposes of determining which paragraphs in § 63.5805 apply to you, you must use the procedures in either paragraph (a) of this section for new facilities prior to startup, or paragraph (b) of this section for existing facilities and new facilities
after startup. You are not required to calculate or report emissions under this section if you are an existing facility that does not have centrifugal casting or continuous lamination/casting operations, or a new facility that does not have any of the following operations: Open molding, centrifugal casting, continuous lamination/casting, pultrusion, SMC and BMC manufacturing, and mixing. Emissions calculation and emission reporting procedures in other sections of this subpart still apply. Calculate organic HAP emissions prior to any add-on control device, and do not include organic HAP emissions from any resin or gel coat used in operations subject to the Boat Manufacturing NESHAP, 40 CFR part 63, subpart VVVV, or from the manufacture of large parts as defined in § 63.5805(d)(2). For centrifugal casting operations at existing facilities, do not include any organic HAP emissions where resin or gel coat is applied to an open centrifugal mold using open molding application techniques. Table 1 and the Table 1 footnotes to this subpart present more information on calculating centrifugal casting organic HAP emissions. The timing and reporting of these calculations is discussed in paragraph (c) of this section.
(a) For new facilities prior to startup, calculate a weighted average organic HAP emissions factor for the operations specified in § 63.5805(c) and (d) on a lbs/ton of resin and gel coat basis. Base the weighted average on your projected operation for the 12 months subsequent to facility startup. Multiply the weighted average organic HAP emissions factor by projected resin use over the same period. You may calculate your organic HAP emissions factor based on the factors in Table 1 to this subpart, or you may use any HAP emissions factor approved by us, such as factors from the “Compilation of Air Pollutant Emissions Factors, Volume I: Stationary Point and Area Sources (AP-42),” or organic HAP emissions test data from similar facilities.
(b) For existing facilities and new facilities after startup, you may use the procedures in either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. If the emission factors for an existing facility have changed over the period of time prior to their initial compliance date due to incorporation of pollution-prevention control techniques, existing facilities may base the average emission factor on their operations as they exist on the compliance date. If an existing facility has accepted an enforceable permit limit that would result in less than 100 tpy of HAP measured prior to any add-on controls, and can demonstrate that they will operate at that level subsequent to the compliance date, they can be deemed to be below the 100 tpy threshold.
(1)
Use a calculated emission factor.
Calculate a weighted average organic HAP emissions factor on a lbs/ton of resin and gel coat basis. Base the weighted average on the prior 12 months of operation. Multiply the weighted average organic HAP emissions factor by resin and gel coat use over the same period. You may calculate this organic HAP emissions factor based on the equations in Table 1 to this subpart, or you may use any organic HAP emissions factor approved by us, such as factors from AP-42, or site-specific organic HAP emissions factors if they are supported by HAP emissions test data.
(2)
Conduct performance testing.
Conduct performance testing using the test procedures in § 63.5850 to determine a site-specific organic HAP emissions factor in units of lbs/ton of resin and gel coat used. Conduct the test under conditions expected to result in the highest possible organic HAP emissions. Multiply this factor by annual resin and gel coat use to determine annual organic HAP emissions. This calculation must be repeated and reported annually.
(c) Existing facilities must initially perform this calculation based on their 12 months of operation prior to April 21, 2003, and include this information with their initial notification report. Existing facilities must repeat the calculation based on their resin and gel coat use in the 12 months prior to their initial compliance date, and submit this information with their initial compliance report. After their initial compliance date, existing and new facilities must recalculate organic HAP emissions over the 12-month period
ending June 30 or December 31, whichever date is the first date following their compliance date specified in § 63.5800. Subsequent calculations should cover the periods in the semiannual compliance reports.

# Compliance Dates and Standards
§ 63.5800
When do I have to comply with this subpart?
You must comply with the standards in this subpart by the dates specified in Table 2 to this subpart. Facilities meeting an organic HAP emissions standard based on a 12-month rolling average must begin collecting data on the compliance date in order to demonstrate compliance.
§ 63.5805
What standards must I meet to comply with this subpart?
You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section that apply to you. You may elect to comply using any options to meet the standards described in §§ 63.5810 through 63.5830. Use the procedures in § 63.5799 to determine if you meet or exceed the 100 tpy threshold.
(a) If you have an existing facility that has any centrifugal casting or continuous casting/lamination operations, you must meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section:
(1) If the combination of all centrifugal casting and continuous lamination/casting operations emit 100 tpy or more of HAP, you must reduce the total organic HAP emissions from centrifugal casting and continuous lamination/casting operations by at least 95 percent by weight. As an alternative to meeting the 95 percent by weight requirement, centrifugal casting operations may meet the applicable organic HAP emissions limits in Table 5 to this subpart and continuous lamination/casting operations may meet an organic HAP emissions limit of 1.47 lbs/ton of neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus applied. For centrifugal casting, the percent reduction requirement does not apply to organic HAP emissions that occur during resin application onto an open centrifugal casting mold using open molding application techniques.
(2) If the combination of all centrifugal casting and continuous lamination/casting operations emit less than 100 tpy of HAP, then centrifugal casting and continuous lamination/casting operations must meet the appropriate requirements in Table 3 to this subpart.
(b) All operations at existing facilities not listed in paragraph (a) of this section must meet the organic HAP emissions limits in Table 3 to this subpart and the work practice standards in Table 4 to this subpart that apply, regardless of the quantity of HAP emitted.
(c) If you have a new facility that emits less than 100 tpy of HAP from the combination of all open molding, centrifugal casting, continuous lamination/casting, pultrusion, SMC manufacturing, mixing, and BMC manufacturing, you must meet the organic HAP emissions limits in Table 3 to this subpart and the work practice standards in Table 4 to this subpart that apply to you.
(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if you have a new facility that emits 100 tpy or more of HAP from the combination of all open molding, centrifugal casting, continuous lamination/casting, pultrusion, SMC manufacturing, mixing, and BMC manufacturing, you must reduce the total organic HAP emissions from these operations by at least 95 percent by weight and meet any applicable work practice standards in Table 4 to this subpart that apply to you. As an alternative to meeting 95 percent by weight, you may meet the organic HAP emissions limits in Table 5 to this subpart. If you have a continuous lamination/casting operation, that operation may alternatively meet an organic HAP emissions limit of 1.47 lbs/ton of neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus applied.
(2)(i) If your new facility manufactures large reinforced plastic composites parts using open molding or pultrusion operations, the specific open molding and pultrusion operations used to produce large parts are not required to reduce HAP emissions by 95 weight
percent, but must meet the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart.
(ii) A large open molding part is defined as a part that, when the final finished part is enclosed in the smallest rectangular six-sided box into which the part can fit, the total interior volume of the box exceeds 250 cubic feet, or any interior sides of the box exceed 50 square feet.
(iii) A large pultruded part is a part that exceeds an outside perimeter of 24 inches or has more than 350 reinforcements.
(e) If you have a new or existing facility subject to paragraph (a)(2) or (c) of this section at its initial compliance date that subsequently meets or exceeds the 100 tpy threshold in any calendar year, you must notify your permitting authority in your compliance report. You may at the same time request a one-time exemption from the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or (d) of this section in your compliance report if you can demonstrate all of the following:
(1) The exceedance of the threshold was due to circumstances that will not be repeated.
(2) The average annual organic HAP emissions from the potentially affected operations for the last 3 years were below 100 tpy.
(3) Projected organic HAP emissions for the next calendar year are below 100 tpy, based on projected resin and gel coat use and the HAP emission factors calculated according to the procedures in § 63.5799.
(f) If you apply for an exemption in paragraph (e) of this section and subsequently exceed the HAP emission thresholds specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (c) of this section over the next 12-month period, you must notify the permitting authority in your semiannual report, the exemption is removed, and your facility must comply with paragraph (a)(1) or (d) of this section within 3 years from the time your organic HAP emissions first exceeded the threshold.
(g) If you have repair operations subject to this subpart as defined in § 63.5785, these repair operations must meet the requirements in Tables 3 and 4 to this subpart and are not required to meet the 95 percent organic HAP emissions reduction requirements in paragraph (a)(1) or (d) of this section.
(h) If you use an add-on control device to comply with this subpart, you must meet all requirements contained in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS.
[70 FR 50124, Aug. 25, 2005]

# Options for Meeting Standards
§ 63.5810
What are my options for meeting the standards for open molding and centrifugal casting operations at new and existing sources?
You must use one of the following methods in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section to meet the standards for open molding or centrifugal casting operations in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart. You may use any control method that reduces organic HAP emissions, including reducing resin and gel coat organic HAP content, changing to nonatomized mechanical application, using covered curing techniques, and routing part or all of your emissions to an add-on control. You may use different compliance options for the different operations listed in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart. The necessary calculations must be completed within 30 days after the end of each month. You may switch between the compliance options in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. When you change to an option based on a 12-month rolling average, you must base the average on the previous 12 months of data calculated using the compliance option you are changing to, unless you were previously using an option that did not require you to maintain records of resin and gel coat use. In this case, you must immediately begin collecting resin and gel coat use data and demonstrate compliance 12 months after changing options.
(a)
Demonstrate that an individual resin or gel coat, as applied, meets the applicable emission limit in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart.
(1) Calculate your actual organic HAP emissions factor for each different process stream within each operation type. A process stream is defined as each individual combination of resin or gel coat, application technique, and control technique. Process streams within operations types are
considered different from each other if any of the following four characteristics vary: the neat resin plus or neat gel coat plus organic HAP content, the gel coat type, the application technique, or the control technique. You must calculate organic HAP emissions factors for each different process stream by using the appropriate equations in Table 1 to this subpart for open molding and for centrifugal casting, or site-specific organic HAP emissions factors discussed in § 63.5796. The emission factor calculation should include any and all emission reduction techniques used including any add-on controls. If you are using vapor suppressants to reduce HAP emissions, you must determine the vapor suppressant effectiveness (VSE) by conducting testing according to the procedures specified in appendix A to subpart WWWW of 40 CFR part 63. If you are using an add-on control device to reduce HAP emissions, you must determine the add-on control factor by conducting capture and control efficiency testing using the procedures specified in § 63.5850. The organic HAP emissions factor calculated from the equations in Table 1 to this subpart, or a site-specific emissions factor, is multiplied by the add-on control factor to calculate the organic HAP emissions factor after control. Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the add-on control factor used in the organic HAP emissions factor equations.

Where:
Percent Control Efficiency = a value calculated from organic HAP emissions test measurements made according to the requirements of § 63.5850 to this subpart.
(2) If the calculated emission factor is less than or equal to the appropriate emission limit, you have demonstrated that this process stream complies with the emission limit in Table 3 to this subpart. It is not necessary that all your process streams, considered individually, demonstrate compliance to use this option for some process streams. However, for any individual resin or gel coat you use, if any of the process streams that include that resin or gel coat are to be used in any averaging calculations described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, then all process streams using that individual resin or gel coat must be included in the averaging calculations.
(b)
Demonstrate that, on average, you meet the individual organic HAP emissions limits for each combination of operation type and resin application method or gel coat type.
Demonstrate that on average you meet the individual organic HAP emissions limits for each unique combination of operation type and resin application method or gel coat type shown in Table 3 to this subpart that applies to you.
(1)(i) Group the process streams described in paragraph (a) to this section by operation type and resin application method or gel coat type listed in Table 3 to this subpart and then calculate a weighted average emission factor based on the amounts of each individual resin or gel coat used for the last 12 months. To do this, sum the product of each individual organic HAP emissions factor calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the amount of neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus usage that corresponds to the individual factors and divide the numerator by the total amount of neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus used in that operation type as shown in Equation 2 of this section.

(ii) You may, but are not required to, include process streams where you have demonstrated compliance as described in paragraph (a) of this section, subject to the limitations described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and you are not required to and should not include process streams for which you will demonstrate compliance using the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) Compare each organic HAP emissions factor calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with its corresponding organic HAP emissions limit in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart. If all emissions factors are equal to or less than their corresponding emission limits, then you are in compliance.
(c)
Demonstrate compliance with a weighted average emission limit.
Demonstrate each month that you meet each weighted average of the organic HAP emissions limits in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart that apply to you. When using this option, you must demonstrate compliance with the weighted average organic HAP emissions limit for all your open molding operations, and then separately demonstrate compliance with the weighted average organic HAP emissions limit for all your centrifugal casting operations. Open molding operations and centrifugal casting operations may not be averaged with each other.
(1) Each month calculate the weighted average organic HAP emissions limit for all open molding operations and the weighted average organic HAP emissions limit for all centrifugal casting operations for your facility for the last 12-month period to determine the organic HAP emissions limit you must meet. To do this, multiply the individual organic HAP emissions limits in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart for each open molding (centrifugal casting) operation type by the amount of neat resin plus or neat gel coat plus used in the last 12 months for each open molding (centrifugal casting) operation type, sum these results, and then divide this sum by the total amount of neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus used in open molding (centrifugal casting) over the last 12 months as shown in Equation 3 of this section.

n = number of operations.
(2) Each month calculate your weighted average organic HAP emissions factor for open molding and centrifugal casting. To do this, multiply your actual open molding (centrifugal casting) operation organic HAP emissions factors calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the amount of neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus used in each open molding (centrifugal casting) operation type, sum the results, and divide this sum by the total amount of neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus used in open molding (centrifugal casting) operations as shown in Equation 4 of this section.

(3) Compare the values calculated in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. If each 12-month rolling average organic HAP emissions factor is less than or equal to the corresponding 12-month rolling average organic HAP emissions limit, then you are in compliance.
(d)
Meet the organic HAP emissions limit for one application method and use the same resin(s) for all application methods of that resin type.
This option is limited to resins of the same type. The resin types for which this option may be used are noncorrosion-resistant, corrosion-resistant and/or high strength, and tooling.
(1) For any combination of manual resin application, mechanical resin application, filament application, or centrifugal casting, you may elect to meet the organic HAP emissions limit for any one of these application methods and use the same resin in all of the resin application methods listed in this paragraph (d)(1). Table 7 to this subpart presents the possible combinations based on a facility selecting the application process that results in the highest allowable organic HAP content resin. If the resin organic HAP content is below the applicable value shown in Table 7 to this subpart, the resin is in compliance.
(2) You may also use a weighted average organic HAP content for each application method described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Calculate the weighted average organic HAP content monthly. Use Equation 2 in paragraph (b)(1) of this section except substitute organic HAP content for organic HAP emissions factor. You are in compliance if the weighted average organic HAP content based on the last 12 months of resin use is less than or equal to the applicable organic HAP contents in Table 7 to this subpart.
(3) You may simultaneously use the averaging provisions in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to demonstrate compliance for any operations and/or resins you do not include in your compliance demonstrations in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. However, any resins for which you claim compliance under the option in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section may not be included in any of the averaging calculations described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
(4) You do not have to keep records of resin use for any of the individual resins where you demonstrate compliance under the option in paragraph (d)(1) of this section unless you elect to include that resin in the averaging calculations described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

# Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements
§ 63.5840
By what date must I conduct a performance test or other initial compliance demonstration?
You must conduct performance tests, performance evaluations, design evaluations, capture efficiency testing, and other initial compliance demonstrations by the compliance date specified in Table 2 to this subpart, with three exceptions. Open molding and centrifugal casting operations that elect to meet an organic HAP emissions limit on a 12-month rolling average must initiate collection of the required
data on the compliance date, and demonstrate compliance 1 year after the compliance date. New sources that use add-on controls to initially meet compliance must demonstrate compliance within 180 days after their compliance date.
§ 63.5845
When must I conduct subsequent performance tests?
You must conduct a performance test every 5 years following the initial performance test for any standard you meet with an add-on control device.

(a) If you are using any add-on controls to meet an organic HAP emissions limit in this subpart, you must conduct each performance test, performance evaluation, and design evaluation in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, that applies to you. The basic requirements for performance tests, performance evaluations, and design evaluations are presented in Table 6 to this subpart.
(b) Each performance test must be conducted according to the requirements in § 63.7(e)(1) and under the specific conditions that 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, specifies.
(c) Each performance evaluation must be conducted according to the requirements in § 63.8(e) as applicable and under the specific conditions that 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, specifies.
(d) You may not conduct performance tests or performance evaluations during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, as specified in § 63.7(e)(1).
(e) You must conduct the control device performance test using the emission measurement methods specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Use either Method 1 or 1A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to select the sampling sites.
(2) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F or 2G of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.
(3) Use Method 18 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to measure organic HAP emissions or use Method 25A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to measure total gaseous organic emissions as a surrogate for total organic HAP emissions. If you use Method 25A, you must assume that all gaseous organic emissions measured as carbon are organic HAP emissions. If you use Method 18 and the number of organic HAP in the exhaust stream exceeds five, you must take into account the use of multiple chromatographic columns and analytical techniques to get an accurate measure of at least 90 percent of the total organic HAP mass emissions. Do not use Method 18 to measure organic HAP emissions from a combustion device; use instead Method 25A and assume that all gaseous organic mass emissions measured as carbon are organic HAP emissions.
(4) You may use American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6420-99 (available for purchase from at least one of the following addresses: 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959; or University Microfilms International, 300 North Zeeb Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48106.) in lieu of Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, under the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) If the target compound(s) is listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99 and the target concentration is between 150 parts per billion by volume and 100 parts per million by volume.
(ii) If the target compound(s) is not listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99, but is potentially detected by mass spectrometry, an additional system continuing calibration check after each run, as detailed in Section 10.5.3 of ASTM D6420-99, must be followed, met, documented, and submitted with the performance test report even if you do not use a moisture condenser or the compound is not considered soluble.
(iii) If a minimum of one sample/analysis cycle is completed at least every 15 minutes.
(5) Use the procedures in EPA Method 3B of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to determine an oxygen correction factor if required by § 63.997(e)(2)(iii)(C). You may use American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) PTC 19-10-1981-Part 10 (available for purchase from ASME, P.O. Box 2900, 22 Law Drive, Fairfield, New Jersey, 07007-2900,
or online at
www.asme.org/catalog
) as an alternative to EPA Method 3B of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
(f) The control device performance test must consist of three runs and each run must last at least 1 hour. The production conditions during the test runs must represent normal production conditions with respect to the types of parts being made and material application methods. The production conditions during the test must also represent maximum potential emissions with respect to the organic HAP content of the materials being applied and the material application rates.
(g) If you are using a concentrator/oxidizer control device, you must test the combined flow upstream of the concentrator, and the combined outlet flow from both the oxidizer and the concentrator to determine the overall control device efficiency. If the outlet flow from the concentrator and oxidizer are exhausted in separate stacks, you must test both stacks simultaneously with the inlet to the concentrator to determine the overall control device efficiency.
(h) During the test, you must also monitor and record separately the amounts of production resin, tooling resin, pigmented gel coat, clear gel coat, and tooling gel coat applied inside the enclosure that is vented to the control device.
§ 63.5855
What are my monitor installation and operation requirements?
You must monitor and operate all add-on control devices according to the procedures in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS.
§ 63.5860
How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the standards?
(a) You demonstrate initial compliance with each organic HAP emissions standard in paragraphs (a) through (h) of § 63.5805 that applies to you by using the procedures shown in Tables 8 and 9 to this subpart.
(b) If using an add-on control device to demonstrate compliance, you must also establish each control device operating limit in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, that applies to you.

# Emission Factor, Percent Reduction, and Capture Efficiency Calculation Procedures for Continuous Lamination/Casting Operations
§ 63.5865
What data must I generate to demonstrate compliance with the standards for continuous lamination/casting operations?
(a) For continuous lamination/casting affected sources complying with a percent reduction requirement, you must generate the data identified in Tables 10 and 11 to this subpart for each data requirement that applies to your facility.
(b) For continuous lamination/casting affected sources complying with a lbs/ton limit, you must generate the data identified in Tables 11 and 12 to this subpart for each data requirement that applies to your facility.
§ 63.5870
How do I calculate annual uncontrolled and controlled organic HAP emissions from my wet-out area(s) and from my oven(s) for continuous lamination/casting operations?
To calculate your annual uncontrolled and controlled organic HAP emissions from your wet-out areas and from your ovens, you must develop uncontrolled and controlled wet-out area and uncontrolled and controlled oven organic HAP emissions estimation equations or factors to apply to each formula applied on each line, determine how much of each formula for each end product is applied each year on each line, and assign uncontrolled and controlled wet-out area and uncontrolled and controlled oven organic HAP emissions estimation equations or factors to each formula. You must determine the overall capture efficiency using the procedures in § 63.5850 to this subpart.
(a) To develop uncontrolled and controlled organic HAP emissions estimation equations and factors, you must, at a minimum, do the following, as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section:
(1) Identify each end product and the thickness of each end product produced on the line. Separate end products into the following end product groupings, as applicable: corrosion-resistant gel
coated end products, noncorrosion-resistant gel coated end products, corrosion-resistant nongel coated end products, and noncorrosion-resistant nongel coated end products. This step creates end product/thickness combinations.
(2) Identify each formula used on the line to produce each end product/thickness combination. Identify the amount of each such formula applied per year. Rank each formula used to produce each end product/thickness combination according to usage within each end product/thickness combination.
(3) For each end product/thickness combination being produced, select the formula with the highest usage rate for testing.
(4) If not already selected, also select the worst-case formula (likely to be associated with the formula with the highest organic HAP content, type of HAP, application of gel coat, thin product, low line speed, higher resin table temperature) amongst all formulae. (You may use the results of the worst-case formula test for all formulae if desired to limit the amount of testing required.)
(5) For each formula selected for testing, conduct at least one test (consisting of three runs). During the test, track information on organic HAP content and type of HAP, end product thickness, line speed, and resin temperature on the wet-out area table.
(6) Using the test results, develop uncontrolled and controlled organic HAP emissions estimation equations (or factors) or series of equations (or factors) that best fit the results for estimating uncontrolled and controlled organic HAP emissions, taking into account the organic HAP content and type of HAP, end product thickness, line speed, and resin temperature on the wet-out area table.
(b) In lieu of using the method specified in paragraph (a) of this section for developing uncontrolled and controlled organic HAP emissions estimation equations and factors, you may either method specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, as applicable.
(1) For either uncontrolled or controlled organic HAP emissions estimates, you may use previously established, facility-specific organic HAP emissions equations or factors, provided they allow estimation of both wet-out area and oven organic HAP emissions, where necessary, and have been approved by your permitting authority. If a previously established equation or factor is specific to the wet-out area only, or to the oven only, then you must develop the corresponding uncontrolled or controlled equation or factor for the other organic HAP emissions source.
(2) For uncontrolled (controlled) organic HAP emissions estimates, you may use controlled (uncontrolled) organic HAP emissions estimates and control device destruction efficiency to calculate your uncontrolled (controlled) organic HAP emissions provided the control device destruction efficiency was calculated at the same time you collected the data to develop your facility's controlled (uncontrolled) organic HAP emissions estimation equations and factors.
(c) Assign to each formula an uncontrolled organic HAP emissions estimation equation or factor based on the end product/thickness combination for which that formula is used.
(d)(1) To calculate your annual uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from wet-out areas that do not have any capture and control and from wet-out areas that are captured by an enclosure but are vented to the atmosphere and not to a control device, multiply each formula's annual usage by its appropriate organic HAP emissions estimation equation or factor and sum the individual results.
(2) To calculate your annual uncontrolled organic HAP emissions that escape from the enclosure on the wet-out area, multiply each formula's annual usage by its appropriate uncontrolled organic HAP emissions estimation equation or factor, sum the individual results, and multiply the summation by 1 minus the percent capture (expressed as a fraction).
(3) To calculate your annual uncontrolled oven organic HAP emissions, multiply each formula's annual usage by its appropriate uncontrolled organic HAP emissions estimation equation or factor and sum the individual results.
(4) To calculate your annual controlled organic HAP emissions, multiply each formula's annual usage by its appropriate organic HAP emissions estimation equation or factor and sum the individual results to obtain total annual controlled organic HAP emissions.
(e) Where a facility is calculating both uncontrolled and controlled organic HAP emissions estimation equations and factors, you must test the same formulae. In addition, you must develop both sets of equations and factors from the same tests.
§ 63.5875
How do I determine the capture efficiency of the enclosure on my wet-out area and the capture efficiency of my oven(s) for continuous lamination/casting operations?
(a) The capture efficiency of a wet-out area enclosure is assumed to be 100 percent if it meets the design and operation requirements for a permanent total enclosure (PTE) specified in EPA Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51. If a PTE does not exist, then a temporary total enclosure must be constructed and verified using EPA Method 204, and capture efficiency testing must be determined using EPA Methods 204B through E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.
(b) The capture efficiency of an oven is to be considered 100 percent, provided the oven is operated under negative pressure.
§ 63.5880
How do I determine how much neat resin plus is applied to the line and how much neat gel coat plus is applied to the line for continuous lamination/casting operations?
Use the following procedures to determine how much neat resin plus and neat gel coat plus is applied to the line each year.
(a) Track formula usage by end product/thickness combinations.
(b) Use in-house records to show usage. This may be either from automated systems or manual records.
(c) Record daily the usage of each formula/end product combination on each line. This is to be recorded at the end of each run (
i.e.,
when a changeover in formula or product is made) and at the end of each shift.
(d) Sum the amounts from the daily records to calculate annual usage of each formula/end product combination by line.
§ 63.5885
How do I calculate percent reduction to demonstrate compliance for continuous lamination/casting operations?
You may calculate percent reduction using any of the methods in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
(a)
Compliant line option.
If all of your wet-out areas have PTE that meet the requirements of EPA Method 204 of appendix M of 40 CFR part 51, and all of your wet-out area organic HAP emissions and oven organic HAP emissions are vented to an add-on control device, use Equation 1 of this section to demonstrate compliance. In all other situations, use Equation 2 of this section to demonstrate compliance.

# Continuous Compliance Requirements
§ 63.5895
How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?
(a) During production, you must collect and keep a record of data as indicated in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, if you are using an add-on control device.
(b) You must monitor and collect data as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) Except for monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must conduct all monitoring in continuous operation (or collect data at all required intervals) at all times that the affected source is operating.
(2) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities for purposes to this subpart, including data averages and calculations, or fulfilling a minimum data availability requirement, if applicable. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.
(3) At all times, you must maintain necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.
(4) A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring equipment to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
(c) You must collect and keep records of resin and gel coat use, organic HAP content, and operation where the resin is used if you are meeting any organic HAP emissions limits based on an organic HAP emissions limit in Tables 3 or 5 to this subpart. You must collect and keep records of resin and gel coat use, organic HAP content, and operation where the resin is used if you are meeting any organic HAP content limits in Table 7 to this subpart if you are averaging organic HAP contents. Resin use records may be based on purchase records if you can reasonably estimate how the resin is applied. The organic HAP content records may be based on MSDS or on resin specifications supplied by the resin supplier.
(d) Resin and gel coat use records are not required for the individual resins and gel coats that are demonstrated, as applied, to meet their applicable emission as defined in § 63.5810(a). However, you must retain the records of resin and gel coat organic HAP content, and you must include the list of these resins and gel coats and identify their application methods in your semiannual compliance reports. If after you have initially demonstrated that a specific combination of an individual resin or gel coat, application method, and controls meets its applicable emission limit, and the resin or gel coat changes or the organic HAP content increases, or you change the application method
or controls, then you again must demonstrate that the individual resin or gel coat meets its emission limit as specified in paragraph (a) of § 63.5810. If any of the previously mentioned changes results in a situation where an individual resin or gel coat now exceeds its applicable emission limit in Table 3 or 5 of this subpart, you must begin collecting resin and gel coat use records and calculate compliance using one of the averaging options on a 12-month rolling average.
(e) For each of your pultrusion machines, you must record all times that wet area enclosures doors or covers are open and there is resin present in the resin bath.
[68 FR 19402, Apr. 21, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 50128, Aug. 25, 2005]
§ 63.5900
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the standards?
(a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each standard in § 63.5805 that applies to you according to the methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) Compliance with organic HAP emissions limits for sources using add-on control devices is demonstrated following the procedures in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS. Sources using add-on controls may also use continuous emissions monitors to demonstrate continuous compliance as an alternative to control parameter monitoring.
(2) Compliance with organic HAP emissions limits is demonstrated by maintaining an organic HAP emissions factor value less than or equal to the appropriate organic HAP emissions limit listed in Table 3 or 5 to this subpart, on a 12-month rolling average, and/or by including in each compliance report a statement that individual resins and gel coats, as applied, meet the appropriate organic HAP emissions limits, as discussed in § 63.5895(d).
(3) Compliance with organic HAP content limits in Table 7 to this subpart is demonstrated by maintaining an average organic HAP content value less than or equal to the appropriate organic HAP contents listed in Table 7 to this subpart, on a 12-month rolling average, and/or by including in each compliance report a statement that resins and gel coats individually meet the appropriate organic HAP content limits in Table 7 to this subpart, as discussed in § 63.5895(d).
(4) Compliance with the work practice standards in Table 4 to this subpart is demonstrated by performing the work practice required for your operation.
(b) You must report each deviation from each standard in § 63.5805 that applies to you. The deviations must be reported according to the requirements in § 63.5910.
(c) You must meet the organic HAP emissions limits and work practice standards that apply to you at all times.

§ 63.5935
What definitions apply to this subpart?
Terms used in this subpart are defined in the CAA, in 40 CFR 63.2, and in this section as follows:
Atomized mechanical application
means application of resin or gel coat with spray equipment that separates the liquid into a fine mist. This fine mist may be created by forcing the liquid under high pressure through an elliptical orifice, bombarding a liquid stream with directed air jets, or a combination of these techniques.
Bulk molding compound (BMC)
means a putty-like molding compound containing resin(s) in a form that is ready to mold. In addition to resins, BMC may contain catalysts, fillers, and reinforcements. Bulk molding compound can be used in compression molding and injection molding operations to manufacture reinforced plastic composites products.
BMC manufacturing
means a process that involves the preparation of BMC.
Centrifugal casting
means a process for fabricating cylindrical composites, such as pipes, in which composite materials are positioned inside a rotating hollow mandrel and held in place by centrifugal forces until the part is sufficiently cured to maintain its physical shape.
Charge
means the amount of SMC or BMC that is placed into a compression or injection mold necessary to complete one mold cycle.
Cleaning
means removal of composite materials, such as cured and uncured resin from equipment, finished surfaces, floors, hands of employees, or any other surfaces.
Clear production gel coat
means an unpigmented, quick-setting resin used to improve the surface appearance and/or performance of composites. It can be used to form the surface layer of any composites other than those used for molds in tooling operations.
Closed molding
means a grouping of processes for fabricating composites in a way that HAP-containing materials are not exposed to the atmosphere except during the material loading stage (
e.g.,
compression molding, injection molding, and resin transfer molding). Processes where the mold is covered with plastic (or equivalent material) prior to resin application, and the resin is injected into the covered mold are also considered closed molding.
Composite
means a shaped and cured part produced by using composite materials.
Composite materials
means the raw materials used to make composites. The raw materials include styrene containing resins. They may also include gel coat, monomer, catalyst, pigment, filler, and reinforcement.
Compression molding
means a closed molding process for fabricating composites in which composite materials are placed inside matched dies that are used to cure the materials under heat and pressure without exposure to the atmosphere. The addition of mold paste or in-mold coating is considered part of the closed molding process. The composite materials used in this process are generally SMC or BMC.
Compression/injection molding
means a grouping of processes that involves the use of compression molding and/or injection molding.
Continuous casting
means a continuous process for fabricating composites in which composite materials are placed on an in-line conveyor belt to produce cast sheets that are cured in an oven.
Continuous lamination
means a continuous process for fabricating composites in which composite materials are typically sandwiched between plastic films, pulled through compaction rollers, and cured in an oven. This process is generally used to produce flat or corrugated products on an in-line conveyor.
Continuous lamination/casting
means a grouping of processes that involves the use of continuous lamination and/or continuous casting.
Controlled emissions

# Appendix A to Subpart WWWW of Part 63—Test Method for Determining Vapor Suppressant Effectiveness

# 1. Scope and Application
1.1
Applicability.
If a facility is using vapor suppressants to reduce hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions, the organic HAP emission factor equations in Table 1 to this subpart require that the vapor suppressant effectiveness factor be determined. The vapor suppressant effectiveness factor is then used as one of the inputs into the appropriate organic HAP emission factor equation. The vapor suppressant effectiveness factor test is not intended to quantify overall volatile emissions from a resin, nor to be used as a stand-alone test for emissions determination. This test is designed to evaluate the performance of film forming vapor suppressant resin additives. The results of this test are used only in combination with the organic HAP emissions factor equations in Table 1 to this subpart to generate emission factors.
1.1.1 The open molding process consists of application of resin and reinforcements to the mold surface, followed by a manual rollout process to consolidate the laminate, and the curing stage where the laminate surface is not disturbed. Emission studies have shown that approximately 50 percent to 55 percent of the emissions occur while the resin is being applied to the mold. Vapor suppressants have little effect during this portion of the lamination process, but can have a significant effect during the curing stage. Therefore, if a suppressant is 100 percent effective, the overall emissions from the process would be reduced by 45 percent to 50 percent, representing the emissions generated during the curing stage. In actual practice, vapor suppressant effectiveness will be less than 100 percent and the test results determine the specific effectiveness in terms of the vapor suppressant effectiveness factor. This factor represents the effectiveness of a specific combination of suppressant additive and resin formulation.
1.1.2 A resin manufacturer may supply a molder with a vapor-suppressed resin, and employ this test to provide the molder with the vapor suppressant effectiveness factor for that combination of resin and vapor suppressant. The factor qualifies the effectiveness of the vapor suppressant when the resin is tested in the specific formulation supplied to the molder. The addition of fillers or other diluents by the molder may impact the effectiveness of the vapor suppressant. The formulation, including resin/glass ratio and filler content, used in the test should be similar to the formulation to be used in production. The premise of this method is to compare laminate samples made with vapor suppressant additive and made without the additive. The difference in emissions between the two yields the vapor suppressant effectiveness factor.
1.1.3 The method uses a mass balance determination to establish the relative loss of the volatile component from unsaturated polyester or vinyl ester resins, with and without vapor suppressant additives. The effectiveness of a specific vapor suppressant and resin mixture is determined by comparing the relative volatile weight losses from vapor suppressed and non-suppressed resins. The volatile species are not separately analyzed. While the species contained in the volatile component are not determined, an extended listing of potential monomer that may be contained in unsaturated polyester or vinyl ester resins is provided in Table 1.1. However, most polyester and vinyl ester resin formulations presently used by the composites industry only contain styrene monomer.

# 2. Summary of Method
2.1 Differences in specific resin and suppressant additive chemistry affect the performance of a vapor suppressant. The purpose of this method is to quantify the effectiveness of a specific combination of vapor suppressant and unsaturated polyester or vinyl ester resin as they are to be used in production. This comparative test quantifies the loss of volatiles from a fiberglass reinforced laminate during the roll-out and curing emission phases, for resins formulated with and without a suppressant additive. A criterion for this method is the testing of a non-vapor suppressed resin system and testing the same resin with a vapor suppressant. The two resins are as identical as possible with the exception of the addition of the suppressant to one. The exact formulation used for the test will be determined by the in-use production requirements. Each formulation
of resin, glass, fillers, and additives is developed to meet particular customer and or performance specifications.
2.2 The result of this test is used as an input factor in the organic HAP emissions factor equations in Table 1 to this subpart, which allows these equations to predict emissions from a specific combination of resin and suppressant. This test does not provide an emission rate for the entire lamination process.

# 8. Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage
This test method involves the immediate recording of data during the roll out and curing phases of the lamination process during each test run. Samples are neither collected, preserved, nor stored.

# 9. Quality Control
Careful attention to the prescribed test procedure, routing equipment calibration, and replicate testing are the quality control activities for this test method. Refer to the procedures in section 11. A minimum of six test runs of a resin system without a suppressant and six test runs of the same resin with a suppressant shall be performed for each resin and suppressant test combination.

# 10. Calibration and Standardization
10.1 The laboratory balances, stopwatch, hygrometer and thermometer shall be maintained in a state of calibration prior to testing and thereafter on a scheduled basis as determined by the testing laboratory. This shall be accomplished by using certified calibration standards.
10.2 Calibration records shall be maintained for a period of 3 years.

# 11. Test Procedure
11.1 Test Set-up.
11.1.1 The laboratory balance is located in an enclosure to prevent fluctuations in balance readings due to localized air movement. The front of enclosure is open to permit work activity, but positioned so that local airflow will not effect balance readings. The ambient temperature is determined by suspending the thermometer at a point inside the enclosure.
11.1.2 The bottom of the aluminum pan is covered with the Mylar film. The film is held in position with tape or by friction between the pan and the film.
11.1.3 The resin and pan are brought to room temperature. This test temperature must be between 70 °F and 80 °F. The testing temperature cannot vary more than ±2 °F during the measurement of test runs. Temperature shall be recorded at the same time weight is recorded on suppressed and non-suppressed test data sheets, shown in Table 17.1.
11.1.4 The relative humidity may not change more than ±15 percent during the test runs. This is determined by recording the relative humidity in the vicinity of the test chamber at the beginning and end of an individual test run. This data is recorded on the test data sheets shown in Table 17.1.
11.1.5 Two plies of nominal 1.5 oz/ft
2
chopped strand mat (CSM) are cut into a square or rectangle with the minimum surface area of 60 square inches (
i.e.
a square with a side dimension of 7.75 inches).
11.1.6 The appropriate resin application roller is readily available.
11.2 Resin Gel Time/Initiator Percentage
11.2.1 Previous testing has indicated that resin gel time influences the emissions from composite production. The testing indicated that longer the gel times led to higher emissions. There are a number of factors that influence gel time including initiator type, initiator brand, initiator level, temperature and resin additives. Under actual usage conditions a molder will adjust the initiator to meet a gel time requirement. In this test procedure, the vapor suppressed and non-vapor suppressed resin systems will be adjusted to the same gel time by selecting the appropriate initiator level for each.
11.2.2 All test runs within a test will be processed in a manner that produces the same resin gel time ±2 minutes. To facilitate the resin mixing procedure, master batches of resin and resin plus vapor suppressant of resin are prepared. These resin master batches will have all of the required ingredients except initiator; this includes filler for filled systems. The gel times for the tests are conducted using the master batch and adjustments to meet gel time requirements shall be made to the master batch before emission testing is conducted. Test temperatures must be maintained within the required range, during gel time testing. Further gel time testing is not required after the non-vapor suppressed and vapor suppressed master batches are established with gel times within ±2 minutes. A sufficient quantity of each resin should be prepared to allow for additional test specimens in the event one or more test fails to meet the data acceptance criteria discussed in Section 11.5 and shown in Table 17.2.
11.2.3 The specific brand of initiator and the nominal percentage level recommended by the resin manufacturer will be indicated on the resin certificate of analysis
15
; or, if a unique gel time is required in a production laminate, initiator brand and percentage will be determined by that specific requirement.
11.2.4 Examples:
11.2.4.1 The resin for a test run is specified as having a 15-minute cup gel time at 77 °F using Brand X initiator at 1.5 percent by weight. The non-suppressed control resin has a 15-minute gel time. The suppressed resin has a gel time of 17-minutes. An initiator level of 1.5 percent would be selected for the both the non-suppressed and the suppressed test samples.
11.2.4.2 Based on a specific production requirement, a resin is processed in production using 2.25 percent of Brand Y initiator, which produces a 20-minute gel time. This initiator at level of 2.25 percent produces a 20
minute gel time for the non-suppressed control resin, but yields a 25-minute gel time for the suppressed resin sample. The suppressed resin is retested at 2.50 percent initiator and produces a 21-minute gel time. The initiator levels of 2.25 percent and 2.50 percent respectively would yield gel times within ±2 minutes.
11.3 Test Run Procedure for Unfilled Resin (see the data sheet shown in Table 17.1).
11.3.1 The insulating board is placed on the balance.
11.3.2 The aluminum pan with attached Mylar film is placed on the balance, and the balance is tared (weight reading set to zero with the plate on the balance.)
11.3.3 Place two plies of 1.5 oz. CSM on the balance and record the weight (glass weight).
11.3.4 The resin beaker and stirring rod are put on the second balance and tared.
11.3.5 The required resin weight and initiator weight are calculated (refer to calculation formulas in 12.2).
11.3.6 The disposable resin application roller is placed on the edge of the plate.
11.3.7 The balance is tared, with the aluminum pan, Mylar film, glass mat, and resin application roller on the balance pan.
11.3.8 Resin is weighed into a beaker, as calculated, using the second balance. The mixing stick should be tared with the beaker weight.
11.3.9 Initiator is weighed into the resin, as calculated, using an eyedropper or a pipette, and the combination is mixed.
11.3.10 Initiated resin is poured on chopped strand mat in a pe-determined pattern (see Figure 11.6).
11.3.11 A stopwatch is started from zero.
11.3.12 The initial laminate weight is recorded.
11.3.13 The plate is removed from balance to enable roll-out of the laminate.
11.3.14 The wet laminate is rolled with the resin application roller to completely distribute the resin, saturate the chopped strand mat, and eliminate air voids. Roll-out time should be in the range of 2 to 3
16
minutes and vary less than ±10 percent of the average time required for the complete set of six suppressed and six non-suppressed runs.
11.3.15 Record the rollout end time (time from start to completion of rollout).
11.3.16 Place the resin application roller on the edge of the plate when rollout is completed.
11.3.17 Place the plate back on the balance pan. Immediately record the weight.
11.3.18 For the first test in a series of six tests, weight is recorded every 5-minute interval (suppressed and non-suppressed). The end of the test occurs when three consecutive equal weights are recorded or a weight gain is observed (the last weight before the increased weight is the end of test weight). For the remaining five tests in the series, after the initial weights are taken, the next weight is recorded 30 minutes before the end of the test, as suggested by the results from the first test. It is likely that the time to reach the end point of a suppressed resin test will be shorter than the time required to complete a non-suppressed test. Therefore, the time to start taking data manually may be different for suppressed and non-suppressed resins.
11.4 Test Run Procedures for Filled Resin Systems
17
Note that the procedure for filled systems differs from the procedure for unfilled systems. With filled systems, resin is applied to one ply of the CSM and the second ply is placed on top of the resin.
11.4.1 The insulating board is placed on the balance.
11.4.2 The aluminum pan with attached Mylar film is placed on the balance, and the balance is tared (weight reading set to zero with the plate on the balance.)
11.4.3 Place two plies of 1.5 oz. CSM on the balance and record the weight (glass weight).
11.4.4 Remove the top ply of fiberglass and record its weight (weight of 1st layer of glass).
11.4.5 The required resin weight and initiator weight are calculated (refer to calculation formulas in 12.2). Calculate the weight of filled resin and initiator based on the 2 layers of fiberglass.
11.4.6 The resin beaker and stirring rod are put on the second balance and tared.
11.4.7 A disposable resin application roller is placed on the edge of the plate.
11.4.8 The balance is tared, with the aluminum pan, Mylar film, glass mat, and resin application roller on the balance pan.
11.4.9 Resin is weighed into the beaker, as calculated, using the second balance. The mixing stick should be tared with the beaker weight.
11.4.10 Initiator is weighed into the resin, as calculated, using an eyedropper or a pipette, and the combination is mixed.
11.4.11 Initiated resin is poured on the single ply of CSM in a pre-determined pattern. Refer to Figure 11.6.
11.4.12 A stopwatch is started from zero.
11.4.13 Record the weight of the resin ans single ply of CSM (L
1
). The initial laminate weight equals L
1
plus the weight of second glass layer.
11.4.14 Replace the second layer of fiberglass.
11.4.15 Remove the plate from the balance to allow roll-out of the laminate.
11.4.16 Roll the wet laminate with the resin application roller to completely distribute the resin, saturate the chopped strand mat, and eliminate air voids. Roll-out time should be in the range of 2 to 3
16
minutes and vary less than ±10 percent of the average time required for the complete set of six suppressed and six non-suppressed runs.
11.4.17 Record the roll-out end time (time from start to completion of rollout).
11.4.18 Place the resin application roller on the edge of the plate when rollout is completed.
11.4.19 Place the plate back on the balance pan. The initial weight is recorded immediately.
11.4.20 For the first test run in a series of six, weight is recorded at every 5-minute interval (suppressed and non-suppressed). The end of the test occurs when three consecutive equal weights are recorded or a weight gain is observed (the last weight before the increased weight is the end of test weight). For the remaining five tests in the series, after the initial weights are taken, the next weight is recorded 30 minutes before the end of the test, as suggested by the results from the first test. It is likely that the time to reach the end point of a suppressed resin test will be shorter than the time required to complete a non-suppressed test. Therefore, the time to start taking data manually may be different for suppressed and non-suppressed resins.
11.5 Data Acceptance Criteria:
11.5.1 A test set is designed as twelve individual test runs using the same resin, initiator, and gel time, six of the test runs use the resin non-vapor suppressed and the other six use it vapor suppressed.
11.5.2 If a test run falls outside any of the time, temperature, weight or humidity variation requirements, it must be discarded and run again.
11.5.3 The laminate roll out time for each individual test run must vary less than ±10 percent of the average time required for the complete set of six suppressed and six non-suppressed runs.
11.5.4 Test temperature for each test run must be maintained within ±2 °F and the average must be between 70° and 80 °F. Refer to 11.1.3.
11.5.5 The difference in the amount of resin for each run must be within ±10 percent of the average weight for the complete set of six suppressed and six non-suppressed runs.
11.5.6 The relative humidity from each test run must be within ±15 percent of the average humidity for the complete set of six suppressed and six non-suppressed tests. Refer to 11.1.4
11.5.7 The glass content for each test set must be within ±10 percent of the average resin-to-/glass ratio for the complete set of six suppressed and six non-suppressed runs. Refer to 12.2).
11.5.8 The filler content for each test of a test set must be within ±5 percent of the average filler content for the complete set of six suppressed and six non-suppressed runs. Refer to 12.2.
11.6 Resin Application Pour Pattern:
11.6.1 To facilitate the distribution of resin across the chopped strand mat, and to provide consistency from test to test, a uniform pour pattern should be used. A typical pour pattern is shown below:
ER21AP03.009
11.6.2 The resin is to be evenly distributed across the entire surface of the chopped strand mat using the resin application roller to achieve a wet look across the surface of the laminate. Pushing excess resin off the reinforcement and onto the Mylar sheet should be avoided. No resin is to be pushed more than
1/2
inch beyond the edge of the glass mat. If excess resin is pushed further from the glass mat, it will void the test run. As part of this process, typical visible air voids are to be eliminated by the rollout process. If the pour pattern is different from the above, it must be recorded and attached to test data sheet 17.1.

# 12. Data Analysis and Calculations
12.1 Data Analysis:
This test method requires a simple mass balance calculation, no special data analysis is necessary.
12.2 Calculations:
12.2.1 The target glass content (percent) for unfilled resin systems is determined from the specific production parameters being evaluated. In absence of any specific production requirements the target may be set at the tester's discretion.
12.2.2 Glass content determination (expressed as a per cent):
% Glass = Glass wt(g)/(Glass wt(g) + Resin weight (g))
12.2.3 Weight of resin required:
Resin weight required = (Glass wt (g)/% glass)—Glass wt (g)
12.2.4 Filled resin formulation determination for filled resin systems (
e.g.
30 percent filler by weight for a particulate filler, or
1 percent by weight for a lightweight filler, such as hollow microspheres):
% Resin content = resin
weight(g)/(resin weight(g) + glass
weight(g) + filler weight(g))
% Glass content = glass
weight(g)/(resin weight(g) + glass
weight(g) + filler weight(g))
Filler content = filler
weight(g)/(resin weight(g) + glass
weight(g) + filler weight(g))
12.2.5 Initiator weight determination:
Initiator weight (g) = Resin weight(g) × Initiator %
12.2.6 Emission weight loss determination:
Emissions weight loss (g) = Initial resin weight (g)−Final resin weight (g)
12.2.7 % Emission weight loss:
% Emission Weight Loss = (Emission weight loss (g) Initial resin weight (g) × 100
12.2.8 Average % Emission Weight Loss (assuming six test runs):
ER21AP03.010
12.2.9 VSE Factor calculation:
VSE Factor = 1 −(Average % VS Emission Weight Loss/Average NVS Emission Weight Loss)

HAP Emissions with vapor suppresants = ((0.286 × %HAP)−0.0529) × 2000 × (1-(0.5 × VSE factor))
HAP Emissions with vapor suppresants = ((0.286 × .35)−0.0529) × 2000 × (1−(0.5 × .45))
HAP Emissions with vapor suppresants = 73 pounds of HAP emissions per ton of resin.

13.1 Bias:
The bias of this test method has not been determined.
13.2 Precision Testing
13.2.1 Subsequent to the initial development of this test protocol by the Composites Fabricators Association, a series of tests were conducted in three different laboratory facilities. The purpose of this round robin testing was to verify the precision of the test method in various laboratories. Each laboratory received a sample of an orthophthalic polyester resin from the same production batch, containing 48 per cent styrene by weight. Each testing site was also provided with the same vapor suppressant additive.
The suppressant manufacturer specified the percentage level of suppressant additive. The resin manufacturer specified the type and level of initiator required to produce a 20 minute gel time. The target glass content was 30 percent by weight.
13.2.2 Each laboratory independently conducted the VSE test according to this method. A summary of the results is included in Table 13.1.

Balance Enclosure—The purpose of the balance enclosure is to prevent localized airflow from adversely affecting the laboratory balance. The enclosure may be a simple three-sided box with a top and an open face. The configuration of the enclosure is secondary to the purpose of providing a stable and steady balance reading, free from the effects of airflow, for accurate measurements. The enclosure can be fabricated locally. A typical enclosure is shown in Figure 17.1.

Certificate of Analysis: Resin gel time, as recorded on the resin certificate of analysis, is measured using a laboratory standard gel time procedure. This procedure typically uses a 100 gram cup sample at 77 °F (25 °C), a specific type of initiator and a specified percentage.
16
Roll-out times may vary with resin viscosity or resin additive. The important aspect of this step is to produce the same roll-out time for both the suppressed and non-suppressed samples.
17
While this test can be used with filled resin systems, the test is not designed to determine the effect of the filler on emissions, but rather to measure the effect of the suppressant additive in the resin system. When evaluating a filled system both the non-vapor suppressed and vapor suppressed samples should be formulated with the same type and level of filler.

# Subpart XXXX—National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Rubber Tire Manufacturing

# Source:
67 FR 45598, July 9, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.5980
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for rubber tire manufacturing. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate
initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations.
§ 63.5981
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a rubber tire manufacturing facility that is located at, or is a part of, a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions.
(1) Rubber tire manufacturing includes rubber processing, the production of rubber tires and/or the production of components integral to rubber tires, the production of tire cord, and the application of puncture sealant. Components of rubber tires include, but are not limited to, rubber compounds, sidewalls, tread, tire beads, tire cord and liners. Other components often associated with rubber tires but not integral to the tire, such as wheels, inner tubes, tire bladders, and valve stems, are not components of rubber tires or tire cord and are not subject to this subpart.
(2) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit considering controls, in the aggregate, any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.
(b) You are not subject to this subpart if the affected source at your rubber tire manufacturing facility meets either of the conditions described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) You own or operate a tire cord production affected source, but the primary product produced at the affected source is determined to be subject to another subpart under this part 63 as of the effective date of that subpart (publication date of the final rule) or startup of the source, whichever is later. In this case, you must determine which subpart applies to your source and you must be in compliance with the applicable subpart by the compliance date of that subpart. The primary product is the product that is produced for the greatest operating time over a 5-year period, based on expected utilization for the 5 years following the compliance date or following initial startup of the source, whichever is later.
(2) Your rubber tire manufacturing affected source is a research and development facility whose primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new processes and products, where such source is operated under the close supervision of technically trained personnel and is not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce, except in a de minimis manner.

(b) The affected sources are defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section (tire production), paragraph (b)(2) of this section (tire cord production), paragraph (b)(3) of this section (puncture sealant application), and paragraph (b)(4) of this section (rubber processing).
(1) The tire production affected source is the collection of all processes that use or process cements and solvents as defined in § 63.6022, located at any rubber tire manufacturing facility. It includes, but is not limited to: Storage and mixing vessels and the transfer equipment containing cements and/or solvents; wastewater handling and treatment operations; tread and cement operations; tire painting operations; ink and finish operations; undertread cement operations; process equipment cleaning materials; bead cementing operations; tire building operations; green tire spray operations; extruding, to the extent cements and solvents are used; cement house operations; marking operations; calendar operations, to the extent solvents are used; tire striping operations; tire repair operations; slab dip operations; other tire building operations, to the extent that cements and solvents are used; and balance pad operations.
(2) The tire cord production affected source is the collection of all processes engaged in the production of tire cord. It includes, but is not limited to: dipping operations, drying ovens, heat-set
ovens, bulk storage tanks, mixing facilities, general facility vents, air pollution control devices, and warehouse storage vents.
(3) The puncture sealant application affected source is the puncture sealant application booth operation used to apply puncture sealant to finished tires.
(4) The rubber processing affected source is the collection of all rubber mixing processes (
e.g.,
banburys and associated drop mills) that either mix compounds or warm rubber compound before the compound is processed into components of rubber tires. The mixed rubber compound itself is also included in the rubber processing affected source. On and before November 29, 2024, there are no emission limitations or other requirements for the rubber processing affected source. The emission limitations for the rubber processing affected source are effective after November 29, 2024.
(c) An affected source that is not a rubber processing affected source is a new affected source if construction of the affected source commenced after October 18, 2000, and it met the applicability criteria of § 63.5981 at the time construction commenced. An affected source that is a rubber processing affected source is a new affected source if construction of the affected source commenced after November 16, 2023, and it met the applicability criteria of § 63.5981 at the time construction commenced.
(d) An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the criteria as defined in § 63.2.
(e) An affected source is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.
[67 FR 45598, July 9, 2002, as amended at 89 FR 94907, Nov. 29, 2024]

If the results of an analysis by EPA Method 311 are different from the HAP content determined by another means, the EPA Method 311 results will govern compliance determinations.
(2) Unless you demonstrate otherwise, the HAP content analysis must be based on coatings prior to any cross-linking reactions,
i.e.,
curing. However, you may account for differences in HAP emissions resulting from chemical reactions based on the conversion rates of the individual coating formulations, chemistry demonstrations, or other demonstrations that are verifiable to the approving agency.

# Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements for Puncture Sealant Application Affected Sources
§ 63.6000
How do I conduct tests and procedures for puncture sealant application affected sources?
(a)
Methods to determine compliance with the puncture sealant application emission limitations in Table 3 to this subpart.
Use the methods and equations in paragraph (b) of this section to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the overall control efficiency compliance alternatives described in § 63.5989(a) and (b). Use the methods and equations in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section to demonstrate initial
and continuous compliance with the HAP constituent compliance alternative described in § 63.5989(c) and (d).
(b)
Methods to determine compliance with the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 1.
Follow the test procedures described in § 63.5993 to determine the overall control efficiency of your system.
(1) You must also meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) Conduct the performance test using a puncture sealant with an average mass percent HAP content that is representative of the puncture sealants typically used at your puncture sealant application affected source.
(ii) Establish all applicable operating limit ranges that correspond to the control system efficiency as described in Table 5 to this subpart.
(2) Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the overall efficiency of the control system. If you have a permanent total enclosure that satisfies EPA Method 204 (found in 40 CFR part 51, appendix M) criteria, assume 100 percent capture efficiency for variable F. Equation 1 follows:
ER09JY02.008
Where:
R = overall control system efficiency, percent.
F = capture efficiency of the capture system on add-on control device, percent, determined during the performance test.
E = control efficiency of add-on control device k, percent, determined during the performance test.
(3) Monitor the established operating limits as appropriate.
(i) If you use a thermal oxidizer, monitor the firebox secondary chamber temperature.
(ii) If you use a carbon adsorber, monitor the total regeneration stream mass or volumetric flow for each regeneration cycle, and the carbon bed temperature after each regeneration, and within 15 minutes of completing any cooling cycle.
(iii) For each control device used other than a thermal oxidizer or a regenerative carbon adsorber, install and operate a continuous parameter monitoring system according to your site-specific performance test plan submitted according to § 63.7(c)(2)(i).
(iv) If you use a permanent total enclosure, monitor the face velocity across the NDO in the enclosure. Also, if you use an enclosure, monitor to ensure that the sizes of the NDO have not changed, that there are no new NDO, and that a HAP emission source has not been moved closer to an NDO since the last performance test was conducted.
(v) If you use other capture systems, monitor the parameters identified in your monitoring plan.
(vi) Maintain the operating parameter within the operating range established during the performance test.
(c)
Methods to determine the mass percent of each HAP in puncture sealants.
To determine the HAP content in the puncture sealant used at your puncture sealant application affected source, use EPA Method 311 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63, an approved alternative method, or any other reasonable means for determining the HAP content of your puncture sealants. Other reasonable means include, but are not limited to: an MSDS, provided it contains appropriate information; a CPDS; or a manufacturer's hazardous air pollutant data sheet. You are not required to test the materials that you use, but the Administrator may require a test using EPA Method 311 (or an approved alternative method) to confirm the reported HAP content. If the results of an analysis by EPA Method 311 are different from the HAP content determined by another means, the EPA Method 311 results will govern compliance determinations.
(d)
Methods to determine compliance with the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 2.
Use the equations in
this paragraph (d) to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the HAP constituent emission limits for puncture sealant application affected sources using the compliance alternatives described in § 63.5989(c) and (d).
(1) Use Equation 2 of this section to calculate the monthly average HAP emission rate when complying by using puncture sealants without using an add-on control device to show that the monthly average HAP emissions do not exceed the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 2. Equation 2 follows:
ER09JY02.009
Where:
E
month
= mass of the specific HAP emitted per total mass of puncture sealants from all puncture sealants used at the puncture sealant affected source per month, grams per megagram.
HAP
i
= mass percent, expressed as a decimal, of the specific HAP in puncture sealant i, including any application booth dilution, determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
TPSEAL

= total mass of puncture sealant i used in the month, grams.
n = number of puncture sealants used in the month.
(2) Use Equation 3 of this section to calculate the monthly average HAP emission rate when complying by using puncture sealants by using an add-on control device to show that the monthly average HAP emissions do not exceed the emission limits in Table 3 to this subpart, option 2. Equation 3 follows:
ER09JY02.010
Where:
E
month
= mass of the specific HAP emitted per total mass of puncture sealants used at the puncture sealant affected source per month, grams per megagram.
HAP
i
= mass percent, expressed as a decimal, of the specific HAP in puncture sealant i, including any application booth dilution, determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for puncture sealants used in the month in processes that are not routed to a control device.
TPSEAL
i
= total mass of puncture sealant i used in the month in processes that are not routed to a control device, gram.
n = number of puncture sealants used in the month in processes that are not routed to a control device.
HAP
j
= mass percent, expressed as a decimal, of the specific HAP, in puncture sealant j, including any application booth dilution, determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, for puncture sealants used in the month in processes that are routed to a control device during operating days, which are defined as days when the control system is operating within the operating range established during the performance test and when monitoring data are collected.
TPSEAL
j
= total mass of puncture sealant j used in the month in processes that are routed to a control device during all operating days, grams.
EFF = efficiency of the control system determined during the performance test (capture system efficiency multiplied by the control device efficiency), percent.
m = number of puncture sealants used in the month that are routed to a control device during all operating days.
HAP
k
= mass percent, expressed as a decimal, of the specific HAP, in puncture sealant k, including any application booth dilution, for puncture sealants used in the month in processes that are routed to a control device during non-control operating days, which are defined as days when either the control system is not operating within the operating range established during the performance test or when monitoring data are not collected.
TPSEAL
k
= total mass of total mass of puncture sealant k used in the month in processes that are routed to a control device during all non-control operating days, grams.
p = number of puncture sealants used in the month that are routed to a control device during all non-control operating days.
(3) Each monthly calculation is a compliance demonstration for the purpose of this subpart.
(e)
Specific compliance demonstration requirements for puncture sealant application affected sources.
(1) Conduct any required compliance demonstrations according to the requirements in § 63.5993.
(2) Conduct the compliance demonstration using a puncture sealant with average mass percent HAP content that is representative of the puncture sealants typically used at your puncture sealant application affected source.
(3) Establish an operating range that corresponds to the appropriate control efficiency described in Table 5 to this subpart.
(f)
How to take credit for HAP emissions reductions from add-on control devices.
If you want to take credit in Equation 3 of this section for HAP emissions reduced using a control system, you must monitor the established operating parameters as appropriate and meet the requirements in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(g)
How to take credit for HAP emissions reductions when streams are combined.
When performing material balances to demonstrate compliance, if the storage of materials, exhaust, or the wastewater from more than one affected source are combined at the point where control systems are applied, any credit for emissions reductions needs to be prorated among the affected sources based on the ratio of their contribution to the uncontrolled emissions.
§ 63.6001

[89 FR 94909, Nov. 29, 2024]

# Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements for Rubber Processing Affected Sources
§ 63.6011
How do I conduct tests and procedures for rubber processing affected sources?
(a) Conduct any required compliance demonstration according to the requirements in § 63.5993 (b), (c), and (d).
(b) You must use the methods in table 17 of this subpart and according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section to measure emissions and stack gas flow rates and characteristics to determine THC and fPM or metal HAP mass emission rates in grams per day.
(1) You must operate a THC CEMS in accordance with the requirements in § 63.6012 and Performance Specification 8A in appendix B to 40 CFR part 60. For the purposes of conducting the accuracy and quality assurance evaluations for CEMS, the reference method (RM) is Method 25A of appendix A-7 to 40 CFR part 60. Owners or operators are
responsible for ensuring their instruments provide appropriate data continuously. If a THC monitor will be used for an emission stream that could have a wide variability in THC concentrations because of mixing both high-emitting and low-emitting compounds at different times, then a dual-span monitor should be considered for use. If the THC monitor is used for emissions that are relatively constant, then a dual-span monitor may not be needed, but it remains the responsibility of source owners or operators to make that determination. Owners and operators cannot discard from the compliance determination THC concentration data that exceed the calibration range of the monitor.
(2) Use the THC CEMS to conduct the initial compliance test for the first 15 mixer operating days after the applicable compliance date for each mixer. All THC values must be used as they are recorded by the THC CEMS, except that negative values equal to or greater than to −5 should be treated as zeros, and values less than (
i.e.,
more negative than) −5 cannot be used as valid compliance data in the calculations.
(3) To convert the THC concentration measurements to mass emission rates, you must measure the volumetric flow rate in the same duct or stack in which the THC concentration is monitored no less frequently than once every 5 years. You may use the same flow rate measurements that are completed for demonstrating compliance with the emission limits for fPM or total metal HAP according to table 17 of this subpart. If you change operations in a way that would likely result in a change to volumetric flow rate, you must conduct an additional measurement of the new volumetric flow rate.
(c) You must monitor mixed rubber compound processed in each mixer in Mg per day during the testing for THC. During the testing for fPM or total metal HAP, you must monitor the mixed rubber compound processed in each mixer in Mg for the same periods that fPM or total metal HAP testing runs are performed, excluding the mass of rubber processed during the time between fPM or metal HAP sampling runs.
(d) You must use the methods in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section to calculate the THC emission rate for the 15-day initial compliance period to demonstrate initial compliance. You must use the average THC emission rate obtained during the first 15 mixer operating days after the applicable compliance date to determine initial compliance for each mixer, group of mixers routed to the same control device or stack, or all mixers combined if complying with the facility-wide average alternative.
(1) Use Equation 1 to paragraph (d)(1) of this section to calculate the 15-day average THC emission rate in grams THC per megagram of mixed rubber compound processed. This emission rate is calculated for each rubber mixer separately, group of mixers routed to the same control device or stack, or for all rubber mixers combined if complying with the facility-wide average alternative.

# Equation 1 to Paragraph (d)(1)
ER29NO24.001
Where:
E
15 days
= Emission rate of the THC emitted per total mass of mixed rubber compounds processed per 15-day period, grams THC per megagram of mixed rubber compound processed.
THC
i
= Daily THC emissions for each day during the 15-day compliance period, grams/day, using the methods in paragraph (b) of this section. These THC emission values are calculated for each rubber mixer separately if compliance is demonstrated for each mixer separately, or for all rubber mixers combined if complying with the facility-wide average alternative. If you are demonstrating compliance for two or more mixers routed to the same control device or stack, then
these THC emission values are calculated using the data for the combined mixer emissions at the common stack.
RP
i
= Daily mass of mixed rubber compound processed for each day
i
during the 15-day compliance period, megagrams/day. These rubber mass processed values are calculated for each rubber mixer separately if compliance is demonstrated for each mixer separately, or for all rubber mixers combined if complying with the facility-wide emission average alternative. If you are demonstrating compliance for two or more mixers that are routed to the same control device or stack, then these rubber mass values are calculated for the combined mass processed for the mixers that share the common stack.
(2) Use Equation 2 to paragraph (d)(2) of this section to calculate the THC emission rate in grams per day THC as propane for each day
i
in the 15-day initial compliance period for rubber processing for each rubber mixer emission stack.

# Equation 2 to Paragraph (d)(2)
ER29NO24.002
Where:
THC
i
= Daily THC emissions from rubber processing, grams/day for each rubber mixer emission stack.
THC
j
= Daily average THC concentration, parts per million by volume, for each day during the 15-day compliance period for rubber processing for each rubber mixer emission stack, as measured by the THC CEMS.
Q = Average volumetric flow rate of gas, dry standard cubic feet per minute, dscfm, for each rubber mixer emission stack from the most recent available emissions test.
H = Hours per day that rubber processing is performed in at least one of the mixers vented to the rubber mixer emission stack for which emissions are being calculated.
(e) You must use Equation 3 to this paragraph to calculate the fPM emission rate in grams per megagram of mixed rubber compound processed or use Equation 4 to of this paragraph to calculate the metal HAP emission rate in grams per megagram of mixed rubber compound processed to demonstrate initial compliance. The rubber mass processed at each mixer must be recorded for the exact same period of time as the fPM or metal HAP emissions are measured at each mixer. If you are demonstrating compliance with the facility-wide emission average alternative, the relevant measurement of fPM or metal HAP, as appropriate, at each mixer does not need to be done simultaneously for all mixers, but all tests of mixers to be averaged must be done within the same 3-month period.

# Equations 3 and 4 to Paragraph (e)
ER29NO24.003
Where:
E
fPM
= Emission rate of the fPM emitted in grams of fPM per megagram of mixed rubber compound processed.
fPM
i
= Total grams of fPM emitted during the performance test, measured using EPA method 5. These fPM emission values are calculated for each rubber mixer
i separately if compliance is demonstrated for each mixer separately, and it is summed for all rubber mixers combined if complying with the facility-wide average alternative.
RP
j
= Total megagrams of mixed rubber compound mass processed rate recorded during the fPM (Eq. 3A) or total metal HAP emissions test (Eq. 3B).

# Subpart YYYY—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Stationary Combustion Turbines

# Source:
69 FR 10537, Mar. 5, 2004, unless otherwise noted.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.6080
What is the purpose of subpart YYYY?
Subpart YYYY establishes national emission limitations and operating limitations for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions from stationary combustion turbines located at major sources of HAP emissions, and requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission and operating limitations.
§ 63.6085
Am I subject to this subpart?
You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a stationary combustion turbine located at a major source of HAP emissions.
(a) Stationary combustion turbine means all equipment, including but not limited to the turbine, the fuel, air, lubrication and exhaust gas systems,
control systems (except emissions control equipment), and any ancillary components and sub-components comprising any simple cycle stationary combustion turbine, any regenerative/recuperative cycle stationary combustion turbine, the combustion turbine portion of any stationary cogeneration cycle combustion system, or the combustion turbine portion of any stationary combined cycle steam/electric generating system. Stationary means that the combustion turbine is not self propelled or intended to be propelled while performing its function, although it may be mounted on a vehicle for portability or transportability. Stationary combustion turbines covered by this subpart include simple cycle stationary combustion turbines, regenerative/recuperative cycle stationary combustion turbines, cogeneration cycle stationary combustion turbines, and combined cycle stationary combustion turbines. Stationary combustion turbines subject to this subpart do not include turbines located at a research or laboratory facility, if research is conducted on the turbine itself and the turbine is not being used to power other applications at the research or laboratory facility.
(b) A major source of HAP emissions is a contiguous site under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07 megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per year, except that for oil and gas production facilities, a major source of HAP emissions is determined for each surface site.
§ 63.6090
What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
This subpart applies to each affected source.
(a)
Affected source.
An affected source is any existing, new, or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine located at a major source of HAP emissions.
(1)
Existing stationary combustion turbine.
A stationary combustion turbine is existing if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the stationary combustion turbine on or before January 14, 2003. A change in ownership of an existing stationary combustion turbine does not make that stationary combustion turbine a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine.
(2)
New stationary combustion turbine.
A stationary combustion turbine is new if you commenced construction of the stationary combustion turbine after January 14, 2003.
(3)
Reconstructed stationary combustion turbine.
A stationary combustion turbine is reconstructed if you meet the definition of reconstruction in § 63.2 of subpart A of this part and reconstruction is commenced after January 14, 2003.
(b)
Subcategories with limited requirements.
(1) A new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine located at a major source which meets either of the following criteria does not have to meet the requirements of this subpart and of subpart A of this part except for the initial notification requirements of § 63.6145(d):
(i) The stationary combustion turbine is an emergency stationary combustion turbine; or
(ii) The stationary combustion turbine is located on the North Slope of Alaska.
(2) A stationary combustion turbine which burns landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis, or a stationary combustion turbine where gasified municipal solid waste (MSW) is used to generate 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis does not have to meet the requirements of this subpart except for:
(i) The initial notification requirements of § 63.6145(d); and
(ii) Additional monitoring and reporting requirements as provided in §§ 63.6125(c) and 63.6150.
(3) An existing, new, or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine with a rated peak power output of less than 1.0 megawatt (MW) at International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard day conditions, which is located at a major source, does not have to meet the requirements of this subpart and of subpart A of this part. This determination applies to the capacities of individual combustion turbines, whether or not an aggregated group of combustion turbines has a common
add-on air pollution control device. No initial notification is necessary, even if the unit appears to be subject to other requirements for initial notification. For example, a 0.75 MW emergency turbine would not have to submit an initial notification.
(4) Existing stationary combustion turbines in all subcategories do not have to meet the requirements of this subpart and of subpart A of this part. No initial notification is necessary for any existing stationary combustion turbine, even if a new or reconstructed turbine in the same category would require an initial notification.
(5) Combustion turbine engine test cells/stands do not have to meet the requirements of this subpart but may have to meet the requirements of subpart A of this part if subject to another subpart. No initial notification is necessary, even if the unit appears to be subject to other requirements for initial notification.
§ 63.6092
Are duct burners and waste heat recovery units covered by subpart YYYY?
No, duct burners and waste heat recovery units are considered steam generating units and are not covered under this subpart. In some cases, it may be difficult to separately monitor emissions from the turbine and duct burner, so sources are allowed to meet the required emission limitations with their duct burners in operation.
§ 63.6095
When do I have to comply with this subpart?
(a)
Affected sources.
(1) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix oil-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame oil-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart on or before March 5, 2004, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart no later than March 5, 2004.
(2) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix oil-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame oil-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart after March 5, 2004, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.
(3) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix gas-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame gas-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart on or before March 9, 2022, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart no later than March 9, 2022.
(4) If you start up a new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix gas-fired stationary combustion turbine or a diffusion flame gas-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart after March 9, 2022, you must comply with the emissions limitations and operating limitations in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.
(b)
Area sources that become major sources.
If your new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine is an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP, it must be in compliance with any applicable requirements of this subpart when it becomes a major source.
(c) You must meet the notification requirements in § 63.6145 according to the schedule in § 63.6145 and in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.
[69 FR 10537, Mar. 5, 2004, as amended at 69 FR 51188, Aug. 18, 2004; 87 FR 13192, Mar. 9, 2022]

# Emission and Operating Limitations
§ 63.6100
What emission and operating limitations must I meet?
For each new or reconstructed stationary combustion turbine which is a lean premix gas-fired stationary combustion turbine, a lean premix oil-fired stationary combustion turbine, a diffusion flame gas-fired stationary combustion turbine, or a diffusion flame oil-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined by this subpart, you must comply with the emission limitations and operating limitations in Table 1 and Table 2 of this subpart.

# General Compliance Requirements
§ 63.6105
What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
(a) Before September 8, 2020, you must be in compliance with the emission limitations and operating limitations which apply to you at all times except during startup, shutdown, and malfunctions. After September 8, 2020, you must be in compliance with the emission limitations, operating limitations, and other requirements in this subpart which apply to you at all times.
(b) Before September 8, 2020, if you must comply with emission and operating limitations, you must operate and maintain your stationary combustion turbine, oxidation catalyst emission control device or other air pollution control equipment, and monitoring equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions at all times including during startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
(c) After September 8, 2020, at all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
[85 FR 13539, Mar. 9, 2020]

You must measure these operating parameters during the initial performance test and continuously monitor thereafter. Alternatively, you may petition the Administrator for approval of no additional operating limitations. If you submit a petition under this section, you must not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has been approved or disapproved by the Administrator.
(f) If your stationary combustion turbine is not equipped with an oxidation catalyst and you petition the Administrator for approval of additional operating limitations to demonstrate compliance with the formaldehyde emission limitation in Table 1, your petition must include the following information described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as additional operating limitations;
(2) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and HAP emissions, identifying how HAP emissions change with changes in these parameters and how limitations on these parameters will serve to limit HAP emissions;
(3) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower values for these parameters which will establish the limits on these parameters in the operating limitations;
(4) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments; and
(5) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these parameters.
(g) If you petition the Administrator for approval of no additional operating limitations, your petition must include the information described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) Identification of the parameters associated with operation of the stationary combustion turbine and any emission control device which could change intentionally (
e.g.,
operator adjustment, automatic controller adjustment, etc.) or unintentionally (
e.g.,
wear and tear, error, etc.) on a routine basis or over time;
(2) A discussion of the relationship, if any, between changes in the parameters and changes in HAP emissions;
(3) For the parameters which could change in such a way as to increase HAP emissions, a discussion of why establishing limitations on the parameters is not possible;
(4) For the parameters which could change in such a way as to increase HAP emissions, a discussion of why you could not establish upper and/or lower values for the parameters which would establish limits on the parameters as operating limitations;
(5) For the parameters which could change in such a way as to increase
HAP emissions, a discussion identifying the methods you could use to measure them and the instruments you could use to monitor them, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of the methods and instruments;
(6) For the parameters, a discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you could use to monitor them; and
(7) A discussion of why, from your point of view, it is infeasible, unreasonable or unnecessary to adopt the parameters as operating limitations.
