Test methods and procedures.
(a)
Composition determination.
Compliance with the hand-wipe cleaning solvent approved composition list specified in § 63.744(b)(1) for hand-wipe cleaning solvents shall be demonstrated using data supplied by the manufacturer of the cleaning solvent. The data shall identify all components of the cleaning solvent and shall demonstrate that one of the approved composition definitions is met.
(b)
Vapor pressure determination.
The composite vapor pressure of hand-wipe cleaning solvents used in a cleaning operation subject to this subpart shall be determined as follows:
(1) For single-component hand-wipe cleaning solvents, the vapor pressure shall be determined using MSDS or other manufacturer's data, standard engineering reference texts, or other equivalent methods.
(2) The composite vapor pressure of a blended hand-wipe solvent shall be determined by quantifying the amount of each organic compound in the blend using manufacturer's supplied data or a gas chromatographic analysis in accordance with ASTM E 260-91 or 96 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14 of subpart A of this part) and by calculating the composite vapor pressure of the solvent by summing the partial pressures of each component. The vapor pressure of each component shall be determined using manufacturer's data, standard engineering reference texts, or other equivalent methods. The following equation shall be used to determine the composite vapor pressure:

Organic HAP content level determination—compliant primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings.
For those uncontrolled primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings complying with the primer, topcoat, or specialty coating organic HAP content limits specified in § 63.745(c) without being averaged, the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section shall be used to determine the mass of organic HAP emitted per volume of coating (less water) as applied. As an alternative to the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, an owner or operator may use the coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate that organic HAP emitted per volume of coating (less water), as applied, is less than or equal to the applicable organic HAP limit specified in § 63.745(c). Owners and operators that use the coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate compliance based on the HAP content of the coating may add non-HAP solvent to those coatings provided that the owner or operator also maintains records of the non-HAP solvent added to the coating.
(1) For coatings that contain no exempt solvents, determine the total organic HAP content using manufacturer's supplied data or Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to determine the VOC content. The VOC content shall be used as a surrogate for total HAP content for coatings that contain no exempt solvent. If there is a discrepancy between the manufacturer's formulation data and the results of the Method 24 analysis, compliance shall be based on the results from the Method 24 analysis.
When Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content of water-reducible coatings, the precision adjustment factors in Reference Method 24 shall be used. If the adjusted analytical VOC content is less than the formulation solvent content, then the analytical VOC content should be set equal to the formulation solvent content.
(2) For each coating formulation as applied, determine the organic HAP weight fraction, water weight fraction (if applicable), and density from manufacturer's data. If the value for organic HAP weight fraction cannot be determined using the manufacturer's data, the owner or operator shall use Method 311 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, or submit an alternative procedure for determining the value for approval by the Administrator. If the values for water weight fraction (if applicable) and density cannot be determined using the manufacturer's data, the owner or operator shall submit an alternative procedure for determining their values for approval by the Administrator. Recalculation is required only when a change occurs in the coating formulation. If there is a discrepancy between the manufacturer's formulation data and the results of the Method 311 analysis, compliance shall be based on the results from the Method 311 analysis.

For those uncontrolled primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings that are averaged together in order to comply with the primer, topcoat, and specialty coating organic HAP content limits specified in § 63.745(c), the following procedure shall be used to determine the monthly volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP emitted per volume of coating (less water) as applied, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter averaging period as part of an ambient ozone control program.
(1)(i) Determine the total organic HAP weight fraction as applied of each coating. If any ingredients, including diluent solvent, are added to a coating prior to its application, the organic HAP weight fraction of the coating shall be determined at a time and location in the process after all ingredients have been added.
(ii) Determine the total organic HAP weight fraction of each coating as applied each month.

(B) If a change in formulation or a change in the ingredients added to the coating takes place, including the ratio of coating to diluent solvent, prior to its application, either of which results in a more than minimal effect on the organic HAP content of the coating, the total organic HAP weight fraction of the coating shall be redetermined.
(iii) Manufacturer's formulation data may be used to determine the total organic HAP content of each coating and any ingredients added to the coating prior to its application. If the total organic HAP content cannot be determined using the manufacturer's data, the owner or operator shall use Method 311 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A for determining the total organic HAP weight fraction, or shall submit an alternative procedure for determining the total organic HAP weight fraction for approval by the Administrator. If there is a discrepancy between the manufacturer's formulation data and the results of the Method 311 analysis, compliance shall be based on the results from the Method 311 analysis.
(2)(i) Determine the volume both in total gallons as applied and in total gallons (less water) as applied of each coating. If any ingredients, including diluent solvents, are added prior to its application, the volume of each coating shall be determined at a time and location in the process after all ingredients (including any diluent solvent) have been added.
(ii) Determine the volume of each coating (less water) as applied each month, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter period as part of an ambient ozone control program.

(ii) Determine the density of each coating as applied each month, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter period as part of an ambient ozone control program.
(A) If no changes have been made to a coating, either as supplied or as applied, or if a change has been made that has a minimal effect on the density of the coating, then the value previously determined may continue to be used until a change in formulation has been made by either the manufacturer or the user.
(B) If a change in formulation or a change in the ingredients added to the coating takes place, including the ratio of coating to diluent solvent, prior to its application, either of which results in a more than minimal effect on the density of the coating, then the density of the coating shall be redetermined.
(iii) The density may be determined from company records, including manufacturer's data sheets. If the density of the coating cannot be determined using the company's records, including the manufacturer's data, then the owner or operator shall submit an alternative procedure for determining the density for approval by the Administrator.

For those uncontrolled primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings complying with the primer, topcoat, and specialty coating VOC content levels specified in § 63.745(c) without being averaged, the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section shall be used to determine the mass of VOC emitted per volume of coating (less water and exempt solvents) as applied. As an alternative to the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section, an owner or operator may use coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate that VOC emitted per volume of coating (less water and exempt solvents), as applied, is less than or equal to the applicable VOC limit specified in § 63.745(c).
(1) Determine the VOC content of each formulation (less water and exempt solvents) as applied using manufacturer's supplied data or Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to determine the VOC content. The VOC content shall be used as a surrogate for total HAP content for coatings that contain no exempt solvent. If there is a discrepancy between the manufacturer's formulation data and the results of the Method 24 analysis, compliance shall be based on the results from the Method 24 analysis.
When Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content of water-reducible coatings, the precision adjustment factors in Reference Method 24 shall be used. If the adjusted analytical VOC content is less than the formulation solvent content, then the analytical VOC content should be set equal to the formulation solvent content.
(2) For each coating applied, calculate the mass of VOC emitted per volume of coating (lb/gal) (less water and exempt solvents) as applied using equations 5, 6, and 7:
ER01SE95.008
where:
V
wi
= volume (gal) of water in one gal of coating i.
D

= volume (gal) of exempt solvents in one gal of coating i.
(3)(i) If the VOC content is found to be different when EPA Method 24 is used during an enforcement inspection from that used by the owner or operator in calculating G
a
, compliance shall be based, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, upon the VOC content obtained using EPA Method 24.
(ii) If the VOC content of a coating obtained using Method 24 would indicate noncompliance as determined under either § 63.749 (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i), an owner or operator may elect to average the coating with other uncontrolled coatings and (re)calculate G
i
(using the procedure specified in paragraph (f) of this section), provided appropriate and sufficient records were maintained for all coatings included in the average (re)calculation. The (re)calculated value of G
i
(G
a
in paragraph (f)) for the averaged coatings shall then be used to determine compliance.
(f)
VOC content level determination—averaged primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings
. For those uncontrolled primers, topcoats, and specialty coatings that are averaged within their respective coating category in order to comply with the primer, topcoat, and specialty coating VOC content limits specified in § 63.745(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(6), the following procedure shall be used to determine the monthly volume-weighted average mass of VOC emitted per volume of coating (less water and exempt solvents) as applied, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter averaging period as part of an ambient ozone control program.
(1)(i) Determine the VOC content (lb/gal) as applied of each coating. If any ingredients, including diluent solvent, are added to a coating prior to its application, the VOC content of the coating shall be determined at a time and location in the process after all ingredients have been added.
(ii) Determine the VOC content of each coating as applied each month, unless the permitting agency specifies a shorter period as part of an ambient ozone control program.
(A) If no changes have been made to a coating, either as supplied or as applied, or if a change has been made that has a minimal effect on the VOC content of the coating, the value previously determined may continue to be used until a change in formulation has been made by either the manufacturer or the user.
(B) If a change in formulation or a change in the ingredients added to the coating takes place, including the ratio of coating to diluent solvent, prior to its application, either of which results in a more than minimal effect on the VOC content of the coating, the VOC content of the coating shall be redetermined.
(iii) Determine the VOC content of each primer, topcoat, and specialty coating formulation (less water and exempt solvents) as applied using EPA Method 24 or from manufacturer's data.
(2)(i) Determine the volume both in total gallons as applied and in total gallons (less water and exempt solvents) as applied of each coating. If any ingredients, including diluent solvents, are added prior to its application, the volume of each coating shall be determined at a time and location in the process after all ingredients (including any diluent solvent) have been added.
(ii) Determine the volume of each coating (less water and exempt solvents) as applied each day.
(iii) The volume applied may be determined from company records.
(3) Calculate the total volume in gallons (less water and exempt solvents) as applied by summing the individual volumes of each coating (less water and exempt solvents) as applied, which
were determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(4) Calculate the volume-weighted average mass of VOC emitted per unit volume (lb/gal) of coating (less water and exempt solvents) as applied for each coating category during each 30-day period using equation 8:
ER01SE95.011
where:
G

C
lwes
= total volume (gal) of all coatings (less water and exempt solvents) as applied during each 30-day period for those coatings being averaged.
(5)(i) If the VOC content is found to be different when EPA Method 24 is used during an enforcement inspection from that used by the owner or operator in calculating G
a
, recalculation of G
a
is required using the new value. If more than one coating is involved, the recalculation shall be made once using all of the new values.
(ii) If recalculation is required, an owner or operator may elect to include in the recalculation of G
a
uncontrolled coatings that were not previously included provided appropriate and sufficient records were maintained for these other coatings to allow daily recalculations.
(iii) The recalculated value of G

When an initial compliance demonstration is required by this subpart, the procedures in paragraphs (g)(9) through (g)(14) of this section shall be used in determining initial compliance with the provisions of this subpart.
(1) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d) when emissions are controlled by a dedicated solvent recovery device, each owner or operator of the affected operation may perform a liquid-liquid HAP or VOC material balance over rolling 7- to 30-day periods in lieu of demonstrating compliance through the methods in paragraph (g)(2), (g)(3), or (g)(4) of this section. Results of the material balance calculations performed to demonstrate initial compliance shall be submitted to the Administrator with the notification of compliance status required by § 63.9(h) and by § 63.753 (c)(1)(iv), (d)(3)(i), and (e)(3). When demonstrating compliance by this procedure, § 63.7(e)(3) of subpart A does not apply. The amount of liquid HAP or VOC applied and recovered shall be determined as discussed in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section. The overall HAP or VOC emission reduction (R) is calculated using equation 9:
ER01SE95.012
(i) The value of RS

(2) To demonstrate initial compliance with § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d) when affected HAP emission points are controlled by an emission control device other than a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each carbon adsorber vessel, each owner or operator of an affected source shall perform a gaseous emission test using the following procedures.
(i) Construct the overall HAP emission reduction system so that all volumetric flow rates and total HAP or VOC emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in § 63.750(g) (9) through (14).
(ii) Determine capture efficiency from the HAP emission points by capturing, venting, and measuring all HAP emissions from the HAP emission points. During a performance test, the owner or operator of affected HAP emission points located in an area with other gaseous emission sources not affected by this subpart shall isolate the affected HAP emission points from all other gaseous emission points by one of the following methods:
(A) Build a temporary total enclosure around the affected HAP emission point(s); or
(B) Shut down all gaseous emission points not affected by this subpart and continue to exhaust fugitive emissions from the affected HAP emission points through any building ventilation system and other room exhausts such as drying ovens. All ventilation air must be vented through stacks suitable for testing.
(iii) Operate the emission control device with all affected HAP emission points connected and operating.
(iv) Determine the efficiency (E) of the control device using equation 10:
(v) Determine the efficiency (F) of the capture system using equation 11:
ER01SE95.013
(vi) For each HAP emission point subject to § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (E) × (F) is equal to or greater than the overall HAP control efficiencies required under § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d).
(3) To demonstrate compliance with § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d) when affected HAP emission points are controlled by a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each carbon adsorber vessel, each owner or operator of an affected source shall perform a gaseous emission test using the following procedures:

sys
) × (F) is equal to or greater than the overall HAP control efficiency required by § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d).
(4) An alternative method of demonstrating compliance with § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d) is the installation of a total enclosure around the affected HAP emission point(s) and the ventilation of all HAP emissions from the total enclosure to a control device with the efficiency specified in paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section. If this method is selected, the compliance test methods described in paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2), and (g)(3) of this section are not required. Instead, each owner or operator of an affected source shall:
(i) Demonstrate that a total enclosure is installed. An enclosure that meets the requirements in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) (A) through (D) of this section shall be considered a total enclosure. The owner or operator of an enclosure that does not meet these requirements may apply to the Administrator for approval of the enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. The enclosure shall be considered a total enclosure if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that all HAP emissions from the affected HAP emission point(s) are contained and vented to the control device. The requirements for automatic approval are as follows:
(A) The total area of all natural draft openings shall not exceed 5% of the total surface area of the total enclosure's walls, floor, and ceiling;
(B) All sources of emissions within the enclosure shall be a minimum of four equivalent diameters away from each natural draft opening;
(C) The average inward face velocity (FV) across all natural draft openings shall be a minimum of 3,600 meters per hour as determined by the following procedures:

(
2
) Determine FV by equation 14:
ER01SE95.016
(D) The air passing through all natural draft openings shall flow into the enclosure continuously. If FV is less than or equal to 9,000 meters per hour, the continuous inward flow of air shall be verified by continuous observation using smoke tubes, streamers, tracer gases, or other means approved by the Administrator over the period that the volumetric flow rate tests required to
determine FV are carried out. If FV is greater than 9,000 meters per hour, the direction of airflow through the natural draft openings shall be presumed to be inward at all times without verification.
(ii) Determine the control device efficiency using equation 10 or equations 12 and 13, as applicable, and the test methods and procedures specified in § 63.750(g) (9) through (14).

The design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition, component concentrations, flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, capacity of the carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for the carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and the emission point operating schedule.
(6)(i) To demonstrate initial compliance with § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d) when hard piping or ductwork is used to direct VOC and HAP emissions from a VOC and HAP source to the control device, each owner or operator shall demonstrate upon inspection that the criteria of paragraph (g)(6)(i)(A) and paragraph (g)(6)(i) (B) or (C) of this section VR/FD are met.
(A) The equipment shall be vented to a control device.
(B) The control device efficiency (E or H
sys
, as applicable) determined using equation 10 or equations 12 and 13, respectively, and the test methods and procedures specified in § 63.750(g) (9) through (14), shall be equal to or greater than the overall HAP control efficiency required by § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d).
(C) When a nonregenerative carbon adsorber is used, the ductwork from the affected emission point(s) shall be vented to the control device and the carbon adsorber shall be demonstrated, through the procedures of § 63.750(g) (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5), to meet the requirements of § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d).
(7) Startups and shutdowns are normal operation for this source category. Emissions from these activities are to be included when determining if the standards specified in § 63.745(d), § 63.746(c), or § 63.747(d) are being attained.
(8) An owner or operator who uses compliance techniques other than those specified in this subpart shall submit a description of those compliance procedures, subject to the Administrator's approval, in accordance with § 63.7(f) of subpart A.
(9) Either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A of appendix A of part 60, as appropriate to the conditions at the site, shall be used to determine VOC and HAP concentration of air exhaust streams as required by § 63.750(g) (1) through (6). The owner or operator shall submit notice of the intended test method to the Administrator for approval along with the notification of the performance test required under § 63.7(b). Method selection shall be based on consideration of the diversity of organic species present and their total concentration and on consideration of the potential presence of interfering gases. Except as indicated in paragraphs (g)(9) (i) and (ii) of this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 30 minutes.
(i) When either EPA Method 18 or EPA Method 25A is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust stack for all the individual carbon adsorber vessels pursuant to paragraph (g) (2) or (4) of this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences through the adsorption cycles of all of the individual carbon adsorber vessels.

Organic HAP content level determination—compliant chemical milling maskants.
For those uncontrolled chemical milling maskants complying with the chemical milling maskant organic HAP content limit specified in § 63.747(c)(1) without being averaged, the procedure in paragraph (k)(1) of this section shall be used to determine the mass of organic HAP emitted per unit volume of coating (chemical milling maskant) i as applied (less water), H
i
(lb/gal). As an alternative to the procedures in paragraph (k)(1) of this section, an owner or operator may use coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate that organic HAP emitted per volume of coating (less water), as applied, is less than or equal to the applicable organic HAP limit specified in § 63.747(c). Owners and operators that use the coating manufacturer's supplied data to demonstrate compliance based on the HAP content of the coating may add non-HAP solvent to those coatings provided that the owner or operator also maintains records of the non-HAP solvent added to the coating.
(1) For coatings that contain no exempt solvents, determine the total organic HAP content using manufacturer's supplied data or Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to determine the VOC content. The VOC content shall be used as a surrogate for total HAP content for coatings that contain no exempt solvent. If there is a discrepancy between the manufacturer's formulation data and the results of the Method 24 analysis, compliance shall be based on the results from the Method 24 analysis.
When Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content of water-reducible coatings, the precision adjustment factors in Reference Method 24 shall be used. If the adjusted analytical VOC content is less than the formulation solvent content, then the analytical VOC content should be set equal to the formulation solvent content.

—A coating that chars when exposed to open flame or extreme temperatures, as would occur during the failure of an engine casing or during aerodynamic heating. The ablative char surface serves as an insulative barrier, protecting adjacent components from the heat or open flame.
Adhesion promoter
—A very thin coating applied to a substrate to promote wetting and form a chemical bond with the subsequently applied material.
Adhesive bonding primer
—A primer applied in a thin film to aerospace components for the purpose of corrosion inhibition and increased adhesive bond strength by attachment. There are two categories of adhesive bonding primers: primers with a design cure at 250 °F or below and primers with a design cure above 250 °F.
Aerosol coating
—A hand-held, pressurized, nonrefillable container that expels an adhesive or a coating in a finely divided spray when a valve on the container is depressed.
Antichafe coating
—A coating applied to areas of moving aerospace components that may rub during normal operations or installation.
Bearing coating
—A coating applied to an antifriction bearing, a bearing housing, or the area adjacent to such a bearing in order to facilitate bearing function or to protect base material from excessive wear. A material shall not be classified as a bearing coating if it can also be classified as a dry lubricative material or a solid film lubricant.
Bonding maskant
—A temporary coating used to protect selected areas of aerospace parts from strong acid or alkaline solutions during processing for bonding.
Caulking and smoothing compounds
—Semi-solid materials which are applied by hand application methods and are used to aerodynamically smooth exterior vehicle surfaces or fill cavities such as bolt hole accesses. A material shall not be classified as a caulking and smoothing compound if it can also be classified as a sealant.
Chemical agent-resistant coating (CARC)
—An exterior topcoat designed to withstand exposure to chemical warfare agents or the decontaminants used on these agents.
Clear coating
—A transparent coating usually applied over a colored opaque coating, metallic substrate, or placard to give improved gloss and protection to the color coat. In some cases, a clearcoat refers to any transparent coating without regard to substrate.
Commercial exterior aerodynamic structure primer
—A primer used on aerodynamic components and structures that protrude from the fuselage, such as wings and attached components, control surfaces, horizontal stabilizers, vertical fins, wing-to-body fairings, antennae, and landing gear and doors, for the purpose of extended corrosion protection and enhanced adhesion.
Commercial interior adhesive
—Materials used in the bonding of passenger cabin interior components. These components must meet the FAA fireworthiness requirements.
Compatible substrate primer
—Includes two categories: compatible epoxy primer and adhesive primer.
Compatible epoxy primer
is primer that is compatible with the filled elastomeric coating and is epoxy based. The compatible substrate primer is an epoxy-polyamide primer used to promote adhesion of elastomeric coatings such as impact-resistant coatings.
Adhesive primer
is a coating that (1) inhibits corrosion and serves as a primer applied to bare metal surfaces or prior to adhesive application, or (2) is applied to surfaces that can be expected to contain fuel. Fuel tank coatings are excluded from this category.
Corrosion prevention system
—A coating system that provides corrosion protection by displacing water and penetrating mating surfaces, forming a protective barrier between the metal surface and moisture. Coatings containing oils or waxes are excluded from this category.
Critical use and line sealer maskant
—A temporary coating, not covered under other maskant categories, used to protect selected areas of aerospace parts from strong acid or alkaline solutions such as those used in anodizing, plating, chemical milling and processing of magnesium, titanium, high-strength steel, high-precision aluminum chemical milling of deep cuts, and aluminum chemical milling of complex shapes. Materials used for repairs or to bridge gaps left by scribing operations (i.e. line sealer) are also included in this category.
Cryogenic flexible primer
—A primer designed to provide corrosion resistance, flexibility, and adhesion of subsequent coating systems when exposed to loads up to and surpassing the yield point of the substrate at cryogenic temperatures (−275 °F and below).
Cryoprotective coating
—A coating that insulates cryogenic or subcooled surfaces to limit propellant boil-off, maintain structural integrity of metallic structures during ascent or re-entry, and prevent ice formation.
Cyanoacrylate adhesive
—A fast-setting, single component adhesive that cures at room temperature. Also known as “super glue.”
Dry lubricative material
—A coating consisting of lauric acid, cetyl alcohol, waxes, or other non-cross linked or resin-bound materials which act as a dry lubricant.
Electric or radiation-effect coating
—A coating or coating system engineered to interact, through absorption or reflection, with specific regions of the electromagnetic energy spectrum, such as the ultraviolet, visible, infrared, or microwave regions. Uses include, but are not limited to, lightning strike protection, electromagnetic pulse (EMP) protection, and radar avoidance. Coatings that have been designated as “Classified National Security Information” by the Department of Defense are exempt.
Electrostatic discharge and electromagnetic interference (EMI) coating
—A coating applied to aerospace vehicles and components to disperse static energy or reduce electromagnetic interference.
Elevated-temperature Skydrol-resistant commercial primer
—A primer applied primarily to commercial aircraft (or commercial aircraft adapted for military use) that must withstand immersion in phosphate-ester (PE) hydraulic fluid (Skydrol 500b or equivalent) at the elevated temperature of 150 °F for 1,000 hours.
Epoxy polyamide topcoat
—A coating used where harder films are required or in some areas where engraving is accomplished in camouflage colors.
Fire-resistant (interior) coating
—For civilian aircraft, fire-resistant interior coatings are used on passenger cabin interior parts that are subject to the FAA fireworthiness requirements. For military aircraft, fire-resistant interior coatings are used on parts subject to the flammability requirements of MIL-STD-1630A and MIL-A-87721. For space applications, these coatings are used on parts subject to the flammability requirements of SE-R-0006 and SSP 30233.
Flexible primer
—A primer that meets flexibility requirements such as those needed for adhesive bond primed fastener heads or on surfaces expected to contain fuel. The flexible coating is required because it provides a compatible, flexible substrate over bonded sheet rubber and rubber-type coatings as well as a flexible bridge between the fasteners, skin, and skin-to-skin joints on outer aircraft skins. This flexible bridge allows more topcoat flexibility around fasteners and decreases the chance of the topcoat cracking around the fasteners. The result is better corrosion resistance.
Flight test coating
—A coating applied to aircraft other than missiles or single-use aircraft prior to flight testing to protect the aircraft from corrosion and to provide required marking during flight test evaluation.
Fuel tank adhesive
—An adhesive used to bond components exposed to fuel and that must be compatible with fuel tank coatings.
Fuel tank coating
—A coating applied to fuel tank components to inhibit corrosion and/or bacterial growth and to assure sealant adhesion in extreme environmental conditions.
High temperature coating
—A coating designed to withstand temperatures of more than 350 °F.
Insulation covering
—Material that is applied to foam insulation to protect the insulation from mechanical or environmental damage.
Intermediate release coating
—A thin coating applied beneath topcoats to assist in removing the topcoat in depainting operations and generally to allow the use of less hazardous depainting methods.
Lacquer
—A clear or pigmented coating formulated with a nitrocellulose or synthetic resin to dry by evaporation without a chemical reaction. Lacquers are resoluble in their original solvent.
Metalized epoxy coating
—A coating that contains relatively large quantities of metallic pigmentation for appearance and/or added protection.
Mold release
—A coating applied to a mold surface to prevent the molded piece from sticking to the mold as it is removed.
Nonstructural adhesive
—An adhesive that bonds nonload bearing aerospace components in noncritical applications and is not covered in any other specialty adhesive categories.
Optical anti-reflection coating
—A coating with a low reflectance in the infrared and visible wavelength ranges, which is used for anti-reflection on or near optical and laser hardware.
Part marking coating
—Coatings or inks used to make identifying markings on materials, components, and/or assemblies. These markings may be either permanent or temporary.
Pretreatment coating
—An organic coating that contains at least 0.5 percent acids by weight and is applied directly to metal or composite surfaces to provide surface etching, corrosion resistance, adhesion, and ease of stripping.
Rain erosion-resistant coating—
A coating or coating system used to protect the leading edges of parts such as flaps, stabilizers, radomes, engine inlet nacelles, etc. against erosion caused by rain impact during flight.

# Subpart HH—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Oil and Natural Gas Production Facilities

# Source:
64 FR 32628, June 17, 1999, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.760
Applicability and designation of affected source.
(a) This subpart applies to the owners and operators of the emission points, specified in paragraph (b) of this section that are located at oil and natural gas production facilities that meet the specified criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and either (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.
(1) Facilities that are major or area sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) as defined in § 63.761. Emissions for major source determination purposes can be estimated using the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, as appropriate, calculated in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. As an alternative to calculating the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, the owner or operator of a new or existing source may use the facility's design maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput to estimate the maximum potential emissions. Other means to determine the facility's major source status are allowed, provided the information is documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction in accordance with § 63.10(b)(3). A facility that is determined to be an area source, but subsequently increases its emissions or its potential to emit above the major source levels, and becomes a major
source, must comply with all provisions of this subpart applicable to a major source starting on the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (f) of this section. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude a source from limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting authority.
(i) If the owner or operator documents, to the Administrator's satisfaction, a decline in annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, as appropriate, each year for the 5 years prior to October 15, 2012, the owner or operator shall calculate the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput used to determine maximum potential emissions according to the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. In all other circumstances, the owner or operator shall calculate the maximum throughput used to determine whether a facility is a major source in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
(A) The maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is the average of the annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput for the 3 years prior to October 15, 2012, multiplied by a factor of 1.2.
(B) The maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is the highest annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput over the 5 years prior to October 15, 2012, multiplied by a factor of 1.2.
(ii) The owner or operator shall maintain records of the annual facility natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput each year and upon request submit such records to the Administrator. If the facility annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput increases above the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput calculated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput must be recalculated using the higher throughput multiplied by a factor of 1.2.
(iii) The owner or operator shall determine the maximum values for other parameters used to calculate emissions as the maximum for the period over which the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Parameters, other than glycol circulation rate, shall be based on either highest measured values or annual average. For estimating maximum potential emissions from glycol dehydration units, the glycol circulation rate used in the calculation shall be the unit's maximum rate under its physical and operational design consistent with the definition of potential to emit in § 63.2.
(2) Facilities that process, upgrade, or store hydrocarbon liquids.
(3) Facilities that process, upgrade, or store natural gas prior to the point at which natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category or is delivered to a final end user. For the purposes of this subpart, natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category after the natural gas processing plant, when present. If no natural gas processing plant is present, natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category after the point of custody transfer.
(b) The affected sources for major sources are listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and for area sources in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(1) For major sources, the affected source shall comprise each emission point located at a facility that meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section and listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this section.
(i) Each glycol dehydration unit as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.
(A) Each large glycol dehydration unit;
(B) Each small glycol dehydration unit for which construction commenced on or before August 23, 2011, is an existing small glycol dehydration unit; and
(C) Each small glycol dehydration unit for which construction commenced after August 23, 2011, is a new small glycol dehydration unit.
(ii) Each storage vessel with the potential for flash emissions;
(iii) The group of all ancillary equipment, except compressors, intended to
operate in volatile hazardous air pollutant service (as defined in § 63.761), which are located at natural gas processing plants; and
(iv) Compressors intended to operate in volatile hazardous air pollutant service (as defined in § 63.761), which are located at natural gas processing plants.
(2) For area sources, the affected source includes each triethylene glycol (TEG) dehydration unit located at a facility that meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) Any source that determines it is not a major source but has actual emissions of 5 tons per year or more of a single HAP, or 12.5 tons per year or more of a combination of HAP (
i.e.,
50 percent of the major source thresholds), shall update its major source determination within 1 year of the prior determination or October 15, 2012, whichever is later, and each year thereafter, using gas composition data measured during the preceding 12 months.
(d) The owner and operator of a facility that does not contain an affected source as specified in paragraph (b) of this section are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.
(e)
Exemptions.
The facilities listed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section are exempt from the requirements of this subpart. Records shall be maintained as required in § 63.10(b)(3).
(1) A facility that exclusively processes, stores, or transfers black oil (as defined in § 63.761) is not subject to the requirements of this subpart. For the purposes of this subpart, a black oil facility that uses natural gas for fuel or generates gas from black oil shall qualify for this exemption.
(2) A major source facility, prior to the point of custody transfer, with a facility-wide actual annual average natural gas throughput less than 18.4 thousand standard cubic meters per day and a facility-wide actual annual average hydrocarbon liquid throughput less than 39,700 liters per day.
(f) The owner or operator of an affected major source shall achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart by the dates specified in paragraphs (f)(1), (2), and (f)(7) through (9) of this section. The owner or operator of an affected area source shall achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart by the dates specified in paragraphs (f)(3) through (6) of this section.
(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (f)(7) through (9) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected major source, the construction or reconstruction of which commenced before February 6, 1998, shall achieve compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart no later than June 17, 2002, except as provided for in § 63.6(i). The owner or operator of an area source, the construction or reconstruction of which commenced before February 6, 1998, that increases its emissions of (or its potential to emit) HAP such that the source becomes a major source that is subject to this subpart shall comply with this subpart 3 years after becoming a major source.
(2) Except as specified in paragraphs (f)(7) through (9) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected major source, the construction or reconstruction of which commences on or after February 6, 1998, shall achieve compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart immediately upon initial startup or June 17, 1999, whichever date is later. Area sources, other than production field facilities identified in (f)(9) of this section, the construction or reconstruction of which commences on or after February 6, 1998, that become major sources shall comply with the provisions of this standard immediately upon becoming a major source.
(3) The owner or operator of an affected area source, located in an Urban-1 county, as defined in § 63.761, the construction or reconstruction of which commences before February 6, 1998, shall achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart no later than the dates specified in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, except as provided for in § 63.6(i).

(f)
Compliance demonstration for control device performance requirements.
This paragraph applies to the demonstration of compliance with the control device performance requirements specified in § 63.771(d)(1)(i), (e)(3), and (f)(1). Compliance shall be demonstrated using the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section. As an alternative, an owner or operator that installs a condenser as the control device to achieve the requirements specified in § 63.771(d)(1)(ii), (e)(3), or (f)(1) may demonstrate compliance according to paragraph (g) of this section. An owner or operator may switch between compliance with paragraph (f) of this section and compliance with paragraph (g) of this section only after at least 1 year of operation in compliance with the selected approach. Notification of such a change in the compliance method shall be reported in the next Periodic Report, as required in § 63.775(e), following the change.
(1) The owner or operator shall establish a site specific maximum or minimum monitoring parameter value (as appropriate) according to the requirements of § 63.773(d)(5)(i).
(2) The owner or operator shall calculate the daily average of the applicable monitored parameter in accordance with § 63.773(d)(4) except that the inlet gas flowrate to the control device shall not be averaged.
(3) Compliance with the operating parameter limit is achieved when the daily average of the monitoring parameter value calculated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section is either equal to or greater than the minimum or equal to or less than the maximum monitoring value established under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. For inlet gas flowrate, compliance with the operating parameter limit is achieved when the value is equal to or less than the value established under § 63.772(h) or under the performance test conducted under § 63.772(e), as applicable.
(4) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, system accuracy audits and required zero and span adjustments), the CMS required in § 63.773(d) must be operated at all times the affected source is operating. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. Monitoring system repairs are required to be completed in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.
(5) Data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities may not be used in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. All the data collected during all other required data collection periods must
be used in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.
(6) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required quality monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, system accuracy audits and required zero and span adjustments), failure to collect required data is a deviation of the monitoring requirements.

i.e.,
at least 76.0 percent if the 365-day design value is 80.0 percent).
(B) After 120 days and no more than 364 days of operation after the compliance dates specified in § 63.760(f), the owner or operator shall calculate the average HAP emission reduction as the HAP emission reduction averaged over the number of days between the current day and the applicable compliance date. For sources required to meet the overall 95.0-percent reduction requirement, compliance with the performance requirements is achieved if the average HAP emission reduction is equal to or greater than 90.0 percent. For sources required to meet the BTEX limit under § 63.765(b)(1)(iii), compliance is achieved if the average BTEX emission reduction is at least 95.0 percent of the required 365-day value identified under paragraph (g)(1) of this section (
i.e.,
at least 76.0 percent if the 365-day design value is 80.0 percent).

(ii) Subsequent reporting periods begin every January 1 and end on December 31. Subsequent reports shall be submitted within 30 days following the end of the reporting period.
(iii) The periodic reports must contain the information included in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(f)
Notification of process change.
Whenever a process change is made, or a change in any of the information submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status Report, the owner or operator shall submit a report within 180 days after the process change is made or as a part of the next Periodic Report as required under paragraph (e) of this section, whichever is sooner. The report shall include:
(1) A brief description of the process change;
(2) A description of any modification to standard procedures or quality assurance procedures;
(3) Revisions to any of the information reported in the original Notification of Compliance Status Report under paragraph (d) of this section; and
(4) Information required by the Notification of Compliance Status Report under paragraph (d) of this section for changes involving the addition of processes or equipment.
(g)
Electronic reporting.
(1) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (defined in § 63.2) as required by this subpart you must submit the results of the performance tests required by this subpart to EPA's WebFIRE database by using the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) that is accessed through EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
www.epa.gov/cdx
). Performance test data must be submitted in the file format generated through use of EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html
). Only data collected using test methods on the ERT Web site are subject to this requirement for submitting reports electronically to WebFIRE. Owners or operators who claim that some of the information being submitted for performance tests is confidential business information (CBI) must submit a complete ERT file including information claimed to be CBI on a compact disk or other commonly used electronic storage media (including, but not limited to, flash drives) to EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: WebFIRE Administrator, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to EPA via CDX as described earlier in this paragraph. At the discretion of the delegated authority, you must also submit these reports, including the confidential business information, to the delegated authority in the format specified by the delegated authority.
(2) All reports required by this subpart not subject to the requirements in paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be sent to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13. The Administrator or the delegated authority may request a report in any form suitable for the specific case (e.g., by commonly used electronic media such as Excel spreadsheet, on CD or hard copy). The Administrator retains the right to require submittal of reports subject to paragraph (g)(1) of this section in paper format.

§ 63.776
Implementation and enforcement.
(a) This subpart can be implemented and enforced by the U.S. EPA, or a delegated authority such as the applicable State, local, or Tribal agency. If the U.S. EPA Administrator has delegated authority to a State, local, or Tribal agency, then that agency, in addition to the U.S. EPA, has the authority to implement and enforce this subpart. Contact the applicable U.S. EPA Regional Office to find out if this subpart
is delegated to a State, local, or Tribal agency.
(b) In delegating implementation and enforcement authority of this subpart to a State, local, or Tribal agency under subpart E of this part, the authorities contained in paragraph (c) of this section are retained by the Administrator of U.S. EPA and cannot be transferred to the State, local, or Tribal agency.
(c) The authorities that cannot be delegated to State, local, or Tribal agencies are as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) Approval of alternatives to the requirements in §§ 63.760, 63.764 through 63.766, 63.769, 63.771, and 63.777.
(2) Approval of major alternatives to test methods under § 63.7(e)(2)(ii) and (f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.
(3) Approval of major alternatives to monitoring under § 63.8(f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.
(4) Approval of major alternatives to recordkeeping and reporting under § 63.10(f), as defined in § 63.90, and as required in this subpart.
§ 63.777
Alternative means of emission limitation.
(a) If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in HAP emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in HAP emissions from that source achieved under the applicable requirements in §§ 63.764 through 63.771, the Administrator will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement. The notice may condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.
(b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be published only after public notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
(c) Any person seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the Administrator information demonstrating that the alternative achieves equivalent emission reductions.

# Subpart II—National Emission Standards for Shipbuilding and Ship Repair (Surface Coating)

# Source:
60 FR 64336, Dec. 15, 1995, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.780
Relationship of subpart II to subpart A of this part.
Table 1 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A of this part that apply to owners and operators of sources subject to the provisions of this subpart.
§ 63.781
Applicability.
(a) The provisions of this subpart apply to shipbuilding and ship repair operations at any facility that is a major source.
(b) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to coatings used in volumes of less than 200 liters (52.8 gallons) per year, provided the total volume of coating exempt under this paragraph does not exceed 1,000 liters per year (264 gallons per year) at any facility. Coatings exempt under this paragraph shall be clearly labeled as “low-usage exempt,” and the volume of each such coating applied shall be maintained in the facility's records.
(c) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to coatings applied with hand-held, nonrefillable, aerosol containers or to unsaturated polyester resin (i.e., fiberglass lay-up) coatings. Coatings applied to suitably prepared fiberglass surfaces for protective or decorative purposes are subject to this subpart.
(d) If you are authorized in accordance with 40 CFR 63.783(c) to use an add-on control system as an alternative means of limiting emissions from coating operations, in response to
an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available in response to claims for injunctive relief.
(1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, you must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
(i) The excess emissions:
(A) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and
(B) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and
(C) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
(D) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
(ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
(iii) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions; and
(iv) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; and
(v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment and human health; and
(vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
(vii) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
(viii) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
(ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
(2)
Notification.
The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.
[60 FR 64336, Dec. 15, 1995, as amended at 76 FR 72068, Nov. 21, 2011]
§ 63.782
Definitions.
Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act (CAA), in
subpart A of part 63, or in this section as follows:
Add-on control system
means an air pollution control device such as a carbon absorber or incinerator that reduces pollution in an air stream by destruction or removal prior to discharge to the atmosphere.
Affected source
means any shipbuilding or ship repair facility having surface coating operations with a minimum 1,000 liters (L) (264 gallons [gal]) annual marine coating usage that is subject to this subpart.
Affirmative defense
means, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or a defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding.
Air flask specialty coating
means any special composition coating applied to interior surfaces of high pressure breathing air flasks to provide corrosion resistance and that is certified safe for use with breathing air supplies.
Antenna specialty coating
means any coating applied to equipment through which electromagnetic signals must pass for reception or transmission.
Antifoulant specialty coating
means any coating that is applied to the underwater portion of a vessel to prevent or reduce the attachment of biological organisms and that is registered with the EPA as a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
As applied
means the condition of a coating at the time of application to the substrate, including any thinning solvent.
As supplied
means the condition of a coating before any thinning, as sold and delivered by the coating manufacturer to the user.
Batch
means the product of an individual production run of a coating manufacturer's process. A batch may vary in composition from other batches of the same product.
Bitumens
mean black or brown materials that are soluble in carbon disulfide and consist mainly of hydrocarbons.
Bituminous resin coating
means any coating that incorporates bitumens as a principal component and is formulated primarily to be applied to a substrate or surface to resist ultraviolet radiation and/or water.
Certify
means, in reference to the volatile organic compounds (VOC) content or volatile organic hazardous air pollutants (VOHAP) content of a coating, to attest to the VOC content as determined through analysis by Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 or through use of forms and procedures outlined in appendix A of this subpart, or to attest to the VOHAP content as determined through an Administrator-approved test method. In the case of conflicting results, Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 shall take precedence over the forms and procedures outlined in appendix A to this subpart for the options in which VOC is used as a surrogate for VOHAP.
Coating
means any material that can be applied as a thin layer to a substrate and which cures to form a continuous solid film.
Cold-weather time period

§ 63.783
Standards.
(a) No owner or operator of any existing or new affected source shall cause
or allow the application of any coating to a ship with an as-applied VOHAP content exceeding the applicable limit given in Table 2 of this subpart, as determined by the procedures described in § 63.785 (c)(1) through (c)(4). For the compliance procedures described in § 63.785 (c)(1) through (c)(3), VOC shall be used as a surrogate for VOHAP, and Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 shall be used as the definitive measure for determining compliance. For the compliance procedure described in § 63.785(c)(4), an alternative test method capable of measuring independent VOHAP shall be used to determine compliance. The method must be submitted to and approved by the Administrator.
(b) Each owner or operator of a new or existing affected source shall ensure that:
(1) At all times the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
(2) All handling and transfer of VOHAP-containing materials to and from containers, tanks, vats, drums, and piping systems is conducted in a manner that minimizes spills.
(3) All containers, tanks, vats, drums, and piping systems are free of cracks, holes, and other defects and remain closed unless materials are being added to or removed from them.
(c)
Approval of alternative means of limiting emissions.
(1) The owner or operator of an affected source may apply to the Administrator for permission to use an alternative means (such as an add-on control system) of limiting emissions from coating operations. The application must include:
(i) An engineering material balance evaluation that provides a comparison of the emissions that would be achieved using the alternative means to those that would result from using coatings that comply with the limits in Table 2 of this subpart, or the results from an emission test that accurately measures the capture efficiency and control device efficiency achieved by the control system and the composition of the associated coatings so that the emissions comparison can be made;
(ii) A proposed monitoring protocol that includes operating parameter values to be monitored for compliance and an explanation of how the operating parameter values will be established through a performance test; and
(iii) Details of appropriate recordkeeping and reporting procedures.
(2) The Administrator shall approve the alternative means of limiting emissions if, in the Administrator's judgment, postcontrol emissions of VOHAP per volume applied solids will be no greater than those from the use of coatings that comply with the limits in Table 2 of this subpart.
(3) The Administrator may condition approval on operation, maintenance, and monitoring requirements to ensure that emissions from the source are no greater than those that would otherwise result from this subpart.

§ 63.785
Compliance procedures.
(a) For each batch of coating that is received by an affected source, the owner or operator shall (see Figure 1 of this section for a flow diagram of the compliance procedures):
(1) Determine the coating category and the applicable VOHAP limit as specified in § 63.783(a).
(2) Certify the as-supplied VOC content of the batch of coating. The owner or operator may use a certification supplied by the manufacturer for the batch, although the owner or operator retains liability should subsequent testing reveal a violation. If the owner or operator performs the certification testing, only one of the containers in which the batch of coating was received is required to be tested.
(b)(1) In lieu of testing each batch of coating, as applied, the owner or operator may determine compliance with the VOHAP limits using any combination of the procedures described in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section. The procedure used for each coating shall be determined and documented prior to application.
(2) The results of any compliance demonstration conducted by the affected source or any regulatory agency using Method 24 shall take precedence over the results using the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(3) of this section.
(3) The results of any compliance demonstration conducted by the affected source or any regulatory agency using an approved test method to determine VOHAP content shall take precedence over the results using the procedures in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(c)(1)
Coatings to which thinning solvent will not be added.
For coatings to which thinning solvent (or any other material) will not be added under any circumstance or to which only water is added, the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply as follows:
(i) Certify the as-applied VOC content of each batch of coating.
(ii) Notify the persons responsible for applying the coating that no thinning solvent may be added to the coating by affixing a label to each container of coating in the batch or through another means described in the implementation plan required in § 63.787(b).
(iii) If the certified as-applied VOC content of each batch of coating used during a calendar month is less than or equal to the applicable VOHAP limit in § 63.783(a) (either in terms of g/L of coating or g/L of solids), then compliance is demonstrated for that calendar month, unless a violation is revealed using Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
(2)
Coatings to which thinning solvent will be added—coating-by-coating compliance.
For a coating to which thinning solvent is routinely or sometimes added, the owner or operator shall comply as follows:
(i) Prior to the first application of each batch, designate a single thinner for the coating and calculate the maximum allowable thinning ratio (or ratios, if the affected source complies with the cold-weather limits in addition to the other limits specified in Table 2 of this subpart) for each batch as follows:
ER15DE95.191
where:
R = Maximum allowable thinning ratio for a given batch (L thinner/L coating as supplied);
V
s
= Volume fraction of solids in the batch as supplied (L solids/L coating as supplied);
VOHAP limit = Maximum allowable as-applied VOHAP content of the coating (g VOHAP/L solids);

The procedures specified in § 63.786(d) may be used to determine the values of variables defined in this paragraph. In addition, the owner or operator may choose to construct nomographs, based on Equation 1 of this subpart, similar or identical to the one provided in appendix B of this subpart as a means of easily estimating the maximum allowable thinning ratio.
(ii) Prior to the first application of each batch, notify painters and other persons, as necessary, of the designated thinner and maximum allowable thinning ratio(s) for each batch of the coating by affixing a label to each container of coating or through another means described in the implementation plan required in § 63.787(b).
(iii) By the 15th day of each calendar month, determine the volume of each batch of the coating used, as supplied, during the previous month.
(iv) By the 15th day of each calendar month, determine the total allowable volume of thinner for the coating used during the previous month as follows:

(vi) If the volume of thinner actually used with the coating [paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section] is less than or equal to the total allowable volume of thinner for the coating [paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section], then compliance is demonstrated for the coating for the previous month, unless a violation is revealed using Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
(3)
Coatings to which the same thinning solvent will be added—group compliance.
For coatings to which the same thinning solvent (or other material) is routinely or sometimes added, the owner or operator shall comply as follows:
(i) Designate a single thinner to be added to each coating during the month and “group” coatings according to their designated thinner.
(ii) Prior to the first application of each batch, calculate the maximum allowable thinning ratio (or ratios, if the affected source complies with the cold-weather limits in addition to the other limits specified in Table 2 of this subpart) for each batch of coating in the group using the equations in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(iii) Prior to the first application of each “batch,” notify painters and other persons, as necessary, of the designated thinner and maximum allowable thinning ratio(s) for each batch in the group by affixing a label to each container of coating or through another means described in the implementation plan required in § 63.787(b).
(iv) By the 15th day of each calendar month, determine the volume of each batch of the group used, as supplied, during the previous month.

(4)
Demonstration of compliance through an alternative (i.e., other than Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60) test method.
The owner or operator shall comply as follows:
(i) Certify the as-supplied VOHAP content (g VOHAP/L solids) of each batch of coating.
(ii) If no thinning solvent will be added to the coating, the owner or operator of an affected source shall follow the procedure described in § 63.785(c)(1), except that VOHAP content shall be used in lieu of VOC content.
(iii) If thinning solvent will be added to the coating, the owner or operator of an affected source shall follow the procedure described in § 63.785(c)(2) or (3), except that in Equation 1 of this subpart: the term “m
VOC
” shall be replaced by the term “m
VOHAP
,” defined as the VOHAP content of the coating as supplied (g VOHAP/L coating) and the term “D
th
” shall be replaced by the term “D
th(VOHAP)
” defined as the average density of the VOHAP thinner(s) (g/L).
(d) A violation revealed through any approved test method shall result in a 1-day violation for enforcement purposes. A violation revealed through the recordkeeping procedures described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section shall result in a 30-day violation for enforcement purposes, unless the owner or operator provides sufficient data to demonstrate the specific days during which noncompliant coatings were applied.
(e) Continuous compliance requirements. You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the emissions standards and operating limits by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.786 for each affected source.
(1)
General requirements.
(i) You must monitor and collect data, and provide a site specific monitoring plan, as required by §§ 63.783, 63.785, 63.786 and 63.787.
(ii) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times the affected source is operating, and periods of malfunction. Any period for which data collection is required and the operation of the Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) is not otherwise exempt and for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for required calculations constitutes a deviation from the monitoring requirements.
(iii) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. The owner or operator must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.

[60 FR 64336, Dec. 15, 1995, as amended at 76 FR 72069, Nov. 21, 2011]
§ 63.786
Test methods and procedures.
(a) For the compliance procedures described in § 63.785(c) (1) through (c)(3),
Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is the definitive method for determining the VOC content of coatings, as supplied or as applied. When a coating or thinner contains exempt compounds that are volatile HAP or VOHAP, the owner or operator shall ensure, when determining the VOC content of a coating, that the mass of these exempt compounds is included.
(b) For the compliance procedure described in § 63.785(c)(4), the Administrator must approve the test method for determining the VOHAP content of coatings and thinners. As part of the approval, the test method must meet the specified accuracy limits indicated below for sensitivity, duplicates, repeatability, and reproducibility coefficient of variation each determined at the 95 percent confidence limit. Each percentage value below is the corresponding coefficient of variation multiplied by 2.8 as in the ASTM Method E180-93: Standard Practice for Determining the Precision of ASTM Methods for Analysis and Testing of Industrial Chemicals (incorporation by reference—see § 63.14).
(1)
Sensitivity.
The overall sensitivity must be sufficient to identify and calculate at least one mass percent of the compounds of interest based on the original sample. The sensitivity is defined as ten times the noise level as specified in ASTM Method D3257-93: Standard Test Methods for Aromatics in Mineral Spirits by Gas Chromatography (incorporation by reference—see § 63.14). In determining the sensitivity, the level of sample dilution must be factored in.
(2)
Repeatability.
First, at the 0.1-5 percent analyte range the results would be suspect if duplicates vary by more than 6 percent relative and/or day to day variation of mean duplicates by the same analyst exceeds 10 percent relative. Second, at greater than 5 percent analyte range the results would be suspect if duplicates vary by more than 5 percent relative and/or day to day variation of duplicates by the same analyst exceeds 5 percent relative.
(3)
Reproducibility.
First, at the 0.1-5 percent analyte range the results would be suspect if lab to lab variation exceeds 60 percent relative. Second, at greater than 5 percent range the results would be suspect if lab to lab variation exceeds 20 percent relative.
(4) Any test method should include information on the apparatus, reagents and materials, analytical procedure, procedure for identification and confirmation of the volatile species in the mixture being analyzed, precision and bias, and other details to be reported. The reporting should also include information on quality assurance (QA) auditing.
(5) Multiple and different analytical techniques must be used for positive identification if the components in a mixture under analysis are not known. In such cases a single column gas chromatograph (GC) may not be adequate. A combination of equipment may be needed such as a GC/mass spectrometer or GC/infrared system. (If a GC method is used, the operator must use practices in ASTM Method E260-91 or 96: Standard Practice for Gas Chromatography [incorporation by reference—see § 63.14].)
(c) A coating manufacturer or the owner or operator of an affected source may use batch formulation data as a test method in lieu of Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to certify the as-supplied VOC content of a coating if the manufacturer or the owner or operator has determined that batch formulation data have a consistent and quantitatively known relationship to Method 24 results. This determination shall consider the role of cure volatiles, which may cause emissions to exceed an amount based solely upon coating formulation data. Notwithstanding such determination, in the event of conflicting results, Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall take precedence.
(d) Each owner or operator of an affected source shall use or ensure that the manufacturer uses the form and procedures mentioned in appendix A of this subpart to determine values for the thinner and coating parameters used in Equations 1 and 2 of this subpart. The owner or operator shall ensure that the coating/thinner manufacturer (or supplier) provides information on the VOC and VOHAP contents of the coatings/thinners and the procedure(s) used to determine these values.
(e) For add-on control systems approved for use in limiting emissions from coating operations pursuant to § 63.783(c), performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to demonstrate the conditions present during performance tests.
[60 FR 64336, Dec. 15, 1995, as amended at 65 FR 62215, Oct. 17, 2000; 76 FR 72069, Nov. 21, 2011]

The limits are expressed in two sets of equivalent units. Either set of limits may be used for the compliance procedure described in § 63.785(c)(1), but only the limits expressed in units of g/L solids (nonvolatiles) shall be used for the compliance procedures described § 63.785(c) (2) through (4).
b
VOC (including exempt compounds listed as HAP) shall be used as a surrogate for VOHAP for those compliance procedures described in § 63.785(c) (1) through (3).
c
To convert from g/L to lb/gal, multiply by (3.785 L/gal)(1/453.6 lb/g) or 1/120. For compliance purposes, metric units define the standards.
d
VOHAP limits expressed in units of mass of VOHAP per volume of solids were derived from the VOHAP limits expressed in units of mass of VOHAP per volume of coating assuming the coatings contain no water or exempt compounds and that the volumes of all components within a coating are additive.
e
These limits apply during cold-weather time periods, as defined in § 63.782. Cold-weather allowances are not given to coatings in categories that permit less than 40 percent volume solids (nonvolatiles). Such coatings are subject to the same limits regardless of weather conditions.

§ 63.800
Applicability.
(a) The affected source to which this subpart applies is each facility that is engaged, either in part or in whole, in the manufacture of wood furniture or wood furniture components and that is located at a plant site that is a major source as defined in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, § 63.2. The owner or operator of a source that meets the definition for an incidental wood furniture manufacturer shall maintain purchase or usage records demonstrating that the source meets the definition in § 63.801 of this subpart, but the source shall not be subject to any other provisions of this subpart.
(b) A source that complies with the limits and criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section is an area source for the purposes of this subpart and is not subject to any other provision of this rule, provided that: In the case of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), finishing materials, adhesives, cleaning solvents and washoff solvents used for wood furniture or wood furniture component manufacturing operations account for at least 90 percent of annual HAP emissions at the plant site, and if the plant site has HAP emissions that do not originate from the listed materials, the owner or operator shall keep any records necessary to demonstrate that the 90 percent criterion is being met. A source that initially relies on the limits and criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) to become an area source, but subsequently exceeds the relevant limit (without first obtaining and complying with other limits that keep its potential to emit hazardous air pollutants below major source levels), becomes a major source and must comply thereafter with all applicable provisions of this subpart starting on the applicable compliance date in § 63.800. Nothing in this paragraph (b) is intended to preclude a source from limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting authority.
(1) The owner or operator of the source uses no more than 250 gallons per month, for every month, of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials at the source, including materials used for source categories other than wood furniture (surface coating), but excluding materials used in routine janitorial or facility grounds maintenance, personal uses by employees or other persons, the use of products for the purpose of maintaining motor vehicles operated by the facility, or the use of toxic chemicals contained in intake water (used for processing or noncontact cooling) or intake air (used either as compressed air or for combustion). The owner or operator shall maintain records of the total gallons of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials used each month, and upon request submit such records to the Administrator. These records shall be maintained for five years.
(2) The owner or operator of the source uses no more than 3,000 gallons per rolling 12-month period, for every 12-month period, of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials at the source, including materials used for source categories other than wood furniture (surface coating), but excluding materials used in routine janitorial or facility grounds maintenance, personal uses by employees or other persons, the use of products for the purpose of maintaining motor vehicles operated by the facility, or the use of toxic chemicals contained in intake water (used for processing or noncontact cooling) or intake air (used either as compressed air or for combustion). A rolling 12-month period includes the previous 12 months of operation. The owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the total gallons of coating, gluing, cleaning, and washoff materials used each month and the total gallons used each previous month, and upon request submit such records to the Administrator. Because records are needed over the previous set of 12 months, the owner or operator shall keep monthly records beginning no less than one year before the compliance date specified in § 63.800(e).
Records shall be maintained for five years.
(3) The source emits no more than 4.5 Mg (5 tons) of any one HAP per rolling 12-month period and no more than 11.4 Mg (12.5 tons) of any combination of HAP per rolling 12-month period, and at least 90 percent of the plantwide emissions per rolling 12-month period are associated with the manufacture of wood furniture or wood furniture components.
(c) This subpart does not apply to research or laboratory facilities as defined in § 63.801.
(d) This subpart does not apply to any surface coating or coating operation that meets any of the criteria of paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) Surface coating of metal parts and products other than metal components of wood furniture that meets the applicability criteria for miscellaneous metal parts and products surface coating (subpart MMMM of this part).
(2) Surface coating of plastic parts and products other than plastic components of wood furniture that meets the applicability criteria for plastic parts and products surface coating (subpart PPPP of this part).
(3) Surface coating of wood building products that meets the applicability criteria for wood building products surface coating (subpart QQQQ of this part). The surface coating of millwork and trim associated with cabinet manufacturing are subject to subpart JJ.
(4) Surface coating of metal furniture that meets the applicability criteria for metal furniture surface coating (subpart RRRR of this part). Surface coating of metal components of wood furniture performed at a wood furniture or wood furniture component manufacturing facility are subject to subpart JJ.
(e) Owners or operators of affected sources shall also comply with the requirements of subpart A of this part (General Provisions), according to the applicability of subpart A to such sources, as identified in Table 1 of this subpart.
(f) The compliance date for existing affected sources that emit less than 50 tons per year of HAP in 1996 is December 7, 1998. The compliance date for existing affected sources that emit 50 tons or more of hazardous air pollutants in 1996 is November 21, 1997. The owner or operator of an existing area source that increases its emissions of (or its potential to emit) HAP such that the source becomes a major source that is subject to this subpart shall comply with this subpart one year after becoming a major source.
(g) Existing affected sources shall be in compliance with § 63.802(a)(4) and § 63.803(h) no later than November 21, 2014. The owner or operator of an existing area source that increases its emissions of (or its potential to emit) hazardous air pollutants (HAP) such that the source becomes a major source that is subject to this subpart shall comply with this subpart 1 year after becoming a major source.
(h) New affected sources must comply with the provisions of this standard immediately upon startup or by December 7, 1995, whichever is later. New area sources that become major sources shall comply with the provisions of this standard immediately upon becoming a major source.
(i) Reconstructed affected sources are subject to the requirements for new affected sources. The costs associated with the purchase and installation of air pollution control equipment (e.g., incinerators, carbon adsorbers, etc.) are not considered in determining whether the facility has been reconstructed, unless the control equipment is required as part of the process (e.g., product recovery). Additionally, the costs of retrofitting and replacement of equipment that is installed specifically to comply with this subpart are not considered reconstruction costs. For example, an affected source may convert to waterborne coatings to meet the requirements of this subpart. At most facilities, this conversion will require the replacement of existing storage tanks, mix equipment, and transfer lines. The cost of replacing the equipment is not considered in determining whether the facility has been reconstructed.
(j) If the owner or operator, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.804, uses a control system as a means of limiting emissions, in response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this
subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the respondent fails to meet its burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
(1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, the owner or operator must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
(i) The excess emissions:
(A) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and
(B) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and
(C) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
(D) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
(ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
(iii) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions; and
(iv) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
(v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and
(vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
(vii) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and

(4) If, after November 1998, the annual usage of the VHAP identified in paragraph (l)(1) exceeds its baseline level, then the owner or operator of the affected source shall provide a written notification to the permitting authority that describes the amount of the increase and explains the reasons for exceedance of the baseline level. The following explanations would relieve the owner or operator from further action, unless the affected source is not in compliance with any State regulations or requirements for that VHAP:
(i) The exceedance is no more than 15.0 percent above the baseline level;
(ii) Usage of the VHAP is below the de minimis level presented in Table 5 of this subpart for that VHAP (sources using a control device to reduce emissions may adjust their usage based on the overall control efficiency of the control system, which is determined using the procedures in § 63.805 (d) or (e);
(iii) The affected source is in compliance with its State's air toxic regulations or guidelines for the VHAP; or
(iv) The source of the pollutant is a finishing material with a VOC content of no more than 1.0 kg VOC/kg solids (1.0 lb VOC/lb solids), as applied.
(5) If none of the above explanations are the reason for the increase, the owner or operator shall confer with the permitting authority to discuss the reason for the increase and whether there are practical and reasonable technology-based solutions for reducing the usage. The evaluation of whether a technology is reasonable and practical shall be based on cost, quality, and marketability of the product, whether the technology is being used successfully by other wood furniture manufacturing operations, or other criteria mutually agreed upon by the permitting authority and owner or operator. If there are no practical and reasonable solutions, the facility need take no further action. If there are solutions, the owner or operator shall develop a plan to reduce usage of the pollutant to the extent feasible. The plan shall address the approach to be used to reduce emissions, a timetable for implementing the plan, and a schedule for submitting notification of progress.
(6) If, after November 1998, an affected source uses a VHAP of potential concern listed in table 6 of this subpart for which a baseline level has not been previously established, then the baseline level shall be established as the
de minimis
level provided in that same table for that chemical. The affected source shall track the annual usage of each VHAP of potential concern identified in this paragraph that is present in amounts subject to MSDS reporting as
required by OSHA. If usage of the VHAP of potential concern exceeds the
de minimis
level listed in table 6 of this subpart for that chemical, then the affected source shall provide an explanation to the permitting authority that documents the reason for the exceedance of the
de minimis
level. If the explanation is not one of those listed in paragraphs (l)(4)(i) through (l)(4)(iv) of this section, the affected source shall follow the procedures in paragraph (l)(5) of this section.

Continuous compliance requirements.
You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the emissions standards and operating limits by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.805 for each affected source.
(i)
General requirements.
(A) You must monitor and collect data, and provide a site specific monitoring plan as required by §§ 63.804, 63.806 and 63.807.
(B) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times the affected source is operating and periods of malfunction. Any period for which data collection is required and the operation of the CEMS is not otherwise exempt and for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for required calculations constitutes a deviation from the monitoring requirements.
(C) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. The owner or operator must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.
(ii) [Reserved]
(h) The owner or operator of an existing or new affected source subject to § 63.802(a)(4) or (b)(4) shall comply with those provisions by using either of the methods presented in § 63.804(h)(1) and (2) if complying with § 63.802(a)(4)(i) or (b)(4)(i) or by using the method presented in § 63.804(h)(3) if complying with § 63.802(a)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(ii).

(4) The EPA Method 3 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used to analyze the exhaust gases.
(5) The EPA Method 4 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) shall be used to measure the moisture in the stack gas.
(6) The EPA Methods 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 3, and 4 shall be performed, as applicable, at least twice during each test period.
(d) Each owner or operator of an affected source demonstrating compliance in accordance with § 63.804 (f)(4) or (f)(6) shall perform a gaseous emission test using the following procedures:
(1) Construct the overall HAP emission reduction system so that all volumetric flow rates and total HAP emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods specified in § 63.805(c) (1) through (6);
(2) Determine capture efficiency from the affected emission point(s) by capturing, venting, and measuring all HAP emissions from the affected emission point(s). During a performance test, the owner or operator shall isolate affected emission point(s) located in an area with other nonaffected gaseous emission sources from all other gaseous emission point(s) by any of the following methods:
(i) Build a temporary total enclosure (see § 63.801) around the affected emission point(s); or
(ii) Use the building that houses the process as the enclosure (see § 63.801);
(iii) Use any alternative protocol and test method provided they meet either the requirements of the data quality objective (DQO) approach or the lower confidence level (LCL) approach (see § 63.801);
(iv) Shut down all nonaffected HAP emission point(s) and continue to exhaust fugitive emissions from the affected emission point(s) through any building ventilation system and other room exhausts such as drying ovens. All exhaust air must be vented through stacks suitable for testing; or

61 FR 27140, May 30, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.820
Applicability.
(a) The provisions of this subpart apply to:
(1) Each new and existing facility that is a major source of hazardous air pollutants (HAP), as defined in 40 CFR 63.2, at which publication rotogravure, product and packaging rotogravure, or wide-web flexographic printing presses are operated, and
(2) Each new and existing facility at which publication rotogravure, product and packaging rotogravure, or wide-web flexographic printing presses are operated for which the owner or operator chooses to commit to and meets the criteria of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section for purposes of establishing the facility to be an area source of HAP with respect to this subpart. A facility which establishes area source status through some other mechanism, as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, is not subject to the provisions of this subpart.
(i) Use less than 9.1 Mg (10 tons) per each rolling 12-month period of each HAP at the facility, including materials used for source categories or purposes other than printing and publishing, and
(ii) Use less than 22.7 Mg (25 tons) per each rolling 12-month period of any combination of HAP at the facility, including materials used for source categories or purposes other than printing and publishing.
(3) Each facility for which the owner or operator chooses to commit to and meets the criteria stated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be considered an area source, and is subject only to the provisions of §§ 63.829(d) and 63.830(b)(1) of this subpart.
(4) Each facility for which the owner or operator commits to the conditions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may exclude material used in routine janitorial or facility grounds maintenance, personal uses by employees or other persons, the use of products for the purpose of maintaining electric, propane, gasoline and diesel powered motor vehicles operated by the facility, and the use of HAP contained in intake water (used for processing or noncontact cooling) or intake air (used either as compressed air or for combustion).
(5) Each facility for which the owner or operator commits to the conditions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to become an area source, but subsequently exceeds either of the thresholds in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for any rolling 12-month period (without first obtaining and complying with other limits that keep its potential to emit HAP below major source levels), shall be considered in violation of its commitment for that 12-month period and shall be considered a major source of HAP beginning the first month after the end of the 12-month period in which either of the HAP-use thresholds was exceeded. As a major source of HAP, each such facility would be subject to the provisions of this subpart as noted in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and would no longer be eligible to use the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, even if in subsequent 12-month periods the facility uses less HAP than the thresholds in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(6) An owner or operator of an affected source subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section who chooses to no longer be subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall notify the Administrator of such change. If, by no longer being subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the facility at which the affected source is located becomes a major source:
(i) The owner or operator of an existing source must continue to comply with the HAP usage provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section until the source is in compliance with all relevant requirements for existing affected sources under this subpart;
(ii) The owner or operator of a new source must continue to comply with the HAP usage provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section until the source is in compliance with all relevant requirements for new affected sources under this subpart.
(7) Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude a facility from establishing area source status by limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting authority.
(b) This subpart does not apply to research or laboratory equipment.
(c) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, an owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if the owner or operator fails to meet the burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
(1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, the owners or operators of a facility must timely meet the notification requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
(i) The excess emissions were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and
monitoring equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;
(ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs;
(iii) The frequency, amount, and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions;
(iv) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
(v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health;
(vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation, if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices;
(vii) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs;
(viii) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
(ix) The owner or operator has prepared a written root cause analysis, the purpose of which is to determine, correct and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
(2)
Notification.
The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.
[61 FR 27140, May 30, 1996, as amended at 71 FR 29799, May 24, 2006; 76 FR 22597, Apr. 21, 2011]

Certified product data sheet (CPDS)
means documentation furnished by suppliers of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, and other materials or by an independent third party that provides the organic HAP weight fraction of these materials determined in accordance with § 63.827(b), or the volatile matter weight fraction or solids weight fraction determined in accordance with § 63.827(c). A material safety data sheet (MSDS) may serve as
a CPDS provided the MSDS meets the data requirements of § 63.827(b) and (c). The purpose of the CPDS is to assist the owner or operator in demonstrating compliance with the emission limitations presented in §§ 63.824-63.825.
Coating

This includes, but is not limited to, folding cartons, flexible packaging, labels and wrappers, gift wraps, wall and floor coverings, upholstery, decorative laminates, and tissue products.
Proof press
means any press which prints only non-saleable items used to check the quality of image formation of rotogravure cylinders or flexographic plates; substrates such as paper, plastic film, metal foil, or vinyl; or ink, coating varnish, adhesive, primer, or other solids-containing material.
Publication rotogravure press
means a rotogravure press used for publication rotogravure printing. A publication rotogravure press may include one or more flexographic imprinters. A publication rotogravure press with one or more flexographic imprinters is not a flexographic press.
Publication rotogravure printing
means the production, on a rotogravure press, of the following saleable paper products:
(1) Catalogues, including mail order and premium,
(2) Direct mail advertisements, including circulars, letters, pamphlets, cards, and printed envelopes,

§ 63.824
Standards: Publication rotogravure printing.
(a) Each owner or operator of any publication rotogravure printing affected source that is subject to the requirements of this subpart shall comply with these requirements on and after the compliance dates as specified in § 63.826 of this subpart.
(b) Each publication rotogravure affected source shall limit emissions of organic HAP to no more than eight percent of the total volatile matter
used each month. The emission limitation may be achieved by overall control of at least 92 percent of organic HAP used, by substitution of non-HAP materials for organic HAP, or by a combination of capture and control technologies and substitution of materials. To demonstrate compliance, each owner or operator shall follow the procedure in paragraph (b)(1) of this section when emissions from the affected source are controlled by a solvent recovery device, the procedure in paragraph (b)(2) of this section when emissions from the affected source are controlled by an oxidizer, and the procedure in paragraph (b)(3) of this section when no control device is used.
(1) Each owner or operator using a solvent recovery device to control emissions shall demonstrate compliance by showing that the HAP emission limitation is achieved by following the procedures in either paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section:
(i) Perform a liquid-liquid material balance for each month as follows:
(A) Measure the mass of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used by the affected source during the month.
(B) Determine the organic HAP content of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent and other material used by the affected source during the month following the procedure in § 63.827(b)(1).
(C) Determine the volatile matter content, including water, of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used by the affected source during the month following the procedure in § 63.827(c)(1).
(D) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate, according to the manufacturer's specifications, a device that indicates the cumulative amount of volatile matter recovered by the solvent recovery device on a monthly basis. The device shall be initially certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±2.0 percent.
(E) Measure the amount of volatile matter recovered for the month.
(F) Calculate the overall effective organic HAP control efficiency (R

) for the month using Equation 1:
ER30MY96.000
For the purposes of this calculation, the mass fraction of organic HAP present in the recovered volatile matter is assumed to be equal to the mass fraction of organic HAP present in the volatile matter used.
(G) The affected source is in compliance for the month, if R
e
is at least 92 percent each month.
(ii) Use continuous emission monitors, conduct an initial performance test of capture efficiency, and continuously monitor a site specific operating parameter to assure capture efficiency as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) through (b)(1)(ii)(E) of this section:
(A) Install continuous emission monitors to collect the data necessary to calculate the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream entering and the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream exiting the solvent recovery device for each month such that the percent control efficiency (E) of the solvent recovery device can be calculated for the month. This requires continuous emission monitoring of the total organic volatile matter concentration in the gas stream entering the solvent recovery device, the total organic volatile matter concentration in the gas stream exiting the solvent recovery device, and the volumetric gas flow rate through the solvent recovery device. A single continuous volumetric gas flow measurement should be sufficient for a solvent recovery device since the inlet and outlet volumetric gas flow rates for a solvent recovery device are essentially equal. Each month's individual
inlet concentration values and corresponding individual gas flow rate values are multiplied and then summed to get the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream entering the solvent recovery device for the month. Each month's individual outlet concentration values and corresponding individual gas flow rate values are multiplied and then summed to get the total organic volatile matter mass flow in the gas stream exiting the solvent recovery device for the month.
(B) Determine the percent capture efficiency (F) of the capture system according to § 63.827(e).
(C) Calculate the overall effective organic HAP control efficiency (R
e
) achieved for each month using Equation 2.
ER30MY96.001
(D) Install, calibrate, operate and maintain the instrumentation necessary to measure continuously the site-specific operating parameter established in accordance with § 63.828(a)(5) whenever a publication rotogravure printing press is operated.
(E) The affected source is in compliance with the requirement for the month if R
e
is at least 92 percent, and the capture device is operated at an average value greater than, or less than (as appropriate) the operating parameter value established in accordance with § 63.828(a)(5) for each three-hour period.
(2) Each owner or operator using an oxidizer to control emissions shall demonstrate compliance by showing that the HAP emission limitation is achieved by following the procedure in either paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section:
(i) Demonstrate initial compliance through performance tests and continuing compliance through continuous monitoring as follows:
(A) Determine the oxidizer destruction efficiency (E) using the procedure in § 63.827(d).
(B) Determine the capture efficiency (F) using the procedure in § 63.827(e).
(C) [Reserved]
(D) Calculate the overall effective organic HAP control efficiency (R
e
) achieved using Equation 2.
(E) The affected source is in initial compliance if R
e
is at least 92 percent. Demonstration of continuing compliance is achieved by continuous monitoring of an appropriate oxidizer operating parameter in accordance with § 63.828(a)(4), and by continuous monitoring of an appropriate capture system monitoring parameter in accordance with § 63.828(a)(5). The affected source is in continuing compliance if the capture device is operated at an average value greater than or less than (as appropriate) the operating parameter value established in accordance with § 63.828(a)(5), and
(
1
) if an oxidizer other than a catalytic oxidizer is used, the average combustion temperature for all three-hour periods is greater than or equal to the average combustion temperature established under § 63.827(d), or
(
2
) if a catalytic oxidizer is used, the average catalyst bed inlet temperature for all three-hour periods is greater than or equal to the average catalyst bed inlet temperature established in accordance with § 63.827(d).
(ii) Use continuous emission monitors, conduct an initial performance test of capture efficiency, and continuously monitor a site specific operating parameter to assure capture efficiency. The percent control efficiency of the oxidizer shall be demonstrated in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section except that separate continuous measurements of the inlet volumetric gas flow rate and the outlet volumetric gas flow rate are required for an oxidizer.
(3) To demonstrate compliance without the use of a control device, each owner or operator shall compare the mass of organic HAP used to the mass of volatile matter used each month, as
specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(iv) of this section:
(i) Measure the mass of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used in the affected source during the month.
(ii) Determine the organic HAP content of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used during the month following the procedure in § 63.827(b)(1), and
(iii) Determine the volatile matter content, including water, of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used during the month following the procedure in § 63.827(c)(1).
(iv) The affected source is in compliance for the month if the mass of organic HAP used does not exceed eight percent of the mass of volatile matter used.

(b) Determination of the weight fraction organic HAP of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents,
thinners, reducers, diluents, and other materials used by a publication rotogravure affected source shall be conducted according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Determination of the weight fraction organic HAP of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, thinners, reducers, diluents, and other materials applied by a product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing affected source shall be conducted according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the weight fraction organic HAP values are not determined using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the owner or operator must submit an alternative test method for determining their values for approval by the Administrator in accordance with § 63.7(f). The recovery efficiency of the test method must be determined for all of the target organic HAP and a correction factor, if necessary, must be determined and applied.
(1) Each owner or operator of a publication rotogravure affected source shall determine the weight fraction organic HAP of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, and other material used by following one of the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:
(i) The owner or operator may test the material in accordance with Method 311 of appendix A of this part. The Method 311 determination may be performed by the owner or operator of the affected source, the supplier of the material, or an independent third party. The organic HAP content determined by Method 311 must be calculated according to the criteria and procedures in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.
(A) Include each organic HAP determined to be present at greater than or equal to 0.1 weight percent for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and greater than or equal to 1.0 weight percent for other organic HAP compounds.
(B) Express the weight fraction of each organic HAP included according to paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.3791).
(C) Calculate the total weight fraction of organic HAP in the tested material by summing the weight fraction of each organic HAP included according to paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763).

The weight fraction of each such organic HAP in each raw material must be determined by Method 311 of appendix A of this part, by an alternate method approved by the Administrator, or from a CPDS provided by the raw material supplier or an independent third party. The weight fraction of each such organic HAP in each raw material must be expressed as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291).
(B) For each raw material used in making the material, the weight fraction contribution of each organic HAP,
which is included according to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, in that raw material to the weight fraction organic HAP of the material is calculated by multiplying the weight fraction, truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291), of that organic HAP in that raw material times the weight fraction of that raw material, truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.2246), in the material. The product of each such multiplication is to be truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291 times 0.2246 yields 0.02899586 which truncates to 0.0289).
(C) For each organic HAP which is included according to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the total weight fraction of that organic HAP in the material is calculated by adding the weight fraction contribution of that organic HAP from each raw material in which that organic HAP is included according to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. The sum of each such addition must be expressed to four places after the decimal point.
(D) The total weight fraction of organic HAP in the material is the sum of the counted individual organic HAP weight fractions. This sum must be truncated to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763).

The weight fraction of each such organic HAP in each raw material must be determined by Method 311 of appendix A of this part, by an
alternate method approved by the Administrator, or from a CPDS provided by the raw material supplier or an independent third party. The weight fraction of each such organic HAP in each raw material must be expressed as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291).
(B) For each raw material used in making the material, the weight fraction contribution of each organic HAP, which is included according to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, in that raw material to the weight fraction organic HAP of the material is calculated by multiplying the weight fraction, truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291), of that organic HAP in that raw material times the weight fraction of that raw material, truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.2246), in the material. The product of each such multiplication is truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1291 times 0.2246 yields 0.02899586 which truncates to 0.0289).
(C) For each organic HAP which is included according to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the total weight fraction of that organic HAP in the material is calculated by adding the weight fraction contribution of that organic HAP from each raw material in which that organic HAP is included according to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. The sum of each such addition must be expressed to four places after the decimal point.
(D) The total weight fraction of organic HAP in the material is the sum of the counted individual organic HAP weight fractions. This sum is to be truncated to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.763).

If these values cannot be determined using Method 24A, the owner or operator shall submit an alternative technique for determining their values for approval by the Administrator.
(2) Each owner or operator of a product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing affected source shall determine the volatile matter weight fraction and solids weight fraction of each ink, coating, varnish, adhesive, primer, solvent, reducer, thinner, diluent, and other material applied by following the procedures in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, or by using formulation data as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(i) Determine the volatile matter weight fraction of the material using Method 24 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The Method 24 determination may be performed by the owner or operator of the affected source, the supplier of the material, or an independent third party.

# Appendix A to Subpart KK of Part 63—Data Quality Objective and Lower Confidence Limit Approaches for Alternative Capture Efficiency Protocols and Test Methods

# 1. Introduction
1.1 Alternative capture efficiency (CE) protocols and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the data quality objective (DQO) approach or the lower confidence limit (LCL) approach are acceptable under § 63.827(f). The general criteria for alternative CE protocols and test methods to qualify under either the DQO or LCL approach are described in section 2. The DQO approach and criteria specific to the DQO approach are described in section 3. The LCL approach and criteria specific to the LCL approach are described in section 4. The recommended reporting for alternative CE protocols and test methods are presented in section 5. The recommended recordkeeping for alternative CE protocols and test methods are presented in section 6.
1.2 Although the Procedures L, G.1, G.2, F.1, and F.2 in § 52.741 of part 52 were developed for TTE and BE testing, the same procedures can also be used in an alternative CE protocol. For example, a traditional liquid/gas mass balance CE protocol could employ Procedure L to measure liquid VOC input and Procedure G.1 to measure captured VOC.

# 2. General Criteria for DQO and LCL Approaches
2.1 The following general criteria must be met for an alternative capture efficiency protocol and test methods to qualify under the DQO or LCL approach.
2.2 An alternative CE protocol must consist of at least three valid test runs. Each test run must be at least 20 minutes long. No test run can be longer than 24 hours.
2.3 All test runs must be separate and independent. For example, liquid VOC input and output must be determined independently for each run. The final liquid VOC sample from one run cannot be the initial sample for another run. In addition, liquid input for an entire day cannot be apportioned among test runs based on production.
2.4 Composite liquid samples cannot be used to obtain an “average composition” for a test run. For example, separate initial and final coating samples must be taken and analyzed for each run; initial and final samples cannot be combined prior to analysis to derive an “average composition” for the test run.
2.5 All individual test runs that result in a CE of greater than 105 percent are invalid and must be discarded.
2.6 If the source can demonstrate to the regulatory agency that a test run should not be considered due to an identified testing or analysis error such as spillage of part of the sample during shipping or an upset or improper operating conditions that is not considered part of normal operation then the test result for that individual test run may be discarded. This limited exception allows sources to discard as “outliers” certain individual test runs without replacing them with a valid test run as long as the facility has at least three valid test runs to use when calculating its DQO or LCL. This exception is limited solely to test runs involving the types of errors identified above.
2.7 All valid test runs that are conducted must be included in the average CE determination. The individual test run CE results and average CE results cannot be truncated (i.e., 105 percent cannot be reported as 100 + percent) for purposes of meeting general or specific criteria for either the DQO or the LCL. If the DQO is satisfied and the average CE is greater than 100, then 100 percent CE must be considered the result of the test.
2.8 Alternative test methods for measuring VOC concentration must include a three-point calibration of the gas analysis instrument in the expected concentration range.

# 3. Data Quality Objective Approach
3.1 The purpose of the DQO is to allow sources to use alternative CE protocols and test methods while ensuring reasonable precision consistent with pertinent requirements of the Clean Air Act. In addition to the general criteria described in section 2, the specific DQO criterion is that the width of the two-sided 95 percent confidence interval of the mean measured value must be less than or equal to 10 percent of the mean measured value (see Figure 1). This ensures that 95 percent of the time, when the DQO is met, the actual CE value will be ±5 percent of the mean measured value (assuming that the test protocol is unbiased).
EC01MY92.047
3.2 The DQO calculation is made as follows using Equations 1 and 2:
ER24MY06.004
ER24MY06.005
Where:
a = Distance from the average measured CE value to the endpoints of the 95-percent (two-sided) confidence interval for the measured value.
n = Number of valid test runs.
P = DQO indicator statistic, distance from the average measured CE value to the endpoints of the 95-percent (two-sided) confidence interval, expressed as a percent of the average measured CE value.
s = Sample standard deviation.

3.3 The sample standard deviation and average CE value are calculated using Equations 3 and 4 as follows:
er30my96.024
er30my96.025
3.4 The DQO criteria are achieved when all of the general criteria in section 2 are achieved and P ≤5 percent (i.e., the specific DQO criterion is achieved). In order to meet this objective, facilities may have to conduct more than three test runs. Examples of calculating P, given a finite number of test runs, are shown below. (For purposes of this example it is assumed that all of the general criteria are met.)
3.5 Facility A conducted a CE test using a traditional liquid/gas mass balance and submitted the following results and the calculations shown in Equations 5 and 6:

ER30MY96.031
3.10 Based on these results, the specific DQO criterion is satisfied. Since all of the general criteria were also satisfied, the average CE from the nine test runs can be used to determine compliance.

# 4. Lower Confidence Limit Approach
4.1 The purpose of the LCL approach is to provide sources, that may be performing much better than their applicable regulatory requirement, a screening option by which they can demonstrate compliance. The approach uses less precise methods and avoids additional test runs which might otherwise be needed to meet the specific DQO criterion while still being assured of correctly demonstrating compliance. It is designed to reduce “false positive” or so called “Type II errors” which may erroneously indicate compliance where more variable test methods are employed. Because it encourages CE performance greater than that required in exchange for reduced compliance demonstration burden, the sources that successfully use the LCL approach could produce emission reductions beyond allowable emissions. Thus, it could provide additional benefits to the environment as well.
4.2 The LCL approach compares the 80 percent (two-sided) LCL for the mean measured CE value to the applicable CE regulatory requirement. In addition to the general criteria described in section 2, the specific LCL criteria are that either the LCL be greater than or equal to the applicable CE regulatory requirement or that the specific DQO criterion is met. A more detailed description of the LCL approach follows:
4.3 A source conducts an initial series of at least three runs. The owner or operator may choose to conduct additional test runs during the initial test if desired.
4.4 If all of the general criteria are met and the specific DQO criterion is met, then the average CE value is used to determine compliance.
4.5 If the data meet all of the general criteria, but do not meet the specific DQO criterion; and the average CE, using all valid test runs, is above 100 percent then the test sequence cannot be used to calculate the LCL. At this point the facility has the option of (a) conducting more test runs in hopes of meeting the DQO or of bringing the average CE for all test runs below 100 percent so the LCL can be used or (b) discarding all previous test data and retesting.
4.6 The purpose of the requirement in Section 4.5 is to protect against protocols and test methods which may be inherently biased high. This is important because it is impossible to have an actual CE greater than 100 percent and the LCL approach only looks at the lower end variability of the test results. This is different from the DQO which allows average CE values up to 105 percent because the DQO sets both upper and lower limits on test variability.
4.7 If at any point during testing the results meet the DQO, the average CE can be used for demonstrating compliance with the applicable regulatory requirement. Similarly, if the average CE is below 100 percent then the LCL can be used for demonstrating compliance with the applicable regulatory requirement without regard to the DQO.
4.8 The LCL is calculated at an 80 percent (two-sided) confidence level as follows using Equation 11:
ER24MY06.006
Where:
LC
1
= LCL at an 80-percent (two-sided) confidence level.
n = Number of valid test runs.
s = Sample standard deviation.
t
0.90
= t-value at the 80-percent (two-sided) confidence level (see Table A-1).
x
avg
= Average measured CE value (calculated from all valid test runs).
4.9 The resulting LC
1
is compared to the applicable CE regulatory requirement. If LC
1
exceeds (i.e., is higher than) the applicable regulatory requirement, then a facility is in initial compliance. However, if the LC
1
is below the CE requirement, then the facility must conduct additional test runs. After this point the test results will be evaluated not only looking at the LCL, but also the DQO of ±5 percent of the mean at a 95 percent confidence level. If the test results with the additional test runs meet the DQO before the LCL exceeds the applicable CE regulatory requirement, then the average CE value will be compared to the applicable CE regulatory requirement for determination of compliance.
4.10 If there is no specific CE requirement in the applicable regulation, then the applicable CE regulatory requirement is determined based on the applicable regulation and an acceptable destruction efficiency test. If the applicable regulation requires daily compliance and the latest CE compliance demonstration was made using the LCL approach, then the calculated LC
1
will be the highest CE value which a facility is allowed to claim until another CE demonstration test is conducted. This last requirement is necessary to assure both sufficiently reliable test results in all circumstances and the potential environmental benefits referenced above.
4.11 An example of calculating the LCL is shown below. Facility B's applicable regulatory requirement is 85 percent CE. Facility B conducted a CE test using a traditional liquid/gas mass balance and submitted the following results and the calculation shown in Equation 12:
Run
CE
1
94.2
2
97.6
3
90.5
Therefore:
n = 3
t
0.90
= 1.886
x
avg
= 94.1
s = 3.55
ER30MY96.033
4.12 Since the LC
1
of 90.23 percent is above the applicable regulatory requirement of 85 percent then the facility is in compliance. The facility must continue to accept the LC
1
of 90.23 percent as its CE value until a new series of valid tests is conducted. (The data generated by Facility B do not meet the specific DQO criterion.)

# 5. Recommended Reporting for Alternative CE Protocols
5.1 If a facility chooses to use alternative CE protocols and test methods that satisfy either the DQO or LCL and the additional criteria in section 4., the following information should be submitted with each test report to the appropriate regulatory agency:
1. A copy of all alternative test methods, including any changes to the EPA reference methods, QA/QC procedures and calibration procedures.
2. A table with information on each liquid sample, including the sample identification, where and when the sample was taken, and the VOC content of the sample;
3. The coating usage for each test run (for protocols in which the liquid VOC input is to be determined);
4. The quantity of captured VOC measured for each test run;
5. The CE calculations and results for each test run;
6. The DQO or LCL calculations and results; and
7. The QA/QC results, including information on calibrations (e.g., how often the instruments were calibrated, the calibration results, and information on calibration gases, if applicable).

# 6. Recommended Recordkeeping for Alternative CE Protocols.
6.1 A record should be kept at the facility of all raw data recorded during the test in a suitable form for submittal to the appropriate regulatory authority upon request.

The owner or operator shall calculate a lower TF emission limit for any potline associated with the modified potroom group, reconstructed potroom group, or new potroom group using the following equation:
L
1
= f
1
× L
PG1
+ (1−f
1
) × L
PL
Where:
L
1
= the lower TF emission limit in kg/Mg (lb/ton);
f
1
= the fraction of the potline's total aluminum production capacity that is contained within all modified potroom groups, reconstructed potroom groups, and new potroom groups;
L
PG1
= 0.95 kg/Mg (1.9 lb/ton) for prebake potlines and 1.0 kg/Mg (2.0 lb/ton) for Soderberg potlines; and
L
PL
= the TF emission limit from § 63.843(a)(1) for the appropriate potline subcategory that would have otherwise applied to the potline.
(c)
Upper TF emission limit.
The owner or operator shall calculate an upper TF emission limit for any potline associated with the modified potroom group, reconstructed potroom group, or new potroom group using the following equation:

+ (1−f
1
) × L
PL
Where:
L
2
= the upper TF emission limit in kg/Mg (lb/ton); and
L
PG2
= 1.25 kg/Mg (2.5 lb/ton) for prebake potlines and 1.3 kg/Mg (2.6 lb/ton) for Soderberg potlines.
(d)
Recalculation.
The TF emission limits in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be recalculated each time a new potroom group is added to the potline and each time an additional potroom group meets the definition of “modified potroom group” or “reconstructed potroom group.”
(e)
Emission limitation.
The owner or operator shall not discharge or cause to be discharged into the atmosphere emissions of TF from any potline associated with the modified potroom group, reconstructed potroom group, or new potroom group that exceed the lower emission limit calculated in paragraph (b) of this section, except that emissions less than the upper limit calculated in paragraph (c) of this section will be considered in compliance if the owner or operator demonstrates that exemplary operation and maintenance procedures were used with respect to the emission control system and that proper control equipment was operating at the potline during the performance test.
(f)
Report.
Within 30 days of any performance test that reveals emissions that fall between the lower limit calculated in paragraph (b) of this section and the upper limit calculated in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit to the applicable regulatory authority a report indicating whether all necessary control devices were online and operating properly during the performance test, describing the operating and maintenance procedures followed, and setting forth any explanation for the excess emissions.
(g)
Procedures to determine TF emissions.
The owner or operator shall determine TF emissions for the potline using the following procedures:
(1) Determine the emission rate of TF in kg/Mg (lb/ton) from sampling secondary emissions and the primary control system for all new potroom groups, modified potroom groups, and reconstructed potroom groups using the procedures, equations, and test methods in §§ 63.847, 63.848, and 63.849.
(2) Determine the emission rate of TF in kg/Mg (lb/ton) from sampling secondary emissions and the primary control system for potroom groups or sections of potroom groups within the potline that are not new potroom groups, modified potroom groups, or reconstructed potroom groups according to paragraphs (g)(2)(i) or (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
(i) Determine the mass emission rate of TF in kg/Mg (lb/ton) from at least one potroom group within the potline that is not a new potroom group, modified potroom group, or reconstructed potroom group using the procedures,
equations, and test methods in §§ 63.847, 63.848, and 63.849, or
(ii) Use the results of the testing required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section to represent the entire potline based on a demonstration that the results are representative of the entire potline. Representativeness shall be based on showing that all of the potroom groups associated with the potline are substantially equivalent in terms of their structure, operability, type of emissions, volume of emissions, and concentration of emissions.
(3) Calculate the TF emissions for the potline in kg/Mg (lb/ton) based on the production-weighted average of the TF emission rates from paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section using the following equation:
E = f
1
× E
PG1
+ (1-f
1
) × E
PL
where:
E = the TF emission rate for the entire potline, kg/Mg (lb/ton);
f
1
= the fraction of the potline's total aluminum production rate that is contained within all modified potroom groups, reconstructed potroom groups, and new potroom groups;
E
PG1
= the TF emission rate from paragraph (g)(1) of this section for all modified potroom groups, reconstructed potroom groups, and new potroom groups, kg/Mg (lb/ton); and
E
PL
= the TF emission rate for the balance of the potline from paragraph (g)(2) of this section, kg/Mg (lb/ton).
Compliance is demonstrated when TF emissions for the potline meet the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section.

§ 63.860
Applicability and designation of affected source.
(a) The requirements of this subpart apply to the owner or operator of each kraft, soda, sulfite, or stand-alone semichemical pulp mill that is a major source of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions as defined in § 63.2.
(b)
Affected sources.
The requirements of this subpart apply to each new or existing affected source listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section:
(1) Each existing chemical recovery system (as defined in § 63.861) located at a kraft or soda pulp mill.
(2) Each new nondirect contact evaporator (NDCE) recovery furnace and associated smelt dissolving tank(s) located at a kraft or soda pulp mill.
(3) Each new direct contact evaporator (DCE) recovery furnace system (as defined in § 63.861) and associated
smelt dissolving tank(s) located at a kraft or soda pulp mill.
(4) Each new lime kiln located at a kraft or soda pulp mill.
(5) Each new or existing sulfite combustion unit located at a sulfite pulp mill, except such existing units at Cosmo Specialty Fibers' Cosmopolis, Washington facility (Emission Unit no. AP-10).
(6) Each new or existing semichemical combustion unit located at a stand-alone semichemical pulp mill.
(7) The requirements of the alternative standard in § 63.862(d) apply to the hog fuel dryer at Cosmo Specialty Fibers' Cosmopolis, Washington facility (Emission Unit no. HD-14).
(c) The requirements of the General Provisions in subpart A of this part that apply to the owner or operator subject to the requirements of this subpart are identified in Table 1 to this subpart.
(d) At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.

If the reporting form specific to this subpart is not available in CEDRI at the time that the report is due, you must submit the report to the Administrator at all the appropriate addresses listed in § 63.13. Once the form has been available in CEDRI for 1 year, you must begin submitting all subsequent reports via CEDRI. The reports must be submitted by the deadlines specified in this subpart, regardless of the method in which the reports are submitted.
(3) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, and due to a planned or actual outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the submission is due, you will be or are precluded from accessing CEDRI or CDX and submitting a required report within the time prescribed, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying the date, time and length of the outage; a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved. The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(4) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX and a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date the submission is due, the owner or operator may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage). If you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the
event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs. The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.

# Subpart OO—National Emission Standards for Tanks—Level 1

# Source:
61 FR 34184, July 1, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.900
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart apply to the control of air emissions from tanks for which another subpart of 40 CFR parts 60, 61, or 63 references the use of this subpart for such air emission control. These air emission standards for tanks are placed here for administrative convenience and only apply to those owners and operators of facilities subject to the other subparts that reference this subpart. The provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A—General Provisions do not apply to this
subpart except as noted in the subpart that references this subpart.
§ 63.901
Definitions.
All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined in both this section and in another subpart that references the use of this subpart, then the definition in this subpart shall take precedence when implementing this subpart.
Closure device
means a cap, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that, when the device is secured in the closed position, prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an opening in a fixed roof. Closure devices include devices that are detachable from the cover (e.g., a sampling port cap), manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring-loaded pressure relief valve).
Fixed roof
means a cover that is mounted on a tank in a stationary position and does not move with fluctuations in the level of the liquid managed in the tank.
No detectable organic emissions
means no escape of organics to the atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in § 63.905(a) of this subpart.
Regulated-material
means the material (e.g. waste, wastewater, off-site material) required to be managed in tanks using air emission controls in accordance with the standards specified in this subpart.
Safety device
means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to equipment by venting gases or vapors during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purpose of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
Tank
means a stationary unit that is constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (such as wood, concrete, steel, fiberglass, or plastic) which provide structural support and is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids or other materials.
[61 FR 34184, July 1, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 38985, July 20, 1999]
§ 63.902
Standards—Tank fixed roof.
(a) This section applies to owners and operators subject to this subpart and controlling air emissions from a tank using a fixed roof. This section does not apply to a fixed-roof tank that is also equipped with an internal floating roof.
(b) The tank shall be equipped with a fixed roof designed to meet the following specifications:
(1) The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be designed to form a continuous barrier over the entire surface area of the liquid in the tank. The fixed roof may be a separate cover installed on the tank (e.g., a removable cover mounted on an open-top tank) or may be an integral part of the tank structural design (e.g., a horizontal cylindrical tank equipped with a hatch).
(2) The fixed roof shall be installed in a manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces between roof section joints or between the interface of the roof edge and the tank wall.
(3) Each opening in the fixed roof, and any manifold system associated with the fixed roof, shall be either:
(i) equipped with a closure device designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the
closure device or between the perimeter of the opening and the closure device; or
(ii) connected by a closed-vent system that is vented to a control device. The control device shall remove or destroy organics in the vent stream, and shall be operating whenever regulated material is managed in the tank.
(4) The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be made of suitable materials that will minimize exposure of the regulated-material to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, and will maintain the integrity of the equipment throughout its intended service life. Factors to be considered when selecting the materials for and designing the fixed roof and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability, the effects of any contact with the liquid or its vapors managed in the tank; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for the tank on which the fixed roof is installed.
(c) Whenever a regulated-material is in the tank, the fixed roof shall be installed with each closure device secured in the closed position except as follows:
(1) Opening of closure devices or removal of the fixed roof is allowed at the following times:
(i) To provide access to the tank for performing routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed for normal operations. Examples of such activities include those times when a worker needs to open a port to sample the liquid in the tank, or when a worker needs to open a hatch to maintain or repair equipment. Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable, to the tank.
(ii) To remove accumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom of tank.
(2) Opening of a spring-loaded pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the tank internal pressure in accordance with the tank design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the tank internal pressure is within the internal pressure operating range determined by the owner or operator based on the tank manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal operating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those times when the container internal pressure exceeds the internal pressure operating range for the tank as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.
(3) Opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.901 of this subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require it to do so to avoid an unsafe condition.
(d) The owner or operator shall inspect the air emission control equipment in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.906(a) of this subpart.
[61 FR 34184, July 1, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 38986, July 20, 1999]
§§ 63.903-63.904
[Reserved]
§ 63.905
Test methods and procedures.
(a) Procedure for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.
(1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.
(2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.
(3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.
(4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and
(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.
(6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.
(8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.
(i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
(ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
(9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
(i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.
(ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.
(b) [Reserved]
[64 FR 38986, July 20, 1999]
§ 63.906
Inspection and monitoring requirements.
(a) Owners and operators that use a tank equipped with a fixed roof in accordance with the provisions of § 63.902 of this subpart shall meet the following requirements:
(1) The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be visually inspected by the
owner or operator to check for defects that could result in air emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and the tank wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices.
(2) The owner or operator must perform an initial inspection following installation of the fixed roof. Thereafter, the owner or operator must perform the inspections at least once every calendar year except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section.
(3) In the event that a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
(4) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the inspection in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.907 (a) of this subpart.
(b) The owner or operator shall repair all detected defects as follows:
(1) The owner or operator shall make first efforts at repair of the defect no later than 5 calendar days after detection and repair shall be completed as soon as possible but no later than 45 calendar days after detection except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2) Repair of a defect may be delayed beyond 45 calendar days if the owner or operator determines that repair of the defect requires emptying or temporary removal from service of the tank and no alternative tank capacity is available at the site to accept the regulated material normally managed in the tank. In this case, the owner or operator shall repair the defect the next time alternative tank capacity becomes available and the tank can be emptied or temporarily removed from service, as necessary to complete the repair.
(c) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the defect repair in accordance with the requirements specified in § 63.907(b) of this subpart.
(d)
Alternative inspection and monitoring interval.
Following the initial inspection and monitoring of a fixed roof in accordance with this section, subsequent inspection and monitoring of the equipment may be performed at intervals longer than 1 year when an owner or operator determines that performing the required inspection or monitoring procedures would expose a worker to dangerous, hazardous, or otherwise unsafe conditions and the owner or operator complies with the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator must prepare and maintain at the plant site written documentation identifying the specific air pollution control equipment designated as “unsafe to inspect and monitor.” The documentation must include for each piece of air pollution control equipment designated as such a written explanation of the reasons why the equipment is unsafe to inspect or monitor using the applicable procedures under this section.
(2) The owner or operator must develop and implement a written plan and schedule to inspect and monitor the air pollution control equipment using the applicable procedures specified in this section during times when a worker can safely access the air pollution control equipment. The required inspections and monitoring must be performed as frequently as practicable but do not need to be performed more frequently than the periodic schedule that would be otherwise applicable to the air pollution control equipment under the provisions of this section. A copy of the written plan and schedule must be maintained at the plant site.
[61 FR 34184, July 1, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 38986, July 20, 1999]
§ 63.907
Recordkeeping requirements.
(a) Each owner or operator shall prepare and maintain a record for each tank that includes the following information:
(1) A tank identification number (or other unique identification description as selected by the owner or operator).
(2) A description of the tank dimensions and the tank design capacity.
(3) The date that each inspection required by § 63.906 of this subpart is performed.
(b) The owner or operator shall record the following information for each defect detected during inspections
required by § 63.906 of this subpart: the location of the defect, a description of the defect, the date of detection, and corrective action taken to repair the defect. In the event that repair of the defect is delayed in accordance with the provisions of § 63.907(b)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall also record the reason for the delay and the date that completion of repair of the defect is expected.
§ 63.908
Implementation and enforcement.
(a) This subpart can be implemented and enforced by the U.S. EPA, or a delegated authority such as the applicable State, local, or Tribal agency. If the U.S. EPA Administrator has delegated authority to a State, local, or Tribal agency, then that agency, in addition to the U.S. EPA, has the authority to implement and enforce this subpart. Contact the applicable U.S. EPA Regional Office to find out if this subpart is delegated to a State, local, or Tribal agency.

# Subpart PP—National Emission Standards for Containers

# Source:
61 FR 34186, July 1, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.920
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart apply to the control of air emissions from containers for which another subpart of 40 CFR parts 60, 61, or 63 references the use of this subpart for such air emission control. These air emission standards for containers are placed here for administrative convenience and only apply to those owners and operators of facilities subject to the other subparts that reference this subpart. The provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A—General Provisions do not apply to this subpart except as noted in the subpart that references this subpart.
§ 63.921
Definitions.
All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined in both this section and in another subpart that references the use of this subpart, then the definition in this subpart shall take precedence when implementing this subpart.
Container
means a portable unit in which a material can be stored, transported, treated, disposed of, or otherwise handled. Examples of containers include but are not limited to drums, dumpsters, roll-off boxes, bulk cargo containers commonly known as “portable tanks” or “totes,” cargo tank trucks, and tank railcars.
Closure device
means a cover, cap, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an opening in a container or its cover when the device is secured in the closed position. Closure devices include devices that are detachable from the container (e.g., a drum head, a threaded plug), manually operated (e.g., a hinged dumpster lid, a truck tank hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring loaded pressure relief valve).
Empty container
means a container for which either of the following conditions exists: the container meets the
conditions for an empty container specified in 40 CFR 261.7(b); or all regulated-material has been removed from the container except for any regulated-material that remains on the interior surfaces of the container as clingage or in pools on the container bottom due to irregularities in the container.
No detectable organic emissions
means no escape of organics to the atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in § 63.925(a) of this subpart.
Regulated-material
means the material (e.g. waste, wastewater, off-site material) required to be managed in containers using air emission controls in accordance with the standards specified in this subpart.
Safety device
means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to equipment by venting gases or vapors during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purpose of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
[61 FR 34186, July 1, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 38987, July 20, 1999]
§ 63.922
Standards—Container Level 1 controls.
(a) This section applies to owners and operators subject to this subpart and required to control air emissions from containers using Container Level 1 controls.
(b) A container using Container Level 1 controls is one of the following:
(1) A container that meets the applicable U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations on packaging hazardous materials for transportation as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
(2) A container equipped with a cover and closure devices that form a continuous barrier over the container openings such that when the cover and closure devices are secured in the closed position there are no visible holes, gaps, or other open spaces into the interior of the container. The cover may be a separate cover installed on the container (e.g., a lid on a drum, a suitably secured tarp on a roll-off box) or may be an integral part of the container structural design (e.g., a bulk cargo container equipped with a screw-type cap).
(3) An open-top container in which an organic vapor-suppressing barrier is placed on or over the regulated-material in the container such that no regulated-material is exposed to the atmosphere. One example of such a barrier is application of a suitable organic-vapor suppressing foam.
(c) A container used to meet the requirements of either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section shall be equipped with covers and closure devices, as applicable to the container, that are composed of suitable materials to minimize exposure of the regulated-material to the atmosphere and to maintain the equipment integrity for as long as it is in service. Factors to be considered when selecting the materials for and designing the cover and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability, the effects of contact with the material or its vapor managed in the container; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for container on which the cover is installed.
(d) Whenever a regulated-material is in a container using Container Level 1 controls, the owner or operator shall install all covers and closure devices
for the container, and secure and maintain each closure device in the closed position except as follows:
(1) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of adding material to the container as follows:
(i) In the case when the container is filled to the intended final level in one continuous operation, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install the covers, as applicable to the container, upon conclusion of the filling operation.
(ii) In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material intermittently are added to the container over a period of time, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon either: the container being filled to the intended final level; the completion of a batch loading after which no additional material will be added to the container within 15 minutes; the person performing the loading operation leaves the immediate vicinity of the container; or the shutdown of the process generating the material being added to the container, whichever condition occurs first.
(2) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed for the purpose of removing material from the container as follows:
(i) For the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section, an empty container as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart may be open to the atmosphere at any time (e.g., covers and closure devices are not required to be secured in the closed position on an empty container).
(ii) In the case when discrete quantities or batches of material are removed from the container but the container does not meet the conditions to be an empty container as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure devices in the closed position and install covers, as applicable to the container, upon the completion of a batch removal after which no additional material will be removed from the container within 15 minutes, or the person performing the unloading operation leaves the immediate vicinity of the container, whichever condition occurs first.
(3) Opening of a closure device or cover is allowed when access inside the container is needed to perform routine activities other than transfer of regulated-material. Examples of such activities include those times when a worker needs to open a port to measure the depth of or sample the material in the container, or when a worker needs to open a manhole hatch to access equipment inside the container. Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable to the container.
(4) Opening of a spring-loaded pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the container internal pressure in accordance with the container design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the container internal pressure is within the internal pressure operating range determined by the owner or operator based on container manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, ignitable, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal operating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those times when the container internal pressure exceeds the internal pressure operating range for the container as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.
(5) Opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.921 of this subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require it to do so to avoid an unsafe condition.

§ 63.925
Test methods and procedures.
(a) Procedures for determining no detectable organic emissions for the purpose of complying with this subpart.
(1) The test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Each potential leak interface (i.e., a location where organic vapor leakage could occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.
(2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.
(3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.
(4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in
Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and
(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.
(6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.
(8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.
(i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
(ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
(9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
(i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.
(ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.
(b) Procedure for determining a container to be vapor-tight for the purpose of complying with this subpart.
(1) The test shall be performed in accordance with Method 27 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A of this chapter.
(2) A pressure measurement device shall be used that has a precision of ±2.5 mm water and that is capable of measuring above the pressure at which the container is to be tested for vapor tightness.
(3) If the test results determined by Method 27 indicate that the container sustains a pressure change less than or equal to 750 Pascals within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to a minimum of 4,500 Pascals, then the container is determined to be vapor-tight.

# Subpart QQ—National Emission Standards for Surface Impoundments

# Source:
61 FR 34190, July 1, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.940
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart apply to the control of air emissions from surface impoundments for which another subpart of 40 CFR parts 60, 61, or 63 references the use of this subpart for such air emission control. These air emission standards for surface impoundments are placed here for administrative convenience and only apply to those owners and operators of facilities subject to the other subparts that reference this subpart. The provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart AA—General Provisions do not apply to this subpart except as noted in the subpart that references this subpart.
§ 63.941
Definitions.
All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined in both this section and in another subpart that references the use of this subpart, then the definition in this subpart shall take precedence when implementing this subpart.
Closure device
means a cap, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an
opening in a surface impoundment cover when the device is secured in the closed position. Closure devices include devices that are detachable from the cover (e.g., a sampling port cap), manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring loaded pressure relief valve).
Cover
means a device or system that provides a continuous barrier over the material managed in a surface impoundment to prevent or reduce air pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. A cover may have openings needed for operation, inspection, sampling, maintenance, and repair of the surface impoundment provided that each opening is closed when not in use (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports). Examples of a cover for a surface impoundment include, but are not limited to, a floating membrane cover placed on the surface of the material in the surface impoundment or an air-supported structure installed over the surface impoundment.
No detectable organic emissions
means no escape of organics to the atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in § 63.944(a) of this subpart.
Regulated-material
means the material (e.g. waste, wastewater, off-site material) required to be managed in containers using air emission controls in accordance with the standards specified in this subpart.
Safety device
means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to equipment by venting gases or vapors during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purpose of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
Surface impoundment
means a unit that is a natural topographical depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with man-made materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids. Examples of surface impoundments include holding, storage, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons.

Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly replace the cover and secure the closure device in the closed position, as applicable.
(ii) To remove accumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom of surface impoundment.
(2) Opening of a spring-loaded pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the pressure in the vapor headspace underneath the cover in accordance with the cover design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions as defined in § 63.941 of this subpart when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the cover vapor headspace pressure is within the pressure operating range determined by the owner or operator based on the cover manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, ignitible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
(3) Opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.941 of this subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require it to do so to avoid an unsafe condition.
(d) The owner or operator shall inspect the floating membrane cover in accordance with the procedures specified in § 63.946(a) of this subpart.
§ 63.943
Standards—Surface impoundment vented to control device.

Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices include, but are not limited to the interface of the cover and its foundation mounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure device; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure-relief valve.
(2) The test shall be performed when the unit contains a material having a total organic concentration representative of the range of concentrations for the materials expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover
and closure devices shall be secured in the closed position.
(3) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of the organic constituents in the material placed in the unit, not for each individual organic constituent.
(4) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(5) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon in air); and
(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane in air at a concentration of approximately, but less than 10,000 ppmv.
(6) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, the background level value must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(7) Each potential leak interface shall be checked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface as close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a complete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface shall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device prevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an enclosed extension or horn (e.g., some pressure relief devices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.
(8) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable procedure specified in paragraph (a)(8)(i) or (a)(8)(ii) of this section.
(i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
(ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic concentration value measured by the instrument and the background organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
(9) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable emissions using the applicable criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
(i) For a potential leak interface other than a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 500 ppmv.
(ii) For a seal around a shaft that passes through a cover opening, the potential leak interface is determined to operate with no detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value determined in paragraph (a)(8) is less than 10,000 ppmv.

61 FR 34193, July 1, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.960
Applicability.
(a) The provisions of this subpart apply to the control of air emissions from individual drain systems for which another subpart of 40 CFR parts 60, 61, or 63 references the use of this subpart for such air emission control. These air emission standards for individual drain systems are placed here for administrative convenience and only apply to those owners and operators of facilities subject to the other subparts that reference this subpart. The provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A—General Provisions do not apply to this subpart except as noted in the subpart that references this subpart.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 63.961
Definitions.
All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined in both this section and in another subpart that references the use of this subpart, then the definition in this subpart shall take precedence when implementing this subpart.
Closure device
means a cap, cover, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that, when the device is secured in the closed position, prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an opening to the individual drain system. Closure devices include devices that are detachable (e.g., a plug or manhole cover), manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring-loaded pressure relief valve).
Hard-piping
means pipe or tubing that is manufactured and properly installed in accordance with relevant standards (e.g., ANSI B31-3) and good engineering practices.
Individual drain system
means a stationary system used to convey regulated-material to a waste management unit or to discharge or disposal. The term includes hard-piping, all drains and junction boxes, together with their associated sewer lines and other junction boxes (e.g., manholes, sumps, and lift stations) conveying regulated-material. For the purpose of this subpart, an individual drain system is not a drain and collection system that is designed and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall runoff (e.g., stormwater sewer system) and is segregated from all other individual drain systems.
Junction box
means a sump, manhole, or access point to a sewer line or a lift station.
Regulated-material
means the wastewater streams, residuals, and any other materials specified by the referencing subpart to be managed in accordance with the standards under this subpart.
Sewer line
means a lateral, trunk line, branch line, or other conduit used to convey regulated-material to a downstream waste management unit. Sewer lines include pipes, grates, and trenches.
Waste management unit
means the equipment, structure, or device used to convey, store, treat, or dispose of regulated-material. Examples of waste management units include: wastewater tanks, surface impoundments, individual drain systems, and biological wastewater treatment units. Examples
of equipment that may be waste management units include containers, air flotation units, oil-water separators or organic-water separators, or organic removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units.
Water seal
means a seal pot, p-leg trap, or other type of trap filled with water (e.g., flooded sewers that maintain liquid levels adequate to prevent air flow through the system) that creates a liquid barrier between the sewer line and the atmosphere. The liquid level of the seal must be maintained in the vertical leg of a drain in order to be considered a water seal.

# Subpart SS—National Emission Standards for Closed Vent Systems, Control Devices, Recovery Devices and Routing to a Fuel Gas System or a Process

# Source:
64 FR 34866, June 29, 1999, unless otherwise noted.
§ 63.980
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart include requirements for closed vent systems, control devices and routing of air emissions to a fuel gas system or process. These provisions apply when another subpart references the use of this subpart for such air emission control. These air emission standards are placed here for administrative convenience and only apply to those owners and operators of facilities subject to a referencing subpart. The provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A (General Provisions) do not apply to this subpart except as specified in a referencing subpart.
§ 63.981
Definitions.
Alternative test method
means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant that is not a reference test or equivalent method, and that has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction, using Method 301 in appendix A of this part 63, or previously approved by the Administrator prior to the promulgation date of standards for an affected source or affected facility under a referencing subpart, to produce results adequate for the Administrator's determination that it may be used in place of a test method specified in this subpart.
Boiler
means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator or a process heater.
By compound
means by individual stream components, not carbon equivalents.
Closed vent system
means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device. Closed vent system does not include the vapor collection system that is part of any tank truck or railcar.
Closed vent system shutdown
means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a closed vent system or part of a closed vent system consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be effected.
An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit for less than 24 hours is not a closed vent system shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that would stop production from a process unit or part of a process unit for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the closed vent system or part of the closed vent system of materials and start up the unit, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled closed vent system shutdown, is not a closed vent system shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not closed vent system shutdowns.
Combustion device
means an individual unit of equipment, such as a flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler, used for the combustion of organic emissions.
Continuous parameter monitoring system
(CPMS) means the total equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this part, used to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of process or control system parameters.
Continuous record
means documentation, either in hard copy or computer readable form, of data values measured at least once every 15 minutes and recorded at the frequency specified in § 63.998(b).
Control device
means, with the exceptions noted below, a combustion device, recovery device, recapture device, or any combination of these devices used to comply with this subpart or a referencing subpart. For process vents from continuous unit operations at affected sources in subcategories where the applicability criteria includes a TRE index value, recovery devices are not considered to be control devices. Primary condensers on steam strippers or fuel gas systems are not considered to be control devices.
Control System
means the combination of the closed vent system and the control devices used to collect and control vapors or gases from a regulated emission source.
Day
means a calendar day.
Ductwork
means a conveyance system such as those commonly used for heating and ventilation systems. It is often made of sheet metal and often has sections connected by screws or crimping. Hard-piping is not ductwork.
Final recovery device
means the last recovery device on a process vent stream from a continuous unit operation at an affected source in a subcategory where the applicability criteria includes a TRE index value. The final recovery device usually discharges to a combustion device, recapture device, or directly to the atmosphere.
First attempt at repair,
