The interest is not an amount subject to withholding as defined in § 1.1441-2(a) and is not a withholdable payment. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, USP must apply the rules of §§ 1.1441-1(b)(2) and 1.1441-5(c) and (e) to determine the payee of the interest. Under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(i), X, the person to whom the payment is made, is considered to be the payee, unless X is determined to be a flow-through entity, in which case the rules of § 1.1441-5(c) or (e) apply to determine the payee. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii) applies to determine X's classification as an individual, trust, estate, corporation or partnership. Under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(B), X is treated as a partnership, since it does not appear to be an individual, trust, or estate and cannot be treated as an exempt recipient without documentation. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply the provisions of §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to determine whether, X is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section also states that the presumptions of foreign status for payments made with respect to offshore obligations contained in §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and 1.1441-5(d)(2) do not apply to amounts that are not subject to withholding and that are not withholdable payments described in paragraph (d)(2)(i). Therefore, under §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a U.S. partnership because it does not have actual knowledge that X's employer identification number begins with the digits “98.” Therefore, USP must treat X as a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient and report the payment on Form 1099 under section 6049. Under § 31.3406(g)-1(e) of this chapter, however, USP is not required to backup withhold on the payment unless it has actual knowledge that X is a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient.

# Example 6.

Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 5,
except that the interest is paid by F, a non-U.S. payor, as defined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(ii)
Analysis.
The analysis is the same as under
Example 5.
However, F is a non-U.S. payor paying foreign source interest outside the United States, and there is no indication that the amount is received in the United States under § 1.6049-4(f)(16). Thus, paragraph (b)(6) of this section exempts the payment from reporting under section 6049.

# Example 7.
(i)
Facts.
USP, a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section
that is not an FFI, makes a payment of U.S. source interest that is a withholdable payment to NQI, a nonqualified intermediary as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(14), that is a certified deemed-compliant FFI under § 1.1471-5(f)(2). The interest is paid inside the United States to an account of a bank or other financial institution maintained in the United States. NQI has provided USP with a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate, as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) that includes its chapter 4 status, but has not attached any documentation from the persons on whose behalf it acts or a withholding statement as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv).
(ii)
Analysis.
U.S. source interest is an amount subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a). USP may treat the payment as made to a foreign intermediary under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v)(A) because USP has received a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate from NQI and may except NQI from withholding under chapter 4 of the Code given NQI's status for chapter 4 purposes as a deemed-compliant FFI. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, USP must then apply § 1.1471-3(c)(3) to treat the persons on whose behalf NQI is acting as the payees. Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section also requires USP to apply the presumption rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v) if it cannot reliably associate the payment with valid documentation from a payee. See § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii). As the payment is a withholdable payment, the interest is treated as paid to a nonparticipating FFI under § 1.1471-3(f)(4). Therefore, the payment is not subject to reporting on Form 1099 under paragraph (b)(12) of this section. See § 1.1471-2(a) for the withholding requirement with respect to the payment and § 1.1474-1(d)(2) for the requirement to report the payment on Form 1042-S.

# Example 8.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 7,
except that the interest is paid outside the United States, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section to an offshore account, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and is not a withholdable payment.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v)(B), the interest is treated as paid to an unknown foreign payee because it cannot be reliably associated with documentation under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii). Therefore, the payment is not subject to reporting on Form 1099 under paragraph (b)(12) of this section because the payment is presumed made to a foreign person. The payment is subject to withholding, however, under § 1.1441-1(b) at a rate of 30% and is subject to reporting on Form 1042-S under § 1.1461-1(c).

# Example 10.
(i)
Facts.
USP, a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, makes a payment of foreign source interest (other than deposit interest) to NQI, a foreign corporation and a nonqualified intermediary as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(14). NQI has provided USP with a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate, as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii), but has not attached any documentation from the persons on whose behalf it acts or a withholding statement as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv).
(ii)
Analysis.
Foreign source interest is not an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and is not a withholdable payment. See §§ 1.1441-2(a) and 1.1473-1(a). Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, amounts that are not subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and that are not withholdable payments described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that a payor may treat as paid to a foreign intermediary are treated as made to an exempt recipient described in § 1.6049-4(c) absent actual knowledge that the payee is a U.S. person who is not an exempt recipient. Therefore, the foreign source interest is not subject to reporting on Form 1099.

# Example 11.
(i)
Facts.
USP is a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section that is a bank. USP pays U.S. source original issue discount from the redemption of an obligation described in section 871(g)(1)(B) to NQI, a foreign corporation that is a nonqualified intermediary as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(14). The redemption proceeds are not paid outside of the United States as they are paid with respect to an account NQI has with a branch of a bank in the United States. See § 1.6049-5(e)(2). NQI provides a nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) that includes a certification of its status as a registered deemed-compliant FFI but does not attach any payee documentation or a withholding statement described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv).
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, USP must treat the payment as made to an undocumented U.S. payee that is not an exempt recipient and report the payment on Form 1099. Further, because the payment is made inside the United States, the exception to backup withholding with respect to offshore obligations contained in § 31.3406(g)-1(e) of this chapter does not apply, and the payment is subject to backup withholding.

# Example 12.
(i)
Facts.
P, a payor, makes a payment to NQI of U.S. source interest on debt obligations issued prior to July 18, 1984, that mature 30 years from their issuance dates. Therefore, the interest does not qualify as portfolio interest under section 871(h) or 881(d). Additionally, the interest is not a withholdable payment under § 1.1471-2(b) as the interest is a payment with respect to a grandfathered obligation for purposes of
chapter 4 of the Code. NQI, a U.S. payor, is a nonqualified foreign intermediary, as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(14), and has furnished P a valid nonqualified intermediary withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) to which it has attached a valid Form W-9 for A, and two valid beneficial owner Forms W-8, one for B and one for C. A is not an exempt recipient under § 1.6049-4(c). NQI furnishes a withholding statement, described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv), in which it allocates 20% of the U.S. source interest to A, but does not allocate the remaining 80% of the interest between B and C. B's withholding certificate indicates that B is a foreign pension fund, exempt from U.S. tax under the U.S. income tax treaty with Country T. C's withholding certificate indicates that C is a foreign corporation not entitled to a reduced rate of withholding.
(ii)
Analysis.
As the interest is not a withholdable payment under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, P applies the rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(v) to determine the payees of the interest even though NQI has not certified its status for purposes of chapter 4 of the Code. Under that section, the payees are the persons on whose behalf NQI acts—A, B and C. Because P can reliably associate 20% of the payment with valid documentation provided by A, P must treat 20% of the interest as paid to A, a U.S. person not exempt from reporting, and report the payment on Form 1099. P cannot reliably associate the remaining 80% of the payment with valid documentation under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) and, therefore, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section must apply the presumption rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v). Under that section, the interest is presumed paid to an unknown foreign payee. Under paragraph (b)(12) of this section, P is not required to report the interest presumed paid to a foreign person on Form 1099. Under § 1.1441-1(b), 80% of the interest is subject to 30% withholding, however, and the interest is reportable on Form 1042-S under § 1.1461-1(c).

# Example 13.

Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 12,
except that P can reliably associate 30% of the payment of interest to B, but cannot reliably associate the remaining 70 percent with A or C.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, P applies the rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(v) to determine the payees of the interest. Under that section, the payees are the persons on whose behalf NQI acts—A, B and C. Because P can reliably associate 30% of the payment with B, a foreign pensions fund exempt from withholding under an income tax treaty, P may treat that payment as paid to B and not subject to reporting on Form 1099 under paragraph (b)(12) of this section. P cannot reliably associate the remaining 70% of the payment with valid documentation under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) and, therefore, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section must apply the presumption rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v). Under that section, the interest is presumed paid to an unknown foreign payee. Under paragraph (b)(12) of this section, P is not required to report the interest presumed paid to a foreign person on Form 1099. Under § 1.1441-1(b), 80% of the interest is subject to 30% withholding, however, and the interest is reportable on Form 1042-S under § 1.1461-1(c).

# Example 14.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 12,
except that P also makes a payment of foreign source interest to NQI.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii), P may treat the foreign source interest as paid to an exempt recipient as defined in § 1.6049-4(c) and not subject to reporting on Form 1099 even though some or all of the foreign source interest may in fact be owned by A, the U.S. person that is not exempt from reporting.

# Example 15.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 12,
except that NQI is a non-U.S. payor.
(ii)
Analysis.
The analysis is the same as under
Example 12
with respect to B and C. However, because NQI is a non-U.S. payor, it may under § 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii) allocate the portion of the payment to A to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees on a withholding statement provided to P in lieu of furnishing the Form W-9 to P when NQI reports the payments in accordance with § 1.6049-4(c)(4)(i). In such a case, provided that P obtains a certification form confirming NQI's status as a participating FFI, P is excepted from reporting the payment under paragraph (b)(14) of this section because P can reliably associate the payment with the documentation provided by NQI.
(e)
Determination of whether amounts are considered paid outside the United States
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 6049 and this section, an amount is considered to be paid by a payor or middleman outside the United States if the payor or middleman completes the acts necessary to effect payment outside the United States. See paragraphs (e)(2) through (5) of this section for further clarification of where amounts are considered paid. A payment shall not be considered to be made within the United States for purposes of section 6049 merely by reason of the fact that it is made on a draft drawn on a United States bank account or by a wire or other electronic transfer from a United States account.
(2)
Amounts paid with respect to deposits or accounts with banks and other financial institutions.
Notwithstanding
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an amount paid by a bank or other financial institution with respect to a deposit or with respect to an account with the institution is considered paid at the branch or office at which the amount is credited unless the amount is collected by the financial institution as the agent of the payee. However, an amount will not be considered to be paid at the branch or office where the amount is considered to be credited unless the branch or office is a permanent place of business that is regularly maintained, occupied, and used to carry on a banking or similar financial business; the business is conducted by at least one employee of the branch or office who is regularly in attendance at such place of business during normal business hours; and the branch or office receives deposits and engages in one or more of the other activities described in § 1.864-4(c)(5)(i).
(3)
Coupon bonds and discount obligations in bearer form.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an amount paid with respect to a bond with coupons attached (including a certificate of deposit with detachable interest coupons) or a discount obligation that is not in registered form (within the meaning of section 163(f) and the regulations thereunder) is considered to be paid where the coupon or the discount obligation is presented to the payor or its paying agent for payment.
(4)
Foreign-targeted registered obligations.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, where the payor is the issuer or the issuer's agent, an amount is considered paid outside the United States with respect to a foreign-targeted registered obligation issued before January 1, 2016, as described in § 1.871-14(e)(2), if either the amount is paid by transfer to an account maintained by the registered owner outside the United States, or by mail to an address of the registered owner outside the United States, or by credit to an international account. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), the term
international account
means the book-entry account of a financial institution (within the meaning of section 871(h)(4)(B)) or of an international financial organization with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York maintains records that specifically identify an international financial organization or a financial institution (within the meaning of section 871(h)(4)(B)) as either a non-United States person or a foreign branch of a United States person as registered owner. An international financial organization is a central bank or monetary authority of a foreign government or a public international organization of which the United States is a member to the extent that such central bank, authority, or organization holds obligations solely for its own account and is exempt from tax under section 892 or 895.
(5)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of this paragraph (e) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
FC is a foreign corporation that is not a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. A holds FC coupon bonds that are not in registered form under section 163(f) and the regulations thereunder. FB, a foreign branch of DC, is the designated paying agent with respect to the bonds issued by FC. A does not have an account with FB. A presents a coupon from a FC bond for payment to FB at its office outside the United States. FB pays A with a check drawn against a bank account maintained in the United States. For purposes of section 6049, the place of payment of interest on the FC bond by FB to A is considered to be outside the United States under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

# Example 2.
Individual C deposits funds in an account with FB, a foreign country X branch of DB, a U.S. corporation engaged in the commercial banking business. FB maintains an office and employees in foreign country X, accepts deposits, and conducts one or more of the other activities listed in § 1.864-4(c)(5)(i). The terms of C's deposit provide that it will be payable with accrued interest. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, FB is considered to pay the interest on C's deposit outside the United States.

# Example 3.
DC, a U.S. corporation engaged in the commercial banking business, maintains FB, a branch in foreign country X. FB has an office and employees in foreign country X, accepts deposits, and engages in one or more of the other activities listed in § 1.864-4(c)(5)(i). D, a United States citizen, purchases a certificate of deposit issued in 1980 by FB. The certificate of deposit has a maturity of 20 years and has detachable interest coupons payable at six-month intervals. D presents some of the coupons at the
U.S. office of DC and receives payment in cash. Because the coupon is presented to DC for payment within the United States, DC is considered to have made the payment within the United States under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

# Example 4.
FB is recognized by both foreign country X and by the Federal Reserve Bank as a foreign country X branch of DC, a U.S. corporation engaged in the commercial banking business. A local foreign country X bank serves as FB's resident agent in Country X. FB maintains no physical office or employees in foreign country X. All the records, accounts, and transactions of FB are handled at the United States office of DC. E deposits funds in an amount maintained with FB. Interest earned on the deposit is periodically credited to E's account with FB by employees of DC. For purposes of section 6049, the place of payment of the interest on E's deposit with FB is considered to be within the United States by reason of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.

# Example 5.
DC is a U.S. corporation. A holds bonds that were issued by DC in registered form under section 163(f), as in effect prior to the amendment by section 502 of the HIRE Act of 2010, and the regulations thereunder and that are foreign-targeted registered obligations as defined in § 1.871-14(e)(2). DB, a commercial banking business, is the registrar of bonds issued by DC. Interest on the DC bonds is paid to A and other bondholders by check prepared by DB at its principal office inside the United States and mailed from there to A's address outside the United States. The check is drawn on a United States account maintained by DC with DB within the United States. The place of payment to A by DB of the interest on the DC bonds is considered to be outside the United States under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(f)
Original issue discount treated as payment of interest.
In determining whether an obligation is one which was issued at a discount and the amount of discount which is includible in income of the holder, a payor (other than the issuer of the obligation) may rely on the Internal Revenue Service's publication of publicly traded original issue discount obligations. In the case of an obligation as to which there is during any calendar year an amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of any holder (as determined under sections 1232 and 1232A and the regulations thereunder), the issuer of the obligation or a middleman (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(4)) shall be treated as having paid to such holder during such calendar year an amount of interest equal to the amount of original issue discount so includible without regard to any reduction by reason of a purchase allowance under sections 1232(a)(2)(C)(ii), 1232A (a)(6) or (b)(4) or a purchase at a premium under 1232A(c)(4)(A) or paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.1232-3. Thus, the determination of the amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of any holder with respect to any obligation shall be determined as if any holder of the obligation were the original holder. However, see § 1.6049-9 for the reporting of premium for a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2014. In the case of (1) an obligation to which section 1232A does not apply (for example, a short-term government obligation as defined in section 1232(a)(3)) and (2) an obligation issued on or before December 31, 1982, in bearer form, the amount of original issue discount includible in gross income shall be treated as if paid in the calendar year in which the date of maturity occurs or in which the date of redemption occurs if redemption occurs before maturity. The amount subject to reporting on an obligation issued in bearer form with a maturity at the date of issue of more than 1 year (a long term obligation) is the amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder during the calendar year of maturity or redemption if redemption occurs before maturity. The amount of original issue discount subject to reporting on a long term obligation shall not be reduced to reflect any purchase allowance. Discount on short term government obligations as defined in section 1232(a)(3), such as Treasury bills, and discount on other obligations with a maturity at the date of issue of not more than 1 year (a short term obligation), including commercial paper, when paid at maturity or redemption if redemption occurs before maturity, shall constitute a payment of interest for purposes of section 6049. In general, the amount subject to reporting on short term obligations is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the original issue price. The procedure set forth in section 3455(b)(2)(B) and § 31.3455(b)-1(b)(3) for establishing the price at which a holder purchased an obligation subsequent to
the date of original issue shall apply for purposes of section 6049. Original issue discount on an obligation (including an obligation with a maturity of not more than six months from the date of original issue) held by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation is interest described in paragraph (b)(1)(vi)(A) or (B) of this section and, therefore is not interest subject to reporting under section 6049 unless it is described in § 1.6049-8(a) (relating to deposit interest paid on or after January 1, 2013, to certain nonresident alien individuals).
(g)
Applicability dates.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g), this section applies to payments made on or after January 6, 2017. For payments made after June 30, 2014, and before January 6, 2017, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2016. For payments made after December 31, 2000, and before July 1, 2014, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2013. Paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of this section applies to payments made on or after October 1, 2019. For payments made before October 1, 2019, a taxpayer may apply paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of this section for payments during the last taxable year of a foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, and each subsequent taxable year of the foreign corporation, provided that the taxpayer and United States persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) to the taxpayer consistently apply such paragraph with respect to all foreign corporations. For payments made before October 1, 2019, where the taxpayer does not apply the provisions of paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of this section, see paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2020.

§ 1.6049(d)-5T
Reporting by brokers of interest and original issue discount on and after January 1, 1986 (temporary).
For purposes of § 1.6049-5 (c), relating to original issue discount treated as interest subject to reporting, on and after January 1, 1986, a payor who is a broker or middleman holding as a nominee—
(a) A bank certificate of deposit (without regard to whether the broker or middleman sold the certificate of deposit to the owner), or
(b) Any other original issue discount debt instrument that is specified by the Commissioner,
must determine whether that obligation is one that was issued at a discount and the amount of discount that is includible in the income of the owner. However, before January 1, 1987, reporting is required only with respect to certificates of deposit (or any such other obligations) held by a broker or middleman as a nominee on or after June 1, 1986, that were sold by the broker or middleman (whether for the broker's account or as an agent of the issuer) to the owner. The preceding two sentences do not apply to certificates of deposit (or any such other obligations) held on or after January 1, 1986, but disposed of before June 1, 1986; reporting requirements with respect to such certificates of deposit (or any other such obligations) shall be determined under the provisions of § 1.6049-5 (c) as in effect immediately prior to publication of this § 1.6049-5T.

§ 1.6049-6
Statements to recipients of interest payments and holders of obligations for attributed original issue discount.
(a)
Requirement of furnishing statement to recipient.
Every person filing a Form 1099 under section 6049(a) and § 1.6049-4(e) shall furnish to the person whose identifying number is required to be shown on the form a written statement showing the information required by paragraph (b) of this section. With respect to interest other than interest reported on a transactional basis under § 1.6049-4(e), no statement is required to be furnished under section 6049(c) and
this section if the aggregate of the payments for the calendar year is less than $10, unless such payment is subject to the tax imposed under section 3406. In the case of any payment that is subject to withholding under section 3406, a statement shall be furnished irrespective of the amount of the payment. With respect to payments which are reported on a transactional basis, no statement is required to be furnished under section 6049(c) and this section to a person if the payment of interest to (or received on behalf of) such person for the transaction is less than $10 unless the payment is subject to withholding under section 3406. Again, in the case of any payment that is subject to withholding under section 3406, a statement shall be furnished irrespective of the amount of the payment.
(b)
Form of statement.
The written statement required to be furnished to a person under paragraph (a) of this section shall show the following information:
(1) With respect to payments of interest (other than original issue discount) to any person during a calendar year, the statement shall show:
(i) The aggregate amount of payments shown on Form 1099 as having been made to (or received on behalf of) such person;
(ii) The amount of tax withheld under section 3406, if any;
(iii) The name and address of the person filing the form; and
(iv) A legend stating that such amount is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service.
(2) With respect to original issue discount includible in the gross income of a holder of an obligation during a calendar year, the statement shall show:
(i) The aggregate amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income by (or on behalf of) such person for the calendar year with respect to the obligation (determined by applying the rules of paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.6049-4);
(ii) The amount of tax withheld under section 3406, if any;
(iii) The account, serial, or other identifying number of each obligation with respect to which a return is being made;
(iv) All other items shown on Form 1099 for such calendar year; and

2
) If the REMIC regular interest or the collateralized debt obligation has de minimis original issue discount (as defined in section 1273(a)(3) and any regulations thereunder), then, at the option of the REMIC or the issuer of the collateralized debt obligation, the fraction may be computed in the manner specified in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(K) of this section taking into account the de minimis original issue discount.

(C) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person required to file this form;
(D) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person who must include the amount of interest specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section in gross income;

(G) All other items shown on Form 1099 for the calendar year;

(J) The CUSIP number, account number, serial number, or other identifying number or information, of each class of REMIC regular interest or collateralized debt obligation, with respect to which a return is being made; and
(K) Information necessary to compute accrual of market discount. For calendar years after 1989, this information includes:
(

Information with respect to REMIC assets
—(i)
95 percent asset test.
For calendar years after 1988, the written statement provided by a REMIC must also contain the following information for each calendar quarter—
(A) The percentage of REMIC assets that are qualifying real property loans under section 593,
(B) The percentage of REMIC assets that are assets described in section 7701 (a)(19), and
(C) The percentage of REMIC assets that are real estate assets defined in section 856 (c)(6)(B), computed by reference to the average adjusted basis (as defined in section 1011) of the REMIC assets during the calendar quarter (as described in § 1.860F-4 (e)(1)(iii)). If for any calendar quarter the percentage of REMIC assets represented by a category is at least 95 percent, then the statement need only specify that the percentage for that category, for that calendar quarter, was at least 95 percent.
(ii)
Additional information required if the 95 percent test not met.
If, for any calendar quarter after 1988, less than 95 percent of the assets of the REMIC are real estate assets defined in section 856 (c)(6)(B), then, for that calendar quarter, the REMIC's written statement must also provide to any real estate investment trust (REIT) that holds a regular interest the following information—
(A) The percentage of REMIC assets described in section 856 (c)(5)(A), computed by reference to the average adjusted basis of the REMIC assets during the calendar quarter (as described in § 1.860F-4 (e)(1)(iii)),
(B) The percentage of REMIC gross income (other than gross income from prohibited transactions defined in section 860F (a)(2)) described in section 856 (c)(3)(A) through (E), computed as of the close of the calendar quarter, and
(C) The percentage of REMIC gross income (other than gross income from prohibited transactions defined in section 860F (a)(2)) described in section 856 (c)(3)(F), computed as of the close of the calendar quarter. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C), the term “foreclosure property” contained in section 856 (c)(3)(F) shall have the meaning specified in section 860G (a)(8).
In determining whether a REIT satisfies the limitations of section 856 (c)(2), all REMIC gross income is deemed to be derived from a source specified in section 856 (c)(2).
(iii)
Calendar years 1988 and 1989.
For calendar years 1988 and 1989, the percentage of assets required in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section may be computed by reference to the average fair market value of the assets of the REMIC during the calendar quarter (as described in § 1.860F-4 (e)(1)(iii)), instead of by reference to the average adjusted basis of the assets of the REMIC during the calendar quarter.
(4)
Cross-reference.
See § 1.67-3T (f)(2)(ii) for additional information that may be separately stated on the statement required by this paragraph (f) with respect to certain holders of regular interests in REMICs described in § 1.67-3T (a)(2)(ii).
(5)

(B)
Nominee reporting.
For calendar quarters and calendar years prior to 1989, each statement required under this paragraph (f) to be furnished by a

(
2
) January 31 of the year following the calendar year to which the statement relates.
(6)
Special rules
—(i)
Copy of Form 1099 permissible.
The requirements of this paragraph (f) for the furnishing of a statement to any person, including the legend requirement of paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(D) and (f)(2)(ii)(H) of this section, may be met by furnishing to that person—

(B) A substitute form that contains all the information required under this paragraph (f) and that complies with any current revenue procedure concerning the reproduction of paper substitutes of Forms 1099 and the furnishing of substitute statements to forms recipients. The inclusion on the substitute form of the information specified in this paragraph (f) that is not required by the official Forms 1099 will not cause the substitute form to fail to meet any requirements that limit the information that may be provided with a substitute form.
(ii)
Statement furnished by mail.
A statement mailed to the last known address of any person shall be considered to be furnished to that person within the meaning of this section.
(7)

§ 1.6049-8
Interest and original issue discount paid to certain nonresident aliens.
(a)
Interest subject to reporting requirement.
For purposes of §§ 1.6049-4, 1.6049-6, and this section, and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the term
interest
means interest described in section 871(i)(2)(A) that relates to a deposit maintained at an office within the United States, and that is paid to a nonresident alien individual who is a resident of a country that is identified, in an applicable revenue procedure (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) as of December 31 prior to the calendar year in which the interest is paid, as a country with which the United States has in effect an income tax or other convention or bilateral agreement relating to the exchange of tax information within the meaning of
section 6103(k)(4), under which the competent authority is the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate and the United States agrees to provide, as well as receive, information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of §§ 1.6049-4, 1.6049-6, and this section, for any year for which the information return under § 1.6049-4(b)(5) is required, a payor may elect to treat interest as including all interest described in section 871(i)(2)(A) that relates to a deposit maintained at an office within the United States and that is paid to any nonresident alien individual. A payor shall make this election by reporting all such interest. For purposes of the regulations under section 6049 (§§ 1.6049-1 through 1.6049-8), a nonresident alien individual is a person described in section 7701(b)(1)(B). A payor or middleman may rely upon the permanent residence address provided on a valid Form W-8BEN, “Beneficial Owners Certificate of Foreign Status for U.S. Tax Withholding”, to determine the country in which a nonresident alien individual is resident unless such payor or middleman knows or has reason to know that such documentation of the country of residence is unreliable or incorrect. Amounts described in this paragraph (a) are not subject to backup withholding under section 3406 if the payor may treat the payee as a foreign beneficial owner or foreign payee under the rules of § 1.6049-5(b)(12). See § 31.3406(g)-1(d) of this chapter. However, if the payor or middleman does not have either a valid Form W-8BEN or valid Form W-9, “Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification”, the payor or middleman must report the payment as made to a U.S. non-exempt recipient if it must so treat the payee under the presumption rules of § 1.6049-5(d)(2) and § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii), and the payor must also backup withhold under section 3406. (For interest paid to a Canadian nonresident alien individual on or before December 31, 2012, see paragraph (a) of this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2000).
(b)
Interest excluded from reporting requirement.
The term
interest
does not include an amount that is paid by the issuer or its agent outside the United States with respect to an obligation that is described in paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section.
(1)(i) The obligation is not in registered form (within the meaning of section 163(f) and the regulations thereunder); is part of a larger single public offering of securities; and is described in section 163(f)(2)(B).
(ii) Unless it has actual knowledge to the contrary, a middleman may treat an obligation as if it is described in section 163(f)(2)(B) if the obligation or coupon therefrom, whichever is presented for payment, contains the statement described in section 163(f)(2)(B)(ii)(II) and the regulations thereunder.
(2)(i) The obligation has a face or principal amount of not less than $500,000, and satisfies the requirements described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A), (B), and (C) of this section.
(A) The obligation satisfies the requirements of sections 163(f)(2)(B) (i) and (ii)(I) and the regulations thereunder (as if it were a registration-required obligation within the meaning of section 163(f)(2)(A)) and is issued in accordance with the procedures of § 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)).
(B) If the obligation is in registered form, it is registered in the name of an exempt recipient described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii).
(C) The obligation has on its face and on any detachable coupons the following statement (or a similar statement having the same effect): “By accepting this obligation or coupon, the holder represents and warrants that it is not a United States person (other than an exempt recipient described in the regulations under section 6049(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder) and that it is not acting for or on behalf of a United States person (other than an exempt recipient described in the regulations under section 6049(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder).”
(ii) Unless the middleman has actual knowledge to the contrary, it may treat an obligation as satisfying the requirements of sections 163(f)(2)(B) (i) and (ii)(I) and the regulations thereunder if the obligation or a coupon therefrom, whichever is presented for
payment, contains the statement in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section.

§ 1.6049-9
Premium subject to reporting for a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2014.
(a)
General rule.
Notwithstanding § 1.6049-5(f), for a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2014, if a broker (as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(1)) is required to file a statement for the debt instrument under § 1.6049-6, the broker generally must report any bond premium (as defined in § 1.171-1(d)) or acquisition premium (as defined in § 1.1272-2(b)(3)) for the calendar year. This section, however, only applies to a debt instrument that is a covered security as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(15).
(b)
Reporting of bond premium amortization.
Unless a broker has been notified in writing in accordance with § 1.6045-1(n)(5) that a customer does not want to amortize bond premium under section 171, the broker must report the amount of any amortizable bond premium allocable to a stated interest payment made to the customer during the calendar year. See §§ 1.171-2 and 1.171-3 to determine the amount of amortizable bond premium allocable to a stated interest payment. Instead of reporting a gross amount for both stated interest and amortizable bond premium, a broker may report a net amount of stated interest that reflects the offset of the stated interest payment by the amount of amortizable bond premium allocable to the payment. In this case, the broker must not report the amortizable bond premium as a separate item. This paragraph (b) also applies to amortizable bond premium on a tax-exempt obligation, which is required to be amortized under section 171.
(c)
Reporting of acquisition premium amortization.
A broker must report the amount of any acquisition premium amortization that reduces the amount of original issue discount includible in income by the customer during a calendar year. For a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2015, a broker must use the rules in § 1.1272-2(b)(4) to determine the amount of acquisition premium amortization. However, for a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, if a customer timely notifies the broker in accordance with § 1.6045-1(n)(5), a broker may use the rules in § 1.1272-3 to determine the amount of acquisition premium amortization. Instead of reporting a gross amount for both original issue discount and acquisition premium amortization, a broker may report a net amount of original issue discount that reflects the offset of the original issue discount includible in income by the customer for the calendar year by the amount of acquisition premium allocable to the original issue discount. In this case, the broker must not report the acquisition premium amortization as a separate item. See § 1.6049-10 for the reporting of acquisition premium on a tax-exempt obligation.
[T.D. 9713, 80 FR 13239, Mar. 13, 2015; T.D. 9750, 81 FR 24702, Apr. 27, 2016]
§ 1.6049-10
Reporting of original issue discount on a tax-exempt obligation.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of section 6049, a payor (as defined in § 1.6049-4(a)(2)) of original issue discount (OID) on a tax-exempt obligation (as defined in section 1288(b)(2)) is required to report the daily portions of OID on the obligation as if the daily portions of OID that accrued during a calendar year were paid to the holder (or holders) of the obligation in the calendar year. The amount of the daily portions of OID that accrues during a calendar year is determined as if section 1272 and § 1.1272-1 applied to a tax-exempt obligation. Notwithstanding any other rule in section 6049 and the regulations thereunder, a payor must determine whether a tax-exempt obligation was issued with OID and the amount of OID that accrues for each relevant period. As prescribed by section 1288(b)(1), OID on a tax-exempt obligation is determined without regard to the de minimis rules in section 1273(a)(3) and § 1.1273-1(d).
(b)
Acquisition premium.
A payor is required to report acquisition premium amortization on a tax-exempt obligation in accordance with the rules in § 1.6049-9(c) as if section 1272 applied to
a tax-exempt obligation. See paragraph (a) of this section to determine the amount of OID allocable to an accrual period.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to a tax-exempt obligation that is a covered security (within the meaning of § 1.6045-1(a)(15) and (n)(12)) acquired on or after January 1, 2017. For a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, a broker, however, may rely on this section to report OID and acquisition premium for a tax-exempt obligation that is a covered security acquired before January 1, 2017.

The boat operator may make separate returns on Form 1099-MISC for each crew member for each voyage, or he may aggregate the information required by this paragraph for an individual for all or any part of a return period in which the type of catch (if required) and the percentage due the crew member remain the same.
(b)
Time and place for filing.
Returns required to be made under this section on Form 1099-MISC shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center, designated in the instructions for Form 1099-MISC, on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the year following the calendar year in which the relevant services were performed.

§ 1.6050E-1
Reporting of State and local income tax refunds.
(a)
Applicability.
Section 6050E and this section apply to any refund officer who, with respect to an individual, makes payments of refunds of State or local income taxes or allows credits or offsets with respect to such taxes aggregating $10 or more for such individual in any calendar year.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
(1) The term
refund officer
means the officer or employee of a State or local taxing jurisdiction having control of payments of refunds or the allowance of credits or offsets, or the person
approporiately designated for purposes of this section.
(2) The term
State
shall include the District of Columbia but shall not include the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any possession of the United States.
(3) The term
individual
shall not include an estate or trust.
(4) The term
credit or offset
means an overpayment of tax which, in lieu of being refunded to the taxpayer, is:
(i) Applied against an existing liability of the taxpayer,
(ii) Available for application against a future liability of the taxpayer, or
(iii) Otherwise used or available for use for the taxpayer's benefit.
(c)
Requirement of reporting.
Every refund officer described in paragraph (a) of this section shall make an information return in accordance with this section for each calendar year. An information return must be made even if the refund officer is not required to furnish a statement to the applicable taxpayer under paragraph (k)(2) of this section.
(d)
Prescribed Form.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the information return required by paragraph (c) of this section shall be made on Forms 1096 and 1099.
(e)
Refunds involving different taxable years.
In the case of refunds paid or credits or offsets allowed during a calendar year with respect to two or more taxable years of an individual, a separate Form 1099 shall be filed with respect to each taxable year of the individual. Thus, if during calendar year 1983 a refund officer pays to an individual a refund of $15 with respect to that individual's taxable year ending in 1982 and $20 with respect to that individual's taxable year ending in 1981, a separate Form 1099 shall be filed for each of the two payments. If, instead, the refund with respect to the individual's taxable year ending in 1982 were $5 instead of $15, no return would be required for the payment of $5.
(f)
Information required.
The information required to be reported on Forms 1096 and 1099 includes the aggregate amount of refunds, credits, and offsets made or allowed during the calendar year with respect to the taxable year of the individual covered by the return; the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the individual with respect to whom such payment, credit, or offset was made or allowed; the taxable year covered by the return; and such other information as may be required by the forms. In addition, the nature of the tax is required to be indicated on the Form 1099 in any case where the refund, credit or offset is made or allowed with respect to a payment attributable to an income tax that applies exclusively to income from a trade or business and is not a tax of general application.
(g)
When credit or offset deemed allowed.
For purposes of a return of information under this section, a credit or offset is deemed to be allowed when the liability to pay or credit such amount is admitted by the State or local taxing jurisdiction. Thus, if an amount with respect to a taxpayer's 1982 taxable year is credited in 1983 to reduce the liability of the taxpayer to make estimated tax payments in 1983, it is reportable as a credit allowed in 1983. It is not reportable in the taxable year that gives rise to the refund, credit or offset.
(h)
Time and place for filing.
The returns required under this section for any calendar year shall be filed after September 30 of that calendar year, but not before the refund officer's final payment (or allowance of credit or offset) for the year, and on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the following year. Returns shall be filed with the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for Forms 1099. For extensions of time for filing returns under this section, see § 1.6081-1.
(i)
Use of magnetic media and substitute forms
—(1)
Magnetic media.
A refund officer may be required to file the Forms 1099 required by this section on magnetic media or machine-readable paper forms. See section 6011(e) and applicable regulations and revenue procedures thereunder. If a refund officer is not required to file the Forms 1099 required by this section on magnetic media, the refund officer may request permission
under applicable regulations and revenue procedures to submit the information required by this section on magnetic media.
(2)
Substitute forms.
A refund officer may prepare and use a form which contains provisions identical with those of Form 1096 if the refund officer complies with all revenue procedures relating to substitute Form 1096 in effect at that time. In addition, if a refund officer is not required to file the Forms 1099 required by this section on magnetic media or machine-readable paper forms, the refund officer may prepare and use a form which contains provisions identical with those of Form 1099 if the refund officer complies with all revenue procedures relating to substitute Form 1099 in effect at that time.
(j)
Voluntary information exchange agreements.
The requirements of reporting information to the Internal Revenue Service under this section may be satisfied for any calendar year by submission of the information required under paragraph (f) of this section in accordance with the terms of a voluntary information exchange agreement between the State and the United States in effect during such year.
(k)
Requirement of furnishing statements to recipients
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, every refund officer required to make a return of information under this section shall furnish to the individual whose identifying number is required to be shown on the return a written statement showing the aggregate amount shown on the information return of refunds, credits and offsets made or allowed to such individual with respect to each taxable year of the individual, the name of the State or local taxing jurisdiction paying such refund or allowing such credits or offsets, the taxable year giving rise to the refund, credit or offset and a legend stating that such amount is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service. The requirement of this paragraph may be met by furnishing to the individual a copy of the Form 1099 filed with respect to that individual provided that the form bears a legend stating that such amount is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service. For purposes of this paragraph, a statement shall be considered to be furnished to an individual if it is mailed to the individual at the individual's last known address. An IRS truncated taxpayer identifying number (TTIN) may be used as the identifying number of the individual in lieu of the identifying number appearing on the information return filed with the Internal Revenue Service. For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see § 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).
(2)
Exception for nonitemizers.
A refund officer need not furnish a statement to an individual under paragraph (k)(1) of this section if the refund officer verifies that the individual did not claim itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes for the taxable year giving rise to the refund, credit, or offset. This exception shall not apply, however, if the refund, credit, or offset is made or allowed with respect to a payment attributable to an income tax that applies exclusively to income from a trade or business and is not a tax of general application. For purposes of this paragraph (k)(2), verification shall be made solely from—
(i) The State or local income tax return, or
(ii) Information obtained through a voluntary information exchange agreement with the United States for the applicable taxable year.
(3)
Verification from the State or local income tax return.
A refund officer shall verify from the State or local income tax return that an individual did not claim itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes for the applicable taxable year only if—
(i)(A) An individual who itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes either must attach a copy of Schedule A of the individual's Federal income tax return to the State or local income tax return or must transcribe information from Schedule A of the individual's Federal income tax return on the State or local income tax return;
(B) The information contained on or transcribed from the Schedule A is required for the purpose of computing liability for the State or local income tax; and
(C) The omission of a copy of the Schedule A, or of the information required to be transcribed from the Schedule A, is consistent with the taxpayer's computation of tax on the State or local income tax return; or
(ii) Individuals are required to transcribe information from their Federal income tax return (other than from Schedule A) on the State or local income tax return for the purpose of computing liability for the State or local income tax and the information can be used to determine conclusively whether the taxpayer itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes.
(4)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
State X asks for transcription of the following information on its 1983 income tax return from the taxpayer's 1983 Federal income tax return: Adjusted gross income; taxable income; and number of exemptions claimed. The amount of adjusted gross income and the number of exemptions claimed on the Federal income tax return are taken into account in computing the liability for income tax under the laws of State X. The amount of taxable income transcribed from the Federal return, however, does not enter into the computation of liability for income tax under the laws of State X. Thus, this amount may not be taken into account by the refund officer of State X for purposes of verifying whether a taxpayer itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes. Since the refund officer of State X will not be able to determine conclusively from the amount of adjusted gross income and the number of exemptions transcribed from the Federal return whether a taxpayer itemized deductions for Federal income tax purposes, the transcribed information does not meet the requirements of paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section.
(l)
Time for furnishing statements
—(1)
General rule.
The statement required under paragraph (k) of this section shall be furnished after December 31 of the year in which the refund is paid or credit or offset is allowed, and on or before January 31 of the following year.
(2)
Extensions of time.
For good cause shown upon written application of the refund officer, the service center director may grant an extension of time not exceeding 30 days in which to furnish statements under this paragraph. The application shall be addressed to the Service Center with which the Forms 1099 required under this section are required to be filed and shall contain a concise statement of the reasons for requesting the extension to aid the service center director in determining the period of the extension, if any, which will be granted. The application shall state at the top of the first page that it is made under this section and shall be signed by the refund officer. In general, the application shall be filed after September 30 of the year in which the refund is paid or credit or offset is allowed, and before January 15 of the following year.
(m)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to payments of refunds and credits and offsets allowed after December 31, 1982. The amendments to paragraph (k)(1) apply to payee statements due after December 31, 2014. For payee statements due before January 1, 2015, § 1.6050E-5(k)(1) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) shall apply.

§ 1.6050H-1
Information reporting of mortgage interest received in a trade or business from an individual.
(a)
Information reporting requirement
—(1)
Overview.
The information reporting requirements of section 6050H, this section, and § 1.6050H-2 apply to an interest recipient who receives at least $600 of interest on a qualified mortgage for a calendar year or who makes a reimbursement of interest described in § 1.6050H-2(a)(2)(iv). Paragraph (b) of this section defines qualified mortgage. Paragraph (c) of this section defines interest recipient. Paragraph (d) of this section contains additional rules relating to the reporting requirement for foreign persons, cooperative housing corporations, and nonresident alien individuals. Paragraph (e) of this section contains rules for determining the amount of interest received on a mortgage for a calendar year. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for determining when prepaid interest in the form of points is taken into account as interest for purposes of section 6050H, this section, and § 1.6050H-2.
(2)
Reporting requirement.
Except as otherwise provided in this section and § 1.6050H-2, an interest recipient that either receives at least $600 of interest
on a qualified mortgage for a calendar year or makes reimbursements of interest described in § 1.6050H-2(a)(2)(iv) must, with respect to that interest—
(i) File an information return with the Internal Revenue Service; and
(ii) Furnish a statement to the payor of record on the mortgage.
(3)
Optional reporting.
An interest recipient may, but is not required to, report its receipt of less than $600 of interest on a qualified mortgage for a calendar year. Similarly, an interest recipient also may report reimbursements of interest on a qualified mortgage even if the reimbursements are not required to be reported by § 1.6050H-2(a)(2)(iv). An interest recipient that chooses, but is not required, to file a return as provided in this section and § 1.6050H-2(a) or to furnish a statement as provided in this section and § 1.6050H-2(b) is subject to the requirements of this section and § 1.6050H-2.
(b)
Qualified mortgage
—(1)
In general.
A mortgage is a qualified mortgage if the payor of record on the mortgage is an individual, including an individual acting in a capacity as a sole proprietor of a business. A mortgage is not a qualified mortgage if the payor of record on the mortgage is not an individual (such as a trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation), even though an individual is a co-borrower on the mortgage and all the trustees, beneficiaries, partners, members, or shareholders of the payor of record are individuals.
(2)
Mortgage
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section, an obligation is a mortgage if real property (regardless of where located) secures all or part of the obligation. An interest recipient must determine whether real property secures an obligation at the time the obligation is created or, if security is added or removed at a later time, at that later time. Real property includes a manufactured home as defined in section 25(e)(10). An obligation includes a line of credit or a credit card obligation. For purposes of this section and § 1.6050H-2, a borrower incurs a line of credit or credit card obligation when the borrower first has the right to borrow against the line of credit or credit card, whether the borrower actually borrows an amount at that time. An obligation will not fail to be treated as a mortgage solely because, under an applicable State or local homestead law or other debtor protection law in effect on August 16, 1986, the security interest is ineffective or the enforceability of the security interest is restricted.
(ii)
Transitional rule for certain obligations existing on December 31, 1984
—(A)
In general.
An obligation that existed on December 31, 1984, is not a mortgage if, at the time the payor of record incurred the obligation, the interest recipient reasonably classified the obligation as other than a mortgage, real property loan, real estate loan, or other similar type of obligation. A reasonable classification of an obligation must be consistent with industry practices and determined according to the purpose of the obligation, the property securing the obligation, and any other reasonable factor. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A), an obligation was not reasonably classified as other than a mortgage, real property loan, real estate loan, or other similar type of obligation if, at the time the payor of record incurred the obligation, more than one-half of the obligations in the particular class in which the obligation was classified were secured primarily by real property.
(B)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section:

# Example 1.
B offers an unsecured line of credit and a line of credit secured by real property. B separately markets the two credit lines, and they are governed by different terms and conditions. For accounting purposes, B classifies the two types of loans as a single class. For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the two types of loans are different classes of obligations.

# Example 2.
B operates a program to make loans to small businesses. Depending on the amount of the loan and the credit history of the borrower, B may or may not require security for the loan. If B requires security, it may consist of real or personal property. For accounting purposes, B classifies all of the loans within this program as a single class. For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, all of the loans within this program may be classified as belonging to a single class.
(iii)
Transitional rule for certain obligations existing on December 31, 1987.
An obligation that was incurred after December 31, 1984, and that existed on December 31, 1987, is not a mortgage if the obligation is not primarily secured by real property.
(3)
Payor of record.
A payor of record on a mortgage is the person carried on the books and records of the interest recipient as the principal borrower on the mortgage. If the books and records of the interest recipient do not indicate which borrower is the principal borrower, the interest recipient must designate a borrower as the principal borrower.
(4)
Lender of record.
The lender of record is the person who, at the time the loan is made, is named as the lender on the loan documents and whose right to receive payment from the payor of record is secured by the payor of record's principal residence. An intention by the lender of record to sell or otherwise transfer the loan to a third party subsequent to the close of the transaction will not affect the determination of who is the lender of record.
(c)
Interest recipient
—(1)
Trade or business requirement.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, an interest recipient is a person that is engaged in a trade or business (whether or not the trade or business of lending money) and that, in the course of the trade or business, either receives interest on a mortgage or makes a reimbursement of interest on a qualified mortgage described in § 1.6050H-2(a)(3). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), if a person holds a mortgage which was originated or acquired in the course of a trade or business, the interest on the mortgage is considered to be received in the course of that trade or business. For example, if real estate developer A lends money to individual B to enable B to purchase a house in a subdivision owned and developed by A, and B gives a mortgage to A for the loan, A is an interest recipient for interest received on the mortgage. Alternatively, if C, a person engaged in the trade or business of being a physician, lends money to individual D to enable D to purchase C's home, and D gives a mortgage to C for the loan, C is not an interest recipient for interest received on the mortgage, because C will not receive the interest in the course of the trade or business of being a physician.
(2)
Interest received or collected on behalf of another person
—(i)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) or (3) of this section, a person that, in the course of its trade or business, receives or collects interest on a mortgage on behalf of another person (e.g., the lender of record) is the interest recipient (the initial recipient) for the mortgage. In this case, the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to the transfer of interest from the initial recipient to the person for which the initial recipient receives or collects the interest. For example, if financial institution A collects interest on behalf of financial institution B, A is the initial recipient for the mortgage and is subject to the reporting requirements of section 6050H, and B is not required to report the interest received on the mortgage from A.
(ii)
Exception
—(A)
Scope of exception.
Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section does not apply for any period for which—
(
1
) An initial recipient does not possess the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section; and
(
2
) The person for which the interest is received or collected would receive the interest in the course of its trade or business if the interest were paid directly to that person. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
), if interest is received or collected on behalf of a person other than an individual, that person is presumed to receive interest in a trade or business.
(B)
Application of exception.
If the exception provided by this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) applies, the person for which the interest is received or collected is the interest recipient with respect to interest received or collected on the mortgage during the period described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii).
(3)
Interest received in the form of points.
For purposes of this section and § 1.6050H-2, in the case of prepaid interest received in the form of points (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section):
(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, only the lender of record or a qualified person (as defined in § 1.6050H-2(d)(2)) is treated as receiving the points. The lender of record or qualified person is treated as receiving all points paid directly by the payor of record in connection with the purchase of the principal residence.
(ii)
If designation agreement is in effect.
If a designation agreement is executed pursuant to § 1.6050H-2(d) with respect to points, only the designated party under the agreement is treated as receiving points with respect to any mortgage to which the agreement applies. The designated party is treated as receiving all points with respect to any mortgage to which the agreement applies.
(4)
Governmental unit.
A governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit that receives interest on a mortgage is an interest recipient without regard to the requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the interest be received in the course of a trade or business. A governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit that is an interest recipient must designate an officer or employee to satisfy the reporting requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (c) of this section:

# Example 1.
Financial institution F collects mortgage interest on behalf of financial institution G and deposits the amount collected into G's account held with F. F possesses the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section. F is the interest recipient for the mortgage. G is not required to report.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that F does not possess the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement. G, the person for which F collects the interest, is the interest recipient for the mortgage. F is not required to report.

# Example 3.
S, an individual, sells real property to another individual, P, and takes back a mortgage from P to finance the sale. S does not receive the interest in the course of a trade or business. B, a bank, collects P's payments of principal and interest on behalf of S and deposits that amount into an account held at the bank in S's name. B does not possess the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section. B is the interest recipient for P's mortgage without regard to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, because S would not receive the interest in the course of a trade or business. S is not required to report.

# Example 4.
X collects mortgage interest on behalf of Y, who would receive the interest in the course of a trade or business. X possesses the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section. On July 1, 1988, Z assumes X's interest collection responsibilities. Z does not possess the information needed to comply with the reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section. X is the interest recipient for interest received from January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1988. Because Z does not possess the requisite information and Y would receive the interest in the course of a trade or business, Y is the interest recipient for interest received from July 1, 1988, through December 31, 1988.

# Example 5.
On December 1, Borrower obtains from Lender funds with which to purchase an existing structure to be used as Borrower's principal residence. In connection with the mortgage, Lender charges Borrower $300 as points. Borrower pays this amount to Lender at closing using unborrowed funds. In addition, Lender receives from Borrower with respect to the mortgage $300 as interest (as determined under paragraph (e) of this section) other than points. Because Lender has received at least $600 in interest, including points, with respect to Borrower's mortgage during the calendar year, Lender must report the payments in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and § 1.6050H-2. Under those sections, Lender must separately state on the information return and the statement to Borrower the $300 received as interest (other than points) and the $300 received as points.
(d)
Additional rules
—(1)
Reporting by foreign person.
An interest recipient that is not a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)) must report interest received on a qualified mortgage only if it receives the interest—
(i) At a location in the United States, or
(ii) At a location outside the United States if the interest recipient is—
(A) A controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957(a)), or
(B) A person, 50 percent or more of the gross income of which, from all sources for the three-year period ending with the close of the taxable year
preceding the receipt of interest (or for such part of the period as the person was in existence), was effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
(2)
Reporting with respect to nonresident alien individual
—(i)
In general.
The reporting requirement of paragraph (a) of this section does not apply if—
(A) The payor of record is a nonresident alien individual, and
(B) Real property located in the United States does not secure the mortgage.
(ii)
Nonresident alien individual status.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, an interest recipient must apply the following documentary evidence rules to determine whether a payor of record is a nonresident alien individual:
(A) If interest is paid outside the United States, the interest recipient must satisfy the documentary evidence standard provided in § 1.6049-5(c) with respect to the payor of record; and
(B) If interest is paid within the United States, the interest recipient must secure from the payor of record a Form W-8 or a substantially similar statement signed by the payor under penalty of perjury as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(1).
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), the place of payment is the place where the payor of record completes the acts necessary to effect payment. An amount paid by transfer to an account maintained by an interest recipient in the United States or by mail to a United States address is considered to be paid within the United States.
(3)
Reporting by cooperative housing corporations.
For purposes of this section and § 1.6050H-2, an amount received by a cooperative housing corporation from an individual tenant-stockholder that represents the tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of interest described in section 216(a)(2) is interest received on a qualified mortgage in the course of the cooperative housing corporation's trade or business. A cooperative housing corporation is an interest recipient with respect to each tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of interest and must report $600 or more of interest received from an individual tenant-stockholder. The terms “cooperative housing corporation,” “tenant-stockholder,” and “tenant-stockholder's proportionate share” are defined in section 216 and the regulations thereunder.
(e)
Amount of interest received on mortgage for calendar year
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section and § 1.6050H-2, interest includes mortgage prepayment penalties and late charges other than late charges for a specific mortgage service. Interest also includes prepaid interest in the form of points (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section). Whether an interest recipient receives $600 or more of interest on a mortgage for a calendar year is determined on a mortgage-by-mortgage basis. An interest recipient need not aggregate interest received on all of the mortgages of a payor of record held by the interest recipient to determine whether the $600 threshold is met. Therefore, an interest recipient need not report interest of less than $600 received on a mortgage, even though it receives a total of $600 or more of interest on all of the mortgages of the payor of record for a calendar year.
(2)
Calendar year
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section, the calendar year for which interest is received is the later of the calendar year in which the interest is received or the calendar year in which the interest properly accrues.
(ii)
De minimis rule.
An interest recipient may treat interest received during the current calendar year which properly accrues by January 15 of the subsequent calendar year as interest received for the current calendar year. For example, if an interest recipient receives a monthly interest payment on December 31, 1988, which includes interest accruing for the period December 5, 1988, to January 5, 1989, the interest recipient may treat the entire interest payment as received for 1988. If a portion of an interest payment received in a current calendar year accrues after January 15 of the subsequent calendar year, an interest recipient must report as interest received for the current calendar year only the portion that properly accrues by the end
of the current calendar year. For example, if an interest recipient receives a monthly payment that includes interest accruing for the period December 20, 1988, through January 20, 1989, the interest recipient may not report as interest received for 1988 any interest accruing after December 31, 1988. The interest recipient must report the interest accruing after December 31, 1988, as received for calendar year 1989.
(iii)
Applicability to points.
Paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section do not apply to prepaid interest in the form of points (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section). Points (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) must be reported in the calendar year in which they are received.
(3)
Certain interest not received on mortgage
—(i)
Interest received from seller on payor of record's mortgage.
Interest received from a seller or a person related to a seller within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1) on a payor of record's mortgage is not interest received on a mortgage. For example, interest is not received on a mortgage if a real estate developer deposits an amount in escrow with an interest recipient and advises it to draw on the account to pay interest on a payor of record's mortgage (e.g., a buy-down mortgage). Similarly, interest is not received on a mortgage if an interest recipient receives a lump sum from a real estatge developer for interest on a payor of record's mortgage.
(ii)
Interest received from governmental unit.
Interest received from a governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit is not interest received on a mortgage. For example, interest is not received on a mortgage if received as a housing assistance payment from the Department of Housing and Urban Development on a mortgage insured under section 235 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701-1715z (1982
Supp. 1983)). Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) (1) and (2) of this section, interest received on a mortgage is only the excess of interest received on the mortgage over interest received from a governmental unit or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit.
(4)
Interest calculated under Rule of 78s method of accounting.
An interest recipient permitted by Revenue Procedure 83-40, 1983-1, C.B. 774 (or other revenue procedure) to use the Rule of 78s method of accounting to calculate interest earned on a transaction may report as interest received on a mortgage interest earned on the transaction as calculated under the Rule of 78s method of accounting only if the interest recipient satisfies the notice requirement of § 1.6050H-2(c).
(f)
Points treated as interest
—(1)
General rule.
Subject to the limitations of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, an amount is deemed to be points paid in respect of indebtedness incurred in connection with the purchase of the payor of record's principal residence (points) for purposes of this section and § 1.6050H-2 to the extent that the amount—
(i) Is clearly designated on the Uniform Settlement Statement prescribed under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. 2601
et seq.,
(e.g., the Form HUD-1) as points incurred in connection with the indebtedness, for example
as loan origination fees
(including amounts so designated on Veterans Affairs (VA) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans),
loan discount, discount points,
or
points
;
(ii) Is computed as a percentage of the stated principal amount of the indebtedness incurred by the payor of record;
(iii) Conforms to an established practice of charging points in the area in which the loan is issued and does not exceed the amount generally charged in the area;
(iv) Is paid in connection with the acquisition by the payor of record of a residence that is the principal residence of the payor of record and that secures the loan. For this purpose, the lender of record may rely on a signed written statement of the payor of record that states whether the proceeds of the loan are for the purchase of the mortgagor's principal residence; and
(v) Is paid directly by the payor of record.
(2)
Limitations.
An amount is not points for purposes of this section to the extent that the amount is—
(i) Paid in connection with indebtedness incurred for the improvement of a principal residence;
(ii) Paid in connection with indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a residence that is not the payor of record's principal residence, such as a second home, vacation property, investment property, or trade or business property;
(iii) Paid in connection with a home equity loan or a line of credit, even though the loan is secured by the payor of record's principal residence;
(iv) Paid in connection with a refinancing loan (except as provided by paragraph (f)(4) of this section), including a loan incurred to refinance indebtedness owed by the borrower under the terms of a land contract, a contract for deed, or similar forms of seller financing;
(v) Paid in lieu of amounts that ordinarily are stated separately on the Form HUD-1, such as appraisal fees, inspection fees, title fees, attorney fees, and property taxes; or
(vi) Paid in connection with the acquisition of a principal residence, to the extent that the amount is allocable to indebtedness in excess of the aggregate amount that may be treated as acquisition indebtedness under section 163(h)(3)(B)(ii).
(3)
Special rule
—(i)
Amounts paid directly by payor of record.
For purposes of this section, an amount is considered
paid directly
by the payor of record if it is—
(A) Provided by the payor of record from funds that have not been borrowed from the lender of record for this purpose as part of the overall transaction. The amount provided may include amounts designated as down payments, escrow deposits, earnest money applied at the closing, and other funds actually paid over by the payor of record at or before the time of closing; or
(B) Paid as points (within the meaning of this paragraph (f)) on behalf of the payor of record by the seller. For this purpose, an amount paid as points to an interest recipient by the seller on behalf of the payor of record is treated as paid to the payor of record and then paid directly by the payor of record to the interest recipient.
(ii)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Financed payment of points.
Buyer purchases a principal residence for $100,000. There is a total of $7,000 in closing costs (exclusive of down payment) charged in connection with the sale. Of this amount, $3,000 is charged as points (within the meaning of paragraph (f) of this section). At closing, Buyer makes a down payment of $20,000 and provides unborrowed funds in the amount of $4,000 for the payment of various closing costs other than points. Buyer finances payment of the points by increasing the principal amount of the loan by $3,000. Seller makes no payments on Buyer's behalf. Because Buyer has provided at closing funds that have not been borrowed from the lender of record for this purpose in an amount at least equal to the amount charged as points in the transaction, the lender of record (or a qualified person) must report $3,000 as points in accordance with this section and § 1.6050H-2.

# Example 2. Seller-paid points.
Buyer purchases a principal residence for $100,000. There is a total of $7,000 in closing costs (exclusive of down payment) charged in connection with the sale. Of this amount, $3,000 is charged as points (within the meaning of this paragraph (f)). Seller agrees to pay all closing costs on behalf of Buyer, including the amount charged as points. Accordingly, the amount paid by Seller as points is treated as paid directly by Buyer, and the lender of record (or a qualified person) must report the $3,000 as points in accordance with this section and § 1.6050H-2.
(4)
Construction loans
—(i)
In general.
An amount paid in connection with indebtedness incurred to construct a residence, or to refinance indebtedness incurred to construct a residence, is deemed to be points for purposes of this section to the extent the amount—
(A) Is clearly designated on the loan documents as points incurred in connection with the indebtedness, for example, as
loan origination fees, loan discount, discount points,
or
points;
(B) Is computed as a percentage of the stated principal amount of the indebtedness incurred by the payor of record;
(C) Conforms to an established practice of charging points in the area in which the loan is issued and does not exceed the amount generally charged in the area;
(D) Is paid in connection with indebtedness incurred by the payor of record
to construct (or to refinance construction of) a residence that is to be used, when completed, as the principal residence of the payor of record;
(E) Is paid directly by the payor of record; and
(F) Is not allocable to indebtedness in excess of the aggregate amount that may be treated as acquisition indebtedness under section 163(h)(3)(B)(ii).
(ii)
Limitation on refinancing of construction loans.
Amounts paid in connection with refinancing indebtedness incurred to construct a residence are not treated as points to the extent they are allocable to indebtedness that exceeds the indebtedness incurred to construct the residence.
(5)
Amounts paid to mortgage brokers.
Amounts received directly or indirectly by a mortgage broker are treated as points under this paragraph (f) to the same extent the amounts would be so treated if they were paid to and retained by the lender of record, and must be reported by the lender of record in accordance with this section and § 1.6050H-2.
(6)
Effect on deduction of points.
This section and § 1.6050H-2 address only the information reporting requirements of section 6050H and do not affect a payor of record's deduction for any amount in accordance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
(g)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, this section is effective for mortgage interest received after December 31, 1987.
(2)
Points.
The reporting requirements of this section do not apply to prepaid interest received in the form of points before January 1, 1995. In addition, the inclusion of points in the determination of interest under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies only to transactions occurring after December 31, 1994.
[T.D. 8191, 53 FR 12002, Apr. 12, 1988, as amended by T.D. 8571, 59 FR 63251, Dec. 8, 1994; T.D. 8734, 62 FR 53492, Oct. 14, 1997; T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9237, Mar. 14, 2019]
§ 1.6050H-2
Time, form, and manner of reporting interest received on qualified mortgage.
(a)
Requirement to file return
—(1)
Form of return.
An interest recipient must file a return required by § 1.6050H-1(a) on Form 1098 (with Form 1096 as the transmittal form). An interest recipient may use forms containing provisions substantially similar to those in Forms 1098 and 1096 if it complies with applicable revenue procedures relating to substitute Forms 1098 and 1096. An interest recipient must file a separate return for each qualified mortgage for which it receives $600 or more of interest for a calendar year.
(2)
Information included on return.
An interest recipient must include on Form 1098:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN) (as defined in section 7701(a)(41)) of the payor of record;
(ii) The name, address, and TIN of the interest recipient;
(iii) The amount of interest (other than points) required to be reported with respect to the qualified mortgage for the calendar year;
(iv) With respect to reimbursements of interest on a qualified mortgage (as discussed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) made to the payor of record in the calendar year—
(A) Reimbursements aggregating $600 or more; and
(B) Reimbursements aggregating less than $600, but only if $600 or more of interest on the qualified mortgage is received in the calendar year from the payor of record;
(v) The amount of points paid directly by the payor of record (within the meaning of § 1.6050H-1(f)(3)) required to be reported with respect to the qualified mortgage for the calendar year; and
(vi) Any other information required by Form 1098 or its instructions.
Section 1.6050H-1(e) contains rules to determine the amount of interest received on a mortgage for a calendar year.
(3)
Reimbursements of interest on a qualified mortgage.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section, a reimbursement of interest on a qualified mortgage is a reimbursement of an amount received in a prior year that was required to be reported for that prior year under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section by any interest recipient. Only the interest recipient that makes
the reimbursement is required to report the reimbursement under this section. Form 1098 and the statement furnished to the payor of record under paragraph (b) of this section must not include any amount that constitutes interest on the reimbursement paid to the payor of record. Rules relating to the requirement to report interest on a reimbursement are, in the case of a person carrying on the banking business (or a middleman, as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(4), of a person carrying on the banking business), provided in section 6049 and the regulations thereunder, and, for other persons, provided in section 6041 and the regulations thereunder. Reimbursements of interest on a qualified mortgage (as described in this section) made in 1993 and subsequent calendar years must be reported on Form 1098 and statements furnished to payors of record. Reimbursements made prior to 1993 are not required to be reported.
(4)
Time and place for filing return.
An interest recipient must file a return required by this paragraph (a) on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the year following the calendar year for which it receives the mortgage interest. If no interest is required to be reported for the calendar year, but a reimbursement of interest on a qualified mortgage is required to be reported for the calendar year, then a return required by this paragraph (a) must be filed on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the year following the calendar year in which the reimbursement was made. An interest recipient must file the return required by paragraph (a) of this section with the IRS office designated in the instructions for Form 1098.
(5)
Use of magnetic media.
An interest recipient must file the return required by paragraph (a) of this section on magnetic media only if required by section 6011(e) and the regulations thereunder. An interest recipient not required by section 6011(e) to file returns on magnetic media may request permission to do so. Section 301.6011-2 contains rules relating to the use of magnetic media. A failure to file on magnetic media when required constitutes a failure to file an information return under section 6721.
(b)
Requirement to furnish statement
—(1)
In general.
An interest recipient that must file a return under paragraph (a) of this section must furnish a statement to the payor of record.
(2)
Information included on statement.
An interest recipient must include on the statement that it must furnish to a payor of record:
(i) The information required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
(ii) A legend that—
(A) Identifies the statement as important tax information that is being furnished to the IRS; and
(B) Notifies the payor of record that if the payor of record is required to file a return, a negligence penalty or other sanction may be imposed on the payor of record if the IRS determines that an underpayment of tax results because the payor of record overstated a deduction for this mortgage interest (if any) or understated income from this mortgage interest reimbursement (if any) on the payor of record's return;
(iii) A legend stating that the payor of record may be unable to deduct the full amount of mortgage interest reported on the statement; that limitations based on the cost and value of the property securing the mortgage may apply; and that the payor of record may only deduct mortgage interest to the extent it was incurred, actually paid by the payor of record, and not reimbursed by another person; and
(iv) With respect to any information required to be reported under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section, an instruction providing that the amount of the reimbursement is not to be deducted and that the amount must be included in the gross income of the payor of record if the reimbursed interest was deducted by the payor of record in a prior year so as to reduce income tax.
(3)
Statement furnished pursuant to Federal mortgage program.
An interest recipient that furnishes a statement to a payor of record under a Federal mortgage program will satisfy the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section
if the statement contains all the information and legends required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section and is furnished by the time and at the place required by paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(4)
Copy of Form 1098 to payor of record.
An interest recipient will satisfy the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section by furnishing to a payor of record a copy of Form 1098 (or a substitute statement that complies with applicable revenue procedures) containing all the information filed with the Internal Revenue Service and all the legends required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section by the time and at the place required by paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(5)
Furnishing statement with other information reports.
An interest recipient may transmit the statement required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the payor of record with other information, including other information returns, as permitted by applicable revenue procedures.
(6)
Time and place for furnishing statement.
An interest recipient must furnish a statement required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section to a payor of record on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year for which it receives the mortgage interest. If no mortgage interest is required to be reported for the calendar year, but a reimbursement of interest on a qualified mortgage is required to be reported for the calendar year, then the statement required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be furnished on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the reimbursement was made. The interest recipient will be considered to have furnished the statement to the payor of record if it mails the statement to the payor of record's last known address.
(c)
Notice requirement for use of Rule of 78s method of accounting
—(1)
In general.
An interest recipient seeking to report interest received on a mortgage under the Rule of 78s method of accounting as permitted under § 1.6050H-1(e)(4) must notify the payor of record that the Rule of 78s method of accounting was used to calculate interest received on the mortgage and that the payor of record may not deduct as interest the amount calculated under the Rule of 78s method of accounting unless the payor of record properly uses that method to determine interest deductions. The notice must state that the payor of record may use the Rule of 78s method of accounting to determine interest paid for Federal income tax purposes only for a self-amortizing consumer loan requiring level payments at regular intervals (at least annually) over no longer than a five-year period, with no balloon payment at the end of the loan term, and only when the loan agreement provides for use of the Rule of 78s method of accounting to determine interest earned. See Rev. Proc. 83-40, 1983-1 C.B. 774; Rev. Rul. 83-84, 1983-1 C.B. 97.
(2)
Time and manner.
An interest recipient must provide notice required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section to a payor of record on or with the statement required by paragraph (b) of this section. An interest recipient may provide notice on a separate paper or on the statement required by paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Reporting under designation agreement
—(1)
In general.
An interest recipient that receives or collects interest (including points) on a mortgage may designate a qualified person to satisfy the reporting requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. If a designated qualified person reports as permitted under this paragraph (d), it will satisfy the requirement of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section by including on Form 1098 (and Form 1096) the name, address, and TIN of the designated qualified person.
(2)
Qualified person.
A qualified person is either—
(i) A trade or business with respect to which the interest recipient is under common control within the meaning of § 1.414(c)-2; or
(ii) A person who is named as the designee by the lender of record or by a qualified person (under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) in a designation agreement entered into in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and who either was involved in the original loan transaction or is a subsequent purchaser of the loan.
(3)
Designation agreement.
An interest recipient that designates a qualified
person to satisfy the reporting requirements described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must make that designation in a written designation agreement. The designation agreement must identify the mortgage(s) and calendar years for which the designated qualified person must report, and must be signed by both the designator and designee. A designee may report an amount as having been paid directly by the payor of record (for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section) only if the designation agreement contains the designator's representation that it did not lend such amount to the payor of record as part of the overall transaction. The designator must retain a copy of the designation agreement for four years following the close of the calendar year in which the loan is made. The designation agreement need not be filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
(4)
Penalties.
A designated qualified person is subject to any applicable penalties provided in part II of subchapter B of chapter 68 of the Internal Revenue Code as if it were an interest recipient. A designator is relieved from liability for applicable penalties by designating a qualified person under the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section describes applicable penalties.
(e)
Penalty provisions
—(1)
Returns and statements the due date for which (determined without regard for extensions) is after December 31, 1987, and before December 31, 1989.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1) only, all references to sections of the Internal Revenue Code refer to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended on or before December 31, 1987.
(i)
Failure to file return or to furnish statement.
The section 6721 penalty applies to an interest recipient that fails to file a return required by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to a payor of record. The section 6722 penalty applies to an interest recipient that fails to furnish a statement required by paragraph (b) of this section to a payor of record.
(ii)
Failure to furnish TIN.
The section 6676 penalty may apply to an interest recipient that fails to furnish the TIN of a payor of record on a return required by paragraph (a) of this section. The section 6676 penalty may apply to an interest recipient that fails to request and to obtain the TIN of a payor of record under paragraph (f) of this section.
(iii)
Failure to include correct information.
The section 6723 penalty may apply to an interest recipient that fails to include correct information on a return required by paragraph (a) of this section or on a statement required by paragraph (b) of this section to be furnished to a payor of record.
(2)
Returns and statements the due date for which (determined without regard for extensions) is after December 31, 1989
—(i)
Failure to file return or to furnish statement.
The section 6721 penalty applies to an interest recipient that fails to file a return required by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to a payor of record. The section 6722 penalty applies to an interest recipient that fails to furnish a statement required by paragraph (b) of this section to a payor of record.
(ii)
Failure to furnish TIN.
The section 6721 penalty may apply to an interest recipient that fails to furnish the TIN of a payor of record on a return required by paragraph (a) of this section. The section 6721 penalty may apply to an interest recipient that fails to request and to obtain the TIN of a payor of record under paragraph (f) of this section.
(iii)
Failure to include correct information.
The section 6721 penalty may apply to an interest recipient that fails to include correct information on a return required by paragraph (a) of this section. The section 6722 penalty may apply to an interest recipient that fails to include correct information on a statement required by paragraph (b) of this section to be furnished to a payor record.
(f)
Requirement to request and to obtain TIN
—(1)
In general.
For obligations incurred after December 31, 1987, an interest recipient must make all reasonable efforts to obtain the TIN of a payor of record when the payor of record incurs the obligation. For example, an interest recipient may require a borrower to furnish a TIN during the mortgage approval or application process. If an interest recipient does not
maintain the TIN of a payor of record on a mortgage, whenever incurred, it must request the TIN at least annually and must process responses properly and promptly.
(2)
Manner of requesting TIN.
An interest recipient need not separately mail a request for a TIN. An interest recipient may include a request in its regular mailing of payment coupon booklets or annual statements. If an interest recipient makes no mailing to a payor of record during the year in which the payor of record incurs the obligation, it must request the TIN in a separate mailing. No particular form is required to request a TIN. Nevertheless, an interest recipient must make the request on a separate paper and must clearly notify a payor of record that the Internal Revenue Service requires the payor of record to furnish a TIN in order to verify any mortgage interest deduction. An interest recipient must notify a payor of record that failure to furnish a TIN subjects the payor of record to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. A request for a TIN made on Form W-9 satisfies the requirement of this paragraph (f)(2).
(g)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, this section is effective for mortgage interest received after December 31, 1987.
(2)
Points.
The reporting requirement of this section does not apply to prepaid interest in the form of points received before January 1, 1995.

§ 1.6050H-3
Information reporting of mortgage insurance premiums.
(a)
Information reporting requirements.
Any person who, in the course of a trade or business, receives premiums, including prepaid premiums, for mortgage insurance (as described in paragraph (b) of this section) from any individual aggregating $600 or more for any calendar year, must make an information return setting forth the total amount received from that individual during the calendar year.
(b)
Scope.
Paragraph (a) of this section applies to mortgage insurance provided by the Federal Housing Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Rural Housing Service (or their successor organizations), or to private mortgage insurance (as defined by section 2 of the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 (12 U.S.C. 4901) as in effect on December 20, 2006). The rule stated in paragraph (a) of this section applies to the receipt of all payments of mortgage insurance premiums, by cash or financing, without regard to source.
(c)
Aggregation.
Whether a person receives $600 or more of mortgage insurance premiums is determined on a mortgage-by-mortgage basis. A recipient need not aggregate mortgage insurance premiums received on all of the mortgages of an individual to determine whether the $600 threshold is met. Therefore, a recipient need not report mortgage insurance premiums of less than $600 received on a mortgage, even though it receives a total of $600 or more of mortgage insurance premiums on all of the mortgages for an individual for a calendar year.
(d)
Time, form, and manner of reporting.
Mortgage insurance premiums required to be reported under paragraph (a) of this section must be reported on the Form 1098 or successor form that is filed pursuant to § 1.6050H-2(a) with respect to the mortgage of the individual who paid the mortgage insurance premiums. For the requirements for furnishing statements with respect to Forms 1098 filed with the Internal Revenue Service, see § 1.6050H-2(b).
(e)
Cross reference.
For rules concerning the allocation of certain prepaid qualified mortgage insurance premiums, see § 1.163-11 of this chapter.
(f)
Limitation on the reporting of mortgage insurance premiums.
This section applies to mortgage insurance premiums described in paragraph (b) of this section that are paid or accrued on or after January 1, 2013, and during periods to which section 163(h)(3)(E) applies. This section does not apply to any amounts of mortgage insurance premiums that are allocable to any periods to which section 163(h)(3)(E) does not apply.
(g)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to mortgage insurance premiums received on or after January 1, 2013. For regulations applicable before May 5, 2012, see § 1.6050H-3T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 (revised as of April 1, 2012).

[T.D. 8652, 61 FR 7, Jan. 2, 1996, as amended by T.D. 8974, 66 FR 67687, Dec. 31, 2001; T.D. 9972, 88 FR 11764, Feb. 23, 2023]
§ 1.6050I-1
Returns relating to cash in excess of $10,000 received in a trade or business.
(a)
Reporting requirement
—(1)
Reportable transaction
—(i)
In general.
Any person (as defined in section 7701(a)(1)) who, in the course of a trade or business in which such person is engaged, receives cash in excess of $10,000 in 1 transaction (or 2 or more related transactions) shall, except as otherwise provided, make a return of information with respect to the receipt of cash.
(ii)
Certain financial transactions.
Section 6050I of title 26 of the United States Code requires persons to report
information about financial transactions to the Internal Revenue Service, and section 5331 of title 31 of the United States Code requires persons to report similar information about certain transactions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. This information shall be reported on the same form as prescribed by the Secretary.
(2)
Cash received for the account of another.
Cash in excess of $10,000 received by a person for the account of another must be reported under this section. Thus, for example, a person who collects delinquent accounts receivable for an automobile dealer must report with respect to the receipt of cash in excess of $10,000 from the collection of a particular account even though the proceeds of the collection are credited to the account of the automobile dealer (
i.e.,
where the rights to the proceeds from the account are retained by the automobile dealer and the collection is made on a fee-for-service basis).
(3)
Cash received by agents
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, a person who in the course of a trade or business acts as an agent (or in some other similar capacity) and receives cash in excess of $10,000 from a principal, must report the receipt of cash under this section.
(ii)
Exception.
An agent who receives cash from a principal and uses all of the cash within 15 days in a cash transaction (second cash transaction) which is reportable under section 6050I or section 5331 of title 31 of the United States Code and the corresponding regulations (31 CFR Chapter X), and who discloses the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the principal to the recipient in the second cash transaction need not report the initial receipt of cash under this section. An agent will be deemed to have met the disclosure requirements of this paragraph (a)(3)(ii) if the agent discloses only the name of the principal and the agent knows that the recipient has the principal's address and taxpayer identification number.
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of the rules in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section:

# Example.
B, the principal, gives D, an attorney, $75,000 in cash to purchase real property on behalf of B. Within 15 days D purchases real property for cash from E, a real estate developer, and discloses to E, B's name, address, and taxpayer identification number. Because the transaction qualifies for the exception provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, D need not report with respect to the initial receipt of cash under this section. The exception does not apply, however, if D pays E by means other than cash, or effects the purchase more than 15 days following receipt of the cash from B, or fails to disclose B's name, address, and taxpayer identification number (assuming D does not know that E already has B's address and taxpayer identification number), or purchases the property from a person whose sale of the property is not in the course of that person's trade or business. In any such case, D is required to report the receipt of cash from B under this section.
(b)
Multiple payments.
The receipt of multiple cash deposits or cash installment payments (or other similar payments or prepayments) on or after January 1, 1990, relating to a single transaction (or two or more related transactions), is reported as set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section.
(1)
Initial payment in excess of $10,000.
If the initial payment exceeds $10,000, the recipient must report the initial payment within 15 days of its receipt.
(2)
Initial payment of $10,000 or less.
If the initial payment does not exceed $10,000, the recipient must aggregate the initial payment and subsequent payments made within one year of the initial payment until the aggregate amount exceeds $10,000, and report with respect to the aggregate amount within 15 days after receiving the payment that causes the aggregate amount to exceed $10,000.
(3)
Subsequent payments.
In addition to any other required report, a report must be made each time that previously unreportable payments made within a 12-month period with respect to a single transaction (or two or more related transactions), individually or in the aggregate, exceed $10,000. The report must be made within 15 days after receiving the payment in excess of $10,000 or the payment that causes the aggregate amount received in the 12- month period to exceed $10,000. (If more
than one report would otherwise be required for multiple cash payments within a 15-day period that relate to a single transaction (or two or more related transactions), the recipient may make a single combined report with respect to the payments. The combined report must be made no later than the date by which the first of the separate reports would otherwise be required to be made.) A report with respect to payments of $10,000 or less that are reportable under this paragraph (b)(3) and are received after December 31, 1989, but before July 10, 1990, is due July 24, 1990.
(4)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of the rules in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section:

# Example.
On January 10, 1991, M receives an initial cash payment of $11,000 with respect to a transaction. M receives subsequent cash payments with respect to the same transaction of $4,000 on February 15, 1991, $6,000 on March 20, 1991, and $12,000 on May 15, 1991. M must make a report with respect to the payment received on January 10, 1991, by January 25, 1991. M must also make a report with respect to the payments totalling $22,000 received from February 15, 1991, through May 15, 1991. This report must be made by May 30, 1991, that is, within 15 days of the date that the subsequent payments, all of which were received within a 12-month period, exceeded $10,000.
(c)
Meaning of terms.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section—
(1)
Cash
—(i)
Amounts received prior to February 3, 1992.
For amounts received prior to February 3, 1992, the term
cash
means the coin and currency of the United States or of any other country, which circulate in and are customarily used and accepted as money in the country in which issued.
(ii)
Amounts received on or after February 3, 1992.
For amounts received on or after February 3, 1992, the term
cash
means—
(A) The coin and currency of the United States or of any other country, which circulate in and are customarily used and accepted as money in the country in which issued; and
(B) A cashier's check (by whatever name called, including “treasurer's check” and “bank check”), bank draft, traveler's check, or money order having a face amount of not more than $10,000—
(
1
) Received in a designated reporting transaction as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section (except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv), (v), and (vi) of this section), or
(
2
) Received in any transaction in which the recipient knows that such instrument is being used in an attempt to avoid the reporting of the transaction under section 6050I and this section.
(iii)
Designated reporting transaction.
A designated reporting transaction is a retail sale (or the receipt of funds by a broker or other intermediary in connection with a retail sale) of—
(A) A consumer durable,
(B) A collectible, or
(C) A travel or entertainment activity.
(iv)
Exception for certain loans.
A cashier's check, bank draft, traveler's check, or money order received in a designated reporting transaction is not treated as cash pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section if the instrument constitutes the proceeds of a loan from a bank (as that term is defined in 31 CFR Chapter X). The recipient may rely on a copy of the loan document, a written statement from the bank, or similar documentation (such as a written lien instruction from the issuer of the instrument) to substantiate that the instrument constitutes loan proceeds.
(v)
Exception for certain installment sales.
A cashier's check, bank draft, traveler's check, or money order received in a designated reporting transaction is not treated as cash pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section if the instrument is received in payment on a promissory note or an installment sales contract (including a lease that is considered to be a sale for Federal income tax purposes). However, the preceding sentence applies only if—
(A) Promissory notes or installment sales contracts with the same or substantially similar terms are used in the ordinary course of the recipient's trade or business in connection with sales to ultimate consumers; and
(B) The total amount of payments with respect to the sale that are received on or before the 60th day after the date of the sale does not exceed 50 percent of the purchase price of the sale.
(vi)
Exception for certain down payment plans.
A cashier's check, bank draft, traveler's check, or money order received in a designated reporting transaction is not treated as cash pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section is the instrument is received pursuant to a payment plan requiring one or more down payments and the payment of the balance of the purchase price by a date no later than the date of the sale (in the case of an item of travel or entertainment, a date no later than the earliest date that any item of travel or entertainment pertaining to the same trip or event is furnished). However, the preceding sentence applies only if—
(A) The recipient uses payment plans with the same or substantially similar terms in the ordinary course of its trade or business in connection with sales to ultimate consumers; and
(B) The instrument is received more than 60 days prior to the date of the sale (in the case of an item of travel or entertainment, the date on which the final payment is due).
(vii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the definition of “cash” set forth in paragraphs (c)(l)(ii) through (vi) of this section.

# Example 1.
D, an individual, purchases gold coins from M, a coin dealer, for $13,200. D tenders to M in payment United States currency in the amount of $6,200 and a cashier's check in the face amount of $7,000 which D had purchased. Because the sale is a designated reporting transaction, the cashier's check is treated as cash for purposes of section 6050I and this section. Therefore, because M has received more than $10,000 in cash with respect to the transaction, M must make the report required by section 6050I and this section.

# Example 2.
E, an individual, purchases an automobile from Q, an automobile dealer, for $11,500. E tenders to Q in payment United States currency in the amount of $2,000 and a cashier's check payable to E and Q in the amount of $9,500. The cashier's check constitutes the proceeds of a loan from the bank issuing the check. The origin of the proceeds is evident from provisions inserted by the bank on the check that instruct the dealer to cause a lien to be placed on the vehicle as security for the loan. The sale of the automobile is a designated reporting transaction. However, under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, because E has furnished Q documentary information establishing that the cashier's check constitutes the proceeds of a loan from the bank issuing the check, the cashier's check is not treated as cash pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section.

# Example 3.
F, an individual, purchases an item of jewelry from S, a retail jeweler, for $12,000. F gives S traveler's checks totalling $2,400 and pays the balance with a personal check payable to S in the amount of $9,600. Because the sale is a designated reporting transaction, the traveler's checks are treated as cash for purposes of section 6050I and this section. However, because the personal check is not treated as cash for purposes of section 6050I and this section, S has not received more than $10,000 in cash in the transaction and no report is required to be filed under section 6050I and this section.

# Example 4.
G, an individual, purchases a boat from T, a boat dealer, for $16,500. G pays T with a cashier's check payable to T in the amount of $16,500. The cashier's check is not treated as cash because the face amount of the check is more than $10,000. Thus, no report is required to be made by T under section 6050I and this section.

# Example 5.
H, an individual, arranges with W, a travel agent, for the chartering of a passenger aircraft to transport a group of individuals to a sports event in another city. H also arranges with W for hotel accommodations for the group and for admission tickets to the sports event. In payment, H tenders to W money orders which H had previously purchased. The total amount of the money orders, none of which individually exceeds $10,000 in face amount, exceeds $10,000. Because the transaction is a designated reporting transaction, the money orders are treated as cash for purposes of section 6050I and this section. Therefore, because W has received more than $10,000 in cash with respect to the transaction, W must make the report required by section 6050I and this section.
(2)
Consumer durable.
The term
consumer durable
means an item of tangible personal property of a type that is suitable under ordinary usage for personal consumption or use, that can reasonably be expected to be useful for at least 1 year under ordinary usage, and that has a sales price of more than $10,000. Thus, for example, a $20,000 automobile is a consumer durable (whether or not it is sold for business use), but a $20,000 dump truck or a $20,000 factory machine is not.
(3)
Collectible.
The term
collectible
means an item described in paragraphs (A) through (D) of section 408(m)(2) (determined without regard to section 408(m)(3)).
(4)
Travel or entertainment activity.
The term
travel or entertainment activity
means an item of travel or entertainment (within the meaning of § 1.274-2(b)(1)) pertaining to a single trip or event where the aggregate sales price of the item and all other items pertaining to the same trip or event that are sold in the same transaction (or related transactions) exceeds $10,000.
(5)
Retail sale.
The term
retail sale
means any sale (whether for resale or for any other purpose) made in the course of a trade or business if that trade or business principally consists of making sales to ultimate consumers.
(6)
Trade or business.
The term
trade or business
has the same meaning as under section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
(7)
Transaction
—(i) The term
transaction
means the underlying event precipitating the payer's transfer of cash to the recipient. Transactions include (but are not limited to) a sale of goods or services; a sale of real property; a sale of intangible property; a rental of real or personal property; an exchange of cash for other cash; the establishment or maintenance of or contribution to a custodial, trust, or escrow arrangement; a payment of a preexisting debt; a conversion of cash to a negotiable instrument; a reimbursement for expenses paid; or the making or repayment of a loan. A transaction may not be divided into multiple transactions in order to avoid reporting under this section.
(ii) The term
related transactions
means any transaction conducted between a payer (or its agent) and a recipient of cash in a 24-hour period. Additionally, transactions conducted between a payer (or its agent) and a cash recipient during a period of more than 24 hours are related if the recipient knows or has reason to know that each transaction is one of a series of connected transactions.
(iii) The following examples illustrate the definition of paragraphs (c)(7) (i) and (ii).

# Example 1.
A person has a tacit agreement with a gold dealer to purchase $36,000 in gold bullion. The $36,000 purchase represents a single transaction under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section and the reporting requirements of this section cannot be avoided by recasting the single sales transaction into 4 separate $9,000 sales transactions.

# Example 2.
An attorney agrees to represent a client in a criminal case with the attorney's fee to be determined on an hourly basis. In the first month in which the attorney represents the client, the bill for the attorney's services comes to $8,000 which the client pays in cash. In the second month in which the attorney represents the client, the bill for the attorney's services comes to $4,000, which the client again pays in cash. The aggregate amount of cash paid ($12,000) relates to a single transaction as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, the sale of legal services relating to the criminal case, and the receipt of cash must be reported under this section.

# Example 3.
A person intends to contribute a total of $45,000 to a trust fund, and the trustee of the fund knows or has reason to know of that intention. The $45,000 contribution is a single transaction under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section and the reporting requirement of this section cannot be avoided by the grantor's making five separate $9,000 cash contributions to a single fund or by making five $9,000 cash contributions to five separate funds administered by a common trustee.

# Example 4.
K, an individual, attends a one day auction and purchases for cash two items, at a cost of $9,240 and $1,732.50 respectively (tax and buyer's premium included). Because the transactions are related transactions as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, the auction house is required to report the aggregate amount of cash received from the related sales ($10,972.50), even though the auction house accounts separately on its books for each item sold and presents the purchaser with separate bills for each item purchased.

# Example 5.
F, a coin dealer, sells for cash $9,000 worth of gold coins to an individual on three successive days. Under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section the three $9,000 transactions are related transactions aggregating $27,000 if F knows, or has reason to know, that each transaction is one of a series of connected transactions.
(8)
Recipient.
(i) The term
recipient
means the person receiving the cash. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section, each store, division, branch, department, headquarters, or office (“branch”) (regardless of physical location) comprising a portion of a person's trade or business
shall for purposes of this section be deemed a separate recipient.
(ii) A branch that receives cash payments will not be deemed a separate recipient if the branch (or a central unit linking such branch with other branches) would in the ordinary course of business have reason to know the identity of payers making cash payments to other branches of such person.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of the rules in paragraphs (c)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section:

# Example 1.
N, an individual, purchases regulated futures contracts at a cost of $7,500 and $5,000, respectively, through two different branches of Commodities Broker X on the same day. N pays for each purchase with cash. Each branch of Commodities Broker X transmits the sales information regarding each of N's purchases to a central unit of Commodities Broker X (which settles the transactions against N's account). Under paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section the separate branches of Commodities Broker X are not deemed to be separate recipients; therefore. Commodities Broker X must report with respect to the two related regulated futures contracts sales in accordance with this section.

# Example 2.
P, a corporation, owns and operates a racetrack. P's racetrack contains 100 betting windows at which pari-mutuel wagers may be made. R, an individual, places cash wagers of $3,000 each at five separate betting windows. Assuming that in the ordinary course of business each betting window (or a central unit linking windows) does not have reason to know the identity of persons making wagers at other betting windows, each betting window would be deemed to be a separate cash recipient under paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section. As no individual recipient received cash in excess of $10,000, no report need be made by P under this section.
(d)
Exceptions to the reporting requirements of section 6050I
—(1)
Receipt of cash by certain financial institutions.
A financial institution as defined in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (J), (K), (R), and (S) of section 5312 (a)(2) of title 31, United States Code is not required to report the receipt of cash exceeding $10,000 under section 6050I.
(2)
Receipt of cash by certain casinos having gross annual gaming revenue in excess of $1,000,000
—(i)
In general.
If a casino receives cash in excess of $10,000 and is required to report the receipt of such cash directly to the Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) under 31 CFR 1021.310 or 1010.360 and is subject to the recordkeeping requirements of 31 CFR 1021.400, then the casino is not required to make a return with respect to the receipt of such cash under section 6050I and these regulations.
(ii)
Casinos exempt under 31 CFR 1010.970(c).
Under the authority of section 6050I(c)(1)(A), the Secretary may exempt from the reporting requirements of section 6050I casinos with gross annual gaming revenue in excess of $1,000,000 that are exempt under 31 CFR 1010.970(c) from reporting certain cash transactions to the Treasury Department under 31 CFR 1021.310 or 1010.360. The determination whether a casino which is granted an exemption under 31 CFR 1010.970(c) will be required to report under section 6050I will be made on a case-by-case basis, concurrently with the granting of such an exemption.
(iii)
Reporting of cash received in a nongaming business.
Nongaming businesses (such as shops, restaurants, entertainment, and hotels) at casino hotels and resorts are separate trades or businesses in which the receipt of cash in excess of $10,000 is reportable under section 6050I and these regulations. Thus, a casino exempt under paragraph (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section must report with respect to cash in excess of $10,000 received in its nongaming businesses.
(iv)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of the rules in paragraphs (d)(2) (i) and (iii) of this section:
(A)
Example.
A and B are casinos having gross annual gaming revenue in excess of $1,000,000. C is a casino with gross annual gaming revenue of less than $1,000,000. Casino A receives $15,000 in cash from a customer with respect to a gaming transaction which the casino reports to the Treasury Department under 31 CFR 1021.310 and 1010.360. Casino B's hotel division receives $15,000 in cash from a customer in payment for accommodations provided to that customer at Casino B's hotel. Casino C receives $15,000 in cash
from a customer with respect to a gaming transaction. Casino A is not required to report the transaction under section 6050I or these regulations because the exception for certain casinos provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section (casino exception) applies. Casino B's hotel division is required to report under section 6050I and these regulations because the casino exception does not apply to the receipt of cash by a nongaming business division. Casino C is required to report under section 6050I and these regulations because the casino exception does not apply to casinos having gross annual gaming revenue of $1,000,000 or less which do not have to report to the Treasury Department under 31 CFR 1021.310 and 1010.360.
(B) [Reserved]
(3)
Receipt of cash not in the course of the recipient's trade or business.
The receipt of cash in excess of $10,000 by a person other than in the course of the person's trade or business is not reportable under section 6050I. Thus, for example, F, an individual in the trade or business of selling real estate, sells a motorboat for $12,000, the purchase price of which is paid in cash. F did not use the motorboat in any trade or business in which F was engaged. F is not required to report under section 6050I or these regulations because the exception provided in this paragraph (d)(3) applies.
(4)
Receipt is made with respect to a foreign cash transaction
—(i)
In general.
Generally, there is no requirement to report with respect to a cash transaction if the entire transaction occurs outside the United States (the fifty states and the District of Columbia). An entire transaction consists of both the transaction as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section and the receipt of cash by the recipient. If, however, any part of an entire transaction occurs in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or a possession or territory of the United States and the recipient of cash in that transaction is subject to the general jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service under title 26 of the United States Code, the recipient is required to report the transaction under this section.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of the rules in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section:

# Example.
W, an individual engaged in the trade or business of selling aircraft, reaches an agreement to sell an airplane to a U.S. citizen living in Mexico. The agreement, no portion of which is formulated in the United States, calls for a purchase price of $125,000 and requires delivery of and payment for the airplane to be made in Mexico. Upon delivery of the airplane in Mexico, W receives $125,000 in cash. W is not required to report under section 6050I or these regulations because the exception provided in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section (“foreign transaction exception”) applies. If, however, any part of the agreement to sell had been formulated in the United States, the foreign transaction exception would not apply and W would be required to report the receipt of cash under section 6050I and these regulations.
(e)
Time, manner, and form of reporting
—(1)
Time of reporting.
The reports required by this section must be filed in accordance with the Form 8300 instructions and related publications by the 15th day after the date the cash is received. However, in the case of multiple payments relating to a single transaction (or two or more related transactions), see paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Form of reporting.
A report required by paragraph (a) of this section must be made on Form 8300. A return of information made in compliance with this paragraph must contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person from whom the cash was received; the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person on whose behalf the transaction was conducted (if the recipient knows or has reason to know that the person from whom the cash was received conducted the transaction as an agent for another person); the amount of cash received; the date and nature of the transaction; and any other information required by Form 8300. Form 8300 can be obtained from any Internal Revenue Service Forms Distribution Center.
(3)
Manner of reporting
—(i)
Where to file.
A person making a return of information under this section must file Form 8300 in accordance with the form instructions and related publications.
(ii)
Verification.
A person making a return of information under this section must verify the identity of the person from whom the reportable cash is received. Verification of the identity of a person who purports to be an alien must be made by examination of such person's passport, alien identification card, or other official document evidencing nationality or residence. Verification of the identity of any other person may be made by examination of a document normally acceptable as a means of identification when cashing or accepting checks (for example, a driver's license or a credit card). In addition, a return will be considered incomplete if the person required to make a return knows (or has reason to know) that an agent is conducting the transaction for a principal, and the return does not identify both the principal and the agent.
(iii)
Retention of returns.
A person required to make an information return under this section must keep a copy of each return filed for five years from the date of filing.
(f)
Requirement of furnishing statements
—(1)
In general.
Any person required to make an information return under this section must furnish a single, annual, written statement to each person whose name is set forth in a return (“identified person”) filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
(2)
Form of statement.
The statement required by the preceding paragraph need not follow any particular format, but it must contain the following information:
(i) The name and address of the person making the return;
(ii) The aggregate amount of reportable cash received by the person who made the information return required by this section during the calendar year in all cash transactions relating to the identified person; and
(iii) A legend stating that the information contained in the statement is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service.
(3)
When statement is to be furnished.
Statements required under this paragraph (f) must be furnished to an identified person on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the cash is received. A statement shall be considered to be furnished to an identified person if it is mailed to the identified person at the identified person's last known address.
(g)
Cross-reference to penalty provisions
—(1)
Failure to file correct information return.
See section 6721 for civil penalties relating to the failure to file a correct return under section 6050I(a) and paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
Failure to furnish correct statement.
See section 6722 for civil penalties relating to the failure to furnish a correct statement to identified persons under section 6050I(e) and paragraph (f) of this section.
(3)
Criminal penalties.
Any person who willfully fails to make a return or makes a false return under section 6050I and this section may be subject to criminal prosecution.
(h)

[T.D. 8652, 61 FR 7, Jan. 2, 1996, as amended by T.D. 9972, 88 FR 11764, Feb. 23, 2023]
§ 1.6050J-1T
Questions and answers concerning information returns relating to foreclosures and abandonments of security (temporary).
The following questions and answers relate to the requirement of reporting foreclosures and abandonments of security under section 6050J of the Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954, as added by section 148 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (98 Stat. 687).

# Requirement of Reporting

# In General
Q-1: What does section 6050J provide with respect to the reporting of acquisitions and abandonments of property that secures indebtedness?
A-1: Section 6050J provides that an information return must be made by any person who, in connection with a trade or business conducted by the person (except as provided in A-13), lends money and, in full or partial satisfaction of the debt, acquires an interest in any property that is security for the debt, or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned. For purposes of these questions and answers, a person who lends money in connection with a trade or business is referred to as a “lender”.

# Trade or Business Requirement
Q-2: Must a person be in the trade or business of lending money in order to be subject to the reporting requirement of this section?
A-2: No. A person does not have to be in the trade or business of lending money to be subject to this reporting requirement. Thus, if L sells automobiles and lends money to B to enable B to purchase an automobile from L for use in B's trade or business, and that automobile is security for the loan, L would be subject to this reporting requirement. Similarly, if P promotes interests in an oil well, and lends money to I to enable I to invest in the oil well which is security for the loan, P would be subject to this reporting requirement.
Q-3: How does the reporting requirement apply in the case of pools, fixed investment trusts, or other similar arrangements through which undivided beneficial interests or participations in indebtedness are offered?
A-3: In these cases, the owners of the undivided beneficial interests or participations are not subject to this reporting requirement. Instead, the trustee, record owner, or person acting in a similar capacity is treated as the lender for purposes of this reporting requirement and is the party required to report. For purposes of both section 6050J and the applicable penalty provisions, only one return and one statement must be filed with respect to each loan or other evidence of indebtedness. For situations when more than one return or statement must be filed, see A-29, A-31, and A-41. The trustee, record owner, or person acting in a similar capacity, rather than the owners of beneficial interests or participations, is subject to the applicable penalty provisions (see A-43).
Q-4: How does the reporting requirement apply in the case of corporate, tax-exempt, or other bond issues?
A-4: In these cases, the owners or holders of a bond issue are not required to report. Instead, the trustee or person acting in a similar capacity is treated as the lender for purposes of this reporting requirement and is the party required to report. For purposes of both section 6050J and the applicable penalty provisions, only one return and one statement must be filed with respect to a bond issue. For situations when more than one return or statement must be filed, see A-29, A-31, and A-41. The trustee or person acting in a similar capacity, rather than the owners or holders of a bond issue, is subject to the applicable penalty provisions (see A-43).

# Property Subject to Reporting
Q-5: Does the reporting requirement apply to all types of property securing indebtedness?
A-5: No. The reporting requirement does not apply to any loan made to an individual and secured by an interest in tangible personal property which is neither held for investment nor used in a trade or business. For rules governing when the reporting requirment applies to tangible personal property of a type ordinarily used for personal purposes, see A-8.
Q-6: Does the reporting requirement apply when property securing indebtedness is held both for personal use and for use in a trade or business?
A-6: Yes. The reporting requirement applies when property securing indebtedness is held both for personal use and for use in a trade or business. Similarly, the reporting requirement applies when the borrower holds such property both for personal use and for investment purposes.
Q-7: Does the reporting requirement apply to indebtedness secured by a personal residence?
A-7: Yes. A lender is subject to the reporting requirement if the property that is security for the loan is real property, including a personal residence, whether or not held for investment or used in a trade or business.
Q-8: In the case of a loan made to an individual and secured by personal property of a type that is ordinarily used for personal purposes, how does a lender know whether such property is used in a trade or business or held for investment purposes?
A-8: In the case of a loan made to an individual and secured by personal property of a type that is ordinarily used for personal purposes, such as an automobile, computer, or boat, the lender is subject to the reporting requirement if the lender knows that the property will be used in a trade or business or held for investment purposes. For this purpose, a lender knows information if the information is included on the books and records of the lender or its agents pertaining to the loan, or is known by the lender or agent's officers, partners, principals or employees, but only if such information was acquired in the course of their ordinary business activities on behalf of the lender. For example, if a borrower indicates on the loan agreement or disclosure statement that the borrower intends to use the property securing the loan in the borrower's trade or business, the lender is subject to this reporting requirement. Similarly, if the borrower notifies the lender that the borrower intends to convert the property from personal use to use in a trade or business, the lender is subject to the reporting requirement.
Q-9: If a lender maintains a system under which the lender classifies loans according to the use of property that secures the loan (such as use in a trade or business or personal use), may the lender rely on this system in determining whether the reporting requirement applies?
A-9: Yes. A lender may rely on the classification system to determine whether the reporting requirement applies, provided that the classification system is designed and reasonably maintained to ensure accuracy in identifying the use of property.

# Acquisition of an Interest
Q-10: For purposes of the reporting requirement, when is a lender treated as acquiring an interest in property that is security for indebtedness?
A-10: In general, an interest in property is acquired on the earlier of the date title is transferred to the lender or the date possession and the burdens and benefits of ownership are transferred to the lender. If State or other applicable law provides for an objection period within which the borrower and other appropriate parties may object to the lender's proposal to retain the property in satisfaction of the indebtedness, a lender is treated as acquiring an interest in the property on the date this objection period expires. If the lender purchases the property at a sale held to satisfy the indebtedness, such as at a foreclosure or execution sale, the lender is treated as acquiring an interest in the property on the later of the date of the sale or the date the borrower's right of redemption, if any, expires. See 4A-15 for rules governing reporting when a party other than the lender acquires property securing indebtedness at a foreclosure, execution or similar sale.
Q-11: If a lender takes possession of property that is security for a loan for a limited purpose, such as completing construction on or improvement to the property, is the lender treated as having acquired an interest in the property at that point?
A-11: No. The lender in these circumstances is not treated as acquiring an interest in the property. However, the lender must report if he later acquires an interest in the property in full or partial satisfaction of the indebtedness (see A-10 or A-15).

# Indirect Acquisition
Q-12: If a lender acquires an interest in a partnership, trust, or other entity in full or partial satisfaction of a loan that is secured by the assets or property owned by the partnership, trust, or other entity, is the lender treated as acquiring an interest in the property securing the loan?
A-12: Yes. A lender in this case acquires an interest in the underlying assets or property and the reporting requirements of this section apply to the acquisition of that interest in a partnership, trust, or other entity.

# Treatment of Governmental Units
Q-13: How does the reporting requirement apply to a governmental unit?
A-13: A governmental unit (or any agency or instrumentality thereof) which lends money secured by property is subject to the reporting requirement without regard to the requirement that the money be lent in connection with a trade or business. A governmental unit (or any agency or instrumentality thereof) subject to the reporting requirement must designate an officer or employee to make the return. The officer or employee appropriately designated must make the return in the form and manner prescribed by this section.

# Notification of Sale Under Section 7425(b)
Q-14: Does a return filed as required under this section constitute a notification of sale under section 7425(b)?
A-14: No. A return filed under this section is not considered a notification of sale under section 7425(b).

# Sale to Third Party
Q-15: If a party other than the lender purchases property securing a loan at a foreclosure, execution, or similar sale, must the lender report under this section?
A-15: Yes. The lender must report if a party other than the lender purchases property securing the lender's loan at a foreclosure, execution, or similar sale. If the proceeds of that sale are applied to satisfy all or any portion of the lender's loan, the lender must treat the property as having been abandoned. The lender will be treated as having reason to know that the property has been abandoned as of the date of the sale (see A-19). If no proceeds of such a sale are made available to satisfy any portion of the lender's loan but the lender's security interest foreclosed upon is terminated, reduced, or otherwise impaired by reason of the sale, the lender will be treated as having reason to know that the property has been abandoned as of the date of the sale (see A-19).

# Treatment of Foreign Borrowers
Q-16: How does the reporting requirement apply in the case of foreign borrowers where the property securing the loan is located outside the United States?
A-16: No reporting is required where both of the following requirements are met: (a) The property securing the loan is located outside the United States, and (b) at any time before the lender is required to report, the borrower furnishes the lender with a statement, signed upon penalty of perjury, that he is an exempt foreign person (unless an employee or other agent of the lender who is responsible for receiving or reviewing these statements has actual knowledge that the statement is incorrect). For purposes of this section, the borrower is an exempt foreign person if he:
(1) Is not a citizen of the United States, a resident of the United States, a person treated as a resident of the United States by reason of an election under section 6013 (g) or (h) or a United States corporation or other United States entity;
(2) Is not subject to the provisions of section 877; and
(3) At the time the statement is furnished, is not, or reasonably expects not to be, engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the current year in connection with the loan or property securing the loan.
If, after providing the statement, the borrower ceases to be an exempt foreign person, he must so notify the lender in writing within 30 days of this change in status. If the lender is so notified, this exemption from the reporting requirement no longer applies.

# Abandonments
Q-17: For purposes of this reporting requirement, when has an abandonment occurred?
A-17: An abandonment has occurred when the objective facts and circumstances indicate that the borrower intended to and has permanently discarded the property from use.
Q-18: Does the fact that a lender knows or has reason to know of an abandonment of property securing a loan mean that the borrower is entitled to an abandonment loss?
A-18: No. The definition of an abandonment of property securing a loan in A-17 applies only for purposes of this reporting requirement and is not intended to apply for other purposes, such as determining whether a borrower would be entitled to an abandonment loss.
Q-19: Under what circumstances will a lender be considered to have reason to know that property which is security for a loan has been abandoned?
A-19: Whether a lender has reason to know that property which is security for a loan has been abandoned is to be determined with
reference to all the facts and circumstances concerning the status of the property. When the lender in the ordinary course of business becomes aware or should become aware of circumstances indicating that the property has been abandoned, the lender will be deemed to know all the information that would have been discovered through a reasonable inquiry. For example, if a borrower has failed (without adequate explanation) to make payments on the loan for a substantial period, the lender must make a reasonable inquiry to determine whether there has been an abandonment. If a reasonable inquiry would reveal objective facts and circumstances indicating that the borrower intended to and has permanently discarded the property from use, then the lender has reason to know that the property has been abandoned. If a lender knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned and reasonably expects to commence foreclosure, execution sale, or similar proceedings, see A-20.
Q-20: If a lender has reason to know that property that is security for a loan has been abandoned and reasonably expects to commence within three months foreclosure, execution sale, or similar proceedings, is reporting of the abandonment required?
A-20: In these circumstances, the lender need not report as of the date he knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned. Instead, the lender must report as of the date he acquires an interest in the property or a third party purchases the property at a foreclosure, execution or similar sale (see A-10 and A-15). In any other case, the lender must report as of the date the lender knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned (see A-18).
Q-21: If a lender has reason to know that property that is security for a loan has been abandoned and reasonably expects to commence within three months foreclosure, execution sale or similar proceedings but in fact does not commence such proceedings within the three month period, must the lender report?
A-21: Yes. In these circumstances, the lender's obligation to report the abandonment arises at the close of the three month period. For example, if on December 31, 1985, a lender first has reason to know that property securing his loan has been abandoned and reasonably expects to commence foreclosure proceedings within three months, the lender is not required to report as of December 31, 1985 (see A-20). However, if the lender does not in fact commence foreclosure proceedings by March 31, 1986, the lender's obligation to report arises on this date. The lender must provide information on the abandonment under A-27 as of the date the lender first had reason to know of the abandonment (December 31, 1985). The lender must file the return required under this section with the Internal Revenue Service on or before February 28, 1987, and furnish a statement to the borrower on or before January 31, 1987 (see A-33 and A-40).

# Subsequent Holder of a Loan
Q-22: To whom does the reporting requirement apply when a person lends money secured by property and subsequently transfers his interest in the indebtedness to another person?
A-22: The subsequent holder of a loan is treated as the lender for purposes of this reporting requirement and is the party required to report with respect to events occurring after the date he acquires the loan. This rule applies to all subsequent holders of a secured loan, including governmental units or any agencies or instrumentalities thereof. For example, if the Federal National Mortgage Association purchases real property loans from a lender, it would be subject to the reporting requirement.

# Multiple Lenders
Q-23: If more than one person lends money secured by the same property, and one lender forecloses upon or otherwise acquires an interest in the property, must the other lenders report under this section?
A-23: Yes. In these circumstances, other lenders must report if they know or have reason to know that the property securing their loans is foreclosed upon or otherwise acquired by another lender and the sale or other acquisition terminates, reduces, or otherwise impairs their security interests in the property (see A-15). For example, if there is a first and second mortgage on a building, and the second mortgagee knows or has reason to know that the first mortgagee has foreclosed upon the building, the second mortgagee is subject to the reporting requirement even if no part of the indebtedness owed to him is satisfied by the proceeds of the foreclosure sale. For a description of the reporting requirement applicable to the first mortgagee, see A-10 and A-15.
Q-24: If more than one person lends money secured by property, and one lender knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned, must each lender report under this section?
A-24: No. Each lender is required to report only when he knows or has reason to know that property has been abandoned (see A-19).

# Form and Manner of Return

# Form of Return
Q-25: What form shall be used to make a return required by section 6050J?
A-25: Except as provided in A-35, the return must be made on Forms 1096 and 1099. The person required to make the return, however, may prepare and use a form which
contains provisions substantially similar with those of Forms 1096 and 1099 if the person complies with any revenue procedures relating to substitute Forms 1096 and 1099 in effect at that time.

# Information Included on Return
Q-26: What information must be included on a return required by reason of an acquisition of an interest in property that is security for a loan?
A-26: The following information must be included on the return:
(a) The name and address of the borrower with respect to the secured indebtedness;
(b) The borrower's TIN, as defined in Section 7701(a);
(c) A general description of the property in which an interest is acquired;
(d) Whether the borrower is personally liable for repayment of the indebtedness;
(e) The date on which the person acquired an interest in the property (see A-10 or A-15);
(f) The amount of the indebtedness outstanding at the time the interest in property is acquired;
(g) If the borrower is personally liable for repayment of the indebtedness, the fair market value of the property at the time the interest is acquired;
(h) The amount of the indebtedness satisfied by the acquisition; and
(i) Any other information as may be required by Forms 1096 and 1099.
Q-27: What information must be included on a return required because a person knows or has reason to know that property which is security for a loan has been abandoned?
A-27: The following information must be included on the return:
(a) The information required in A-26 (a), (b), and (d);
(b) A general description of the property abandoned;
(c) The date on which the person first knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned;
(d) The amount of the indebtedness outstanding as of the date on which the person first knows or has reason to know that the property has been abandoned;
(e) If the borrower is personally liable for repayment of the indebtedness, the fair market value of the property at the time of abandonment; and
(f) Any other information as may be required by Forms 1096 and 1099.

# Partnership Borrower
Q-28: If a borrower is a partnership, must the TIN of each partner be reported?
A-28: No. If a borrower is a partnership, only the TIN of the partnership must be reported.

# Multiple Borrowers
Q-29: If there is more than one borrower on a single secured loan, must a person required to report under this section make a return with respect to each borrower on the loan?
A-29: Yes. Generally, a separate return must be made with respect to each borrower on a secured loan. However, only one report is required if the lender knows that the borrowers hold property as tenants by the entirety or that the property is held as community property.

# General Description of Property
Q-30: What type of information constitutes a general description of the property?
A-30: A general description of the property consists of information that sufficiently identifies the property. In the case of real property, a general description consists of the property's address unless this information is not available or would not sufficiently identify the property, in which case a legal description (
i.e.,
section, lot, block) must be provided instead. A general description of personal property consists of the type, make and model (where applicable) of the property. For example, an automobile would be described as “Car—1983 Pontiac Firebird.” However, in the case of a single loan secured by more than one piece of personal property, a general description consists of the type or category of the pieces acquired or abandoned. For example, if the security for a single loan is six desks and seven typewriters, a general description of the property would be “Office Equipment.”

# Multiple Acquisitions and Abandonments
Q-31: Must each acquisition and abandonment that occurs in a taxable year be reported on a separate return?
A-31: Generally, each acquisition and abandonment required to be reported by a person for a taxable year must be reported on a separate return. However, in the case of a single loan secured by more than one piece of property, separate returns will not be required when a person acquires an interest in, or knows or has reason to know of the abandonment of, more than one piece of property that is security for the single loan in a taxable year. Instead, the person shall make one return for all of the acquisitions and one return for all of the abandonments of property that are security for the loan for a taxable year.

# Fair Market Value
Q-32: In the case of a foreclosure, execution, or similar sale, what is the fair market value of the property for purposes of the reporting requirement?
A-32: In general, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the proceeds of the foreclosure, execution, or
similar sale will be considered the fair market value of the property for purposes of this reporting requirement.

# Time for Filing
Q-33: When must a person file the return or returns required by section 6050J with the Internal Revenue Service?
A-33: The return or returns must be filed on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the year following the calendar year in which the acquisition of an interest in the property occurs or in which the lender knows or has reason to know of the abandonment of the property.

# Place for Filing
Q-34: Where must the return or returns be filed?
A-34: The return or returns must be filed with the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for the Form 1099 series.

# Use of Magnetic Media
Q-35: What rules apply with respect to the use of magnetic media?
A-35: Any return required under section 6050J must be filed on magnetic media to the extent required by section 6011(e). Any person not required by section 6011(e) to file returns under section 6050J on magnetic media may request permission to do so. See § 1.9101 for rules relating to permission to submit information on magnetic tape or other media. If a person required to file returns on magnetic media fails to do so, the penalty under section 6652 (failure to file an information return) applies.

# Requirement of Furnishing Statements to Borrowers

# In General
Q-36: What statements must be furnished to borrowers?
A-36: Any person required to make an information return under section 6050J must furnish a statement to each borrower whose name is required to be set forth in a return filed with the Internal Revenue Service. For the date when the statement must be furnished, see A-40.
Q-37: Is the statement considered to be furnished to the borrower if it is mailed to the borrower at the borrower's last known address?
A-37: Yes.

# Information Included on Statement
Q-38: What information must be included on the statement?
A-38: The statement must include the following information:
(a) Except in the case where the return is made on behalf of a governmental unit (or any agency or instrumentality thereof), the name and address of the person required to make the information return;
(b) In the case where the return is made on behalf of a governmental unit or any agency or instrumentality thereof, the name and address of such unit, agency or instrumentality;
(c) The information required under A-26 or A-27, whichever is applicable; and
(d) A legend stating that the information is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service.

# Copy of Form 1099 to Borrowers
Q-39: May the requirement of furnishing a statement be met by furnishing a copy of the Form 1099 filed with respect to that borrower?
A-39: Yes. The requirement of furnishing a statement may be met by furnishing to the borrower a copy of the Form 1099 containing the same information filed with the Service with respect to that borrower, or a reasonable facsimile thereof, provided that the form or the reasonable facsimile bears a legend stating that the information is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service.

# Time of Furnishing Statement
Q-40: When is a statement required to be furnished to the borrower?
A-40: A statement is required to be furnished to the borrower on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the acquisition or abandonment of property occurs.

# Multiple Borrowers
Q-41: If a person required to report under this section must make an information return with respect to more than one borrower on a single loan, of an interest in the property occurs or in which the lender knows or has reason to know of the abandonment of the property.
A-41: Yes. A separate statement must be furnished to each borrower with respect to which a separate return is required under section 6050J.

# Extensions of Time

Returns relating to sales or exchanges of certain partnership interests.
(a)
Partnership return required

A partnership that is in doubt as to whether partnership property constitutes section 751 property to any extent or as to whether a transfer of a partnership interest constitutes a section 751(a) exchange may file Form 8308 in order to avoid the risk of incurring a penalty under section 6721. The penalty under section 6721 will generally apply, however, to partnerships that do not file Form 8308 where in fact a section 751(a) exchange occurred, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (e) of this section.
(2)
Return required under section 6045.
No return shall be required under section 6050K(a) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to the sale or exchange of a partnership interest if a return is required to be filed under section 6045 with respect to such sale or exchange.
(3)
Single or composite documents.
The Commissioner may authorize the use, at the option of the partnership, of a single document which includes all of the partnership's returns for a calendar year in the case of partnerships required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to make 25 or more returns on Form 8308 for any calendar year. In addition, the Commissioner may authorize the use for this purpose, also at the option of such a partnership, of a composite document. These authorizations shall be subject to such conditions, limitations, and special rules governing the preparation, execution, filing, and correction thereof as the Commissioner may deem appropriate. Such composite document shall consist of a form prescribed by the Commissioner and an attachment or attachments of magnetic tape or other approved media. To the extent that the use of a single or composite document has been authorized by the Commissioner, references in this section to Form 8303 shall be deemed to refer also to returns included in a single or composite document under this paragraph (a)(3). Any single or composite document so authorized shall include the information required to be provided on Form 8308 under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to each section 751(a) exchange.

The term “transferee” means the beneficial owner of a partnership interest immediately after the transfer of that interest.

Statement to be furnished to transferor and transferee.
Every partnership required to file a return under paragraph (a) of this section must furnish to each person whose name is required to be set forth in such return a written statement on or before January 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the section 751(a) exchange occurred to which the return under paragraph (a) relates (or, if later, 30 days after the partnership is notified of the exchange as defined in paragraph (e) of this section). The partnership shall use a copy of the completed Form 8308 as a statement unless the Form 8308 contains information with respect to more than one section 751(a) exchange (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section). If the partnership does not use a copy of Form 8308 as a statement, the statement shall include the information required to be shown on Form 8308 with respect to the section 751(a) exchange to which the person to whom the statement is furnished is a party. In addition, it shall state that—
(i) The information shown on the statement has been supplied to the Internal Revenue Service,
(ii) A transferor of a partnership interest in a sale or exchange described in section 751(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is required to treat a portion of any gain or loss resulting from the sale or exchange as ordinary income or loss, and
(iii) The transferor in a section 751(a) sale or exchange is required under paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.751-1 to attach a statement relating to the sale or exchange to his or her income tax return for the taxable year in which the sale or exchange occurred.

(3)
Transfers of partnership interests by foreign persons.
For additional information required to be provided by the partnership if section 864(c)(8) applies to the transfer of a partnership interest by a foreign person, see § 1.864(c)(8)-2(b).
(d)
Requirement that transferor notify partnership
—(1)
In general.
The transferor of any partnership interest in a section 751(a) exchange shall notify the partnership of such exchange in writing within 30 days of the exchange (or, if earlier, January 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the exchange occurred). The written notification from the transferor shall include the following information:
(i) The names and addresses of the transferor and transferee in the section 751(a) exchange;
(ii) The taxpayer identification numbers of the transferor and, if known, of the transferee; and
(iii) The date of the exchange.
Any transferor who notified a partnership under section 6050K(c)(1) prior to January 22, 1986 by a notification that does not meet the requirements of this paragraph (d) shall furnish such partnership with the written notification described in this paragraph (d) on or before February 21, 1986.
(2)
Return required under section 6045.
No transferor shall be required to notify a partnership of the sale or exchange of a partnership interest under section 6050K(c)(1) or paragraph (d)(1) of this section if a return is required to be filed under section 6045 with respect to such sale or exchange.

Transfers of partnership interests by foreign persons.
For notifications required by foreign transferors of partnership interests, see § 1.864(c)(8)-2(a).

Partnership not required to make a return or furnish statements under this section until it has notice of the exchange.
A partnership shall not be required to make a return or furnish statements under section 6050K and this section with respect to any section 751(a) exchange until it has been notified of the exchange. For purposes of section 6050K(c)(2) and this section, a partnership is notified of a section 751(a) exchange when either:
(1) The partnership receives the written notification from the transferor required under paragraph (d) of this section; or
(2) The partnership has knowledge that there has been a transfer of a partnership interest or any portion thereof, and, at the time of the transfer, the partnership had any section 751 property. However, no return or statements are required under section 6050K if the transfer was not a section 751(a) exchange (e.g., a transfer which in its entirety constitutes a gift for federal income tax purposes). For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2), the partnership may rely on a written statement from the transferor that the transfer was not a section 751(a) exchange in the absence of knowledge to the contrary. For rules applicable where the partnership is in doubt as to whether partnership property constitutes section 751 property to any extent or as to whether a transfer of a partnership interest constitutes a section 751(a) exchange, see paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

are defined in sections 7701(a) (1) and (41), respectively.
(c)
Exceptions to information reporting requirement
—(1)
General exceptions.
The following do not need to be reported pursuant to this section:
(i) Any contract or contract action for which the amount obligated is $25,000 or less;
(ii) Any contract with a contractor who, in making the agreement, is acting in his or her capacity as an employee of a Federal executive agency (e.g., any contract of employment under which the employee is paid wages subject to the withholding provisions contained in chapter 24 of subtitle C);
(iii) Any contract between a Federal executive agency and another Federal governmental unit (or any agency or instrumentality thereof);
(iv) Any contract with a foreign government (or any agency or instrumentality thereof);
(v) Any contract with a state or local governmental unit (or any agency or instrumentality thereof);
(vi) Any contract with a person who is not required to have a TIN (see, for example, § 301.6109-1(g));
(vii) Any contract the terms of which provide that all amounts payable under the contract by any Federal executive agency will be paid on or before the 120th day following the date of the contract action, and for which it is reasonable to except that all amounts will be so paid.
(viii) Any contract under which all money (or other property) that will be received by the contractor after the 120th day after the date of the contract action will come from persons other than a Federal executive agency or an agent of such an agency (e.g., a contract under which the contractor will collect amounts owed to a Federal executive agency by the agency's debtor and will remit to the agency the money collected less an amount that serves as the contractor's consideration under the contract).
(ix) Any contract for which the Commissioner determines that the information described in paragraph (a) of this section will not facilitate the collection of Federal tax liabilities because of the manner, method, or timing of payment by the agency under that contract.
(2)
Special rule for certain classified or confidential contracts.
Contracts described in section 6050M(e)(3), relating to certain classified or confidential contracts, are to be reported only in accordance with section 6050M(e)(2).
(d)
Filing requirements
—(1)
Frequency and time for filing.
The information returns required by this section with respect to contracts of a Federal executive agency entered into on or after January 1, 1989, must be filed on a quarterly basis for the calendar quarters ending on the last day of March, June, September, and December. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) of
this section, the returns for contracts entered into during a calendar quarter must be filed on or before the last day of the month following that quarter. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, returns filed before May 7, 1990, will be considered timely filed.
(2)
Form of reporting
—(i)
General rule concerning electronic filing.
The information returns required by this section with respect to contracts of a Federal executive agency for each calendar quarter must be made in one submission (or in multiple submissions if permitted by paragraph (d)(4) of this section). Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the required returns must be made in electronic form (within the meaning of § 301.6011-2(a)(1) of this chapter) in accordance with any applicable revenue procedure or other guidance promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service for the filing of such returns under section 6050M.
(ii)
Exceptions from electronic filing.
Any Federal executive agency that, on October 1, has a reasonable expectation of entering into, during the one-year period beginning on that date, fewer than 10 contracts subject to the reporting requirements under this section that are to be filed during the calendar years after 2023, may make the information returns required by this section for each quarter of that one-year period on the prescribed paper Form 8596 in accordance with the instructions accompanying such form.
(iii)
Exclusions from electronic-filing requirements
—(A)
Waivers.
The Commissioner may grant waivers of the requirements of this section in cases of undue hardship. One principal factor in determining hardship will be the amount, if any, by which the cost of filing the return electronically in accordance with this section exceeds the cost of filing the return on paper. A request for a waiver must be made in accordance with applicable IRS revenue procedures, publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, including postings to the
IRS.gov
website. The waiver request will specify the type of filing (that is, a return required under paragraph (a) of this section) and the period to which it applies.
(B)
Exemptions.
The Commissioner may provide exemptions from the requirements of this section to promote effective and efficient tax administration. A submission claiming an exemption must be made in accordance with applicable IRS revenue procedures, publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, including postings to the
IRS.gov
website.
(3)
Place of filing
—(i)
Returns in electronic form.
Information returns made under this section in electronic form must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with any applicable revenue procedure or other guidance promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service relating to the filing of returns under section 6050M.
(ii)
Form 8596.
Information returns made on paper Form 8596 must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at the location specified in the instructions for that form.
(4)
Special rule concerning multiple returns.
To the extent permitted in any revenue procedure or other guidance relating to the filing of information returns under this section, a Federal executive agency which files information returns under this section on magnetic media may make more than one magnetic media submission for any quarter, if each submission for that quarter contains all of the information required by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to contracts entered into by one or more departments, branches, bureaus, agencies, or other readily identifiable operating functions (such as a geographic region) of the Federal executive agency.
(5)
Special rules for agencies reporting to the Federal Procurement Data Center
—(i)
Election to have the Director of the Federal Procurement Data Center make returns on behalf of agency.
If, in complying with the requirements of the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) (as established under the authority of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 401
et seq.
), a Federal executive agency is required to submit to the Federal Procurement Data Center (FPDC) all the information with respect to one or more contracts required to be reported by paragraph (a) of this section, that Federal executive agency may, in lieu of making returns directly to the Internal Revenue Service with
respect to those contracts, elect to have the Director of the FPDC (or his or her delegate) make the required returns with respect to all of those contracts on its behalf. In order to make this election for such contracts entered into during a calendar quarter, the head of a Federal executive agency (or his or her delegate) shall attach to its submission to the FPDC for that quarter a signed statement to the effect that:
(A) The Director of the FPDC (or his or her delegate) is authorized, in accordance with an election made under 26 CFR 1.6050M-1(d)(5) to make, on the agency's behalf, the required returns for such contracts for that quarter, and
(B) Under the penalties of perjury, such official has examined the information to be submitted by the agency to the FPDC for making those returns and certifies that information to be, to the best of such official's knowledge and belief, a compilation of agency records maintained in the normal course of business for the purpose of providing the information necessary for making true, correct, and complete returns as required by section 6050M.
If the election is made, the Director of the FPDC (or his or her delegate) shall, on the electing agency's behalf, make the returns required by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the contracts to which the election applies.
(ii)
Time, manner, and place of filing.
The Director of the FPDC (or his or her delegate) must—
(A) Make the required returns for a quarter on or before the earlier of;
(
1
) 45 days following the date that the contract information is required to be submitted to the FPDC, or
(
2
) 90 days following the end of the calendar quarter for which the election is made, except that, if that calendar quarter ends September 30, 105 days following the end of that quarter, and
(B) Comply with paragraph (d)(2)(i) and (3)(i) of this section, relating to form and place of filing.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, returns made before May 7, 1990, will be considered timely filed.
(iii)
Contracts reported directly to the Internal Revenue Service.
Even if the election is made, all information with respect to any particular contract required to be reported under paragraph (a) of this section must be reported directly to the Internal Revenue Service by the electing agency if the FPDS does not require that information to be submitted to the FPDC. An electing agency shall not, however, make direct returns to the Internal Revenue Service of contract information that is subject to the election.
(6)
Certification of return
—(i)
Returns made directly with the Internal Revenue Service.
Each return made under this section by a Federal executive agency directly with the Internal Revenue Service on magnetic media or on Forms 8596 and 8596-A shall be signed by the head of the Federal executive agency (or his or her delegate) under the penalties of perjury, certifying that such official has examined the return, that it is prepared pursuant to the requirements of section 6050M and that, to the best of such official's knowledge and belief, it is compiled from agency records maintained in the normal course of business for the purpose of making a true, correct, and complete return as required by section 6050M.
(ii)
Returns made by Director of FPDC on agency's behalf.
Each return made under this section by the Director of the FPDC on behalf of a Federal executive agency shall be signed by the Director of the FPDC (or his or her delegate) under the penalties of perjury, certifying that such official has examined the return, that it is prepared pursuant to the requirements of section 6050M and that, to the best of such official's knowledge and belief, it is compiled from information submitted by the Federal executive agency to the FPDC pursuant to § 1.6050M-1(d)(5)(i) for the purpose of making a true, correct, and complete return as required by section 6050M.
(e)
Special rules relating to increases in amount obligated.
If, through the exercise of an option contained in a basic or initial contract or under any other rule of contract law, express or implied, the amount of money or other property obligated under the contract is increased by more than $25,000 in one contract action, then that action shall be treated as the entering into of a new
contract with respect to which the information required by paragraph (a) of this section is to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar quarter in which the increase occurs.
(f)
Applicability date
—(1)
Contracts required to be reported.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f), this section applies to each Federal executive agency with respect to its contracts entered into on or after January 1, 1989 (including any increase in amount obligated on or after January 1, 1989, that is treated as a new contract under paragraph (e) of this section).
(2)
Contracts not required to be reported.
A Federal executive agency is not required to report—
(i) Any basic or initial contract entered into before January 1, 1989,
(ii) Any increase contract action occurring before January 1, 1989, that is treated as a new contract under paragraph (e) of this section, or
(iii) Any increase contract action that is treated as a new contract under paragraph (e) of this section if the basic or initial contract to which that contract action relates was entered into before January 1, 1989, and—
(A) The increase occurs before April 1, 1990, or
(B) The amount of the increase does not exceed $50,000.
(3)
Illustration.
(i) If a Federal executive agency enters into an initial contract on December 1, 1988, and the amount of money obligated under the contract is increased by $55,000 on April 15, 1990, then there is no reporting requirement with respect to the contract when entered into on December 1, 1988. However, the April 15, 1990, increase, which is treated as a new contract under paragraph (e) of this section, is subject to the reporting requirements of this section because it is considered to be a new contract entered into on April 15, 1990.
(ii) If the $55,000 increase had occurred before April 1, 1990, there would not have been a reporting requirement with respect to that increase.
(4)
Filing requirements for contracts required to be reported.
Section 1.6050M-1(d)(2) and (3) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised
February 23, 2023
) applies to information returns required to be filed during calendar years beginning after December 31, 2023.
[T.D. 8275, 54 FR 50369, Dec. 6, 1989; 55 FR 13522, Apr. 11, 1990; T.D. 9972, 88 FR 11765, Feb. 23, 2023]
§ 1.6050N-1
Statements to recipients of royalties paid after December 31, 1986.
(a)
Requirement.
A person required to make an information return under section 6050N(a) must furnish a statement to each recipient whose name is required to be shown on the related information return for royalties paid.
(b)
Form, manner, and time for providing statements to recipients.
The statement required by paragraph (a) of this section must be either the official Form 1099 prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for the respective calendar year or an acceptable substitute statement. The rules under § 1.6042-4 (relating to statements with respect to dividends) apply comparably in determining the form of the acceptable substitute statement permitted by this section. Those rules also apply for purposes of determining the manner of and time for providing the Form 1099 or its acceptable substitute statement to a recipient under this section. An IRS truncated taxpayer identifying number (TTIN) may be used as the identifying number of the recipient. For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see § 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).
(c)
Exempted foreign-related items
—(1)
In general.
No return shall be required under paragraph (a) of this section for payments of the items described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) Returns of information are not required for payments of royalties that a payor can, prior to payment, associate with documentation upon which it may rely to treat as made to a foreign beneficial owner in accordance with § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) or as made to a foreign payee in accordance with § 1.6049-5(d)(1) or presumed to be made to a foreign payee under § 1.6049-5(d)(2), (3), (4), or (5). However, such payments may be reportable under § 1.1461-1(b) and (c).
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i), the provisions in § 1.6049-5(c)
(regarding rules applicable to documentation of foreign status and definition of U.S. payor and non-U.S. payor) shall apply. See § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(B) and (C) for special payee rules regarding scholarships, grants, pensions, annuities, etc. The provisions of § 1.1441-1 shall apply by substituting the term
payor
for the term
withholding agent
and without regard to the fact that the provisions apply only to amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(ii) Returns of information are not required for payments of royalties from sources outside the United States paid by a non-U.S. payor or non-U.S. middleman and that are paid and received outside the United States. For a definition of non-U.S. payor or non-U.S. middleman, see § 1.6049-5(c)(5). For circumstances in which a payment is considered to be paid and received outside the United States, see § 1.6049-4(f)(16).
(iii) Returns of information are not required for payments made by a foreign intermediary described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(i) that it has received in its capacity as an intermediary and that are associated with a valid withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii) or (iii) and payments made by a U.S. branch of a foreign bank or of a foreign insurance company described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) that are associated with a valid withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v), which certificate the intermediary or branch has furnished to the payor or middleman from whom it has received the payment, unless, and to the extent, the intermediary or branch knows that the payments are required to be reported and were not so reported.
(2)
Definitions
—(i)
Payor.
For purposes of this section, the term
payor
shall have the meaning ascribed to it under § 1.6049-4(a).
(ii)
Joint owners.
Amounts paid to joint owners for which a certificate or documentation is required as a condition for being exempt from reporting under this paragraph (c) of this section are presumed made to U.S. payees who are not exempt recipients if, prior to payment, the payor cannot reliably associate the payment either with a Form W-9 furnished by one of the joint owners in the manner required in §§ 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5 of this chapter, or with documentation described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section furnished by each joint owner upon which it can rely to treat each joint owner as a foreign payee or foreign beneficial owner. For purposes of applying this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), the grace period described in § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) shall apply only if each payee qualifies for such grace period.
(d)
Cross-reference to penalties.
For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to file timely a correct information return required under section 6050N(a), see § 301.6721-1 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations). For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to furnish timely a correct payee statement required under section 6050N(b) and § 1.6050N-1(a), see § 301.6722-1 of this chapter. See § 301.6724-1 of this chapter for the waiver of a penalty if the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to payee statements due after December 31, 2014, without regard to extensions. For payee statements due before January 1, 2015, § 1.6050N-1 (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) shall apply.

§ 1.6050P-1
Information reporting for discharges of indebtedness by certain entities.
(a)
Reporting requirement
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, any applicable entity (as defined in section 6050P(c)(1)) that discharges an indebtedness of any person (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(1)) of at least $600 during a calendar year must file an information return on Form 1099-C with the Internal Revenue Service. Solely for purposes of the reporting requirements of section 6050P and this section, a discharge of indebtedness is deemed to have occurred, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if and only if there has occurred an identifiable event described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, whether or not an actual discharge of indebtedness has occurred on or before the date on which the identifiable event has occurred. The return must include the following information—
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN), as defined in section 7701(a)(41), of each person for which there was an identifiable event during the calendar year;
(ii) The date on which the identifiable event occurred, as described in paragraph (b) of this section;
(iii) The amount of indebtedness discharged, as described in paragraph (c) of this section;
(iv) An indication whether the identifiable event was a discharge of indebtedness in a bankruptcy, if known; and
(v) Any other information required by Form 1099-C or its instructions, or current revenue procedures.
(2)
No aggregation.
For purposes of reporting under this section, multiple discharges of indebtedness of less than $600 are not required to be aggregated unless such separate discharges are pursuant to a plan to evade the reporting requirements of this section.
(3)
Amounts not includible in income.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, discharged indebtedness must be reported regardless of whether the debtor is subject to tax on the discharged debt under sections 61 and 108 or otherwise by applicable law.
(4)
Time and place for reporting—
(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, returns required by this section must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service office designated in the instructions for Form 1099-C on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the year following the calendar year in which the identifiable event occurs.
(ii)
Indebtedness discharged in bankruptcy.
Indebtedness discharged in bankruptcy that is required to be reported under this section must be reported for the later of the calendar year in which the amount of discharged indebtedness first becomes ascertainable, or the calendar year in which the identifiable event occurs.
(b)
Date of discharge
—(1)
In general.
Solely for purposes of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, indebtedness is discharged on the date of the occurrence of an identifiable event specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2)
Identifiable events
—(i)
In general.
An identifiable event is—
(A) A discharge of indebtedness under title 11 of the United States Code (bankruptcy);
(B) A cancellation or extinguishment of an indebtedness that renders a debt unenforceable in a receivership, foreclosure, or similar proceeding in a federal or State court, as described in section 368(a)(3)(A)(ii) (other than a discharge described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section);
(C) A cancellation or extinguishment of an indebtedness upon the expiration of the statute of limitations for collection of an indebtedness, subject to the limitations described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, or upon the expiration of a statutory period for filing a claim or commencing a deficiency judgment proceeding;
(D) A cancellation or extinguishment of an indebtedness pursuant to an election of foreclosure remedies by a creditor that statutorily extinguishes or bars the creditor's right to pursue collection of the indebtedness;
(E) A cancellation or extinguishment of an indebtedness that renders a debt unenforceable pursuant to a probate or similar proceeding;
(F) A discharge of indebtedness pursuant to an agreement between an applicable entity and a debtor to discharge indebtedness at less than full consideration; or
(G) A discharge of indebtedness pursuant to a decision by the creditor, or the application of a defined policy of the creditor, to discontinue collection activity and discharge debt. or
(ii)
Statute of limitations.
In the case of an expiration of the statute of limitations for collection of an indebtedness, an identifiable event occurs under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section only if, and at such time as, a debtor's affirmative statute of limitations defense is upheld in a final judgment or decision of a judicial proceeding, and the period for appealing the judgment or decision has expired.
(iii)
Decision to discontinue collection activity; creditor's defined policy.
For purposes of the identifiable event described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(G) of this section, a creditor's defined policy includes both a written policy of the creditor and the creditor's established business practice. Thus, for example, a creditor's established practice to discontinue collection activity and abandon debts upon expiration of a particular non-payment period is considered a defined policy for purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(G) of this section.
(3)
Permitted reporting.
If a discharge of indebtedness occurs before the date on which an identifiable event occurs, the discharge may, at the creditor's discretion, be reported under this section.
(c)
Indebtedness.
For purposes of this section and § 1.6050P-2, indebtedness
means any amount owed to an applicable entity, including stated principal, fees, stated interest, penalties, administrative costs and fines. The amount of indebtedness discharged may represent all, or only a part, of the total amount owed to the applicable entity.
(d)
Exceptions from reporting requirement
—(1)
Certain bankruptcy discharges
—(i)
In general.
Reporting is required under this section in the case of a discharge of indebtedness in bankruptcy only if the creditor knows from information included in the reporting entity's books and records pertaining to the indebtedness that the debt was incurred for business or investment purposes as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Business or investment debt.
Indebtedness is considered incurred for business purposes if it is incurred in connection with the conduct of any trade or business other than the trade or business of performing services as an employee. Indebtedness is considered incurred for investment purposes if it is incurred to purchase property held for investment, as defined in section 163(d)(5).
(2)
Interest.
The discharge of an amount of indebtedness that is interest is not required to be reported under this section.
(3)
Non-principal amounts in lending transactions.
In the case of a lending transaction, the discharge of an amount other than stated principal is not required to be reported under this section. For this purpose, a lending transaction is any transaction in which a lender loans money to, or makes advances on behalf of, a borrower (including revolving credits and lines of credit).
(4)
Indebtedness of foreign debtors held by foreign branches of U.S. financial institutions
—(i)
Reporting requirements.
[Reserved]
(ii)
Definition.
An indebtedness held by a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution is described in this paragraph (d)(4) only if—
(A) The financial institution is engaged through a branch or office in the active conduct of a banking or similar business outside the United States;
(B) The branch or office is a permanent place of business that is regularly maintained, occupied, and used to carry on a banking or similar financial business;
(C) The business is conducted by at least one employee of the branch or office who is regularly in attendance at such place of business during normal working hours;
(D) The indebtedness is extended outside of the United States by the branch or office in connection with that trade or business; and
(E) The financial institution does not know or have reason to know that the debtor is a United States person.
(5)
Acquisition of indebtedness by related party.
No reporting is required under this section in the case of a deemed discharge of indebtedness under section 108(e)(4) (relating to the acquisition of an indebtedness by a person related to the debtor), unless the disposition of the indebtedness by the creditor was made with a view to avoiding the reporting requirements of this section.
(6)
Releases.
The release of a co-obligor is not required to be reported under this section if the remaining debtors remain liable for the full amount of any unpaid indebtedness.
(7)
Guarantors and sureties.
Solely for purposes of the reporting requirements of this section, a guarantor is not a debtor. Thus, in the case of guaranteed indebtedness, reporting under this section is not required with respect to a guarantor, whether or not there has been a default and demand for payment made upon the guarantor.
(e)
Additional rules
—(1)
Multiple debtors
—(i)
In general.
In the case of indebtedness of $10,000 or more incurred on or after January 1, 1995, that involves more than one debtor, a reporting entity is subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for each debtor discharged from such indebtedness. In the case of indebtedness incurred prior to January 1, 1995, and indebtedness of less than $10,000 incurred on or after January 1, 1995, involving multiple debtors, reporting under this section is required only with respect to the primary (or first-named) debtor. Additionally, only one return of information is required under this section if
the reporting entity knows, or has reason to know, that co-obligors were husband and wife living at the same address when an indebtedness was incurred, and does not know or have reason to know that such circumstances have changed at the date of a discharge of the indebtedness. This paragraph (e)(1) applies to discharges of indebtedness after December 31, 1994.
(ii)
Amount to be reported.
In the case of multiple debtors jointly and severally liable on an indebtedness, the amount of discharged indebtedness required to be reported under this section with respect to each debtor is the total amount of indebtedness discharged. For this purpose, multiple debtors are presumed to be jointly and severally liable on an indebtedness in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
(2)
Multiple creditors
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(2), if indebtedness is owned (or treated as owned for federal income tax purposes) by more than one creditor, each creditor that is an applicable entity must comply with the reporting requirements of this section with respect to any discharge of indebtedness of $600 or more allocable to such creditor. A creditor will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this section if a lead bank, fund administrator, or other designee of the creditor complies on its behalf in any reasonable manner, such as by filing a single return reporting the aggregate amount of indebtedness discharged, or by filing a return with respect to the portion of the discharged indebtedness allocable to the creditor. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(i), any reasonable method may be used to determine the portion of discharged indebtedness allocable to each creditor.
(ii)
Partnerships.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, indebtedness owned by a partnership is treated as owned by the partners.
(iii)
Pass-through securitized indebtedness arrangement
—(A)
Reporting requirements.
[Reserved]
(B)
Definition.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii), a pass-through securitized indebtedness arrangement is any arrangement whereby one or more debt obligations are pooled and held for twenty or more persons whose interests in the debt obligations are undivided co-ownership interests that are freely transferrable. Co-ownership interests that are actively traded personal property (as defined in § 1.1092(d)-1) are presumed to be freely transferrable and held by twenty or more persons.
(iv)
REMICs.
[Reserved]
(v)
No double reporting.
If multiple creditors are considered to hold interests in an indebtedness for purposes of this paragraph (e)(2) by virtue of holding ownership interests in an entity, and the entity is required to report a discharge of that indebtedness under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, then the multiple creditors are not required to report the discharge of indebtedness.
(3)
Coordination with reporting under section 6050J.
If, in the same calendar year, a discharge of indebtedness reportable under section 6050P occurs in connection with a transaction also reportable under section 6050J (relating to foreclosures and abandonments of secured property), an applicable entity need not file both a Form 1099-A and a Form 1099-C with respect to the same debtor. The filing requirements of section 6050J will be satisfied with respect to a borrower if, in lieu of filing Form 1099-A, a Form 1099-C is filed in accordance with the instructions for the filing of that form. This paragraph (e)(3) applies to discharges of indebtedness after December 31, 1994.
(4)
Direct or indirect subsidiary.
For purposes of section 6050P(c)(2)(C), the term direct or indirect subsidiary means a corporation in a chain of corporations beginning with an entity described in section 6050P(c)(2)(A), if at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or at least 50 percent of the total value of all classes of stock, of such corporation is directly owned by the entity described in section 6050P(c)(2)(A), or by one or more other corporations in the chain.
(5)
Entity formed or availed of to hold indebtedness.
Notwithstanding § 1.6050P-2(b)(3), if an entity (the transferee entity) is formed or availed of by an applicable entity (within the meaning of section 6050P(c)(1)) for the principal
purpose of holding indebtedness acquired (including originated) by the applicable entity, then, for purposes of section 6050P(c)(2)(D), the transferee entity has a significant trade or business of lending money.
(6)
Use of magnetic media.
Any return required under this section must be filed on magnetic media to the extent required by section 6011(e) and the regulations thereunder. A failure to file on magnetic media when required constitutes a failure to file an information return under section 6721. Any person not required by section 6011(e) to file returns on magnetic media may request permission to do so under applicable regulations and revenue procedures.
(7)
TIN solicitation requirement
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of reporting under this section, a reasonable effort must be made to obtain the correct name/taxpayer identification number (TIN) combination of a person whose indebtedness is discharged. A TIN obtained at the time an indebtedness is incurred satisfies the requirement of this section, unless the entity required to file knows that such TIN is incorrect. If the TIN is not obtained prior to the occurrence of an identifiable event, it must be requested of the debtor for purposes of satisfying the requirement of this paragraph (e)(7).
(ii)
Manner of soliciting TIN.
Solicitations made in the manner described in § 301.6724-1(e)(1)(i) and (2) of this chapter will be deemed to have satisfied the reasonable effort requirement set forth in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section. A TIN solicitation made after the occurrence of an identifiable event must clearly notify the debtor that the Internal Revenue Service requires the debtor to furnish its TIN, and that failure to furnish such TIN may subject the debtor to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. A TIN provided under this section is not required to be certified under penalties of perjury.
(8)
Recordkeeping requirements.
Any applicable entity required to file a return with the Internal Revenue Service under this section must also retain a copy of the return, or have the ability to reconstruct the data required to be included on the return under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for at least four years from the date such return is required to be filed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(9)
No multiple reporting.
If discharged indebtedness is reported under this section, no further reporting under this section is required for the amount so reported, notwithstanding that a subsequent identifiable event occurs with respect to the same amount. Further, no additional reporting or Form 1099-C correction is required if a creditor receives a payment of all or a portion of a discharged indebtedness reported under this section for a prior calendar year.
(f)
Requirement to furnish statement
—(1)
In general.
Any applicable entity required to file a return under this section must furnish to each person whose name is shown on such return a written statement that includes the following information—
(i) The information required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. An IRS truncated taxpayer identifying number (TTIN) may be used as the TIN of the person for whom there was an identifiable event in lieu of the identifying number appearing on the information return filed with the Internal Revenue Service. For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see § 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations);
(ii) The name, address, and TIN of the applicable entity required to file a return under paragraph (a) of this section;
(iii) A legend identifying the statement as important tax information that is being furnished to the Internal Revenue Service; and
(iv) Any other information required by Form 1099-C or its instructions, or current revenue procedures.
(2)
Furnishing copy of Form 1099-C.
The requirement to provide a statement to the debtor will be satisfied if the applicable entity furnishes copy B of the Form 1099-C or a substitute statement that complies with the requirements of the current revenue procedure for substitute Forms 1099.
(3)
Time and place for furnishing statement.
The statement required by this paragraph (f) must be furnished to the debtor on or before January 31 of the
year following the calendar year in which the identifiable event occurs. The statement will be considered furnished to the debtor if it is mailed to the debtor's last known address.
(g)
Penalties.
For penalties for failure to comply with the requirements of this section, see sections 6721 through 6724.
(h)
Applicability dates.
This section applies to information returns required to be filed, and payee statements required to be furnished, after December 31, 2016. Section 1.6050P-1 (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2016) applies to information returns required to be filed, and payee statements required to be furnished, on or before December 31, 2016.
[T.D. 8654, 61 FR 268, Jan. 4, 1996, as amended by T.D. 8895, 65 FR 50408, Aug. 18, 2000; T.D. 9160, 69 FR 62186, Oct. 25, 2004; T.D. 9430, 73 FR 66540, Nov. 10, 2008; T.D. 9461, 74 FR 47728, Sept. 17, 2009; T.D. 9675, 79 FR 41131, July 15, 2014; T.D. 9793, 81 FR 78911, Nov. 10, 2016]
§ 1.6050P-2
Organization a significant trade or business of which is the lending of money.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of section 6050P(c)(2)(D), the lending of money is a significant trade or business of an organization in a calendar year if the organization lends money on a regular and continuing basis during the calendar year.
(b)
Safe harbors
—(1)
Organizations not subject to section 6050P in the previous calendar year.
For an organization that was not required to report under section 6050P in the previous calendar year, the lending of money is not treated as a significant trade or business for the calendar year in which the lending occurs if gross income from lending money (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) in the organization's most recent test year (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) is both less than $5 million and less than 15 percent of the organization's gross income for that test year.
(2)
Organizations that were subject to section 6050P in the previous calendar year.
For an organization that was required to report under section 6050P for the previous calendar year, the lending of money is not treated as a significant trade or business for the calendar year in which the lending occurs if gross income from lending money (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) in each of the organization's three most recent test years is both less than $3 million and less than 10 percent of the organization's gross income for that test year.
(3)
No test year.
The lending of money is not treated as a significant trade or business for an organization for the calendar year in which the lending occurs if the organization does not have a test year for that calendar year.
(c)
Seller financing.
If the principal trade or business of an organization is selling nonfinancial goods or providing nonfinancial services and if the organization extends credit to the purchasers of those goods or services to finance the purchases, then, for purposes of section 6050P(c)(2)(D), these extensions of credit are not a significant trade or business of lending money.
(d)
Gross income from lending of money.
For purposes of this section, gross income from lending of money includes—
(1) Income from interest, including qualified stated interest, original issue discount, and market discount;
(2) Gains arising from the sale or other disposition of indebtedness;
(3) Penalties with respect to indebtedness (whether or not the penalty is interest for Federal tax purposes); and
(4) Fees with respect to indebtedness, including merchant discount or interchange (whether or not the fee is interest for Federal tax purposes).
(e)
Acquisition of an indebtedness from a person other than the debtor included in lending money.
For purposes of this section, lending money includes acquiring an indebtedness not only from the debtor at origination but also from a prior holder of the indebtedness. Gross income arising from indebtedness is gross income from the lending of money without regard to who originated the indebtedness. If an organization acquires an indebtedness, the organization is required to report any cancellation of the indebtedness if the organization is engaged in a significant trade or business of lending money.
(f)
Test year.
For any calendar year, a
test year
is a taxable year of the organization that ends before July 1 of the previous calendar year.
(g)
Predecessor organization.
If an organization acquires substantially all of the property that was used in a trade or business of some other organization (the predecessor) (including when two or more corporations are parties to a merger agreement under which the surviving corporation becomes the owner of the assets and assumes the liabilities of the absorbed corporation(s)) or was used in a separate unit of the predecessor, then whether the organization at issue qualifies for one of the safe harbors in paragraph (b) of this section is determined by also taking into account the test years, reporting obligations, and gross income of the predecessor.
(h)
Examples.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
Finance Company A, a calendar year taxpayer, was formed in Year 1 as a non-bank subsidiary of Manufacturing Company and has no predecessor. A lends money to purchasers of Manufacturing Company's products on a regular and continuing basis to finance the purchase of those products. A's gross income from stated interest in Year 1 is $4.7 million. In Year 1, A's gross income from fees and penalties with respect to the indebtedness is $0.5 million, and A has no other gross income from lending money within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section.
(ii)
Results.
Section 6050P does not require A to report discharges of indebtedness occurring in Years 1 or 2, because A has no test year for those years. Notwithstanding that A lends money in those years on a regular and continuing basis, under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, A does not have a significant trade or business of lending money in those years for purposes of section 6050P(c)(2)(D). However, for Year 3, A's test year is Year 1. A's gross income from lending in Year 1 is not less than $5 million for purposes of the applicable safe harbor of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Because A lends money on a regular and continuing basis and does not meet the applicable safe harbor, section 6050P requires A to report discharges of indebtedness occurring in Year 3.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that A is a division of Manufacturing Company, rather than a separate subsidiary. Manufacturing Company's principal activity is the manufacture and sale of non-financial products, and, other than financing the purchase of those products, Manufacturing Company does not extend credit or otherwise lend money.
(ii)
Results.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, that financing activity is not a significant trade or business of lending money for purposes of section 6050P(c)(2)(D), and section 6050P does not require Manufacturing Company to report discharges of indebtedness.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
Company B, a calendar year taxpayer, is formed in Year 1. B has no predecessor and a part of its activities consists of the lending of money. B packages and sells part of the indebtedness it originates and holds the remainder. B is engaged in these activities on a regular and continuing basis. For Year 1, the sum of B's gross income from sales of the indebtedness, plus other income described in paragraph (d) of this section, is only $4.8 million, but it is 16% of B's gross income in Year 1.
(ii)
Results.
Because B lends money on a regular and continuing basis and does not meet the applicable safe harbor of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, section 6050P requires B to report discharges of indebtedness occurring in Year 3. B is not required to report discharges of indebtedness in Years 1 and 2 because B has no test year for Years 1 and 2.

# Example 4.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3.
In addition, in each of Years 2, 3, and 4, the sum of B's gross income from sales of the indebtedness, plus other income described in paragraph (d) of this section, is less than both $3 million and 10% of B's gross income.
(ii)
Results.
(A) Because B was required to report under section 6050P for Year 3, the applicable safe harbor for Year 4 is paragraph (b)(2) of this section, which is satisfied only if B's gross income from lending activities for each of the three most recent test years is less than both $3 million and 10% of B's gross income. For Year 4, even though B has only two test years, B's gross income in one of those test years, Year 1, causes B to fail to meet this safe harbor. Accordingly, B is required to report discharges of indebtedness under section 6050P in Year 4. For Year 5, B's three most recent test years are Years 1, 2, and 3. However, B's gross income from lending activities in Year 1 is not less than $3 million and 10% of B's gross income. Accordingly, section 6050P requires B to report discharges of indebtedness in Year 5.
(B) For Year 6, B satisfies the applicable safe harbor requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section for each of the three most recent test years (Years 2, 3, and 4). Therefore, section 6050P does not require B to report discharges of indebtedness in Year 6. Because B is not required to report for Year 6, the applicable safe harbor for Year 7 is the one contained in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and thus the only relevant test year is Year 5.

# Example 5.
(i)
Facts.
(A) Company C, a calendar year taxpayer, was formed in Year 1 and, on a regular and continuing basis, enters into the following transactions with its
clients, all of whom are unrelated parties to C. C does not have any other income.
(B) C's clients sell goods to customers, frequently accepting as payment accounts receivable that are due in 30 to 90 days. Under a contract with each client, C investigates the creditworthiness of the client's customers with respect to the prospective sales, and, for each customer, C determines whether, and to what extent, C is willing to assume the risk of loss on accounts receivable to be issued by the customer. C's decision whether to assume risk of loss may be based on an evaluation of the credit quality of particular customers or on the aggregate credit quality of all of the client's prospective customers. If C is unwilling to assume the risk, the client either may refuse to extend any credit to the customer or may accept the account receivable and bear the risk of loss.
(C) Pursuant to some contracts between C's clients and C, C's clients assign legal title to the accounts receivable to C when the accounts receivable are issued by the customers. For these accounts receivable, C agrees to undertake collections and to remit the amounts collected to the client, less a fee of 0.70 percent of the face value of the accounts receivable. Pursuant to other contracts between C's clients and C, C's clients retain legal title to the accounts receivable and retain the initial collection responsibility. For these accounts receivable, C's fee is reduced to 0.35 percent. Both groups of accounts receivable include accounts receivable for which C has assumed the risk of loss and accounts receivable for which C has not assumed the risk of loss.
(D) Based on all the facts and circumstances, C acquires ownership for Federal tax purposes of some, but not all, of the accounts receivable that it has agreed to collect and of some, but not all, of the accounts receivable for which the client has retained collection responsibility.
(E) In Year 1, C's total fee income with respect to accounts receivable of which it acquired tax ownership was $2 million. C's fee income in Year 1 from accounts receivable of which it did not acquire tax ownership was $700,000. C does not have any other income for Year 1.
(F) In Year 3, there were discharges of $950,000, representing $100,000 of customer defaults on those accounts receivable of which C was the owner for Federal tax purposes at the time of the identifiable event marking the discharge and $850,000 of customer defaults on the accounts receivable of which the clients, and not C, were the owner. Whenever C determined the uncollectibility of an account receivable for which it had not assumed the risk of loss, C reassigned title to the account receivable to the appropriate client. Each defaulting customer defaulted on an account receivable with an outstanding balance of at least $600.
(ii)
Results.
(A) For Year 3, C's test year is Year 1. Under paragraph (e) of this section, C's $2 million fee income from the accounts receivable of which it acquired tax ownership is “gross income from lending money” for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, because C was the owner of the accounts for Federal tax purposes. Under paragraph (e) of this section, C's $700,000 fee income from the accounts receivable of which it did not acquire tax ownership is not “gross income from lending money” for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, because C was not the owner of the accounts receivable for Federal tax purposes. In Year 1, therefore, C's gross income from lending money is less than $5 million but is not less than 15% of C's gross income. Because C lends money on a regular and continuing basis and does not meet the applicable safe harbor, section 6050P requires C to report discharges of indebtedness occurring in Year 3.
(B) In Year 3, section 6050P requires C to report the $100,000 of discharges of the accounts receivable of which C was the owner for Federal tax purposes at the time of the identifiable event marking the discharge. Unless an exception to reporting under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section applies, section 6050P requires C's clients to report the $850,000 of discharges of the accounts receivable of which C did not become the owner.
(i)
Effective date.
This section applies to discharges of indebtedness occurring on or after January 1, 2005.

§ 1.6050S-1
Information reporting for qualified tuition and related expenses.
(a)
Information reporting requirement
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, any eligible educational institution (as defined in section 25A(f)(2) and the regulations thereunder) (an institution) that enrolls (as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) any individual for any academic period (as defined in the regulations under section 25A), and any person that is engaged in a trade or business of making payments under an insurance arrangement as reimbursements or refunds (or other similar amounts) of qualified tuition and related expenses (as defined in section 25A(f)(1) and the regulations thereunder) (an insurer) must—
(i) File an information return, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to each individual described in paragraph (b) of this section; and
(ii) Furnish a statement, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, to each individual described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
No reporting by institution or insurer for nonresident alien individuals.
The information reporting requirements of this section do not apply with respect to any individual who is a nonresident alien (as defined in section 7701(b) and § 301.7701(b)-3 of this chapter) during the calendar year, unless the individual requests the institution or insurer to report. If a nonresident alien individual requests an institution or insurer to report, the institution or insurer must comply with the requirements of this section for the calendar year with respect to which the request is made.
(ii)
No reporting by institutions for noncredit courses
—(A)
In general.
The information reporting requirements of this section do not apply with respect to any course for which no academic credit is offered by the institution.
(B)
Academic credit defined. Academic credit
means credit offered by an institution for the completion of course work leading toward a post-secondary degree, certificate, or other recognized post-secondary educational credential.
(C)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii):

Information reporting requirements for institutions that elect to report payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an institution reporting payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses must file an information return with the IRS on Form 1098-T, “Tuition Statement,” with respect to each individual enrolled (as determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) for an academic period beginning during the calendar year or during a prior calendar year and for whom a transaction described in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(C), (E), (F) or (G) of this section is made during the calendar year. An institution may use a substitute Form 1098-T if the substitute form complies with applicable revenue procedures relating to substitute forms (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(ii)
Information included on return.
An institution reporting payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses must include on Form 1098-T—

(J) Any other information required by Form 1098-T and its instructions.
(iii)
Reportable amount of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during calendar year determined.
The amount of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses with respect to an individual during the calendar year that is reportable on Form 1098-T is determined by netting the amount of payments received (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section) for qualified tuition and related expenses during the calendar year against any reimbursements or refunds (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section) made during the calendar year that relate to payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during the same calendar year.
(iv)
Separate reporting of reimbursements or refunds of payments of qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported for a prior calendar year.
An institution must separately report on Form 1098-T any reimbursements or refunds (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section) made during the current calendar year that relate to payments of qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported by the institution for a prior calendar year. Such reimbursements or refunds shall not be netted against the payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during the current calendar year.

Payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses determined.
For purposes of determining the amount of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during a calendar year, payments received with respect to an individual during the calendar year from any source (except for any scholarship or grant that, by its terms, must be applied to expenses other than qualified tuition and related expenses, such as room and board) are treated as payments of qualified tuition and related expenses up to the total amount billed by the institution for such expenses. For purposes of this section, a payment includes any positive account balance (such as any reimbursement or refund credited to an individual's account) that an institution applies toward current charges.
(vi)
Reimbursements or refunds of payments for qualified tuition and related expenses determined.
For purposes of determining the amount of reimbursements or refunds made of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses, any reimbursement or refund
made with respect to an individual during a calendar year (except for any refund of a scholarship or grant that, by its terms, was required to be applied to expenses other than qualified tuition and related expenses, such as room and board) is treated as a reimbursement or refund of payments for qualified tuition and related expenses up to the amount of any reduction in charges for such expenses. For purposes of this section, a reimbursement or refund includes amounts that an institution credits to an individual's account, as well as amounts disbursed to, or on behalf of, the individual.
(vii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules in this paragraph (b)(2):

# Example 1.
(i) In early August 2003, University X bills enrolled Student A $10,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses and $6,000 for room and board for the 2003 Fall semester. In late August 2003, Student A pays $11,000 to University X. In early September 2003, Student A drops to half-time enrollment for the 2003 Fall semester. In late September 2003, University X credits $5,000 to Student A's account, reflecting a $5,000 reduction in charges for qualified tuition and related expenses. In late September 2003, University X applies the $5,000 positive account balance toward current charges.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the $11,000 payment is treated as a payment of qualified tuition and related expenses up to the $10,000 billed for qualified tuition and related expenses. Under paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, the $5,000 credited to the student's account is treated as a reimbursement or refund of payments for qualified tuition and related expenses, because the current year charges for qualified tuition and related expenses were reduced by $5,000. Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, University X is required to net the $10,000 payment received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003 against the $5,000 reimbursement or refund of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003. Therefore, Institution X is required to report $5,000 of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Student A pays the full $16,000 in late August 2003. In late September 2003, University X reduces the tuition charges by $5,000 and issues a $5,000 refund to Student A.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the $16,000 payment is treated as a payment of qualified tuition and related expenses up to the $10,000 billed for qualified tuition and related expenses. Under paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, the $5,000 refund is treated as reimbursement or refund of payments for qualified tuition and related expenses, because the current year charges for qualified tuition and related expenses were reduced by $5,000. Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, University X is required to net the $10,000 payment received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003 against the $5,000 reimbursement or refund of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003. Therefore, Institution X is required to report $5,000 of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that Student A is enrolled full-time, and, in early September 2003, Student A decides to live at home with her parents. In late September 2003, University X adjusts Student A's account to eliminate room and board charges and issues a $1,000 refund to Student A.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the $11,000 payment is treated as a payment of qualified tuition and related expenses up to the $10,000 billed for qualified tuition and related expenses. Under paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, the $1,000 refund is not treated as reimbursement or refund of payments for qualified tuition and related expenses, because there is no reduction in charges for qualified tuition and related expenses. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, University X is required to report $10,000 of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003.

# Example 4.
(i) In early December 2003, College Y bills enrolled Student B $10,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses and $6,000 for room and board for the 2004 Spring semester. In late December 2003, Student B pays $16,000. In mid-January 2004, after the 2004 Spring semester classes begin, Student B drops to half-time enrollment. In mid-January 2004, College Y credits Student B's account with $5,000, reflecting a $5,000 reduction in charges for qualified tuition and related expenses, but does not issue a refund to Student B. In early August 2004, College Y bills Student B $10,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses and $6,000 for room and board for the 2004 Fall semester. In early September 2004, College Y applies the $5,000 positive account balance toward Student B's $16,000 bill for the 2004 Fall semester. In late September 2004, Student B pays $6,000 towards the charges.
(ii) In the reporting for calendar year 2003, under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the $16,000 payment in December 2003 is treated as a payment of qualified tuition and related expenses up to the $10,000 billed for qualified tuition and related expenses. Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, College Y is
required to report $10,000 of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003. In addition, College Y is required to indicate that the payments reported for 2003 relate to an academic period that begins during the first three months of the next calendar year.
(iii) In the reporting for calendar year 2004, under paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, the $5,000 credited to Student B's account is treated as a reimbursement or refund of qualified tuition and related expenses, because the charges for qualified tuition and related expenses were reduced by $5,000. Under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the $5,000 reimbursement or refund of qualified tuition and related expenses must be separately reported on Form 1098-T because it relates to payments of qualified tuition and related expenses reported by College Y for 2003. Under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the $5,000 positive account balance that is applied toward charges for the 2004 Fall semester is treated as a payment. Therefore, College Y received total payments of $11,000 during 2004 (the $5,000 credit plus the $6,000 payment). Under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, the $11,000 of total payments are treated as a payment of qualified tuition and related expenses up to the $10,000 billed for such expenses. Therefore, for 2004, College Y is required to report $10,000 of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2004 and a $5,000 refund of payments of qualified tuition and related expenses reported for 2003.

(iii)
Reportable amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses during calendar year determined.
The amount billed for qualified tuition and related expenses with respect to an individual during the calendar year that is reportable on Form 1098-T is determined by netting the amounts billed

(iv)
Separate reporting of reductions made to amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported for a prior calendar year.

(v)
Examples.

# Example 1.
(i) In early August 2003, University X bills enrolled Student A $10,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses and $6,000 for room and board for the 2003 Fall semester. In late August 2003, Student A pays $11,000 to University X. In early September 2003, Student A drops to half-time enrollment for the 2003 Fall semester. In late September 2003, University X adjusts Student A's account and reduces the charges for qualified tuition and related expenses by $5,000 to reflect half-time enrollment. In late September 2003, University X applies the $5,000 account balance toward current charges.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, University X is required to net the $10,000 amount of qualified tuition and related expenses billed during 2003 against the $5,000 reduction in charges for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003. Therefore, Institution X is required to report $5,000 in amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that, in addition, in early December 2003, College X bills Student A $10,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses and $6,000 for room and board for the 2004 Spring semester. In early January 2004, Student A pays $16,000. In mid-January 2004, after the 2004 Spring semester classes begin, Student A drops to half-time enrollment. In mid-January 2004, College X credits $5,000 to Student A's account, reflecting a $5,000 reduction in charges for qualified tuition and related expenses, but does not issue a refund check to Student A. In early August 2004, College X bills Student A $10,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses and $6,000 for room and board for the 2004 Fall semester. In early September 2004, College X applies the $5,000 positive account balance toward Student A's $16,000 bill for the 2004 Fall semester. In late September 2004, Student A pays $6,000 toward the charges.
(ii) In the reporting for calendar year 2003, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, College X is required to report $15,000 amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2003 ($5,000 for the 2003 Fall semester and $10,000 for the 2004 Spring semester). In addition, College X is required to indicate that some of the amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses reported for 2003 relate to an academic period that begins during the first three months of the next calendar year.
(iii) In the reporting for calendar year 2004, under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the $5,000 reduction in charges for qualified tuition and related expenses must be separately reported on Form 1098-T because it relates to amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported by College X for 2003. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, College X is required to report $10,000 in amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses during 2004.

(ii)
Acting in a responsible manner.
An institution or insurer must request the TIN of each individual for whom it is required to file a return if it does not already have a record of the individual's correct TIN. If the institution or insurer does not have a record of the individual's correct TIN, then it must solicit the TIN in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section on or before December 31 of each year during which it receives payments, or bills amounts, for qualified tuition and related expenses or makes reimbursements, refunds, or reductions of such amounts with respect to the individual. If an individual refuses to provide his or her TIN upon request, the institution or insurer must file the return and furnish the statement required by this section without the individual's TIN, but with all other required information. The specific solicitation requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section apply in lieu of the solicitation requirements of § 301.6724-1(e) and (f) of this chapter for the purpose of determining whether an institution or insurer acted in a responsible manner in attempting to obtain a correct TIN. An institution or insurer that complies with the requirements of this paragraph (e)(3) will be considered to have acted in a responsible manner within the meaning of § 301.6724-1(d) of this chapter with respect to any failure to include the correct TIN of an individual on a return or statement required by section 6050S and this section.
(iii)
Manner of soliciting TIN.
An institution or insurer must request the individual's TIN in writing and must clearly notify the individual that the law requires the individual to furnish a TIN so that it may be included on an information return filed by the institution or insurer. A request for a TIN made on Form W-9S, “Request for Student's or Borrower's Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,” satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii). An institution or insurer may establish a system for individuals to submit Forms W-9S electronically as described in applicable forms and instructions. An institution or insurer may also develop a separate form to request the individual's TIN or incorporate the request into other forms customarily used by the institution or insurer, such as admission or enrollment forms or financial aid applications.
(4)
Failure to furnish TIN.
The section 6723 penalty may apply to any individual who is required (but fails) to furnish his or her TIN to an institution or insurer.
See
section 6723, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to the penalty for failure to furnish a TIN.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
The rules in this section apply to information returns required to be filed, and information statements required to be furnished, after December 31, 2003. Paragraph (c)(1)(i) applies to payee statements due after December 31, 2014. For payee statements due before January 1, 2015, § 1.6050S-1 (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) shall apply.

Special rules
—(1)
Transitional rule for reporting of loan origination fees and capitalized interest
—(i)
Loans made before September 1, 2004.
For qualified education loans made before September 1, 2004, a payee is not required to report payments of loan origination fees or capitalized interest or to take such payments into account in determining
the $600 amount for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Loans made on or after September 1, 2004.
For qualified education loans made on or after September 1, 2004, a payee is required to report payments of interest as described in § 1.221-1(f). Under § 1.221-1(f), interest includes loan origination fees that represent charges for the use or forbearance of money and capitalized interest.

Qualified education loan certification.
If a loan is not subsidized, guaranteed, financed, or is not otherwise treated as a student loan under a program of the Federal, state, or local government or an eligible educational institution, a payee must request a certification from the payor that the loan will be used solely to pay for qualified higher education expenses. A payee may use Form W-9S, “Request for Student's or Borrower's Social Security Number and Certification,” to obtain the certification. A payee may establish an electronic system for payors to submit Forms W-9S electronically as described in applicable forms and instructions. A payee may also develop a separate form to obtain the payor certification or may incorporate the certification into other forms customarily used by the payee, such as loan applications, provided the certification is clearly set forth. If the certification is not received, the loan is not a qualified education loan for purposes of section 6050S and this section.
(3)
Payments of interest received or collected by one or more persons
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, if a person collects or receives payments of interest on a qualified education loan on behalf of another person (e.g., a lender), the person collecting or receiving the interest must satisfy the information reporting requirements of this section. In this case, the reporting requirements do not apply to the transfer of interest to the other person.
(ii)
Exception.
If the person collecting or receiving payments of interest on a qualified education loan on behalf of another person (e.g., a lender) does not possess the information needed to comply with the information reporting requirements of this section, the other person must satisfy the information reporting requirements of this section.
(4)
Reporting by foreign persons.
A payee that is not a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)) must report payments of interest it receives on a qualified education loan only if it receives the payment—
(i) At a location in the United States; or
(ii) At a location outside the United States if the payee is—
(A) A controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957(a)); or
(B) A person 50 percent or more of the gross income of which, from all sources for the three-year period ending with the close of the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which interest payments were received (or for such part of the period as the person was in existence), was effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
(5)
Governmental units.
A governmental unit, or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit, that receives from any payor interest payments that aggregate $600 or more for any calendar year on one or more qualified education loans is a payee, without regard to the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section that the interest be received in the course of a trade or business.
(f)
Penalty provisions
—(1)
Failure to file correct returns.
The section 6721 penalty may apply to a payee that fails to file information returns required by section 6050S and this section on or before the required filing date; that fails to include all of the required information on the return; or that includes incorrect information on the return. See
section 6721, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to penalties for failure to file correct returns. See section 6724, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to waivers of penalties for certain failures due to reasonable cause.
(2)
Failure to furnish correct information statements.
The section 6722 penalty may apply to a payee that fails to furnish statements required by section 6050S and this section on or before the prescribed date; that fails to include all the required information on the statement; or that includes incorrect information on the statement. See section 6722, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to penalties for failure to furnish correct statements. See section 6724, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to waivers of penalties for certain failures due to reasonable cause.
(3)
Waiver of penalties for failures to include a correct TIN
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a failure to include a correct TIN on Form 1098-E or a related information statement, penalties may be waived if the failure is due to reasonable cause. Reasonable cause may be established if the failure arose from events beyond the payee's control, such as a failure of the payor to furnish a correct TIN. However, the payee must establish that it acted in a responsible manner both before and after the failure.
(ii)
Acting in a responsible manner.
A payee must request the TIN of each payor if it does not already have a record of the payor's correct TIN. If the payee does not have a record of the payor's correct TIN, then it must solicit the TIN in the manner described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section on or before December 31 of each year during which it receives payments of interest. If a payor refuses to provide his or her TIN upon request, the payee must file the return and furnish the statement required by this section without the payor's TIN, but with all other required information. The specific solicitation requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section apply in lieu of the solicitation requirements of § 301.6724-1(e) and (f) of this chapter for the purpose of determining whether a payee acted in a responsible manner in attempting to obtain a correct TIN. A payee that complies with the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3) will be considered to have acted in a responsible manner within the meaning of § 301.6724-1(d) of this chapter with respect to any failure to include the correct TIN of a payor on a return or statement required by section 6050S and this section.
(iii)
Manner of soliciting TIN.
A payee must request the payor's TIN in writing and must clearly notify the payor that the law requires the payor to furnish a TIN so that it may be included on an information return filed by the payee. A request for a TIN made on Form W-9S, “Request for Student's or Borrower's Social Security Number and Certification,” satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3)(iii). A payee may establish a system for payors to submit Forms W-9S electronically as described in applicable forms and instructions. A payee may also develop a separate form to request the payor's TIN or incorporate the request into other forms customarily used by the payee, such as loan applications.
(4)
Failure to furnish TIN.
The section 6723 penalty may apply to any payor who is required (but fails) to furnish his or her TIN to a payee. See section 6723, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to the penalty for failure to furnish a TIN.
(g)
Effective/applicability date.
The rules of this section apply to information returns required to be filed, and payee statements required to be furnished after December 31, 2014. For information returns required to be filed, and payee statements required to be furnished before January 1, 2015, § 1.6050S-3 (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) shall apply.
[T.D. 8992, 67 FR 20904, Apr. 29, 2002, as amended by T.D. 9125, 69 FR 25499, May 7, 2004; T.D. 9675, 79 FR 41131, July 15, 2014]

§ 1.6050W-1
Information reporting for payments made in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions.
(a)
In general
—(1)
General rule.
Every payment settlement entity, as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, must file an information return for each calendar year with respect to payments made in settlement of reportable payment transactions, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, setting forth the following information:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of each participating payee, as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, to whom one or more payments in settlement of reportable payment transactions are made.
(ii) With respect to each participating payee, the gross amount, as defined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, of—
(A) The aggregate reportable payment transactions for the calendar year; and
(B) The aggregate reportable payment transactions for each month of the calendar year.
(iii) Any other information required by the form, instructions or current revenue procedures.
(2)
Payments in settlement of reportable payment transactions.
A payment settlement entity, as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section (or an electronic payment facilitator, as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section), makes a payment in settlement of a reportable payment transaction if the payment settlement entity (or electronic payment facilitator) submits the instruction to transfer funds to the account of the participating payee for purposes of settling the reportable payment transaction. In the case of a third party settlement organization that has the contractual obligation to make payments to participating payees, a payment in settlement of a reportable payment transaction includes the submission of instructions to a purchaser to transfer funds directly to the account of the participating payee for purposes of settling the reportable payment transaction.
(3)
Reportable payment transaction.
The term
reportable payment transaction
means any payment card transaction (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) and any third party network transaction (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
(4)
Payment settlement entity
—(i)
Definition.
The term
payment settlement entity
means a domestic or foreign entity that is—
(A) In the case of a payment card transaction, a merchant acquiring entity (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section); and
(B) In the case of a third party network transaction, a third party settlement organization (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section).
(ii)
Multiple payment settlement entities.
If two or more persons qualify as payment settlement entities (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section) with respect to a reportable payment transaction, then only the payment settlement entity that in fact makes payment in settlement of the reportable payment transaction must file the information return required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(5)
Participating payee
—(i)
Definition.
In general, the term
participating payee
means any person, including any governmental unit (and any agency or instrumentality thereof), who:
(A) In the case of a payment card transaction, accepts a payment card (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) as payment; and
(B) In the case of a third party network transaction, accepts payment from a third party settlement organization (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) in settlement of such transaction.
(ii)
Foreign payees
—(A)
In general.
For payments pursuant to contractual obligations entered into after December 31, 2010, a payment settlement entity that is a person described as a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman in § 1.6049-5(c)(5) is not required to make a return of information for payments to a participating payee with a foreign address as long as, prior to payment, the payment settlement entity has in its files documentation upon which the payment settlement entity may rely to treat the payment as made to a foreign person in accordance with § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii). For purposes of this paragraph (a)(5)(ii), the provisions of § 1.1441-1 shall apply by substituting the term payor for the term withholding agent and without regard to the limitation to amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations under that chapter. Such a payment settlement entity need not make a return of information for payments made outside the United States (within the meaning of § 1.6049-5(e)) to an offshore account (as defined in § 1.6049-5(c)(1)) to a participating payee with only a foreign address if the name of the participating payee indicates that it is an entity listed as a per se corporation under § 301.7701-2(b)(8)(i) and the payment settlement entity does not know or have reason to know that the participating payee is a United States person. A payment settlement entity may apply the grace period rules of § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) of the regulations for payments to a participating payee with only a foreign address, without regard to whether the amounts paid are described in § 1.1441-6(c)(2) or are reportable under section 6042, 6045, 6049, or 6050N. For payments pursuant to contractual obligations entered into before January 1, 2011, a payment settlement entity that is a person described as a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman in § 1.6049-5(c)(5) is not required to make a return of information for payments to a participating payee with a foreign address as long as the payment settlement entity neither knows nor has reason to know that the participating payee is a United States person. For this purpose, a renewal of such a contractual obligation will not result in a new contractual obligation unless there is a material modification to the contractual obligation.
(B)
Non-U.S. payor or middleman.
A payment settlement entity that is not a person described as a U.S. payor or U.S middleman in § 1.6049-5(c)(5) is not required to make a return of information for a payment to a participating payee that does not have a United States address as long as the payment settlement entity neither knows nor has reason to know that the participating payee is a United States person. If the participating payee has any United States address, the payment settlement entity may treat the participating payee as a foreign person only if the payment settlement entity has in its files documentation upon which the payment settlement entity may rely to treat the payment as made to a foreign person in accordance with § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii).
(C)
Foreign address; United States address.
For purposes of this section,
foreign address
means any address that is not within the United States, as defined in section 7701(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code (the States and the District of Columbia).
United States address
means any address that is within the United States.
(6)
Gross amount.
For purposes of this section,
gross amount
means the total dollar amount of aggregate reportable payment transactions for each participating payee without regard to any adjustments for credits, cash equivalents, discount amounts, fees, refunded amounts or any other amounts. The dollar amount of each transaction is determined on the date of the transaction.
(b)
Payment card transactions
—(1)
Definition.
The term
payment card transaction
means any transaction in which a payment card, or any account number or other indicia associated with a payment card, is accepted as payment.
(2)
Merchant acquiring entity.
The term
merchant acquiring entity
means the bank or other organization that has the contractual obligation to make payment to participating payees (as defined in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) of this section) in settlement of payment card transactions.
(3)
Payment card
—(i) The term
payment card
means any card, including
any stored-value card as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, issued pursuant to an agreement or arrangement that provides for—
(A) One or more issuers of such cards;
(B) A network of persons unrelated to each other, and to the issuer, who agree to accept such cards as payment; and
(C) Standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions between the merchant acquiring entities and the persons who agree to accept the cards as payment.
(ii) Persons who agree to accept such cards as payment as described in this paragraph (b)(3) are participating payees within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) of this section.
(4)
Stored-value cards.
The term
stored-value card
means any card with a prepaid value, including any gift card.
(5)
Transactions for which no return of information is required under section 6050W
—(i)
Withdrawals and cash advances.
The use of a “payment card” as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section by a cardholder to withdraw funds at an automated teller machine, or to obtain a cash advance or loan against the cardholder's account, is not a payment card transaction under paragraph (b)(1) of this section because the card is not being accepted as payment by a merchant or other payee.
(ii)
Convenience checks.
The acceptance of a check issued in connection with a payment card account by a merchant or other payee is not a payment card transaction under paragraph (b)(1) of this section because the check is accepted and processed through the banking system in the same manner as a traditional check, not as a payment card.
(iii)
Payee related to issuer.
No return of information is required under this section for any transaction in which a payment card within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) is accepted as payment by a merchant or other payee who is related to the issuer of the payment card.
(c)
Third party network transactions
—(1)
Definition.
The term
third party network transaction
means any transaction that is settled through a third party payment network.
(2)
Third party settlement organization.
The term
third party settlement organization
means the central organization that has the contractual obligation to make payments to participating payees (as defined in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section) of third party network transactions. A central organization is a third party settlement organization if it provides a third party payment network (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) that enables purchasers to transfer funds to providers of goods and services.
(3)
Third party payment network.
(i) The term
third party payment network
means any agreement or arrangement that—
(A) Involves the establishment of accounts with a central organization by a substantial number of providers of goods or services who are unrelated to the organization and who have agreed to settle transactions for the provision of the goods or services to purchasers according to the terms of the agreement or arrangement;
(B) Provides standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions; and
(C) Guarantees payment to the persons providing goods or services in settlement of transactions with purchasers pursuant to the agreement or arrangement.
(ii) A third party payment network does not include any agreement or arrangement that provides for the issuance of payment cards.
(iii) Persons who are providers of goods and services as described in this paragraph (c)(3) are participating payees within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section.
(4)
Exception for de minimis payments.
A third party settlement organization is required to report any information under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to third party network transactions of any participating payee only if—
(i) The amount that would otherwise be reported under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to such transactions exceeds $20,000; and
(ii) The aggregate number of such transactions exceeds 200.
(5)
Coordination with information returns required under section 6045 of the
Code
—(i)
Reporting on exchanges involving digital assets.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (c), the reporting of a payment made in settlement of a third party network transaction in which the payment by a payor is made using digital assets as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(19) or the goods or services provided by a payee are digital assets must be as follows:
(A)
Reporting on payors with respect to payments made using digital assets.
If a payor makes a payment using digital assets and the exchange of the payor's digital assets for goods or services is a sale of digital assets by the payor under § 1.6045-1(a)(9)(ii), the amount paid to the payor in settlement of that exchange is subject to the rules as described in § 1.6045-1 (including any exemption from reporting under § 1.6045-1) and not this section.
(B)
Reporting on payees with respect to the sale of goods or services that are digital assets.
If the goods or services provided by a payee in an exchange are digital assets, the exchange is a sale of digital assets by the payee under § 1.6045-1(a)(9)(ii), and the payor is a broker under § 1.6045-1(a)(1) that effected the sale of such digital assets, the amount paid to the payee in settlement of that exchange is subject to the rules as described in § 1.6045-1 (including any exemption from reporting under § 1.6045-1) and not this section.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c)(5).

Example 1

Facts.
CRX is a
shared-service
organization that performs accounts payable services for numerous purchasers that are unrelated to CRX. A substantial number of sellers of goods and services, including Seller S, have established accounts with CRX and have agreed to accept payment from CRX in settlement of their transactions with purchasers. The agreement between sellers and CRX includes standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions and guarantees payment to the sellers, and the arrangement enables purchasers to transfer funds to providers. Pursuant to this seller agreement, CRX accepts cash from purchasers as payment as well as digital assets, which it exchanges into cash for payment to sellers. Additionally, CRX is a processor of digital asset payments as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(22) and a broker under § 1.6045-1(a)(1). P, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, purchases one month of services from S through CRX's organization. S is also an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting. S's services are not digital assets under § 1.6045-1(a)(19). To effect this transaction, P transfers 100 units of DE, a digital asset as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(19), to CRX. CRX, in turn, exchanges the 100 units of DE for $1,000, based on the fair market value of the DE units, and pays $1,000 to S.
(

)
Analysis with respect to CRX's status.
CRX's arrangement constitutes a third party payment network under paragraph (c)(3) of this section because a substantial number of persons that are unrelated to CRX, including S, have established accounts with CRX, and CRX is contractually obligated to settle transactions for the provision of goods or services by these persons to purchasers, including P. Thus, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, CRX is a third party settlement organization and the transaction involving P's purchase of S's services using 100 units of digital asset DE is a third party network transaction under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(
3
)
Analysis with respect to the reporting on P.
P's payment of 100 units of DE to CRX in return for the payment by CRX of $1,000 in cash to S is a sale of the DE units as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(9)(ii)(D) that is effected by CRX, a processor of digital asset payments and broker under § 1.6045-1(a)(1). Accordingly, pursuant to the rules under paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section, CRX must file an information return under § 1.6045-1 with respect to P's sale of the DE units and is not required to file an information return under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to P.
(

)
Analysis with respect to the reporting on S.
S's services are not digital assets as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(19). Accordingly, pursuant to the rules under paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section, CRX's payment of $1,000 to S in settlement of the reportable payment transaction is subject to the reporting rules under paragraph (a)(1) of this section
and not the reporting rules as described in § 1.6045-1.

Example 2

)
Facts.
CRX is an entity that owns and operates a digital asset trading platform and provides digital asset custodial services and digital asset broker services under § 1.6045-1(a)(1). CRX also exchanges on behalf of customers digital assets under § 1.6045-1(a)(19), including nonfungible tokens, referred to as NFTs, representing ownership in unique digital artwork, video, or music. Exchange transactions undertaken by CRX on behalf of its customers are considered sales under § 1.6045-1(a)(9)(ii) that are effected by CRX and subject to reporting by CRX under § 1.6045-1. A substantial number of NFT sellers have accounts with CRX, into which their NFTs are deposited for sale. None of these sellers are related to CRX, and all have agreed to settle transactions for the sale of their NFTs in digital asset DE, or other forms of consideration, and according to the terms of their contracts with CRX. Buyers of NFTs also have accounts with CRX, into which digital assets are deposited for later use as consideration to acquire NFTs. Once a buyer decides to purchase an NFT for a price agreed to by the NFT seller, CRX effects the requested exchange of the buyer's consideration for the NFT, which allows CRX to guarantee delivery of the bargained for consideration to both buyer and seller. CRX charges a transaction fee on every NFT sale, which is paid by the buyer in additional units of digital asset DE. Seller J, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, sells NFTs representing digital artwork on CRX's digital asset trading platform. J does not perform any other services with respect to these transactions. Buyer B, also an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, seeks to purchase J's NFT-4 using units of DE. Using CRX's platform, buyer B and seller J agree to exchange J's NFT-4 for B's 100 units of DE (with a value of $1,000). At the direction of J and B, CRX executes this exchange, with B paying CRX's transaction fee using additional units of DE.
(
2
)
Analysis with respect to CRX's status.
CRX's arrangement with J and the other NFT sellers constitutes a third party payment network under paragraph (c)(3) of this section because a substantial number of providers of goods or services who are unrelated to CRX, including J, have established accounts with CRX, and CRX is contractually obligated to settle transactions for the provision of goods or services, such as NFTs representing goods or services, by these persons to purchasers. Thus, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, CRX is a third party settlement organization and the sale of J's NFT-4 for 100 units of DE is a third party network transaction under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Therefore, CRX is a payment settlement entity under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
(
3
)
Analysis with respect to the reporting on B.
The exchange of B's 100 units of DE for J's NFT-4 is a sale under § 1.6045-1(a)(9)(ii)(A)(
2
) by B of the 100 DE units that was effected by CRX. Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section, the amount paid to B in settlement of the exchange is subject to the rules as described in § 1.6045-1, and CRX must file an information return under § 1.6045-1 with respect to B's sale of the 100 DE units. CRX is not required to also file an information return under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to the amount paid to B even though CRX is a third party settlement organization.
(

)
Analysis with respect to the reporting on J.
The exchange of J's NFT-4 for 100 units of DE is a sale under § 1.6045-1(a)(9)(ii) by J of a digital asset under § 1.6045-1(a)(19) that was effected by CRX. Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section, the amount paid to J in settlement of the exchange is subject to the rules as described in § 1.6045-1, and CRX must file an information return under § 1.6045-1 with respect to J's sale of the NFT-4. CRX is not required to also file an information return under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to the amount paid to J even though CRX is a third party settlement organization.
(d)
Special rules
—(1)
Aggregated payees.
If a person receives payments from
a payment settlement entity (as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section) on behalf of one or more participating payees and distributes such payments to one or more participating payees (as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section), the person is treated as:
(i) The participating payee with respect to the payment settlement entity; and
(ii) The payment settlement entity with respect to the participating payees to whom the person distributes payments.
(2)
Electronic payment facilitator.
If a payment settlement entity (as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section) contracts with an electronic payment facilitator or other third party to make payments in settlement of reportable payment transactions on behalf of the payment settlement entity, the facilitator must file the annual information return under this section in lieu of the payment settlement entity. The facilitator need not have any agreement or arrangement with the participating payee. Also, the payment need not come from the facilitator's account. The facilitator need only submit instructions to transfer funds to the account of the participating payee in settlement of the reportable payment transaction. The facilitator is liable for any applicable penalties for failure to comply with the information reporting requirements of section 6050W.
(3)
Designations.
The party with the obligation to file the annual information return under this section may designate by written agreement any other person to satisfy the requirements of this section. Thus, notwithstanding the rule in paragraph (d)(2) of this section imposing the obligation to file the annual information return on the electronic payment facilitator in lieu of the payment settlement entity, the payment settlement entity may file the information return by designation if the parties agree in writing. However, a designation does not relieve the party with the reporting obligation from liability for any reporting failures. The party with the obligation to file the annual information return under this section remains liable for any applicable penalties under sections 6721 and 6722 if the requirements of this section are not satisfied.
(4)
Conversion into United States dollars of amounts paid in foreign currency.
When a payment is made or received in a foreign currency, the U.S. dollar amount shall be determined by converting such foreign currency into U.S. dollars on the date of the transaction at the spot rate (as defined in § 1.988-1(d)(1)) or pursuant to a reasonable spot rate convention. For example, a payor may use a month-end spot rate or a monthly average spot rate. A spot rate convention must be used consistently with respect to all non-dollar amounts reported and from year to year. Such convention cannot be changed without the consent of the Commissioner or his or her delegate.
(5)
Unrelated persons.
For purposes of this section,
unrelated
means any person who is not related to another person within the meaning of section 267(b) (providing a list of relationships), including the application of section 267(c) and (e)(3) (providing rules relating to constructive ownership), and section 707(b)(1) (relationships with partnerships).
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:

# Example 1. Merchant acquiring entity.
Customer A purchases goods from merchant B using a credit card issued by Bank X. B is one of a network of unrelated persons that has agreed to accept credit cards issued by X as payment under an agreement that provides standards and mechanisms for settling the transaction between a merchant acquiring bank and the persons who accept the cards. Bank Z is the merchant acquiring bank with the contractual obligation to make payment to B for goods provided to A in this transaction. As defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, Z is the merchant acquiring entity that must file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to report the payment made to settle the transaction for the sale of goods from B to A.

# Example 2. Third party settlement organization.
(i) Merchant B is one of a substantial number of persons selling goods or services over the Internet that have an account with X, an Internet payment service provider. None of these persons, including B, are related to X, and all have agreed to settle transactions for the sale of goods or services to customers according to the terms of their contracts with X. X has guaranteed payment
to all of these persons, including B, for the sale of goods or services to customers. Customer A purchases goods from B. A pays X for the goods purchased from B. X, in turn, makes payment to B in settlement of the transaction for the sale of goods from B to A.
(ii) X's arrangement constitutes a third party payment network as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section because a substantial number of persons that are unrelated to X, including B, have established accounts with X, and X is contractually obligated to settle transactions for the provision of goods or services by these persons to purchasers. Thus, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, X is a third party settlement organization and the transaction discussed in this
Example
is a third party network transaction under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Therefore, X must file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to report the payment made to B in settlement of the transaction with A provided that X's aggregate payments to B from third party network transactions exceed $20,000 and the aggregate number of X's transactions with B exceeds 200 (as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section).

# Example 3. Automated clearinghouse network.
A operates an automated clearinghouse (“ACH”) network that merely processes electronic payments (such as wire transfers, electronic checks, and direct deposit payments) between buyers and sellers. There are no contractual agreements between A and the sellers for the purpose of permitting the sellers to use the ACH network. Thus, A is not a third party settlement organization under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the ACH network is not a third party payment network under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and the electronic payment transactions are not third party network transactions under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A is not required to file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 4. ACH processor.
B provides a variety of ACH payment processing services to a large number of merchants, such as converting checks received in payment of bills into ACH transactions. B groups payment transactions into an ACH file and transmits the ACH file into the ACH network on behalf of merchants in order to initiate payment to merchants through the ACH network. B makes payments to the merchants after the ACH network verifies that the customers' accounts have sufficient funds. Because the ACH network is not a third party payment network under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, B cannot be a third party settlement organization with respect to the ACH network. Similarly, because the ACH itself is not a third party settlement organization under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, B cannot be an electronic payment facilitator because B is not acting on behalf of a payment settlement entity. However, B may itself be operating third party payment network under paragraph (c)(3) of this section if B has a separate agreement or arrangement that: involves the establishment of accounts with B by a substantial number of unrelated merchants who provide goods or services and have agreed to settle transactions for the provision of the goods or services pursuant to the agreement or arrangement; provides for standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions; and guarantees persons providing goods or services pursuant to such agreement or arrangement that these persons will be paid for providing such goods or services.

# Example 5. Gross amount.
On Day 1, Customer A uses a payment card to purchase $100 worth of goods from merchant B. Bank X, the merchant acquiring entity for B, is the party with the contractual obligation to make payment to B in settlement of the transaction. On Day 2, X, after deducting fees of $2, makes payment of $98 to settle the transaction for the sale of goods from B to A. Under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, X must report the amount of $100, the amount of the transaction on Day 1, without any reduction for fees or any other amount, as the gross amount of this reportable payment transaction on the annual information return filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 6. Gift card.
(i) Customer A purchases a gift card from Merchant X that may be used only at X and its related network of stores. A purchases the gift card using cash. A gives the gift card to B. B uses the gift card to purchase goods at one of X's stores. The purchase of the gift card by A using cash is not a payment card transaction described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and, thus, is not required to be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the gift card is not a payment card because the gift card is only accepted as payment by persons who are related to the issuer of the gift card and to each other. Therefore, the use of the gift card by B is not required to be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(ii) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i), except that B adds value to the gift card using a credit card. The use of the credit card to add value to the gift card is a reportable payment transaction (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) and must be reported in a return of information under this section by the bank or other organization that has the contractual obligation to make payment to X in settlement of the transaction.

# Example 7. Private label card.
Bank B issues a card imprinted with Retailer C's logo to
cardholder A. The “C-card” is accepted as payment only at C or at stores related (within the meaning of section 267(b), (c) and (e)(3) and, section 707(b)(1)) to C. A uses the card at C to purchase electronics equipment. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the C-card is not a payment card because the card is accepted as payment only within a network of persons who are related to each other. Therefore, the use of the card by A at C is not required to be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 8. Quasi-private label card.
Bank B issues a card to cardholder A. The card, known as an “E-card,” is issued by B pursuant to an agreement that provides that the E-card is accepted as payment only within a limited network of merchants that carry electronics equipment. The agreement provides for standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions between the merchants and the merchant acquiring entities. The merchants accepting the E-card as payment are not related (within the meaning of section 267(b), (c) and (e)(3) and section 707(b)(1)) to each other or to B. A uses the card to purchase electronics equipment at F Store, one of the stores within the network of merchants accepting the E-card. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the E-card is a payment card because the card is issued pursuant to an agreement that provides for a network of persons unrelated to each other, and to the issuer, who agree to accept the card as payment. Therefore, the use of the E-card by A to purchase electronics equipment at F Store must be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 9. Campus card.
(i) University Y issues Student A a card that may be used on campus at various university-owned merchants and at various local merchants unrelated to Y. A uses the card in the university-owned cafeteria to purchase lunch. Under paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, no return of information is required because the card is being accepted as payment by a person who is related to the issuer of the card.
(ii) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i), except that A uses the campus card to purchase lunch at a local restaurant, unrelated to Y, that has agreed to accept the campus card as payment. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the campus card is a payment card in this transaction because the card is accepted as payment by a person that is unrelated to this issuer of the card pursuant to an agreement. Therefore, the use of the card by A in the local restaurant for the purchase of lunch must be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the bank or other organization that has the contractual obligation to make payment to the restaurant in settlement of the transaction.

# Example 10. Mall card.
Customer B purchases a card that is issued by shopping mall A. Pursuant to an agreement or arrangement, the card is accepted as payment by various merchants located within the mall, who are unrelated to the issuer of the card and to each other. B uses the card in the mall to purchase goods from merchant C. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the mall card is a payment card because the card is accepted as payment by a network of persons who are unrelated to the issuer of the card and to the other merchants who have agreed to accept the card as payment. Therefore, the use of the mall card by B to purchase goods from merchant C is required to be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 11. Electronic benefit transactions card.
Government Agency A issues benefits electronically to recipients by loading these benefits onto a payment card. Pursuant to an agreement, a network of merchants unrelated to A, and to each other, has agreed to accept the benefits card as payment. A issues a card to B, who uses the card to purchase goods from Merchant C. The card issued by A is a payment card (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) because the card is accepted as payment by a network of persons that are unrelated to the issuer of the card, and to each other.
The use of the card by B to purchase goods from C must be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 12. Prepaid telephone card.
A purchases a prepaid telephone card from Company X that may be used to make telephone calls using various long-distance providers unrelated to X that have agreed to accept the card as payment. A places a telephone call using the prepaid card as payment for the telephone call. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the prepaid telephone card is a payment card because the card is accepted as payment by a person that is unrelated to the issuer of the card pursuant to an agreement. Therefore, the use of the prepaid card to make payment for the telephone call must be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the bank or other organization that has the contractual obligation to make payment to the long distance provider in settlement of the transaction.

# Example 13. Transit card.
City Z accepts a transit card as payment for use of its mass transit system. The transit card is issued by B, an organization unrelated to Z. A network of persons, including Z, who are unrelated to each other and to B, have agreed to accept the transit card issued by B as payment for transit and for other goods and services. Transit rider X purchases a transit card and uses the card to pay for travel on Z's mass transit system. Under paragraph (b)(3) of
this section, the transit card is a payment card because the card is accepted as payment by a person who is one of a network of persons that are unrelated to the issuer of the card, and to each other, and that have agreed to accept the card as payment. Therefore, the use of the transit card by X to pay for transit on Z's mass transit system is a payment card transaction described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that must be reported in a return of information required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the bank or other organization that has the contractual obligation to make payment to Z. Z is the participating payee, described in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) of this section, of the payment card transaction.

# Example 14. Cash advance.
Bank A issues Cardholder B a credit card that is a payment card under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. B uses the card at a local bank to obtain a cash advance. Under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, B's use of the payment card to obtain a cash advance is not a payment card transaction (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) because the card is not being accepted as payment by a merchant.

# Example 15. Withdrawals from automated teller machines.
Bank A issues Cardholder B a credit card that is a payment card under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. B uses the card at an automated teller machine to obtain cash. Under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, B's use of the payment card to obtain cash is not a payment card transaction (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) because the card is not being accepted as payment by a merchant.

# Example 16. Convenience checks.
Bank A issues Cardholder B a credit card that is a payment card under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. A sends B paper checks imprinted with the account number associated with the credit card. B uses one of the checks to purchase goods from Merchant S. The check is accepted by S and processed through the bank system in the same manner as a traditional check. Under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, B's use of the convenience check to purchase goods is not a payment card transaction (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) because the check is accepted and processed as a traditional check, not as a payment card.

# Example 17. Healthcare network.
Health carrier A operates healthcare network Y. A collects premiums from covered persons pursuant to a plan agreement between A and the covered persons for the cost of membership in Y. Separately, A pays healthcare providers pursuant to provider agreements to compensate these providers for services rendered to covered persons who are members of Y. A is not a third party settlement organization under paragraph (c)(2) of this section because A does not operate a third party payment network that enables purchasers to transfer funds to providers of goods and services. Therefore, A is not required to file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

# Example 18. Third party accounts payable.
X is a “shared-service” organization that performs accounts payable services for numerous purchasers that are unrelated to X. A substantial number of providers of goods and services have established accounts with X and have agreed to accept payment from X in settlement of their transactions with purchasers. The provider agreement with X includes standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions and guarantees payment to the providers, and the arrangement enables purchasers to transfer funds to providers. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, X's accounts payable services constitute a third party payment network, of which X is the third party settlement organization (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section). For each payee, X must file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to report payments made by X in settlement of accounts payable to that payee if X's aggregate payments to that payee exceed $20,000 and the aggregate number of transactions with that payee exceeds 200 (as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section).

# Example 19. Toll collection network.
State A charges a toll to vehicles that travel its state highways. The tolling agency for A contracted with organization X to perform its toll collection. X provides an electronic toll collection system that allows the toll facility to record the passage of a vehicle with a transponder affixed to the vehicle. The customer account associated with the transponder is automatically debited for the amount of the toll. The customer funds a balance in the account, which is then depleted as the toll transactions occur. X periodically bills the customer to replenish the account. X then makes payment to A to settle the toll transactions that are recorded by the transponder. X also contracts with a substantial number of other entities unrelated to X that have established accounts with X and have agreed to accept payment using the electronic toll collection system provided by X. X guarantees payment to the entities for all toll transactions that are recorded by the transponders, and the arrangement enables customers to transfer funds to State A and other entities that charge tolls. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, X's electronic toll collection system constitutes a third party payment network, of which X is the third party settlement organization (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section). For each payee, including A, X must file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to report payments made by X in settlement of toll transactions if X's aggregate payments to that
payee exceed $20,000 and the aggregate number of transactions with that payee exceeds 200 (as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section).

# Example 20. Hotel kiosk.
Under a “hotel kiosk” arrangement, Hotel B permits its customers to charge, to their room account, transactions for goods and services at a substantial number of sellers unrelated to B that operate on B's premises, or on the premises of hotels related to B, and that have established accounts in B's hotel kiosk system. Customers settle their room account with B when they check out, and B in turn settles the hotel kiosk transactions with the unrelated sellers. B guarantees payment to the sellers for these transactions and the arrangement enables customers to transfer funds to the sellers by means of one payment made to the hotel. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, B's hotel kiosk system constitutes a third party payment network, of which B is the third party settlement organization (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section). For each payee, B must file the annual information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to report payments made by B in settlement of the hotel kiosk transactions if B's aggregate payments to that payee exceed $20,000 and the aggregate number of transactions with that payee exceeds 200 (as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section).

# Example 21. Aggregated payee.
Corporation A, acting on behalf of A's independently-owned franchise stores, receives payment from Bank X for credit card sales effectuated at these franchise stores. X, the payment settlement entity (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section), is required under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section to report the gross amount of the reportable payment transactions distributed to A (notwithstanding the fact that A does not accept payment cards and would not otherwise be treated as a participating payee). In turn, under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, A is required to report the gross amount of the reportable payment transactions allocable to each franchise store. X has no reporting obligation under this section with respect to payments made by A to its franchise stores.

# Example 22. Electronic payment facilitator.
(i) Bank A is a merchant acquiring entity (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) with the contractual obligation to make payments to participating merchants to settle certain credit card transactions. A enters into a contract with Processor X. Pursuant to this contract, X prepares and submits instructions to move funds from A's account to the accounts of participating merchants to settle credit card transactions. X is making payment on A's behalf in settlement of payment card transactions pursuant to a contract between X and A. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, X is an electronic payment facilitator and must file the information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to credit card transactions settled by X. A has no reporting obligation with respect to payments made by X on A's behalf.
(ii) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) except that A and X state in their contract that A will file the information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A may file the information return pursuant to this designation. However, X is liable for any applicable penalties under sections 6721 and 6722 if the reporting requirements of this section are not satisfied.
(iii) The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) except that X merely prepares the instructions to move the funds to the accounts of participating merchants, and the instructions are actually submitted by A. A, not X, is making payment in settlement of payment card transactions. Therefore, A retains the obligation to file the information return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to credit card transactions settled by A.
(f)
Prescribed form.
The return required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be made according to the forms and instructions published by the Internal Revenue Service.
(g)
Time and place for filing.

(a)
Electronic furnishing of statements
—(1)
In general.
A person required by section 6050W to furnish a written statement (furnisher) regarding payments made in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions to the person to whom it is required to be furnished (recipient) may furnish the statement in an electronic format in lieu of a paper format. A furnisher who meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this section is treated as furnishing the required statement.
(2)
Consent
—(i)
In general.
The recipient must have affirmatively consented to receive the statement required under section 6050W in an electronic format or, in the alternative, have previously consented to receive other federal tax statements in an electronic format from the furnisher. The consent may be made electronically in any manner that reasonably demonstrates that the recipient can access the statement in the electronic format in which it will be furnished to the recipient. Alternatively, the consent may be made in a paper document if it is confirmed electronically. Consents must be kept at all times available for inspection by the Internal Revenue Service. Recipients currently receiving electronic communications from the furnisher may elect to receive the statement required under section 6050W in a paper document in lieu of an electronic format. The election to receive a paper document may be made by notifying the furnisher electronically or in a paper document.
(ii)
Withdrawal of consent.
The consent requirement of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is not satisfied if the recipient withdraws the consent to receive electronic statements and the withdrawal takes effect before the statement is furnished. The furnisher may provide that a withdrawal of consent takes effect either on the date it is received by the furnisher or on a subsequent date. The furnisher may also provide that a request for a paper statement will be treated as a withdrawal of consent.
(iii)
Change in hardware or software requirements.
If a change in the hardware or software required to access the statement creates a material risk that the recipient will not be able to access the statement, the furnisher must, prior to changing the hardware or software, provide notice to the recipient. The notice must describe the revised
hardware and software required to access the statement and inform the recipient that a new consent to receive the statement in the revised electronic format must be provided to the furnisher. After implementing the revised hardware and software, the furnisher must obtain from the recipient, in the manner described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a new consent or confirmation of consent to receive the statement electronically.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a)(2):

# Example 1.
Recipient R has consented to receive the statements required under section 6041 in electronic format from Furnisher F. F has retained R's consent and keeps it available for inspection by the IRS. F may furnish to R the statement required under section 6050W in electronic format without securing an affirmative consent from R with respect to the statements required under section 6050W.

# Example 2.
Recipient R has not consented to receive any electronic federal income tax statements from Furnisher F. F may not furnish to R the statements required under section 6050W unless F first secures from R a consent to receive those statements in electronic format in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this section.

# Example 3.
Furnisher F sends Recipient R a letter stating that R may consent to receive statements required by section 6050W(f) electronically on a website instead of in a paper format. The letter contains instructions explaining how to consent to receive the statements electronically by accessing the website, downloading the consent document, completing the consent document, and e-mailing the completed consent back to F. The consent document posted on the website uses the same electronic format that F uses to furnish statements electronically. R reads the instructions and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. R has consented to receive the statements electronically in the manner described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

# Example 4.
Furnisher F sends Recipient R an e-mail stating that R may consent to receive statements required by section 6050W(f) electronically instead of in a paper format. The e-mail contains an attachment instructing R how to consent to receive the statements electronically. The e-mail attachment uses the same electronic format that F uses to furnish statements electronically. R opens the attachment, reads the instructions, and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. R has consented to receive the statements electronically in the manner described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

# Example 5.
Furnisher F posts a notice on its website stating that Recipient R may receive statements required by section 6050W(f) electronically instead of in a paper format. The website contains instructions on how R may access a secure web page and consent to receive the statements electronically. By accessing the secure web page and giving consent, R has consented to receive the statements electronically in the manner described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

For this purpose, a 6050Y(b) issuer may rely on a Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, or a valid substitute form that meets the requirements of § 1.1441-1(d)(2) (substituting “6050Y(b) issuer” for “withholding agent”), that indicates the transferee is a United States person.

for the ownership interest in the entity, including the amount of any debt assumed by the acquirer, that is appropriately allocable to the interest in the life insurance contract held by the entity.

Additionally, for certifying its status as a foreign beneficial owner (as applicable) for purposes of this paragraph (f)(1), a seller that is required to report any of the income from the sale as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States under section 864(b) is required to provide to the 6050Y(b) issuer a Form W-8ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person's Claim that Income is Effectively Connected with the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States. If a 6050Y(b) issuer obtains a Form W-8ECI from a seller with respect to the sale or has reason to know that income from the sale is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States under section 864(b), the exception to reporting described in this paragraph (f)(1) does not apply.
(2) The 6050Y(b) issuer receives notice of a transfer to a foreign person, but does not receive an RPSS with respect to the transfer, provided that, at the time the notice is received—
(i) The 6050Y(b) issuer is not a United States person;
(ii) The life insurance contract (or interest therein) transferred is not on the life of a United States person; and
(iii) The 6050Y(b) issuer has not classified the seller as a United States person in its books and records.
(3) The RPSS received by the 6050Y(b) issuer is with respect to the 6050Y(b) issuer's issuance of a life insurance contract to a policyholder in an exchange pursuant to section 1035.

A payor may also obtain from a partnership or trust that is a reportable death benefits recipient, in addition to documentation establishing the entity's foreign status, a written certification from the entity that no beneficial owner of any portion of the reportable death benefits payment is a United States person.

(3) The payor never received, and has no knowledge of any issuer having received, an RPSS with respect to the interest in a life insurance contract with respect to which the reportable death benefits are paid.

However, the postponement of the due date shall not apply to an income tax return for any such taxable year if:
(1) The books of account and business records are available so as to permit the filing of a proper return, and the corporation has otherwise been in a position to carry on its commercial operations and corporate activities and to make a proper distribution of its earnings or profits, if any, so as to permit the certification required by section 941(b); or
(2) All the commercial operations and corporate activities of such corporation have been carried on in Hong Kong, Macao, or Taiwan (Formosa).
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, the postponed due date referred to in this section will apply if a corporation satisfies the Commissioner that special circumstances exist, related to the unsettled conditions in China, which warrant such postponement.

§ 1.6073-1
Time and place for filing declarations of estimated income tax by individuals.
(a)
Individuals other than farmers or fishermen.
Declarations of estimated tax for the calendar year shall be made on or before April 15th of such calendar
year by every individual whose anticipated income for the year meets the requirements of section 6015(a). If, however, the requirements necessitating the filing of the declaration are first met, in the case of an individual on the calendar year basis, after April 1st, but before June 2d of the calendar year, the declaration must be filed on or before June 15th; if such requirements are first met after June 1st and before September 2d, the declaration must be filed on or before September 15th; and if such requirements are first met after September 1st, the declaration must be filed on or before January 15th of the succeeding calendar year. In the case of an individual on the fiscal year basis, see § 1.6073-2. A special rule applies to nonresident aliens who do not have wages subject to withholding under Chapter 24 of the code and are not treated as residents under section 6013 (g) or (h) of the code. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976, these aliens are not required to file a declaration of estimated tax before June 15th.
(b)
Farmers or fishermen
—(1)
In general.
In the case of an individual on a calendar year basis:
(i) If at least two-thirds of the individual's total estimated gross income from all sources for the calendar year is from farming or fishing (including oyster farming), or
(ii) If at least two-thirds of the individual's total gross income from all sources shown on the return for the preceding taxable year was from farming or fishing (including oyster farming) (with respect to declarations of estimated tax for taxable years beginning after November 10, 1978),
He may file a declaration of estimated tax on or before the 15th day of January of the succeeding calendar year in lieu of the time prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. For the filing of a return in lieu of a declaration, see paragraph (a) of § 1.6015-1.
(2)
Farmers.
The estimated gross income from farming is the estimated income resulting from oyster farming, the cultivation of the soil, the raising or harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities, and the raising of livestock, bees, or poultry. In other words, the requisite gross income must be derived from the operations of a stock, dairy, poultry, fruit, or truck farm, or plantation, ranch, nursery, range, orchard, or oyster bed. If an individual receives for the use of his land income in the form of a share of the crops produced thereon such income is from farming. As to determination of income of farmers, see sections 61 and 162 and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Fishermen.
The estimated gross income from fishing is the estimated income resulting from the catching, taking, harvesting, cultivating or farming of any kind of fish, shellfish (for example, clams and mussels), crustacea (for example, lobsters, crabs, and shrimps), sponges, seaweeds, or other aquatic forms of animal and vegetable life. The estimated gross income from fishing includes the income expected to be received by an officer or member of the crew of a vessel while the vessel is engaged in any such activity, whether or not the officer or member of the crew is himself so engaged, and, in the case of an individual who is engaged in any such activity in the employ of any person, the income expected to be received by such individual from such employment. In addition, income expected to be received for services performed as an ordinary incident to any such activity is estimated gross income from fishing. Similarly, for example, the estimated gross income from fishing includes income expected to be received from the shore services of an officer or member of the crew of a vessel engaged in any such activity, if such services are an ordinary incident to any such activity. Services performed as an ordinary incident to such activities include, for example, services performed in such cleaning, icing, and packing of fish as are necessary for the immediate preservation of the catch.
(c)
Nonresident aliens.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976, in the case of a nonresident alien described in section 6072(c) (relating to returns of nonresident aliens whose wages are not subject to withholding) whose estimated gross income for the calendar year meets the requirements of section 6015(a), a declaration of estimated tax
for the calendar year need not be made before June 15th of such calendar year.
(d)
Place for filing declaration.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), the declaration of estimated tax shall be filed at the place prescribed by the instructions applicable to such declaration. For example, if the instructions applicable to a declaration provide that the declaration of a taxpayer located in North Carolina be filed with the Director, Internal Revenue Service Center, Chamblee, Ga., such declaration shall be filed with the service center.
(e)
Amendment of declaration.
An amended declaration of estimated tax may be filed during any interval between installment dates prescribed for the taxable year. However, no amended declaration may be filed until after the installment date on or before which the original declaration was filed and only one amended declaration may be filed during each interval between installment dates. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), an amended declaration shall be filed with the internal revenue officer with whom the original declaration was filed.
[T.D. 6678, 28 FR 10516, Oct. 1, 1963, as amended by T.D. 6950, 33 FR 5355, Apr. 4, 1968; T.D. 7670, 45 FR 6931, Jan. 31, 1980; T.D. 7719, 45 FR 60902, Sept. 15, 1980]
§ 1.6073-2
Fiscal years.
(a)
Individuals other than farmers or fishermen.
In the case of an individual on the fiscal year basis, the declaration must be filed on or before the 15th day of the 4th month of the taxable year. If, however, the requirements of section 6015(a) are first met after the 1st day of the 4th month and before the 2d day of the 6th month, the declaration must be filed on or before the 15th day of the 6th month of the taxable year. If such requirements are first met after the 1st day of the 6th month, and before the 2d day of the 9th month, the declaration must be filed on or before the 15th day of the 9th month of the taxable year. If such requirements are first met after the 1st day of the 9th month, the declaration must be filed on or before the 15th day of the 1st month of the succeeding fiscal year. Thus, if an individual taxpayer has a fiscal year ending on June 30, 1956, his declaration must be filed on or before October 15, 1955, if the requirements of section 6015(a) are met on or before October 1, 1955. If, however, such requirements are not met until after October 1, 1955, and before December 2, 1955, the declaration need not be filed until December 15, 1955.
(b)
Farmers or fishermen.
In the case of an individual on a fiscal year basis:
(1) If at least two-thirds of the individual's total estimated gross income from all sources for the fiscal year is from farming or fishing (including oyster farming), or
(2) If at least two-thirds of the individual's total gross income from all sources shown on the return for the preceding taxable year was from farming or fishing (including oyster farming) (with respect to declarations of estimated tax for taxable years beginning after November 10, 1978),
he may file a declaration on or before the 15th day of the month immediately following the close of his taxable year, in lieu of the time prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Nonresident aliens.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, in the case of a nonresident alien described in section 6072(c) (relating to returns of nonresident aliens whose wages are not subject to withholding) whose anticipated income for the fiscal year meets the requirements of section 6015(a), § 1.6015(a)-1, and § 1.6015(i)-1, the declaration of estimated tax for the fiscal year need not be filed before the 15th day of the 6th month of such fiscal year.

§ 1.6073-3
Short taxable years.
(a)
Individuals other than farmers or fishermen.
In the case of short taxable years the declaration shall be filed on or before the 15th day of the 4th month of such taxable year if the requirements of section 6015(a) are met on or before the 1st day of the 4th month of such year. If such requirements are first met after the 1st day of the 4th month but before the 2d day of the 6th
month, the declaration must be filed on or before the 15th day of the 6th month. If such requirements are first met after the 1st day of the 6th month but before the 2d day of the 9th month, the declaration must be filed on or before the 15th day of the 9th month. If, however, the period for which the declaration is filed is one of 4 months, or one of 6 months and the requirements of section 6015(a) are not met until after the 1st day of the 4th month, or one of 9 months and such requirements are not met until after the 1st day of the 6th month, the declaration may be filed on or before the 15th day of the succeeding taxable year.
(b)
Farmers or fishermen.
In the case of an individual:
(1) Whose current taxable year is a short taxable year and whose estimated gross income from farming or fishing (including oyster farming) is at least two-thirds of his total estimated gross income from all sources for such current taxable year, or
(2) Whose taxable year preceding the current taxable year was a short taxable year and whose gross income from farming or fishing (including oyster farming) was at least two-thirds of the total gross income from all sources shown on the return for such preceding short taxable year (with respect to declarations of estimated tax for taxable years beginning after November 10, 1978),
he may file a declaration of estimated tax on or before the 15th day of the month immediately following the close of the current taxable year, in lieu of the time prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Nonresident aliens.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, in the case of a short taxable year, a nonresident alien described in section 6072(c) (relating to returns of nonresident aliens whose wages are not subject to withholding) whose anticipated income for the short taxable year meets the requirements of section 6015(a). Sections 1.6015(a)-1, 1.6015(g)-1, and 1.6015(i)-1 on or before the 1st day of the 6th month following the beginning of such year need not file a declaration of estimated tax before the 15th day of the 6th month following the beginning of such year.
[T.D. 6678, 28 FR 10516, Oct. 1, 1963, as amended by T.D. 7719, 45 FR 60903, Sept. 15, 1980]
§ 1.6073-4

Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), an application for an extension of time for filing such a declaration shall be addressed to the internal revenue officer with whom the taxpayer is required to file his declaration, and must contain a full recital of the causes for the delay. Except in the case of taxpayers who are abroad, no extension for filing declarations may be granted for more than 6 months.

(d)
Addition to tax applicable.
An extension of time for filing the declaration of estimated tax automatically extends the time for paying the estimated tax (without interest) for the same period. However, such extension does not relieve the taxpayer from the addition to the tax imposed by section
6654, and the period of the underpayment will be determined under section 6654(c) without regard to such extension.

(2)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A corporation filing on a calendar year basis which changes to a fiscal year beginning September 1, 1965, will have a short taxable year beginning January 1, 1965, and ending August 31, 1965. If the requirements of section 6016(a) are met before April 1, 1965 (the 1st day of the 4th month), the declaration of estimated tax must be filed on or before April 15, 1965 (the 15th day of the 4th month).

However, if the corporation does not meet the requirements of section 6016(a) until August 1, 1965, then the requirements of section 6016(a) were not met before the first day of the last month of the short taxable year, and no declaration of estimated tax is required to be filed for the short taxable year.

Taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 1963.
Where a declaration of estimated tax for a short taxable year of more than 9 months beginning on or before December 31, 1963, is filed before the 15th day of the last month of the short taxable year, an amended declaration may be filed any time on or before such 15th day.
(2)
Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963.

Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), an application by a corporation for an extension of time for filing such a declaration shall be addressed to the internal revenue officer with whom the corporation is required to file its declaration and must contain a full recital of the causes for the delay.

An extension of time granted to a corporation for filing a declaration of estimated tax automatically extends the time for paying the estimated tax (without interest) for the same period. However, such extension does not relieve the corporation from the addition to the tax imposed by section 6655, and the period of the underpayment will be determined under section 6655(c) without regard to such extension.

Application for extension of time

In general.
Under other sections in this chapter, certain taxpayers may request an automatic extension of time to file certain returns. Except in undue hardship cases, no extension of time to file a return will be allowed under this section until an automatic extension of time to file the return has been allowed under the applicable section. No extension of time to file a return will be granted under this section for a period of time greater than that provided for by automatic extension. A taxpayer desiring an extension of the time for filing a return, statement, or other document shall submit an application for extension on or before the due date of such return, statement, or other document. If a form exists for the application for an extension, the taxpayer should use the form; however, taxpayers may apply for an extension in a letter that includes the information required by this paragraph. Except as provided in § 301.6091-1(b) of this chapter (relating to hand-carried documents), the taxpayer should make the application for extension to the Internal Revenue Service office where such return, statement, or other document is required to be filed. Except for requests for automatic extensions of time to file certain returns provided for elsewhere in this chapter, the application must be in writing, signed by the taxpayer or his duly authorized agent, and must clearly set forth—
(i) The particular tax return, information return, statement, or other document, including the taxable year or period thereof, for which the taxpayer requests an extension; and
(ii) An explanation of the reasons for requesting the extension to aid the internal revenue officer in determining whether to grant the request.

Taxpayer unable to sign.
In any case in which a taxpayer is unable, by reason of illness, absence, or other good cause, to sign a request for an extension, any person standing in close personal or business relationship to the taxpayer may sign the request on his behalf, and shall be considered as a duly authorized agent for this purpose,
provided the request sets forth the reasons for a signature other than the taxpayer's and the relationship existing between the taxpayer and the signer.

§ 1.6091-4
Exceptional cases.
(a)
Permission to file in office other than required office.
(1) The Commissioner may permit the filing of any income tax return required to be made under the provisions of subtitle A or F of the Code, or the regulations in this part, in any Internal Revenue Service office, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 6091(b) and §§ 1.6091-1 to 1.6091-3, inclusive.

However, after initial processing all such returns shall be forwarded by the service center to the office with which such returns are, without regard to this subparagraph, required to be filed. For the sole purpose of determining venue, such returns are filed only with such office.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of other sections of this chapter or any rule issued under this chapter:
(i) In cases where, in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, a return is filed with a service center, the authority of the members of the office with whom such return would, without regard to such subparagraph, be required to be filed shall remain the same as if the return had been so filed;
(ii) Unless a return or other document is a proper attachment to, or is,
a return which the service center is expressly authorized to receive, such return or other document shall be filed as if all returns sent directly to the service centers, in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, were filed in the office where such returns are, without regard to such subparagraph, required to be filed; and
(iii) Unless the performance of an act is directly related to the sending of a return directly to the service center, such act shall be performed as if all returns sent directly to the service centers, in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, were filed in the office where such returns are, without regard to such subparagraph, required to be filed.
(4) The application of paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The Commissioner has authorized the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (for all purposes except venue), to receive Form 1120. Except for that authorization, A, a corporation with its principal place of business in Greensboro, North Carolina, is required to file its Form 1120 for Year X with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, A may file an election to defer development expenditures paid or incurred in Year X. Under § 1.616-2(e)(2) and applicable published guidance (in this case Notice 2003-19 (2003-1 C.B. 703)) that statement of election must be filed with the service center that serves A's principal place of business where A filed its income tax return. A may make that election on its income tax return or by filing it separately. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, A may send its Form 1120 to either the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or to the Internal Revenue Service Center, Atlanta, Georgia. If A files its statement of election separately from its income tax return for Year X, then the statement of election is not a proper attachment to A's income tax return and A should send the statement of election to the Internal Revenue Service Center, Atlanta, Georgia (with which A must, without regard to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, file its income tax return), no later than the time prescribed for filing Form 1120 for Year X (including extensions).
(b)
Returns of officers and employees of the Internal Revenue Service.
The Commissioner may require any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service to file his income tax return in any Internal Revenue Service office selected by the Commissioner.
(c)
Residents of Guam.
Income tax returns of an individual citizen of the United States who is a resident of Guam shall be filed with Guam, as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.935-1.

§ 1.6107-1
Tax return preparer must furnish copy of return or claim for refund to taxpayer and must retain a copy or record.
(a)
Furnishing copy to taxpayer
—(1) A person who is a signing tax return preparer of any return of tax or claim for refund of tax under the Internal Revenue Code shall furnish a completed copy of the return or claim for refund to the taxpayer (or nontaxable entity) not later than the time the return or claim for refund is presented for the signature of the taxpayer (or nontaxable entity). The signing tax return preparer may, at its option, request a receipt or other evidence from the taxpayer (or nontaxable entity) sufficient to show satisfaction of the requirement of this paragraph (a).
(2) The tax return preparer must provide a complete copy of the return or claim for refund filed with the IRS to the taxpayer in any media, including electronic media, that is acceptable to both the taxpayer and the tax return preparer. In the case of an electronically filed return, a complete copy of a taxpayer's return or claim for refund consists of the electronic portion of the return or claim for refund, including all schedules, forms, pdf attachments, and jurats, that was filed with the IRS. The copy provided to the taxpayer
must include all information submitted to the IRS to enable the taxpayer to determine what schedules, forms, electronic files, and other supporting materials have been filed with the return. The copy, however, need not contain the identification number of the paid tax return preparer. The electronic portion of the return or claim for refund may be contained on a replica of an official form or on an unofficial form. On an unofficial form, however, data entries must reference the line numbers or descriptions on an official form.
(3) For electronically filed Forms 1040EZ, “Income Tax Return for Single Filers and Joint Filers With No Dependents,” and Form 1040A, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,” filed for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 taxable years, the information may be provided on a replica of a Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return”, that provides all of the information. For other electronically filed returns, the information may be provided on a replica of an official form that provides all of the information.
(b)
Copy or record to be retained.
(1) A person who is a signing tax return preparer of any return or claim for refund shall—
(i)(A) Retain a completed copy of the return or claim for refund; or
(B) Retain a record, by list, card file, or otherwise of the name, taxpayer identification number, and taxable year of the taxpayer (or nontaxable entity) for whom the return or claim for refund was prepared, and the type of return or claim for refund prepared;
(ii) Retain a record, by retention of a copy of the return or claim for refund, maintenance of a list, card file, or otherwise, for each return or claim for refund presented to the taxpayer (or nontaxable entity), of the name of the individual tax return preparer required to sign the return or claim for refund pursuant to § 1.6695-1(b); and
(iii) Make the copy or record of returns and claims for refund and record of the individuals required to sign available for inspection upon request by the Commissioner.
(2) The material described in this paragraph (b) shall be retained and kept available for inspection for the 3-year period following the close of the return period during which the return or claim for refund was presented for signature to the taxpayer (or nontaxable entity). In the case of a return that becomes due (with extensions, if any) during a return period following the return period during which the return was presented for signature, the material shall be retained and kept available for inspection for the 3-year period following the close of the later return period in which the return became due. For the definition of “return period,” see section 6060(c). If the person subject to the record retention requirement of this paragraph (b) is a corporation or a partnership that is dissolved before completion of the 3-year period, then all persons who are responsible for the winding up of the affairs of the corporation or partnership under state law shall be subject, on behalf of the corporation or partnership, to these record retention requirements until completion of the 3-year period. If state law does not specify any person or persons as responsible for winding up, then, collectively, the directors or general partners shall be subject, on behalf of the corporation or partnership, to the record retention requirements of this paragraph (b). For purposes of the penalty imposed by section 6695(d), such designated persons shall be deemed to be the tax return preparer and will be jointly and severally liable for each failure.
(c)
Tax return preparer.
For the definition of “signing tax return preparer,” see § 301.7701-15(b)(1) of this chapter. For purposes of applying this section, a corporation, partnership or other organization that employs a signing tax return preparer to prepare for compensation (or in which a signing tax return preparer is compensated as a partner or member to prepare) a return of tax or claim for refund shall be treated as the sole signing tax return preparer.
(d)
Penalties.
(1) For the civil penalty for failure to furnish a copy of the return or claim for refund to the taxpayers (or nontaxable entity) as required under paragraph (a) of this section, see section 6695(a) and § 1.6695-1(a).

For provisions concerning the requesting and furnishing of identifying numbers with respect to returns, statements, and other documents which must be filed before April 16, 1974, see 26 CFR § 1.6109-1 (revised as of April 1, 1973).
[T.D. 7306, 39 FR 9946, Mar. 15, 1974; 39 FR 11080, Mar. 25, 1974]
§ 1.6109-2
Tax return preparers furnishing identifying numbers for returns or claims for refund and related requirements.
(a)
Furnishing identifying number.
(1) Each filed return of tax or claim for refund of tax under the Internal Revenue Code prepared by one or more tax return preparers must include the identifying number of the tax return preparer required by § 1.6695-1(b) to sign the return or claim for refund. In addition, if there is an employment arrangement or association between the individual tax return preparer and another person (except to the extent the return prepared is for the person), the identifying number of the other person must also appear on the filed return or claim for refund. For the definition of the term “tax return preparer,” see section 7701(a)(36) and § 301.7701-15 of this chapter.
(2)(i) For tax returns or claims for refund filed on or before December 31, 2010, the identifying number of an individual tax return preparer is that individual's social security number or such alternative number as may be prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.
(ii) For tax returns or claims for refund filed after December 31, 2010, the identifying number of a tax return preparer is the individual's preparer tax identification number or such other number prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.
(3) The identifying number of a person (whether an individual or entity) who employs or associates with an individual tax return preparer described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to prepare the return or claim for refund (other than a return prepared for the person) is the person's employer identification number.
(b) and (c) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.6109-2A(b) and (c).
(d) Beginning after December 31, 2010, all tax return preparers must have a preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number that was applied for and received at the time and in the manner, including the
payment of a user fee, as may be prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance. Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, beginning after December 31, 2010, to obtain a preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number, a tax return preparer must be an attorney, certified public accountant, enrolled agent, or registered tax return preparer authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service under 31 U.S.C. 330 and the regulations thereunder.
(e) The Internal Revenue Service may designate an expiration date for any preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number and may further prescribe the time and manner for renewing a preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number, including the payment of a user fee, as set forth in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance. The Internal Revenue Service may provide that any identifying number issued by the Internal Revenue Service prior to the effective date of this regulation will expire on December 31, 2010, unless properly renewed as set forth in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance, including these regulations.
(f) As may be prescribed in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance, the IRS may conduct a Federal tax compliance check on a tax return preparer who applies for or renews a preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number.
(g) Only for purposes of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, the term
tax return preparer
means any individual who is compensated for preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund of tax. Factors to consider in determining whether an individual is a tax return preparer under this paragraph (g) include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the work performed by the individual relative to the overall complexity of the tax return or claim for refund of tax; the amount of the items of income, deductions, or losses attributable to the work performed by the individual relative to the total amount of income, deductions, or losses required to be correctly reported on the tax return or claim for refund of tax; and the amount of tax or credit attributable to the work performed by the individual relative to the total tax liability required to be correctly reported on the tax return or claim for refund of tax. The preparation of a form, statement, or schedule, such as Schedule EIC (Form 1040), “Earned Income Credit,” may constitute the preparation of all or substantially all of a tax return or claim for refund based on the application of the foregoing factors. A tax return preparer does not include an individual who is not otherwise a tax return preparer as that term is defined in § 301.7701-15(b)(2), or who is an individual described in § 301.7701-15(f). The provisions of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Employee A, an individual employed by Tax Return Preparer B, assists Tax Return Preparer B in answering telephone calls, making copies, inputting client tax information gathered by B into the data fields of tax preparation software on a computer, and using the computer to file electronic returns of tax prepared by B. Although Employee A must exercise judgment regarding which data fields in the tax preparation software to use, A does not exercise any discretion or independent judgment as to the clients' underlying tax positions. Employee A, therefore, merely provides clerical assistance or incidental services and is not a tax return preparer required to apply for a PTIN or other identifying number as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that Employee A also interviews B's clients and obtains from them information needed for the preparation of tax returns. Employee A determines the amount and character of entries on the returns and whether the information provided is sufficient for purposes of preparing the returns. For at least some of B's clients, A obtains information and makes determinations that constitute all or substantially all of the tax return. Employee A is a tax return preparer required to apply for a PTIN or other identifying number as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance. Employee A is a tax return preparer even if Employee A relies on tax preparation software to prepare the return.

# Example 3.
C is an employee of a firm that prepares tax returns and claims for refund of tax for compensation. C is responsible for preparing a Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,” for a client. C obtains the information necessary for the preparation of the tax return during a meeting with the client, and makes determinations with respect to the proper application of the tax laws to the information in order to determine the client's tax liability. C completes the tax return and sends the completed return to employee D, who reviews the return for accuracy before signing it. Both C and D are tax return preparers required to apply for a PTIN or other identifying number as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.

# Example 4.
E is an employee at a firm which prepares tax returns and claims for refund of tax for compensation. The firm is engaged by a corporation to prepare its Federal income tax return on Form 1120, “U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return.” Among the documentation that the corporation provides to E in connection with the preparation of the tax return is documentation relating to the corporation's potential eligibility to claim a recently enacted tax credit for the taxable year. In preparing the return, and specifically for purposes of the new tax credit, E (with the corporation's consent) obtains advice from F, a subject matter expert on this and similar credits. F advises E as to the corporation's entitlement to the credit and provides his calculation of the amount of the credit. Based on this advice from F, E prepares the corporation's Form 1120 claiming the tax credit in the amount recommended by F. The additional credit is one of many tax credits and deductions claimed on the tax return, and determining the credit amount does not constitute preparation of all or substantially all of the corporation's tax return under this paragraph (g). F will not be considered to have prepared all or substantially all of the corporation's tax return, and F is not a tax return preparer required to apply for a PTIN or other identifying number as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance. The analysis is the same whether or not the tax credit is a substantial portion of the return under § 301.7701-15 of this chapter (as opposed to substantially all of the return), and whether or not F is in the same firm with E. E is a tax return preparer required to apply for a PTIN or other identifying number as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.
(h) The Internal Revenue Service, through forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance, may prescribe exceptions to the requirements of this section, including the requirement that an individual be authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service before receiving a preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number, as necessary in the interest of effective tax administration. The Internal Revenue Service, through other appropriate guidance, may also specify specific returns, schedules, and other forms that qualify as tax returns or claims for refund for purposes of these regulations.
(i)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (a)(1) of this section is applicable to tax returns and claims for refund filed after December 31, 2008. Paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is applicable to tax returns and claims for refund filed on or before December 31, 2010. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is applicable to tax returns and claims for refund filed after December 31, 2010. Paragraph (d) of this section is applicable to tax return preparers after December 31, 2010. Paragraphs (e) through (h) of this section are effective after September 30, 2010.

§ 1.6115-1
Disclosure requirements for quid pro quo contributions.
(a)
Good faith estimate defined
—(1)
In general.
A good faith estimate of the value of goods or services provided by an organization described in section 170(c) in consideration for a taxpayer's payment to that organization is an estimate of the fair market value, within the meaning of § 1.170A-1(c)(2), of the goods or services. The organization may use any reasonable methodology in making a good faith estimate, provided it applies the methodology in good faith. If the organization fails to apply the methodology in good faith, the organization will be treated as not having met the requirements of section 6115. See section 6714 for the penalties that apply for failure to meet the requirements of section 6115.
(2)
Good faith estimate for goods or services that are not commercially available.
A good faith estimate of the value
of goods or services that are not generally available in a commercial transaction may be determined by reference to the fair market value of similar or comparable goods or services. Goods or services may be similar or comparable even though they do not have the unique qualities of the goods or services that are being valued.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a).

# Example 1. Facility not available on a commercial basis.
Museum
M,
an organization described in section 170(c), is located in Community
N.
In return for a payment of $50,000 or more,
M
allows a donor to hold a private event in a room located in
M.
Private events other than those held by such donors are not permitted to be held in
M.
In Community
N,
there are four hotels,
O, P, Q,
and
R,
that have ballrooms with the same capacity as the room in
M.
Of these hotels, only
O
and
P
have ballrooms that offer amenities and atmosphere that are similar to the amenities and atmosphere of the room in
M
(although
O
and
P
lack the unique collection of art that is displayed in the room in
M
). Because the capacity, amenities, and atmosphere of ballrooms in
O
and
P
are comparable to the capacity, amenities, and atmosphere of the room in
M,
a good faith estimate of the benefits received from
M
may be determined by reference to the cost of renting either the ballroom in
O
or the ballroom in
P.
The cost of renting the ballroom in
O
is $2500 and, therefore, a good faith estimate of the fair market value of the right to host a private event in the room at
M
is $2500. In this example, the ballrooms in
O
and
P
are considered similar and comparable facilities to the room in
M
for valuation purposes, notwithstanding the fact that the room in
M
displays a unique collection of art.

# Example 2. Services available on a commercial basis.
Charity
S
is an organization described in section 170(c).
S
offers to provide a one-hour tennis lesson with Tennis Professional
T
in return for the first payment of $500 or more that it receives.
T
provides one-hour tennis lessons on a commercial basis for $100. Taxpayer pays $500 to
S
and in return receives the tennis lesson with
T.
A good faith estimate of the fair market value of the lesson provided in exchange for Taxpayer's payment is $100.

# Example 3. Celebrity presence.
Charity
U
is an organization described in section 170(c). In return for the first payment of $1000 or more that it receives,
U
will provide a dinner for two followed by an evening tour of Museum
V
conducted by Artist
W,
whose most recent works are on display at
V. W
does not provide tours of
V
on a commercial basis. Typically, tours of
V
are free to the public. Taxpayer pays $1000 to
U
and in return receives a dinner valued at $100 and an evening tour of
V
conducted by
W.
Because tours of
V
are typically free to the public, a good faith estimate of the value of the evening tour conducted by
W
is $0. In this example, the fact that Taxpayer's tour of
V
is conducted by
W
rather than
V
's regular tour guides does not render the tours dissimilar or incomparable for valuation purposes.
(b)
Certain goods or services disregarded.
For purposes of section 6115, an organization described in section 170(c) may disregard goods or services described in § 1.170A-13(f)(8)(i).
(c)
Value of the right to purchase tickets to college or university athletic events.
For purposes of section 6115, the right to purchase tickets for seating at an athletic event in exchange for a payment described in section 170(l) is treated as having a value equal to twenty percent of such payment.
(d)
Goods or services provided to employees or partners of donors
—(1)
Certain goods or services disregarded.
For purposes of section 6115, goods or services provided by an organization described in section 170(c) to employees of a donor or to partners of a partnership that is a donor in return for a payment to the donee organization may be disregarded to the extent that the goods or services provided to each employee or partner are the same as those described in § 1.170A-13(f)(8)(i).
(2)
Description permitted in lieu of good faith estimate for other goods or services.
The written disclosure statement required by section 6115 may include a description of goods or services, in lieu of a good faith estimate of their value, if the donor is—
(i) An employer and, in return for the donor's quid pro quo contribution, an organization described in section 170(c) provides the donor's employees with goods or services other than those described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or
(ii) A partnership and, in return for its quid pro quo contribution, the organization provides partners in the partnership with goods or services other than those described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(e)
Effective date.
This section applies to contributions made on or after December 16, 1996. However, taxpayers may rely on the rules of this section
for contributions made on or after January 1, 1994.

# Time and Place for Paying Tax

# Place and Due Date for Payment of Tax
§ 1.6151-1
Time and place for paying tax shown on returns.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in section 6152 and paragraph (b) of this section, the tax shown on any income tax return shall, without assessment or notice and demand, be paid to the internal revenue officer with whom the return is filed at the time fixed for filing the return (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return). For provisions relating to the time for filing income tax returns, see section 6072 and §§ 1.6072-1 to 1.6072-4, inclusive.

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12137, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6922, 32 FR 8713, June 17, 1967; T.D. 6950, 33 FR 5357, Apr. 4, 1968; T.D. 7102, 36 FR 5498, Mar. 24, 1971; T.D. 7953, 49 FR 19644, May 9, 1984; T.D. 8952, 66 FR 33831, June 26, 2001; T.D. 9394, 73 FR 23085, Apr. 29, 2008; T.D. 9394, 74 FR 14932, Apr. 2, 2009]
§ 1.6153-1
Payment of estimated tax by individuals.
(a)
In general.
(1) The time for payment of the estimated tax by individuals for calendar years shall be as follows:
Date of filing declaration
Dates of payment of estimated tax
(i) On or before April 15
In 4 equal installments—one at time of filing declaration, one on or before June 15, one on or before September 15, and one on or before January 15 of the succeeding taxable year
(ii) After April 15 and before June 16 if not required to be filed on or before April 15
In 3 equal installments—one at time of filing declaration, one on or before September 15, and one on or before January 15 of the succeeding taxable year
(iii) After June 15 and before September 16 if not required to be filed on or before June 15
In 2 equal installments—one at time of filing declaration, and the other on or before January 15 of the succeeding taxable year
(iv) After September 15 if not required to be filed on or before September 15
In full at time of filing declaration
(2) If, for example, due to the nature and amount of his gross income for 1955, the taxpayer is not required to file his declaration as of April 15, but is required to file the declaration on or before June 15, 1955, the case comes within the scope of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph and the estimated tax is payable in 3 equal installments, the 1st on the date of filing, the 2d on or before September 15, 1955, and the 3d installment on or before January 15, 1956.
(3) If a declaration is filed after the time prescribed in section 6073(a) (including any extension of time granted for filing the declaration), there shall be paid at such time all installments of the estimated tax which would have been payable on or before such date of
filing if the declaration had been timely filed in accordance with the provisions of section 6073(a). The remaining installments shall be paid at the times and in the amounts in which they would have been payable if the declaration had been timely filed. Thus, for example, B, a single man who makes his return on the calendar year basis, was employed from the beginning of 1955 and for several years prior thereto at an annual salary of $6,000, thus meeting the requirements of section 6015(a). B filed his declaration for 1955 on September 16, 1955. In such case, B should have filed a declaration on or before April 15, 1955, and at the time of filing his declaration he was delinquent in the payment of three installments of his estimated tax for the taxable year 1955. Hence, upon his filing the declaration on September 16, 1955, three-fourths of the estimated tax shown thereon must be paid.
(4) In the case of a decedent, payments of estimated tax are not required subsequent to the date of death. See, however, paragraph (c) of § 1.6015(b)-1, relating to the making of an amended declaration by a surviving spouse if a joint declaration was made before the death of the decedent.
(5) The payment of any installment of the estimated tax shall be considered payment on account of the tax for such taxable year. Hence, upon the return for such taxable year, the aggregate amount of the payments of estimated tax should be entered as payments to be applied against the tax shown on such return.
(b)
Farmers or fishermen.
Special provisions are made with respect to the filing of the declaration and the payment of the tax by an individual whose estimated gross income from farming or, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, from fishing is at least two-thirds of his total gross income from all sources for the taxable year. As to what constitutes income from farming or fishing within the meaning of this paragraph, see paragraph (b) of § 1.6073-1. The declaration of such an individual may be filed on or before January 15 of the succeeding taxable year in lieu of the time prescribed for individuals generally. Where such an individual makes a declaration of estimated tax after September 15 of the taxable year, the estimated tax shall be paid in full at the time of the filing of the declaration.
(c)
Amendment of declaration.
If any amendment of a declaration is filed, the remaining installments, if any, shall be ratably increased or decreased, as the case may be, to reflect the increase or decrease in the estimated tax by reason of the amendment. If any amendment is made after September 15 of the taxable year, any increase in the estimated tax by reason thereof shall be paid at the time of making the amendment.
(d)
Installments paid in advance.
At the election of the taxpayer any installment of the estimated tax may be paid prior to the date prescribed for its payment.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12139, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6678, 28 FR 10517, Oct. 1, 1963]
§ 1.6153-2
Fiscal years.
In the case of an individual on the fiscal year basis, the dates prescribed for payment of the estimated tax shall be the 15th day of the 4th month, the 15th day of the 6th month, and the 15th day of the 9th month of the taxable year and the 15th day of the 1st month of the succeeding taxable year. For example, if an individual having a fiscal year ending on June 30, 1956, first meets the requirements of section 6015(a) on January 15, 1956, and the declaration is filed on or before March 15, 1956, the estimated tax shall be paid in 2 equal installments, one at the time of filing of such declaration and the other on or before July 15, 1956.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12139, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.6153-3
Short taxable years.
In the case of a short taxable year of an individual for which a declaration is required to be filed the estimated tax shall be paid in equal installments, one at the time of filing the declaration, one on the 15th day of the 6th month of the taxable year and another on the 15th day of the 9th month of such year unless the short taxable year closed during or prior to such 6th or 9th month, and one on the 15th day of the 1st month of the succeeding taxable
year. For example, if the short taxable year is the period of 10 months from January 1, 1955, to October 31, 1955, and the declaration is required to be filed on or before April 15, 1955, the estimated tax is payable in 4 equal installments, one on the date of filing the declaration, and one each on June 15, September 15, and November 15, 1955. If in such case the declaration is required to be filed after April 15 but on or before June 15, the tax will be payable in 3 equal installments, one on the date of filing the declaration, and one each on September 15, and November 15, 1955. The provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.6153-1, relating to payment of estimated tax in any case in which the declaration is filed after the time prescribed in section 6073 and §§ 1.6073-1 to 1.6073-4, inclusive, are equally applicable to the payment of the estimated tax for short taxable years.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12139, Nov. 26, 1960]
§ 1.6153-4
Extension of time for paying the estimated tax.
An extension of time granted an individual under section 6081 for filing the declaration of estimated tax automatically extends the time for paying the estimated tax (without interest) for the same period. See § 1.6073-4 for rules relating to extensions of time for filing declarations of estimated tax by individuals. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), an application for an extension of time for paying a particular installment of the estimated tax shall be addressed to the internal revenue officer with whom the taxpayer files his declaration. Each application must contain a full recital of the causes for the delay. Such extension may be for a reasonable period not to exceed 6 months from the date fixed for payment thereof except in the case of a taxpayer who is abroad. Such extension does not relieve the taxpayer from the addition to the tax imposed by section 6654, and the period of the underpayment will be determined under section 6654(c) without regard to such extension.

# Extensions of Time for Payment

# Source:
Sections 1.6161-1 through 1.6165-1 contained in T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12140, Nov. 26, 1960, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1.6161-1
Extension of time for paying tax or deficiency.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Tax shown or required to be shown on return.
A reasonable extension of the time for payment of the amount of any tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code and shown or required to be shown on any return, or for payment of the amount of any installment of such tax, may be granted by the district directors (including the Director of International Operations) at the request of the taxpayer. The period of such extension shall not be in excess of six months from the date fixed for payment of such tax or installment, except that if the taxpayer is abroad the period of the extension may be in excess of six months.
(2)
Deficiency.
The time for payment of any amount determined as a deficiency in respect of tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code, or for the payment of any part thereof, may, at the request of the taxpayer, be extended by the internal revenue officer to whom the tax is required to be paid for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date fixed for payment of the deficiency, as shown on the notice and demand, and, in exceptional cases, for a further period not in excess of 12 months. No extension of the time for payment of a deficiency shall be granted if the deficiency is due to negligence, to intentional disregard of rules and regulations, or to fraud with intent to evade tax.
(b)
Undue hardship required for extension.
An extension of the time for payment shall be granted only upon a satisfactory showing that payment on the due date of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired will result in an undue hardship. The extension will not be granted upon a general statement of hardship. The term “undue hardship” means more than an inconvenience to the taxpayer. It must appear that substantial financial loss, for example, loss due to the sale of property at a sacrifice price, will result to the taxpayer for making payment on
the due date of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired. If a market exists, the sale of property at the current market price is not ordinarily considered as resulting in an undue hardship.
(c)
Application for extension.
An application for an extension of the time for payment of the tax shown or required to be shown on any return, or for the payment of any installment thereof, or for the payment of any amount determined as a deficiency shall be made on Form 1127 and shall be accompanied by evidence showing the undue hardship that would result to the taxpayer if the extension were refused. Such application shall also be accompanied by a statement of the assets and liabilities of the taxpayer and an itemized statement showing all receipts and disbursements for each of the 3 months immediately preceding the due date of the amount to which the application relates. The application, with supporting documents, must be filed on or before the date prescribed for payment of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired. If the tax is required to be paid to the Director of International Operations, such application must be filed with him, otherwise, the application must be filed with the applicable district director referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of § 1.6091-2, regardless of whether the return is to be filed with, or tax is to be paid to, such district director. The application will be examined, and within 30 days, if possible, will be denied, granted, or tentatively granted subject to certain conditions of which the taxpayer will be notified. If an additional extension is desired, the request therefor must be made on or before the expiration of the period for which the prior extension is granted.
(d)
Payment pursuant to extension.
If an extension of time for payment is granted, the amount the time for payment of which is so extended shall be paid on or before the expiration of the period of the extension without the necessity of notice and demand. The granting of an extension of the time for payment of the tax or deficiency does not relieve the taxpayer from liability for the payment of interest thereon during the period of the extension. See section 6601 and § 301.6601-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration). Further, the granting of an extension of the time for payment of one installment of the tax does not extend the time for payment of subsequent installments.
(e)

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12140, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6950, 33 FR 5357, Apr. 4, 1968; T.D. 7260, 38 FR 4259, Feb. 12, 1973]
§ 1.6162-1
Extension of time for payment of tax on gain attributable to liquidation of personal holding companies.
(a)
In general.
(1) If it is shown to the satisfaction of the district director that undue hardship to the taxpayer will result from the payment of such portion of the amount determined as the tax under chapter 1 of the Code by the taxpayer as is attributable to the short-term or long-term capital gain derived by the taxpayer from the receipt by him of property other than money on a complete liquidation of a corporation to which section 331(a)(1) or 342 applies, the district director may grant an extension of time for the payment of such portion of the tax. For the meaning of the term “undue hardship”, see paragraph (b) of § 1.6161-1.
(2) The extension of time for payment shall be for a period not in excess of five years. The extension shall only be granted for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1956, and shall apply only if the corporation, for its taxable year preceding the year in which occurred the complete liquidation (or the first of the series of distributions in complete liquidation), was, under the law applicable to such taxable year, a personal holding company or a foreign personal holding company.
(b)
Requirement of bond.
As a condition to the granting of an extension of time for payment, the taxpayer will usually be required by the district director to furnish a bond as provided in section 6165 and the regulations thereunder. For other provisions with respect to bonds, see section 7101 and the regulations in part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
§ 1.6164-1
Extensions of time for payment of taxes by corporations expecting carrybacks.
(a)
In general.
If a corporation in any taxable year files a statement with respect to an expected net operating loss carryback from such taxable year, such corporation may extend the time for the payment of all or part of any tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code for the taxable year immediately preceding such taxable year to the extent and subject to the limitations provided in section 6164. A corporation may extend the time for payment with respect to only such taxes as meet the following requirements:
(1) The tax must be one imposed by subtitle A of the Code;
(2) The tax must be for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year of the expected net operating loss;
(3) The tax must be shown on the return or must be assessed within the taxable year of the expected net operating loss; and
(4) The tax must not have been paid or required to have been paid prior to the filing of the statement.
(b)
Statement for purpose of extending time for payment.
(1) The time for payment of the tax is automatically extended upon the filing of a statement on Form 1138 by the corporation with the district director for the district where the tax is payable. The statement on Form 1138 must be filled out in accordance with the instructions accompanying the form, and all information required by the form and the instructions must be furnished by the taxpayer. The district director, upon request, will furnish a receipt for any statement filed. Such receipt will show the date the statement was filed.
(2) The period of extension is that provided in section 6164(d) and § 1.6164-5 unless sooner terminated by action of either the district director or the corporation.
§ 1.6164-2
Amount of tax the time for payment of which may be extended.
(a)
Total amount to which extension may relate.
The total amount of tax the time for payment of which may be extended under section 6164 may not exceed the amount of the reduction of the taxes previously determined attributable to the expected carryback.
(b)
Amount of tax to which extension may relate.
(1) The taxpayer shall specify on Form 1138 the kind of tax and the amount thereof the time for payment of which is to be extended. The amount of tax to which an extension may relate shall not exceed the amount of such tax shown on the return as filed, increased by any amount assessed as a deficiency (or as interest or addition to the tax) prior to the date of filing the statement and decreased by any amount paid or required to be paid prior to such date. In determining the amount of tax required to be paid prior to the date of filing the statement, only the following amounts shall be taken into consideration:
(i) The amount of the tax shown on the return as filed; and
(ii) Any amount assessed as a deficiency (or as interest or addition to the tax) if the tenth day after notice and demand for its payment occurs prior to the date of the filing of the statement.
(2) Delinquent installments are to be considered amounts required to be paid prior to the date of filing the statement. In the case of any authorized extension of time under sections 6161 and 6162, the amount of tax the time for payment of which is so extended is not to be considered required to be paid prior to the end of such extension. Similarly, any amount assessed as a deficiency (or as interest or addition to the tax) is not to be considered required to be paid prior to the date of the filing of the statement unless the tenth day after notice and demand for its payment falls prior to the date of the filing of the statement.
(3) The taxpayer may choose to extend the time for payment of all of one or more taxes, or it may choose to extend the time for payment of portions of several taxes. The taxes chosen by the taxpayer need not be those taxes which are affected by the carryback.
§ 1.6164-3
Computation of the amount of reduction of the tax previously determined.
(a)
Tax previously determined.
The taxpayer is to determine the amount of the reduction, attributable to the expected carryback, in the aggregate of
the taxes previously determined for taxable years prior to the taxable year of the expected net operating loss. The tax previously determined is to be ascertained in accordance with the method prescribed in section 1314(a). Thus, the tax previously determined will be the tax shown on the return as filed, increased by any amounts assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies prior to the date of the filing of the statement, and decreased by any amounts abated, credited, refunded, or otherwise repaid prior to such date. Any items as to which the Internal Revenue Service and the taxpayer are in disagreement at the time of the filing of the statement shall be taken into account in ascertaining the tax previously determined only if, and to the extent that, they were reported in the return, or were reflected in any amounts assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies, or in any amounts abated, credited, refunded, or otherwise repaid, prior to the date of the filing of the statement. The tax previously determined will reflect the foreign tax credit and the credit for tax withheld at source provided in section 32.
(b)
Reduction attributable to the expected carryback.
The reduction, attributable to the expected carryback or related adjustments, in any tax previously determined is to be ascertained by applying the expected carryback as if it were a determined net operating loss carryback, in accordance with the provisions of section 172 and the regulations thereunder. Items must be taken into account only to the extent that such items were included in the return, or were reflected in amounts assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies, or in amounts abated, credited, refunded, or otherwise repaid, prior to the date of the filing of the statement. Thus, for example, if the taxpayer claims a deduction for depreciation of $10,000 in its return and the Internal Revenue Service asserts that only $4,000 is properly deductible, no change is to be made in the $10,000 depreciation deduction as shown by the taxpayer on his return unless a deficiency has been assessed, or an amount collected without assessment, prior to the date of filing of the statement as a result of a change in the depreciation deduction, or unless such change in the depreciation deduction was reflected in an amount abated, credited, refunded, or otherwise repaid prior to such date.

§ 1.6164-4
Payment of remainder of tax where extension relates to only part of the tax.
(a)
Time for payment.
If an extension of time relates to only part of the tax, the time for payment of the remainder of the tax shall be considered to be the dates on which payments would have been required if such remainder had been the tax and the taxpayer had elected to pay the tax in installments as provided in section 6152(a).
(b)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Corporation X, which keeps its books and makes its tax returns on the calendar year basis, filed its income tax return for 1956 on March 15, 1957. The corporation showed a tax of $1,000 on its return and paid 50 percent of such tax, or $500 on March 15, 1957. On June 3, 1957, Corporation X, pursuant to the provisions of section 6164, extended the time for payment of $400 of such tax. The remainder of the tax the time for payment of which was not so extended, i.e., $600, is to be considered the tax for purposes of determining when it is to be paid. The remainder is considered to be due on the dates on which payment would have been required if such remainder had been the tax. Since the taxable year ended on December 31, 1956, the tax is payable in two equal installments of $300 each on March 15, 1957, and June 17, 1957. The taxpayer, having paid $500 on March 15, 1957, will have $100 to pay on June 17, 1957.
§ 1.6164-5
Period of extension.
If the time for the payment of any tax has been extended pursuant to section 6164, such extension shall expire:
(a) On the last day of the month in which falls the last date prescribed by law (including any extension of time granted the taxpayer) for the filing of the return for the taxable year of the expected net operating loss; or
(b) If an application for a tentative carryback adjustment provided in section 6411 with respect to such loss is filed before the expiration of the period
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, on the date on which notice is mailed by registered mail prior to September 3, 1958, and by either registered or certified mail on and after September 3, 1958, to the taxpayer that such application is allowed or disallowed in whole or in part.
§ 1.6164-6
Revised statements.
(a)
Requirements and effect.
A corporation may file more than one statement under section 6164 with respect to any one taxable year. Each statement is to be considered a new statement and not an amendment of any prior statement. Each such new statement is to be in lieu of the last statement previously filed with respect to the taxable year. The new statement may extend the time for payment of a greater or lesser amount of tax than was extended under the prior statement or may change the kind of tax the time for payment of which is to be extended. The extension may not relate to any amount of tax which was paid or required to be paid prior to the date of filing the new statement. Any amount of tax the time for payment of which was extended under a prior statement, however, may continue to be extended under the new statement. If the amount the time for payment of which is extended under the new statement is less than the amount so extended under the last statement previously filed, the extension of time shall be terminated on the date the new statement is filed as to the difference between the two amounts. See § 1.6164-8 for the dates on which such difference must be paid. If a corporation pays any amount of tax, the time for payment of which was extended, prior to the date the extension would otherwise terminate, the extension with respect to such amount shall be deemed terminated, without regard to whether a new statement is filed, on the date such amount is paid. The corporation shall indicate on each new statement filed that it has already filed one or more prior statements with respect to the taxable year. The corporation shall likewise indicate the date each prior statement was filed and the amount of each tax the time for payment of which was extended under each prior statement.
(b)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Corporation Y, which keeps its books and makes its tax returns on the calendar year basis, filed its income tax return for 1956 on March 15, 1957, showing a tax of $100,000. At the same time it filed a statement under section 6164 in which it stated that it expected to have a net operating loss of $75,000 in 1957 and that the reduction in the tax previously determined for 1955 (the second taxable year preceding the year of the expected net operating loss) attributable to the expected net operating loss carryback resulting from such expected loss, would be $39,000. The corporation accordingly extended the time for payment of $39,000 of its income tax for 1956, and paid $30,500 (50 percent of the excess of $100,000 over $39,000) of such tax on March 15, 1957 (see section 6164(c) and § 1.6164-4). As a result of its operations during the next several months, the corporation filed a second statement on June 3, 1957, in which it stated that its expected net operating loss for 1957 would amount to $150,000 and that the corresponding reduction in the tax for 1955 would amount to $78,000. Corporation Y under the new statement may extend the time for payment of $30,500, the installment due on June 17, 1957, and the time for payment of the $39,000 extended under the first statement filed on March 15, 1957, may continue to be extended under the second statement. The $30,500 which was paid on March 15, 1957, will not be affected by the second statement filed on June 3, 1957.
§ 1.6164-7
Termination by district director.
(a)
After an examination of the statement filed by the corporation is made.
The district director is authorized to make such examination of the statements filed as he deems necessary and practicable. If, upon such examination as he may make, the district director believes that, as of the time he makes the examination, all or any part of the statement is in a material respect erroneous or unreasonable, he will terminate the extension as to any part of the amount to which such extension relates which he deems should be terminated.
(b)
Jeopardy.
If the district director believes that the collection of any amount to which an extension under section 6164 relates is in jeopardy, he will immediately terminate the extension. In the case of such a termination, notice and demand shall be made by
the district director for payment of such amount, and there may be no further extension of time under section 6164 with respect to such amount.
§ 1.6164-8
Payments on termination.
(a)
In general.
If an extension of time under section 6164 is terminated with respect to any amount either (1) by the filing of a new statement by the taxpayer under section 6164(e) extending the time for payment of a lesser amount than was extended in a prior statement, or (2) by action of the district director under section 6164(f) after making an examination of the statement filed by the corporation, no further extension of time may be made under section 6164 with respect to such amount. The time for payment of such amount shall be the dates on which payments would have been required if there had been no extension with respect to such amount and the taxpayer had elected under section 6152(a) to pay the tax in installments.
(b)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Corporation Z, which keeps its books and makes its tax returns on the calendar year basis, filed its income tax return for 1956 on March 15, 1957, showing a tax of $100,000. At the same time it filed a statement under section 6164 extending the time for payment of the entire $100,000 on the basis of an expected net operating loss carryback from 1957. On April 10, 1957, the corporation filed a new statement indicating that the reduction, attributable to the carryback from 1957, in its income tax for 1956, would only be $80,000, and thus terminated the above extension of $20,000. The time for payment of such $20,000 may not be extended again, and such $20,000 is payable as if it were the tax for 1956 and Corporation Z had elected to pay such tax in installments. That is, $10,000 is payable on March 15, 1957, and $10,000 payable on June 17, 1957. Inasmuch as the March 15 date had already passed when the Corporation Z terminated the extension with respect to the $20,000, $10,000 is payable immediately upon such termination, and the other installment of $10,000 is payable on June 17, 1957. This example would also apply if the extension of time for payment of the $20,000 were terminated instead by the district director on April 10, 1957.

§ 1.6165-1
Bonds where time to pay the tax or deficiency has been extended.
The district director, including the Director of International Operations, may, as a condition to the granting of an extension of time within which to pay any tax or any deficiency therein, require the taxpayer to furnish a bond in an amount not exceeding double the amount of the tax with respect to which the extension is granted. Such bond shall be furnished in accordance with the provisions contained in section 7101 and the regulations in part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).

(a)
Requirement.
A corporation, any organization subject to the tax imposed by section 511, and any private foundation subject to the tax imposed by section 4940, shall deposit all payments of tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (or treated as so imposed by section 6154(h)), including any payments of estimated tax, on or before the date otherwise prescribed for paying such tax.

taxes and certain taxes of tax-exempt organizations by electronic funds transfer, see § 31.6302-1(h) of this chapter. A taxpayer not required to deposit by electronic funds transfer pursuant to § 31.6302-1(h) of this chapter remains subject to the rules of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Failure to deposit.
For provisions relating to the penalty for failure to make a deposit within the prescribed time, see section 6656.

§ 1.6302-2
Deposit rules for tax withheld on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations.
(a)
Time for making deposits
—(1)
Deposits
—(i)
Monthly deposits.
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iv) of this section, every withholding agent that, pursuant to chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, has accumulated at the close of any calendar month an aggregate amount of undeposited taxes of $200 or more shall deposit such aggregate amount by the 15th day of the following month. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply if the withholding agent has made a deposit of taxes pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section to a quarter-monthly period that occurred during such month. If the 15th day of the following month is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia under section 7503, taxes will be treated as timely deposited if deposited on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. With respect to section 1446(a), this section applies only to a publicly traded partnership or nominee described in § 1.1446-4 and, with respect to section 1446(f), only to a publicly traded partnership or broker described in § 1.1446(f)-4.
(ii)
Quarter-monthly deposits.
If at the close of any quarter-monthly period within a calendar month, the aggregate amount of undeposited taxes required to be withheld pursuant to chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code is $2,000 or more, the withholding agent shall deposit such aggregate amount within 3 business days after the close of such quarter-monthly period. Business days include every calendar day other than Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays in the District of Columbia under section 7503. If any of the three weekdays following the close of a quarter-monthly period is a legal holiday under section 7503, the withholding agent has an additional day for each day that is a legal holiday by which to make the required deposit. For example, if the Monday following the close of a quarter-monthly period is New Year's Day, a legal holiday, the required deposit for the quarter-monthly period is not due until the following Thursday rather than the following Wednesday.
(iii)
Excess deposits.
The excess (if any) of a deposit over the actual taxes for a monthly or quarter-monthly deposit period shall be applied in order of time to each of the withholding agent's succeeding deposits with respect to the same calendar year, until exhausted, to the extent that the amount by which the taxes for a subsequent deposit period exceed the deposit for such subsequent deposit period.
(iv)
Annual deposits.
If at the close of December of each calendar year, the aggregate amount of undeposited taxes required to be withheld pursuant to chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code is less than $200, the withholding agent may deposit such aggregate amount by March 15 of the following calendar year. If such aggregate amount is not so deposited, it shall be remitted in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.1461-1.
(2)
Cross reference.
For rules relating to the adjustment of deposits, see §§ 1.1461-2(b) and 1.6414-1. For rules requiring payment of any undeposited tax, see § 1.1461-1.
(b)
Manner of payment
—(1)
Payments not required by electronic funds transfer.
A payment that is not required to be deposited by this section shall be made separately from a payment required by any other section. The payment may be submitted with the filed return. The
timeliness of the payment will be determined by the date payment is received by the Internal Revenue Service at the place prescribed for filing by regulations or forms and instructions, or if section 7502(a) applies, by the date the payment is treated as received under section 7502(a), or on the last day prescribed for filing the return (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return), whichever is later. Each withholding agent making payments under this section shall report on the return, for the period to which such payments are made, information regarding such payments according to the instructions that apply to such return.
(2)
Voluntary deposits.
An amount of tax which is not required to be deposited may nevertheless be deposited if the withholding agent so desires.
(3)
Separation of deposits.
A deposit required by paragraph (a) of this section for any period occurring in one calendar year shall be made separately from any deposit for any period occurring in another calendar year. In addition, a deposit required to be made by paragraph (a) of this section shall be made separately from a deposit required by any other section.
(4)
Multiple remittances.
A withholding agent may make one, or more than one, remittance of the amount required to be deposited if each remittance is accompanied by the applicable deposit form.
(5)
Time deemed paid.
In general amounts deposited under this section shall be considered as paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return (Form 1042) in respect of such tax (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing such return), or at the time deposited, whichever is later. For purposes of section 6511 and the regulations thereunder, relating to period of limitation on credit or refund, if an amount is so deposited prior to April 15th of a calendar year immediately succeeding the calendar year in which occurs the period for which such amount was so deposited, such amount shall be considered as paid on such April 15th.
(c)
Deposits by electronic funds transfer.
For the requirement to deposit taxes withheld on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations by electronic funds transfer, see § 31.6302-1(h) of this chapter. A taxpayer not required to deposit by electronic funds transfer pursuant to § 31.6302-1(h) of this chapter remains subject to the rules of paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Penalties for failure to make deposits.
For provisions relating to the penalty for failure to make a deposit within the prescribed time, see section 6656.

# ABATEMENTS, CREDITS, AND REFUNDS
§ 1.6411-1
Tentative carryback adjustments.
(a)
In general.
Any taypayer who has a net operating loss under section 172, a net capital loss under section 1211(a) which is a carryback under section 1212, an unused investment credit under section 46, or an unused work incentive program (WIN) credit under section 50A, may file an application under section 6411 for a tentative carryback adjustment of the taxes for taxable years prior to the taxable year of the net operating or capital loss or the unused credit, whichever is applicable, which are affected by the net operating loss carryback, the capital loss carryback, the unused investment credit carryback, or the unused WIN credit carryback, resulting from such loss or unused credit. The regulations under section 6411 shall apply with respect to investment credit carrybacks for taxable years ending after December 31, 1961, but only with respect to applications for tentative carryback adjustments for investment credit carrybacks filed after November 2, 1966. The regulations under section 6411 shall apply with respect to WIN credit carrybacks for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971. The right to file an application for a tentative carryback adjustment is not limited to corporations, but is available to any taxpayer otherwise entitled to carryback a loss or unused credit. A corporation may file an application for a tentative carryback adjustment even though it has not extended the time for payment of tax under section 6164. In
determining any decrease in tax under §§ 1.6411-1 through 1.6411-4, the decrease in tax is determined net of any increase in the tax imposed by section 56 (relating to the minimum tax for tax preferences).
(b)
Contents of application.
(1) The application for a tentative carryback adjustment shall be filed, in the case of a corporation, on Form 1139, and in the case of taxpayers other than corporations, on Form 1045. The application shall be filled out in accordance with the instructions accompanying the form, and all information required by the form and the instructions must be furnished by the taxpayer.
(2) An application for a tentative carryback adjustment does not constitute a claim for credit or refund. If such application is disallowed by the district director or director of a service center in whole or in part, no suit may be maintained in any court for the recovery of any tax based on such application. The filing of an application for a tentative carryback adjustment will not constitute the filing of a claim for credit or refund within the meaning of section 6511 for purposes of determining whether a claim for credit or refund was filed prior to the expiration of the applicable period of limitation. The taxpayer, however, may file a claim for credit or refund under section 6402 at any time prior to the expiration of the applicable period of limitation, and may maintain a suit based on such claim if it is disallowed or if the district director or director of a service center does not act on the claim within 6 months from the date it is filed. Such claim may be filed before, simultaneously with, or after the filing of the application for a tentative carryback adjustment. A claim for credit or refund under section 6402 filed after the filing of an application for a tentative carryback adjustment is not to be considered an amendment of such application. Such claim, however, in proper cases may constitute an amendment to a prior claim filed under section 6402.
(c)
Time and place for filing application.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph the application for a tentative carryback adjustment shall be filed on or after the date of the filing of the return for the taxable year of the net operating loss, net capital loss, unused investment credit, or unused WIN credit and shall be filed within a period of twelve months from the end of such taxable year. With respect to any portion of an investment credit carryback or a WIN credit carryback from a taxable year attributable to a net operating loss carryback or a capital loss carryback from a subsequent taxable year, the twelve-month period shall be measured from the end of such subsequent taxable year. In the case of an application for a tentative carryback adjustment attributable to the carryback of an unused investment credit, the twelve-month period for filing shall not expire before the close of December 31, 1966. Any application filed prior to the date on which the return for the taxable year of the loss or unused credit is filed shall be considered to have been filed on the date such return is filed. In the case of an application filed before April 15, 1968, the application shall be filed with the internal revenue officer to whom the tax was paid or by whom the assessment was made. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), in the case of an application filed after April 14, 1968, if the tax was paid to the Director of International Operations, the application shall be filed with him; otherwise the application shall be filed with the internal revenue office with which the return was filed.

§ 1.6411-2
Computation of tentative carryback adjustment.
(a)
Tax previously determined.
The taxpayer is to determine the amount of decrease, attributable to the carryback, in tax previously determined for each taxable year before the taxable year of the net operating loss, net capital loss, or unused investment credit. The tax previously determined is to be ascertained in accordance with the method prescribed in section
1314(a). Thus, the tax previously determined will be the tax shown on the return as filed, increased by any amounts assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies before the date of the filing of the application for a tentative carryback adjustment, and decreased by any amounts abated, credited, refunded, or otherwise repaid prior to that date. Any items as to which the Commissioner and the taxpayer are in disagreement at the time of the filing of the application shall, for purposes of § 1.6411-2, be taken into account in ascertaining the tax previously determined only if, and to the extent that, they were reported on the return, or were reflected in any amounts assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies, or in any amounts abated, credited, refunded, or otherwise repaid, before the date of filing the application. The tax previously determined, therefore, will reflect the foreign tax credit and the credit for tax withheld at source provided in section 33.
(b)
Decrease attributable to carryback.
After ascertaining the tax previously determined in the manner described in paragraph (a) of this section, the taxpayer shall determine the decrease in tax previously determined attributable to the carryback and any related adjustments on the basis of the items of tax taken into account in computing the tax previously determined. In determining any decrease attributable to the carryback or any related adjustment, items shall be taken into account under this subsection only to the extent that they were reported on the return, or were reflected in amounts assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies, or in amounts abated, credited, refunded, or otherwise repaid, before the date of filing the application for a tentative carryback adjustment. If the Commissioner and the taxpayer are in disagreement as to the proper treatment of any item, it shall be assumed, for purposes of determining the decrease in the tax previously determined, that the item was reported correctly by the taxpayer unless, and to the extent that, the disagreement has resulted in the assessment of a deficiency (or the collection of an amount without an assessment), or the allowing or making of an abatement, credit, refund, or other repayment, before the date of filing the application. Thus, if the taxpayer claimed a deduction on its return of $50,000 for salaries paid its officers but the Commissioner proposes that the deduction should not exceed $20,000, and the Commissioner and the taxpayer have not agreed on the amount properly deductible before the date the application for a tentative carryback adjustment is filed, $50,000 shall be considered as the amount properly deductible for purposes of determining the decrease in tax previously determined in respect of the application for a tentative carryback adjustment. In determining the decrease in tax previously determined, any items that are affected by the carryback must be adjusted to reflect the carryback. Thus, unless otherwise provided, any deduction limited, for example, by adjusted gross income, such as the deduction for medical, dental, etc., expenses, is to be recomputed on the basis of the adjusted gross income as affected by the carryback. See § 1.6411-3(d) for rules on the application of the decrease in tax to any tax liability.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
These regulations apply with respect to applications for tentative refund filed on or after August 27, 2007.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12144, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7301, 39 FR 973, Jan. 4, 1974; T.D. 9355, 72 FR 48933, Aug. 27, 2007; 72 FR 56619, Oct. 4, 2007; T.D. 9499, 75 FR 51934, Aug. 24, 2010]
§ 1.6411-3
Allowance of adjustments.
(a)
Time prescribed.
The Commissioner shall act upon any application for a tentative carryback adjustment filed under section 6411(a) within a period of 90 days from whichever of the following two dates is the later:
(1) The date the application is filed; or
(2) The last day of the month in which falls the last date prescribed by law (including any extension of time granted the taxpayer) for filing the return for the taxable year of the net operating loss, net capital loss, or unused investment credit from which the carryback results.
(b)
Examination.
Within the 90-day period described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Commissioner shall make, to the extent deemed practicable within this period, an examination of the application to discover omissions and errors of computation. The Commissioner shall determine within this period the decrease in tax previously determined, affected by the carryback or any related adjustments, upon the basis of the application and examination. The decrease shall be determined in the same manner as that provided in section 1314(a) for the determination by the taxpayer of the decrease in taxes previously determined, which must be set forth in the application for a tentative carryback adjustment. The Commissioner may correct any errors of computation or omissions discovered upon examination of the application. In determining the decrease in tax previously determined which is affected by the carryback or any related adjustment, the Commissioner may correct any mathematical error appearing on the application and may correct any modification required by the law and incorrectly made by the taxpayer in computing the net operating loss, net capital loss, or unused investment credit, the resulting carrybacks, or the net operating loss deduction, capital loss deduction, or investment credit allowable. If the required modification has not been made by the taxpayer and the Commissioner has the necessary information to make the modification within the 90-day period, the Commissioner may, in the Commissioner's discretion, make the modification. In determining the decrease, the Commissioner will not, for example, change the amount claimed on the return as a deduction for depreciation because the Commissioner believes that the taxpayer has claimed an excessive amount; and the Commissioner will not include in gross income any amount not so included by the taxpayer, even though the Commissioner believes that the amount is subject to tax and properly should be included in gross income.
(c)
Disallowance in whole or in part.
If the Commissioner finds that an application for a tentative carryback adjustment contains material omissions or errors of computation, the Commissioner may disallow the application in whole or in part without further action. If the Commissioner deems that any error of computation can be corrected within the 90-day period, the Commissioner may do so and allow the application in whole or in part. The Commissioner's determination as to whether the Commissioner can correct any error of computation within the 90-day period shall be conclusive. The Commissioner's action in disallowing, in whole or in part, any application for a tentative carryback adjustment shall be final and may not be challenged in any proceeding. The taxpayer may, however, file a claim for credit or refund under section 6402, and may maintain a suit based on the claim if the claim is disallowed or if the Commissioner does not act upon the claim within 6 months from the date it is filed.
(d)
Application of decrease.
(1) Each decrease determined by the Commissioner in any previously determined tax that is affected by the carryback or any related adjustments shall first be applied against any unpaid amount of the tax with respect to which such decrease was determined. The unpaid amount of tax may include one or more of the following:
(i) An amount with respect to which the taxpayer is delinquent;
(ii) An amount the time for payment of which has been extended under section 6164 and which is due and payable on or after the date of the allowance of the decrease.
(iii) An amount (not including an amount the time for payment of which has been extended under section 6164) which is due and payable on or after the date of the allowance of the decrease, including any assessed liabilities, unassessed liabilities determined in a statutory notice of deficiency, unassessed liabilities identified in a proof of claim filed in a bankruptcy proceeding, and other unassessed liabilities in rare and unusual circumstances.
(2) If the unpaid amount of tax includes more than one unpaid amount, the Commissioner may determine against which amount or amounts, and in what proportion, the decrease is to
be applied. In general, however, the decrease will be applied against any amounts described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section in the order named. If there are several amounts of the type described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, any amount of the decrease that is to be applied against the amount will be applied by assuming that the tax previously determined minus the amount of the decrease to be so applied is “the tax” and that the taxpayer had elected to pay the tax in installments. The unpaid amount of tax against which a decrease may be applied under paragraph (d)(1) of this section may not include any amount of tax for any taxable year other than the year of the decrease. After making the application, the Commissioner will credit any remainder of the decrease against any unsatisfied amount of any tax for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year of the net operating loss, capital loss, or unused investment credit, the time for payment of which has been extended under section 6164.
(3) Any remainder of the decrease after the application and credits may, within the 90-day period, in the discretion of the Commissioner, be credited against any tax liability or installment thereof then due from the taxpayer (including assessed liabilities, unassessed liabilities determined in a statutory notice of deficiency, unassessed liabilities identified in a proof of claim filed in a bankruptcy proceeding, and other unassessed liabilities in rare and unusual circumstances), and, if not so credited, shall be refunded to the taxpayer within the 90-day period.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
These regulations apply with respect to applications for tentative refund filed on or after August 27, 2007.

§ 1.6414-1
Credit or refund of tax withheld on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations.
(a)
In general.
Any withholding agent who for the calendar year pays more than the correct amount of:
(1) Tax required to be withheld under chapter 3 of the Code, or
(2) Interest, addition to the tax, additional amount, or penalty with respect to such tax,
may file a claim for credit or refund of the overpayment in the manner and subject to the conditions stated in the Procedure and Administration Regulations (Part 301 of this chapter) under section 6402, or may claim credit for the overpayment as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. With respect to the payment of withholding tax under section 1446, this section shall only apply to a publicly traded partnership described in § 1.1446-4. See § 1.1446-3(d)(2)(iv) for rules regarding refunds to a withholding agent under section 1446.
(b)
Claim for credit on Form 1042.
The withholding agent may claim credit of an overpayment described in paragraph (a) of this section for any calendar year by showing the amount of overpayment on the return on Form 1042 for such calendar year, which shall constitute a claim for credit under this paragraph. The claim for credit shall be evidenced by a statement on the return setting forth the amount determined as an overpayment and showing such other information as may be required by the instructions relating to the return. The amount claimed as a credit may be applied, to the extent it has not been applied under § 1.1461-2(b), by the withholding agent to reduce the amount of a payment or deposit of tax required by § 1.1461-1 or § 1.6302-2(a) for any payment period occurring in the calendar year following the calendar year of overwithholding. The amount so claimed as a credit shall also be entered on the annual return on Form 1042 for the calendar year following the calendar year of overwithholding and
shall be applied as a payment on account of the tax shown on such form. If the withholding agent files a claim for credit or refund of the overpayment on Form 843 in accordance with § 301.6402-2 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations), or a claim for refund of the overpayment on Form 1042 in accordance with § 301.6402-3 of such chapter, he may not claim credit for the overpayment under this paragraph.
(c)
Overpayment of amounts actually withheld.
No credit or refund to the withholding agent shall be allowed for the amount of any overpayment of tax which, after taking into account paragraph (b) of § 1.1464-1, the withholding agent has actually withheld from an item of income under chapter 3 of the Code.
(d)
Effective/Applicability date.
The last two sentences of paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to partnership taxable years beginning after April 29, 2008.

§ 1.6417-2
Rules for making elective payment elections.
(a)
Elective payment elections
—(1)
Elections by applicable entities
—(i)
In general.
An applicable entity that makes an elective payment election in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section will be treated as making a payment against the Federal income taxes imposed by subtitle A for the taxable year with respect to which an applicable credit is determined in the amount determined under paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii)
Disregarded entities.
If an applicable entity is the owner (directly or indirectly) of a disregarded entity that directly holds an applicable credit property, the applicable entity may make an elective payment election in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section for applicable credits determined with respect to the applicable credit property held directly by the disregarded entity.
(iii)
Undivided ownership interests.
If an applicable entity is a co-owner in an applicable credit property through an arrangement properly treated as a tenancy-in-common for Federal income
tax purposes, or through an organization that has made a valid election under section 761(a) of the Code to be excluded from the application of subchapter K of the Code, then the applicable entity's undivided ownership share of the applicable credit property will be treated as a separate applicable credit property owned by such applicable entity, and the applicable entity may make an elective payment election in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section for the applicable credits determined with respect to such applicable credit property.
(iv)
Partnerships and S corporations not applicable entities.
Partnerships and S corporations are not applicable entities described in § 1.6417-1(c), and thus are not eligible to make any election under paragraph (b) of this section, unless the partnership or S corporation is an electing taxpayer. This is the case no matter how many of the partners of a partnership are described in § 1.6417-1(c), including if all of a partnership's partners are so described.
(v)
Members of a consolidated group of which an applicable entity is the common parent.
In the case of a consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1) the common parent of which is an applicable entity, any member that is an electing taxpayer may make an elective payment election with respect to applicable credits determined with respect to the member. See § 1.1502-77 (providing rules regarding the status of the common parent as agent for its members).
(2)
Electing taxpayers
—(i)
Electing taxpayers that are not partnerships or S corporations.
An electing taxpayer other than a partnership or an S corporation that has made an elective payment election in accordance with § 1.6417-3 and paragraph (b) of this section will be treated as making a payment against the Federal income taxes imposed by subtitle A of the Code for the taxable year with respect to which the applicable credit is determined, in the amount determined under paragraph (c) of this section.

In the case of an electing taxpayer that is a partnership or S corporation that has made an elective payment election in accordance with §§ 1.6417-3 and 1.6417-4 and paragraph (b) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service will make a payment to such partnership or S corporation equal to the amount of such credit determined under paragraph (c) of this section and § 1.6417-4(d) (unless the partnership owes any Federal income tax liability, in which case the payment may be reduced by such tax liability).
(iii)
Partners and S corporation shareholders prohibited from making any elective payment election.
Under section 6417(c)(1) of the Code, any elective payment election with respect to applicable credit property held directly by a partnership or S corporation must be made by the partnership or S corporation. As provided under section 6417(c)(2), no partner in a partnership, or shareholder of an S corporation, may make an elective payment election with respect to any applicable credit determined with respect to such applicable credit property.
(iv)
Disregarded entities.
If an electing taxpayer is the owner (directly or indirectly) of a disregarded entity that directly holds any applicable credit property, the electing taxpayer may make an elective payment election in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section for applicable credits determined with respect to the applicable credit property held directly by the disregarded entity.

(vi)
Members of a consolidated group.
A member of a consolidated group may make an elective payment election
with respect to applicable credits determined with respect to the member.

(b)
Manner of making election
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Election is made on the annual tax return.
An elective payment election is made on the annual tax return, as defined in § 1.6417-1(b), in the manner prescribed by the IRS in guidance, along with any required completed source credit form(s) with respect to the applicable credit property, a completed Form 3800,
General Business Credit,
(or its successor), and any additional information, including supporting calculations, required in instructions.
(ii)
Election must be made on original return.
An election must be made on an original return (including any revisions on a superseding return) filed not later than the due date (including extensions of time) for the original return for the taxable year for which the applicable credit is determined. No elective payment election may be made for the first time on an amended return, withdrawn on an amended return, or made or withdrawn by filing an administrative adjustment request under section 6227 of the Code. A numerical error with respect to a properly claimed
elective payment election may be corrected on an amended return or by filing an administrative adjustment request under section 6227 if necessary; however, the applicable entity or electing taxpayer's original return, which must be signed under penalties of perjury, must contain all of the information, including a registration number, required by these final regulations. To properly correct an error on an amended return or administrative adjustment request under section 6227, an applicable entity or electing taxpayer must have made an error in the information included on the original return such that there is a substantive item to correct; an applicable entity or electing taxpayer may not correct a blank item or an item that is described as being “available upon request.” There is no relief available under § 301.9100-1 or § 301.9100-3 of this chapter for an elective payment election that is not timely filed; however, relief under § 301.9100-2(b) may apply if the applicable entity or electing taxpayer has not received an extension of time to file a return after the original due date, has timely filed a return, takes corrective action under § 301.9100-2(c) within the six-month extension period, and meets the procedural requirements outlined in § 301.9100-2(d).
(2)
Pre-filing registration required.
Pre-filing registration in accordance with § 1.6417-5 is a condition for making an elective payment election. An elective payment election will not be effective with respect to credits determined with respect to an applicable credit property unless the applicable entity or electing taxpayer received a valid registration number for the applicable credit property in accordance with § 1.6417-5(c) and provided the registration number for each applicable credit property on its Form 3800 (or its successor), and on any required completed source form(s) with respect to the applicable credit property, attached to the tax return, in accordance with guidance.
(3)
Due date for making the election.
To be effective, an elective payment election must be made no later than:
(i) In the case of any taxpayer for which no Federal income tax return is required under sections 6011 or no Federal return is required under 6033(a) of the Code (such as a State; the District of Columbia; an Indian Tribal government; any U.S. territory; a political subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. territory, or a subdivision of an Indian Tribal government; certain agencies or instrumentalities of a State, the District of Columbia, an Indian Tribal government, or a U.S. territory; or a taxpayer excluded from filing pursuant to section 6033(a)(3)), the 15th day of the fifth month after the end of the taxable year. For purposes of section 6417, an applicable entity that is not required to file a Federal income tax return pursuant to sections 6011 or a Federal return pursuant to 6033(a), but is filing solely to make an elective payment election, may choose whether to file its first return (and thus adopt a taxable year for purposes of section 6417) based upon a calendar or fiscal year, provided that such entity maintains adequate books and records, including a reconciliation of any difference between its regular books of account and its chosen taxable year, to support making an elective payment election on the basis of its chosen taxable year. Subject to issuance of guidance that specifies the manner in which an entity for which no Federal income tax return is required under sections 6011 or no Federal return is required pursuant to 6033(a) could request an extension of time to file and make the elective payment election, an automatic paperless six-month extension from the 15th day of the fifth month after the end of the taxable year is deemed to be allowed.
(ii) In the case of any taxpayer located in a U.S. territory, the due date (including extensions of time) that would apply if the taxpayer were located in the United States.
(iii) In any other case, the due date (including extensions of time) for the original return for the taxable year for which the election is made, but in no event earlier than February 13, 2023.
(4)
Election is not revocable
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, any elective payment election, once made, is irrevocable and applies with respect to any applicable credit for the taxable year for which the election is made.
(ii)
Election lasts for a period of years for certain credits.
For applicable entities making elective payment elections with respect to section 45 credits described in § 1.6417-1(d)(2) or section 45Y credits described in § 1.6417-1(d)(8), the election applies to each taxable year in the 10-year period provided in section 45(a)(2)(A)(ii) or 45Y(b)(1)(B), respectively, beginning on the date the facility was originally placed in service. For applicable entities making elective payment elections with respect to section 45Q credits described in § 1.6417-1(d)(3), the election applies to each taxable year in the 12-year period provided in section 45Q(a)(3)(A) or (4)(A) beginning on the date the carbon capture equipment was originally placed in service. For applicable entities making elective payment elections with respect to section 45V credits described in § 1.6417-1(d)(5), the election applies to the taxable year in which the qualified clean hydrogen production facility was originally placed in service and all subsequent taxable years.
(iii)
Electing taxpayers.
For electing taxpayers who make an elective payment election, the election applies for one five-year period per applicable credit property, but such election may be revoked once per applicable credit property, as provided in § 1.6417-3.
(5)
Scope of election.
An elective payment election applies to the entire amount of applicable credit(s) determined with respect to each applicable credit property that was properly registered for the taxable year, resulting in an elective payment amount that is the entire amount of applicable credit(s) determined with respect to the applicable entity or electing taxpayer for a taxable year.
(c)
Determination of applicable credit
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any applicable entity making an elective payment election, any applicable credit is determined—
(i) Without regard to section 50(b)(3) and (4)(A)(i) of the Code, and
(ii) By treating any property with respect to which such credit is determined as used in a trade or business of the applicable entity.
(2)
Effect of trade or business rule.
The trade or business rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section—
(i) Allows the applicable entity to treat an item of property as if it is: of a character subject to an allowance of depreciation (such as under sections 30C and 45W); one for which depreciation (or amortization in lieu of depreciation) is allowable (such as in sections 48, 48C, and 48E); and used to produce items in the ordinary course of a trade or business of the taxpayer (such as in sections 45V and 45X);
(ii) Allows the applicable entity to apply the capitalization and accelerated depreciation rules (such as sections 167, 168, 263, 263A, and 266 of the Code) that apply to determining the basis and the depreciation allowance for property used in a trade or business;
(iii) Makes applicable those credit limitations generally applicable to persons engaged in the conduct of a trade or business, such as section 49 of the Code in the context of investment tax credits and section 469 of the Code for all applicable credits;
(iv) Does not create any presumption that the trade or business is related (or unrelated) to a tax-exempt entity's exempt purpose; and
(v) Subjects the applicable entity to the credit limitation in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Special rule for investment-related credit property acquired with amounts, including income from certain grants and forgivable loans, that are exempt from taxation
—(i)
Amounts included in basis.
Subject to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, for purposes of section 6417, amounts that are exempt from taxation under subtitle A or otherwise excluded from taxation (such as income from certain grants and forgivable loans), and used to purchase, construct, reconstruct, erect, or otherwise acquire an applicable credit property described in section 30C, 45W, 48, 48C, or 48E (investment-related credit property) are included in basis for purposes of computing the applicable credit amount determined with respect to the applicable credit property, regardless of whether basis is required to be reduced (in whole or in part) by such amounts under general tax principles.
(ii)
No excess benefit from restricted tax exempt amounts.
If an applicable entity receives a grant, forgivable loan, or
other income exempt from taxation under subtitle A or otherwise excluded from taxation (tax exempt amount) for the specific purpose of purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring an investment-related credit property (restricted tax exempt amount), and the sum of any restricted tax exempt amounts plus the applicable credit otherwise determined with respect to that investment-related credit property exceeds the cost of the investment-related credit property, then the amount of the applicable credit is reduced so that the total amount of applicable credit plus the amount of any restricted tax exempt amounts equals the cost of investment-related credit property. The determination of whether a tax exempt grant is made for the specific purpose of purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring an investment-related credit property is made at the time the grant is awarded to the applicable entity. A tax exempt grant awarded after the investment-related credit property is purchased, constructed, reconstructed, erected, or otherwise acquired is generally not a restricted tax exempt amount unless approval of the grant was perfunctory and the amount of the grant was virtually assured at the time of application. The determination of whether a loan is made for the specific purpose of purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring an investment-related credit property and whether forgiveness of that loan is dependent on satisfying that specific purpose is made at the time the loan is approved. This paragraph does not apply if a tax exempt amount is not received for the specific purpose of purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring a property eligible for an investment-related credit; for example, if the tax exempt amount is from the organization's general funds or if such amount's use is not restricted to the purpose of purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring an investment-related credit property (such as purchasing an electric vehicle) and could be used for any of several different applicable credit properties (such as purchasing an electric vehicle or purchasing solar panels) or can be put to other purposes (such as purchasing an electric vehicle or making a building more energy efficient).
(4)
Credits must be determined with respect to the applicable entity or electing taxpayer.
Any credits for which an elective payment election is made must have been determined with respect to the applicable entity or electing taxpayer. An applicable credit is determined with respect to an applicable entity or electing taxpayer if the applicable entity or electing taxpayer owns the underlying applicable credit property and conducts the activities giving rise to the credit or, in the case of section 45X (under which ownership of applicable credit property is not required), to be considered (under the section 45X regulations) the taxpayer with respect to which the section 45X credit is determined. Thus, no election may be made under this section for any credits transferred pursuant to section 6418, allowed pursuant to section 45Q(f)(3), acquired by a lessee from a lessor by means of an election to pass through the credit to a lessee under former section 48(d) (pursuant to section 50(d)(5)), owned by a third party, or otherwise not determined with respect to the applicable entity or electing taxpayer.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c).
(i)
Example 1.
School district A receives a tax exempt grant in the amount of $400,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency to purchase electric school bus B. The grant is a restricted tax exempt amount described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. A purchases B for $400,000. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, A's basis in B is $400,000. B qualifies for the maximum section 45W credit, $40,000. However, because the amount of the restricted tax exempt grant plus the amount of the section 45W credit exceeds the cost of B, the no excess benefit rule found in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section applies. A's section 45W credit is reduced by the amount necessary so that the total amount of the section 45W credit plus the restricted tax exempt amount equals the cost of
B. A's section 45W credit is therefore reduced by $40,000 to zero.
(ii)
Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section (
Example 1
), except that the grant is in the amount of $300,000. This grant is still a restricted tax exempt amount described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. A purchases B using the grant and $100,000 of A's unrestricted funds. A's basis in B is still $400,000 and A's section 45W credit is $40,000. Since the amount of the restricted tax exempt amount plus the amount of the section 45W credit ($340,000) is less than the cost of B, A's 45W credit under section 6417(b)(6) is not subject to the no excess benefit rule found in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Example 3.
Public charity B receives a $60,000 grant from a private foundation to build energy property, P, a qualified investment credit property that costs $80,000. The $60,000 grant is a restricted tax exempt amount described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. B uses $20,000 of its own funds plus the $60,000 grant to build P. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, B's basis in P is $80,000. Assume that, based upon acquisition cost, B can earn a section 48 investment credit (with bonus credit amounts) of $40,000 (50% of basis). However, because the amount of the restricted tax exempt amount ($60,000) plus the section 48 credit ($40,000) exceeds P's cost by $20,000, the no excess benefit rule found in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section applies to reduce B's section 48 applicable credit by $20,000 so that the total amount of the section 48 investment credit plus the restricted tax exempt amount equals the cost of P.
(iv)
Example 4.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development annually provides Capital Funds to Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) for the development, financing, and modernization of public housing developments and for management improvements. Public Housing Authority H uses its annual allotment of Capital Funds to purchase rooftop solar panels for its property and to pay for the related equipment and labor to install the panels. These purchases are considered among the list of eligible uses, but are not the exclusive uses, of H's Capital Funds. Although the Capital Funds are exempt from taxation under subtitle A and used to purchase, construct, reconstruct, erect, or otherwise acquire an investment-related credit property, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, they are included in basis for purposes of computing the applicable credit amount determined with respect to the applicable credit property. In addition, because the Capital Funds were not given for the specific purpose of purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring an investment-related credit property, they are not considered restricted tax exempt amounts and the no excess benefit rule found in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section does not apply.
(v)
Example 5.
Taxpayer Q is engaged in the business of capturing carbon oxide. Q properly elects to be treated as an applicable entity with respect to the section 45Q credit determined with respect to single process trains A, B, and C for 2024. In the same year, Q also purchases section 45Q credits under section 6418 from an unrelated taxpayer and has section 45Q credits allowed to itself pursuant to section 45Q(f)(3). Q can make an elective payment election only with respect to section 45Q applicable credits determined with respect to A, B, and C. Q cannot make an elective payment election with respect to any credits transferred to Q pursuant to section 6418 or allowed to Q pursuant to section 45Q(f)(3).
(d)
Timing of payment.
Except as provided in § 1.6417-4(d) (relating to payments to partnerships and S corporations), the elective payment amount will be treated as made—
(1) In the case of any taxpayer for which no Federal income tax return is required under section 6011 or no Federal return is required under 6033(a), on the later of—
(i) The date that is the 15th day of the fifth month after the end of the taxable year, or
(ii) The date on which such taxpayer submits a claim for credit or refund in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) In any other case, on the later of—
(i) The due date (determined without regard to extensions) of the return for the taxable year, or
(ii) The date on which such return is filed.
(e)
Denial of double benefit
—(1)
In general.
Under section 6417(e), in the case of an applicable entity or electing taxpayer making an elective payment election with respect to an applicable credit, such credit is reduced to zero and is, for any other purposes of the Code, deemed to have been allowed as a credit to such entity or taxpayer for such taxable year. Paragraph (e)(2) and (3) of this section explain the application of the section 6417(e) denial of double benefit rule to an applicable entity or electing taxpayer (other than a partnership or S corporation). The application of section 6417(e) for an electing taxpayer that is a partnership or S corporation is provided in § 1.6417-4(c)(1)(ii).
(2)
Application of the denial of double benefit rule.
An applicable entity or electing taxpayer (other than an electing taxpayer that is a partnership or S corporation) making an elective payment election applies section 6417(e) by taking the following steps:
(i) Compute the amount of the Federal income tax liability (if any) for the taxable year, without regard to the general business credit allowed by section 38 of the Code (GBC), that is payable on the due date of the return (without regard to extensions), and the amount of the Federal income tax liability that may be offset by GBCs pursuant to the limitation based on amount of tax under section 38.
(ii) Compute the allowed amount of GBC carryforwards carried to the taxable year under section 38(a)(1) plus the amount of current year GBCs (including current applicable credits) for the taxable year under section 38(a)(2) and (b). Because the election is made on an original return for the taxable year for which the applicable credit is determined, any business credit carrybacks are not considered in determining the elective payment amount for the taxable year.
(iii) Calculate the net elective payment amount for all applicable credits, which equals the lesser of the sum of all applicable credits for which an elective payment election is made or the excess (if any, otherwise the excess is zero) of the total GBC credits described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section over the amount of the Federal income tax liability that may be offset by GBCs pursuant to the limitation based on amount of tax under section 38 computed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. Treat the net elective payment amount of all applicable credits for which an elective payment election is made as a payment against the tax imposed by subtitle A for the taxable year with respect to which such credits are determined.
(iv) Excluding the net elective payment amount determined under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, but including any applicable credits that are not part of the net elective payment amount, compute the allowed amount of GBC carryforwards carried to the taxable year plus the amount of current year GBCs allowed for the taxable year under section 38 (including, for clarity purposes, the ordering rules in section 38(d)). Apply these GBCs against the tax liability computed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.
(v) Reduce the applicable credits for which an elective payment election is made by the net elective payment amount, as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, and by the amount (if any) allowed as a GBC under section 38 for the taxable year, as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, which results in the applicable credits being reduced to zero.
(3)
Use of applicable credit for other purposes.
The full amount of the applicable credits for which an elective payment election is made is deemed to have been allowed for all other purposes of the Code, including, but not limited to, the basis reduction and recapture rules imposed by section 50 and calculation of tax, calculation of the amount of any underpayment of estimated tax under sections 6654 and 6655 of the Code, and the addition to tax for the failure to pay under section 6651(a)(2) of the Code (if any).
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e).
(i)
Example 1.
U is a tax-exempt university that is not a trust subject to
section 469 and is described in section 501(c)(3). U's fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. U places in service P, energy property eligible for a section 48 credit, in June 2024. P is an asset used in connection with its unrelated business. U completes the pre-filing registration in accordance with § 1.6417-5 as an applicable entity that has placed P into service and intends to make an elective payment election with respect to section 48 credits determined with respect to P. U timely files its 2024 Form 990-T on November 15, 2024. On its return, U properly determines that it has $500,000 of Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) under section 512. On its Form 3800 attached to its return, U calculates its limitation of GBC under section 38(c) (simplified) is $375,000 (paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section). U attaches Form 3468 to claim a section 48 credit of $100,000 with respect to P (its GBC for the taxable year) (paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section). Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the net elective payment amount is $0, so the section 48 credit is considered a credit that reduces U's UBIT liability to $400,000 under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section. U pays its $400,000 tax liability on November 15, 2024. Under paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section, the $100,000 of section 48 credit is reduced by the $100,000 of applicable credits claimed as GBCs for the taxable year, which results in the applicable credits being reduced to zero. However, the $100,000 of current year section 48 credit is deemed to have been allowed to U for 2024 for all other purposes of the Code (paragraph (e)(3) of this section).
(ii)
Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section (
Example 1),
except that U has $80,000 of Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) under section 512 and calculates its limitation of GBC under section 38(c) (simplified) is $60,000 (paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section). Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the net elective payment amount is $40,000 (lesser of $100,000 applicable section 48 credit or $100,000 of total GBC credits described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section minus $60,000 of section 38(c) limitation). Under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, U uses $60,000 of its $100,000 of section 48 credit against its tax liability. U reduces its applicable credit by the $40,000 net elective payment amount determined in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section and by the $60,000 section 48 credit claimed against tax in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, resulting in the applicable credit being reduced to zero (paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section). When the IRS processes U's 2024 Form 990-T, the net elective payment amount results in a $20,000 refund to U (after applying $20,000 of the $40,000 net elective payment amount to cover U's tax shown on the return). However, for other purposes of the Code, the $100,000 section 48 credit is deemed to have been allowed to U for 2024 (paragraph (e)(3) of this section).
(iii)
Example 3.
V is a city located in the United States that never has Federal income tax liability, so paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section does not apply. V timely completes pre-filing registration in accordance with § 1.6417-5 as an applicable entity that will be eligible to make an elective payment election, with regard to its annual accounting period ending in 2024, for the credit determined under section 30C(a) from properties A, B, and C; the credit determined under section 45(a) for facility D; the credit determined under section 45U(a) for facility E; the credit determined under section 45W(a) with respect to vehicles F, G, and H; and the credit determined under section 48(a) with respect to property I and J. V timely files its 2024 Form 990-T. V properly completes and attaches the relevant source credit forms and Form 3800 with registration numbers and all required information in the instructions, properly making the elective payment election for all of the credits, and properly determining that the amount of applicable credits determined with respect to A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J is $500,000 (its GBC for the taxable year) (paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section). Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the net elective payment amount is $500,000. Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the entire $500,000 net elective payment amount is a payment against the tax imposed by subtitle A for the taxable year with respect to which such credits
are determined. When the IRS processes V's 2024 Form 990-T, the net elective payment amount results in a $500,000 refund to V. V's elective payment amount is reduced by the net elective payment amount, so all applicable credits for 2024 are reduced to zero (paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section). However, for other purposes of the Code, the $500,000 of applicable credits are deemed to have been allowed to V for its annual accounting period ending in 2024 (paragraph (e)(3) of this section).
(iv)
Example 4.
W is a business taxpayer engaged in the manufacturing of components, including eligible components as defined in section 45X(c)(1) at facility F. W completes pre-filing registration in accordance with § 1.6417-5 stating that it intends to elect to be treated as an applicable entity with respect to eligible components produced at F in 2024. In 2025, W timely files its 2024 return electing to be treated as an applicable entity, calculating its Federal income tax before GBCs of $125,000 and that its limitation of GBC under section 38(c) (simplified) is $100,000 (paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section). W attaches Form 7207 to claim a current section 45X credit of $50,000 with respect to eligible components produced at F (its applicable credits). W also attaches Form 5884 to claim a current work opportunity tax credit (WOTC) of $50,000 (WOTC is not an applicable credit). W also has business credit carryforwards of $25,000, which together with the 45X credit and WOTC results in a total of $125,000 of GBC for the taxable year (paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section). Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the net elective payment amount is $25,000. Under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, including using the ordering rules in section 38(d), W is allowed $25,000 of the carryforwards, $50,000 of WOTC plus only $25,000 of section 45X credit against net income tax, as defined under section 38(c)(1)(B). The $25,000 of unused section 45X credit is the net elective payment amount that results in a $25,000 payment against tax by W (paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section). On its return, W shows net tax liability of $25,000 ($125,000-$100,000 allowed GBC) and the net elective payment of $25,000 that W applied to net tax liability, resulting in zero tax owed on the return. Under paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section, W's applicable credit is reduced by the $25,000 of the net elective payment amount, as well as by the $25,000 of section 45X credit claimed as a GBC for the taxable year, resulting in the $50,000 of applicable credit being reduced to zero. However, for all other purposes of the Code, the $50,000 of 45X applicable credits are deemed to have been allowed to W for 2024 (paragraph (e)(3) of this section). Even though W did not owe tax after applying the net elective payment amount against its net tax liability, W may be subject to the section 6655 penalty for failure to pay estimated income tax. The net elective payment is not an estimated tax installment, rather, it is treated as a payment made at the filing of the return.
(v)
Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section (
Example 4),
except W filed the return on a timely filed extension after the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Even though the net elective payment amount is sufficient to cover W's tax liability, W may also be subject to the section 6651(a)(2) penalty for failure to pay tax.
(vi)
Example
6. Assume the same facts as in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section (
Example 4),
except W's activities gave rise to a $100,000 section 45Q credit and W filed a Form 8933,
Carbon Oxide Sequestration Tax Credit,
instead of a $50,000 section 45X credit and Form 7207. Assume also that W's activities gave rise to a $50,000 small employer health insurance credit under section 45R (section 45R credit) and W filed Form 8941,
Credit for Small Employer Health Insurance Premiums,
instead of a $50,000 WOTC and Form 5884. Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the net elective payment amount is $75,000. Under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, including using the ordering rules in section 38(d), W is allowed $25,000 of the carryforwards, $25,000 of the section 45Q credit, plus its $50,000 of section 45R credit against net income tax, as defined under section 38(c)(1)(B). The $75,000 of unused section 45Q credit that is the net elective payment amount results in a $75,000 payment against tax
by W (paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section). On its return, W shows net tax liability of $25,000 ($125,000-$100,000 allowed GBC) and the net elective payment amount of $75,000 that W applied to net tax liability, resulting in a refund of $50,000. Under paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section, W's applicable credit is reduced by the $75,000 of the net elective payment amount, as well as by the $25,000 of section 45Q credit claimed as a GBC for the taxable year, resulting in the $100,000 of applicable credit being reduced to zero. However, for all other purposes of the Code, the $100,000 of section 45Q applicable credits are deemed to have been allowed to W for 2024 (paragraph (e)(3) of this section).
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years ending on or after March 11, 2024. For taxable years ending before March 11, 2024, taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§ 1.6417-1 through 1.6417-4 and 1.6417-6, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.

(e)
Election for electing taxpayers
—(1)
In general.
If an electing taxpayer
makes an elective payment election under § 1.6417-2(b) with respect to any taxable year in which the electing taxpayer places in service a qualified clean hydrogen production facility for which a section 45V credit is determined, places in service a single process train at a qualified facility for which a section 45Q credit is determined, or produces, after December 31, 2022, eligible components (as defined in section 45X(c)(1)) at a facility, respectively, the electing taxpayer will be treated as an applicable entity for purposes of making an elective payment election for such taxable year and during the election period described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, but only with respect to the applicable credit property described in § 1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), or (7), as applicable, that is the subject of the election. The taxpayer must otherwise meet all requirements to earn the credit in the electing year and in each succeeding year during the election period described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(2)
Election is per applicable credit property.
An elective payment election under § 1.6417-2(b) is made separately for each applicable credit property, which is, respectively, a qualified clean hydrogen production facility placed in service for which a section 45V credit is determined, a single process train placed in service at a qualified facility for which a section 45Q credit is determined, or a facility at which eligible components are produced for which a section 45X credit is determined. An electing taxpayer may only make one election with respect to any specific applicable credit property.
(3)
Election period
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, if an electing taxpayer makes an elective payment election under § 1.6417-2(b) with respect to applicable credit property described in § 1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), or (7) for which an applicable credit is determined under § 1.6417-1(d)(3), (5), or (7), the election period during which such election applies includes the taxable year for which the election is made and each of the four subsequent taxable years that end before January 1, 2033. The election period cannot be less than a taxable year but may be made for a taxable period of less than 12 months within the meaning of section 443 of the Code.
(ii)
Revocation of election.
An electing taxpayer may, during a subsequent year of the election period described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, revoke the elective payment election with respect to an applicable credit property described in § 1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), or (7), in accordance with forms and instructions.
See
§ 601.602 of this chapter. Any such revocation, if made, applies to the taxable year for which the revocation is made (which cannot be less than a taxable year but may be made for a taxable period of less than 12 months as described in section 443 of the Code) and each subsequent taxable year within the election period. Any such revocation may not be subsequently revoked.
(4)
No transfer election under section 6418(a) permitted while an elective payment election is in effect.
No transfer election under section 6418(a) may be made by an electing taxpayer with respect to any applicable credit under § 1.6417-1(d)(3), (5), or (7) determined with respect to applicable credit property described in § 1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), or (7) during the election period for that applicable credit property. However, if the election period is no longer in effect with respect to an applicable credit property, any credit determined with respect to such applicable credit property can be transferred pursuant to a transfer election under section 6418(a), as long as the taxpayer meets the requirements of section 6418 and the 6418 regulations.
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years ending on or after March 11, 2024. For taxable years ending before March 11, 2024, taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§ 1.6417-1 through 1.6417-4 and 1.6417-6, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.
[TD 9988, 89 FR 17584, Mar. 11, 2024]
§ 1.6417-4
Elective payment election for electing taxpayers that are partnerships or S corporations.
(a)
In general.
In the case of any applicable credit determined with respect to any applicable credit property described in § 1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), or (7) that
is held directly (or treated as held directly because it is held by a disregarded entity) by an electing taxpayer that is a partnership or S corporation, any elective payment election under § 1.6417-2(b) must be made by the partnership or S corporation.
(b)
Elections.
If an electing taxpayer that is a partnership or S corporation makes an elective payment election under § 1.6417-2(b) with respect to any taxable year in which the electing taxpayer places in service applicable credit property described in § 1.6417-1(e)(3) or (5), or produces, after December 31, 2022, eligible components (as defined in section 45X(c)(1)) at an applicable credit property described in § 1.6417-1(e)(7), the electing taxpayer will be treated as an applicable entity for purposes of making an elective payment election for such taxable year and during the election period described in § 1.6417-3(e)(3), but only with respect to the applicable credit property described in § 1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), or (7), respectively, that is the subject of the election. In addition, the taxpayer must otherwise meet all requirements to earn the credit in the electing year and in each succeeding year during the election period described in § 1.6417-3(e)(3).
(c)
Effect of election
—(1)
In general.
If a partnership or S corporation electing taxpayer makes an elective payment election, with respect to the section 45V, 45Q, or 45X credit—
(i) The Internal Revenue Service will make a payment to such partnership or S corporation equal to the amount of such credit, determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section (unless the partnership or S corporation owes a Federal tax liability, in which case the payment may be reduced by such tax liability);
(ii) Before determining any partner's distributive share, or S corporation shareholder's pro rata share, of such credit, such credit is reduced to zero and is, for any other purposes under the Code, deemed to have been allowed solely to such entity (and not allocated or otherwise allowed to its partners or shareholders) for such taxable year;
(iii) Any amount with respect to which such election is made is treated as tax exempt income for purposes of sections 705 and 1366 of the Code;
(iv) A partner's distributive share of such tax exempt income is equal to such partner's distributive share of the otherwise applicable credit for each taxable year, as determined under § 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii);
(v) An S corporation shareholder's pro rata share (as determined under section 1377(a) of the Code) of such tax exempt income for each taxable year (as determined under sections 444 and 1378(b) of the Code) is equal to the S corporation shareholder's pro rata share (as determined under section 1377(a)) of the otherwise applicable credit for each taxable year; and
(vi) Such tax exempt income resulting from such election is treated as received or accrued, including for purposes of sections 705 and 1366, as of the date the applicable credit is determined with respect to the partnership or S corporation (such as, for investment credit property, the date the property is placed in service).
(2)
Electing partnerships in tiered structures.
If a partnership (upper-tier partnership) is a direct or indirect partner of a partnership that makes an elective payment election (electing partnership) and directly or indirectly receives an allocation of tax exempt income resulting from the elective payment election made by the electing partnership, the upper-tier partnership must determine its partners' distributive shares of such tax exempt income in proportion to the partners' distributive shares of the otherwise applicable credit as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.
(3)
Character of tax exempt income.
Tax exempt income resulting from an elective payment election by an S corporation or a partnership is treated as arising from an investment activity and not from the conduct of a trade or business within the meaning of section 469(c)(1)(A) of the Code. As such, the tax exempt income is not treated as passive income to any partners or shareholders who do not materially participate within the meaning of section 469(c)(1)(B).
(d)
Determination of amount of the credit
—(1)
In general.
In determining the amount of an applicable credit that
will result in a payment under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the partnership or S corporation must compute the amount of the applicable credit allowable as if an elective payment election were not made. Because a partnership or S corporation is not subject to sections 38(b) and (c) and 469 (that is, those sections apply at the partner or S corporation shareholder level), the amount of applicable credit determined by a partnership or S corporation is not subject to limitation by those sections. In addition, because the only applicable credits with respect to which a partnership or S corporation may make an elective payment election are not investment credits under section 46 of the Code, sections 49 and 50 of the code do not apply to limit the amount of the applicable credits.
(2)
Example.
The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated in the following example. A and B each contributed cash to P, a calendar-year partnership, for the purpose of manufacturing clean hydrogen at V, a qualified clean hydrogen facility that meets the definition of section 45V(c)(3). The partnership agreement provides that A and B share equally in all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of P. P completes the pre-filing registration process with respect to the section 45V credit at V for 2023 in accordance § 1.6417-5. P places V in service in 2023. P timely files its 2023 Form 1065 and properly makes the elective payment election in accordance with §§ 1.6417-2(b),1.6417-3, and 1.6417-4. On its Form 1065, P properly determined that the amount of the section 45V credit with respect to the clean hydrogen produced at V for 2023 is $100,000. The IRS processes P's return and makes a $100,000 payment to P. Before determining A's and B's distributive shares, P reduces the credit to zero. While the $100,000 section 45V credit is deemed to have been allowed to P for 2023 for any other purpose under this title, the credit is not allocated or otherwise allowed to its partners. The $100,000 is treated as tax exempt income for purposes of section 705 and is treated as arising from an investment activity and not from the conduct of a trade or business within the meaning of section 469(c)(1)(A). P allocates the tax exempt income from the elective payment election proportionately among the partners based on each partner's distributive share of the otherwise eligible section 45V credit as determined under § 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii). Under that section, if partnership receipts or expenditures give rise to a credit, the partner's interest in the partnership with respect to such credit is in the same proportion as such partners' distributive shares of such receipt, loss, or deduction. Section 45V credits arise based on the amount of clean hydrogen produced at a facility. Under the partnership agreement, A and B share all items equally. Thus, A and B will each be allocated $50,000 of tax exempt income for 2023. P will continue to be treated as an applicable entity with respect to V for taxable years 2024-2027 unless P revokes its election in accordance with § 1.6417-3(e)(3)(ii). At the end of 2023, A and B increase their respective tax bases in their partnership interest and capital accounts by $50,000 each (that is, their share of the $100,000 of tax exempt income).

§ 1.6417-5
Additional information and registration.
(a)
Pre-filing registration and election.
An applicable entity or electing taxpayer is required to satisfy the pre-filing registration requirements in paragraph (b) of this section as a condition of, and prior to, making an elective payment election. An applicable entity or electing taxpayer must use the pre-filing registration process to register itself as intending to make the elective payment election, to list all applicable credits it intends to claim, and to list
each applicable credit property that contributed to the determination of such credits as part of the pre-filing submission (or amended submission). An applicable entity or electing taxpayer that does not obtain a registration number under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or report the registration number on its annual tax return, as defined in § 1.6417-1(b), pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section with respect to an otherwise applicable credit property, is ineligible to receive any elective payment amount with respect to the amount of any credit determined with respect to that applicable credit property. However, completion of the pre-filing registration requirements and receipt of a registration number does not, by itself, mean the applicable entity or electing taxpayer is eligible to receive a payment with respect to the applicable credits determined with respect to the applicable credit property.
(b)
Pre-filing registration requirements
—(1)
Manner of pre-filing registration.
Unless otherwise provided in guidance, an applicable entity or electing taxpayer must complete the pre-filing registration process electronically through the IRS electronic portal and in accordance with the instructions provided therein.
(2)
Pre-filing registration and election for members of a consolidated group.
A member of a consolidated group is required to complete pre-filing registration as a condition of, and prior to, making an elective payment election.
See
§ 1.1502-77 (providing rules regarding the status of the common parent as agent for its members).
(3)
Timing of pre-filing registration.
An applicable entity or electing taxpayer must satisfy the pre-filing registration requirements of this paragraph (b) and receive a registration number under paragraph (c) of this section prior to making an elective payment election under § 1.6417-2(b) on the applicable entity's or electing taxpayer's annual tax return for the taxable year at issue.
(4)
Each applicable credit property must have its own registration number.
An applicable entity or electing taxpayer must obtain a registration number for each applicable credit property with respect to which it intends to make an elective payment election.
(5)
Information required to complete the pre-filing registration process.
Unless modified in future guidance, an applicable entity or electing taxpayer must provide the following information to the IRS to complete the pre-filing registration process:
(i) The applicable entity's or electing taxpayer's general information, including its name, address, taxpayer identification number, and type of legal entity.
(ii) Any additional information required by the IRS electronic portal, such as information regarding the taxpayer's exempt status under section 501(a) of the Code; that the applicable entity is a political subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. territory, or subdivision of an Indian tribal government; or that the applicable entity is an agency or instrumentality of a State, the District of Columbia, an Indian tribal government, or a U.S. territory.
(iii) The taxpayer's taxable year.
(iv) The type of annual tax return(s) normally filed by the applicable entity or electing taxpayer, or that the applicable entity or electing taxpayer does not normally file an annual tax return with the IRS.
(v) The type of applicable credit(s) for which the applicable entity or electing taxpayer intends to make an elective payment election.
(vi) For each applicable credit, each applicable credit property that the applicable entity or electing taxpayer intends to use to determine the credit for which the applicable entity or electing taxpayer intends to make an elective payment election.
(vii) For each applicable credit property listed in paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section, any further information required by the IRS electronic portal, such as—
(A) The type of applicable credit property;
(B) Physical location (that is, address and coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the applicable credit property);
(C) Supporting documentation relating to the construction or acquisition of the applicable credit property (such as State, District of Columbia, Indian
tribal, U.S. territorial, or local government permits to operate the applicable credit property; certifications; evidence of ownership that ties to a land deed, lease, or other documented right to use and access any land or facility upon which the applicable credit property is constructed or housed; U.S. Coast Guard registration numbers for offshore wind vessels; and the vehicle identification number of an eligible clean vehicle with respect to which a section 45W credit is determined);
(D) The beginning of construction date and the placed in service date of the applicable credit property,
(E) If an investment-related credit property (as defined § 1.6417-2(c)(3)), the source of funds the taxpayer used to acquire the property; and
(F) Any other information that the applicable entity or electing taxpayer believes will help the IRS evaluate the registration request.
(viii) The name of a contact person for the applicable entity or electing taxpayer. The contact person is the person whom the IRS may contact if there is an issue with the registration. The contact person must either possess legal authority to bind the applicable entity or electing taxpayer or must provide a properly executed power of attorney on Form 2848,
Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative.
(ix) A penalties of perjury statement, effective for all information submitted as a complete application, and signed by a person with personal knowledge of the relevant facts that is authorized to bind the registrant.
(x) Any other information the IRS deems necessary for purposes of preventing duplication, fraud, improper payments, or excessive payments under this section that is provided in guidance.
(c)
Registration number
—(1)
In general.
The IRS will review the information provided and will issue a separate registration number for each applicable credit property for which the applicable entity or electing taxpayer provided sufficient verifiable information.
(2)
Registration number is only valid for one taxable year.
A registration number is valid only with respect to the applicable entity or electing taxpayer that obtained the registration number under this section and only for the taxable year for which it is obtained.
(3)
Renewing registration numbers.
If an elective payment election will be made with respect to an applicable credit property for a taxable year after a registration number under this section has been obtained, the applicable entity or electing taxpayer must renew the registration for that subsequent taxable year in accordance with applicable guidance, including attesting that all the facts previously provided are still correct or updating any facts.
(4)
Amendment of previously submitted registration information if a change occurs before the registration number is used.
As provided in instructions to the pre-filing registration portal, if specified changes occur with respect to one or more applicable credit properties for which a registration number has been previously obtained but not yet used, an applicable entity or electing taxpayer must amend the registration (or may need to submit a new registration) to reflect these new facts. For example, if the owner of a facility previously registered for an elective payment election for applicable credits determined with respect to that facility and the facility undergoes a change of ownership (incident to a corporate reorganization or an asset sale) such that the new owner has a different employer identification number (EIN) than the owner who obtained the original registration, the original owner of the facility must amend the original registration to disassociate its EIN from the applicable credit property and the new owner must submit separately an original registration (or if the new owner previously registered other credit properties, must amend its original registration) to associate the new owner's EIN with the previously registered applicable credit property. If the change of ownership is with respect to an electing taxpayer, then the 5-year election period will continue despite the change in ownership.
(5)
Registration number is required to be reported on the return for the taxable year of the elective payment election.
The applicable entity or electing taxpayer must include the registration number of the applicable credit property on its annual tax return as provided in
§ 1.6417-2(b) for the taxable year. The IRS will treat an elective payment election as ineffective with respect to an applicable credit determined with respect to an applicable credit property for which the applicable entity or electing taxpayer does not include a valid registration number that was assigned to that particular taxpayer during the pre-registration process on the annual tax return.
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years ending on or after March 11, 2024.
[TD 9988, 89 FR 17584, Mar. 11, 2024]
§ 1.6417-6
Special rules.
(a)
Excessive payment
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any elective payment amount that the IRS determines constitutes an excessive payment, the tax imposed on such entity by chapter 1, regardless of whether such entity or taxpayer would otherwise be subject to chapter 1 tax, for the taxable year in which such determination is made will be increased by an amount equal to the sum of—
(i) The amount of such excessive payment, plus
(ii) An amount equal to 20 percent of such excessive payment.
(2)
Reasonable cause.
The amount described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section will not apply to an applicable entity or electing taxpayer if the applicable entity or electing taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the IRS that the excessive payment resulted from reasonable cause.
(3)
Excessive payment defined.
For purposes of this section, the term
excessive payment
means, with respect to an applicable credit property for which an elective payment election is made under § 1.6417-2(b) for any taxable year, an amount equal to the excess of—
(i) The amount treated as a payment under § 1.6417-2(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), or the amount of the payment made pursuant to § 1.6417-2(a)(2)(ii), with respect to such applicable credit property for such taxable year, over
(ii) The amount of the credit that, without application of this section, would be otherwise allowable under the Code (as determined pursuant to § 1.6417-2(c) and (e) or § 1.6417-4(d)(1) and (3), and without regard to the limitation based on tax in section 38(c)) with respect to such applicable credit property for such taxable year. For purposes of this section, the amount of such credit that would be otherwise allowable is the amount claimed on an original or amended return, including any administrative adjustment request under section 6227.
(4)
Example.
This example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (a). B, an instrumentality of State M, places in service in 2023 facility F, which is eligible for the energy credit determined under section 48. B properly completes the pre-filing registration as an applicable entity that will earn the energy credit from F in accordance with § 1.6417-5, and receives a registration number for F. B timely files its 2023 Form 990-T, properly providing the registration number for F and otherwise complying with § 1.6417-2(b). On its Form 990-T, B calculates that the amount of energy credit determined with respect to F is $100,000 and that the net elective payment amount is $100,000. B receives a refund in the amount of $100,000. In 2025, the IRS determines that the amount of energy credit properly allowable to B in 2023 with respect to F (as determined pursuant to § 1.6417-2(c) and (e) and without regard to the limitation based on tax in section 38(c)) was $60,000. B is unable to show reasonable cause for the difference. The excessive payment amount is $40,000 ($100,000 treated as a payment−$60,000 allowable amount). In 2025, the tax imposed under chapter 1 on B is increased in the amount of $48,000 ($40,000 + (20% * $40,000).)
(b)
Basis reduction and recapture
—(1)
In general.
Rules similar to the rules of section 50 (without regard to section 50(b)(3) and (4)(A)(i)) apply for purposes of this section.
(2)
Reporting recapture.
Any reporting of recapture is made on the annual tax return of the applicable entity or electing taxpayer in the manner prescribed by the IRS in any guidance, along with supplemental forms such as Form 4255,
Recapture of Investment Credit.
(3)
Example.
This example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (b). In December 2023, G, a government entity, places in service P, which is energy property eligible for the energy credit
determined under section 48 (section 48 credit). G properly completes the pre-filing registration in accordance with § 1.6417-5 as an applicable entity to make an election under section 6417 for 2023. G timely files its 2023 Form 990-T in 2024, properly making the elective payment election in accordance with § 1.6417-2 for a section 48 energy credit determined with respect to P. On its Form 990-T, G properly determines that the amount of section 48 credit determined with respect P is $100,000 and that its net elective payment amount is $100,000. The IRS sends G a $100,000 refund. Pursuant to section 50(c), G reduces its basis in P by $50,000. In July 2025, P ceases to be investment credit property with respect to G. Because this occurs before the close of the recapture period set forth in section 50, section 50(a)(1)(A) provides that the tax under chapter 1 for 2025 is increased by the recapture percentage of the aggregate decrease in the credits allowed under section 38 for all prior taxable years that would have resulted solely from reducing to zero any credit determined under subpart E of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 with respect to such property. Because P ceased to be investment credit property within 2 full years after P was placed in service, section 50(a)(1)(B) provides that the recapture percentage is 80%. G must properly report the recapture event in 2025, paying an $80,000 tax. Because G is a government entity, G reports the recapture event on a Form 990-T or any Form provided in further guidance, along with supplemental forms such as Form 4255,
Recapture of Investment Credit.
G's basis in P is increased by $40,000.
(c)
Mirror code territories.
Pursuant to section 6417(f) of the Code, section 6417 and the section 6417 regulations are not treated as part of the income tax laws of the United States for purposes of determining the income tax law of any U.S. territory with a mirror code tax system (as defined in section 24(k) of the Code), unless such U.S. territory elects to have section 6417 and the section 6417 regulations be so treated. The applicable territory tax authority for a U.S. territory determines whether such an election has been made.
(d)
Partnerships subject to subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code. See
§ 301.6241-7(j) of this chapter for rules applicable to payments made to partnerships subject to subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code for a partnership taxable year.
(e)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years ending on or after March 11, 2024. For taxable years ending before March 11, 2024, taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§ 1.6417-1 through 1.6417-4 and 1.6417-6, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.

§ 1.6418-2
Rules for making transfer elections.
(a)
Transfer election
—(1)
In general.
An eligible taxpayer can make a transfer election as provided in this section. If a valid transfer election is made by an eligible taxpayer for any taxable year, the transferee taxpayer specified in such election (and not the eligible taxpayer) is treated as the taxpayer for purposes of the Code with respect to the specified credit portion. This paragraph (a) provides rules on the number of transfers permitted, rules for determining the eligible taxpayer in certain ownership situations, and rules describing circumstances under which no transfer election is allowed. Paragraph (b) of this section provides specific rules regarding the scope, manner, and timing of a transfer election. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules regarding limitations applicable to transfer elections. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules regarding an eligible taxpayer's determination of an eligible credit. Paragraph (e) of this section provides the treatment of payments in connection with a transfer election. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules regarding a transferee taxpayer's treatment of an eligible credit following a transfer.
(2)
Multiple transfer elections permitted.
An eligible taxpayer may make multiple transfer elections to transfer one or more specified credit portion(s) to multiple transferee taxpayers, provided that the aggregate amount of specified credit portions transferred with respect to any single eligible credit property does not exceed the amount of the eligible credit determined with respect to the eligible credit property.
(3)
Transfer election in certain ownership situations
—(i)
Disregarded entities.
If an eligible taxpayer is the sole owner (directly or indirectly) of an entity that is disregarded as separate from such eligible taxpayer for Federal income tax purposes and such entity directly holds an eligible credit property, the eligible taxpayer may make a transfer election in the manner provided in this section with respect to any eligible credit determined with respect to such eligible credit property.
(ii)
Undivided ownership interests.
If an eligible taxpayer is a co-owner of an eligible credit property through an arrangement properly treated as a tenancy-in-common for Federal income tax purposes, or through an organization that has made a valid election under section 761(a) of the Code, then the eligible taxpayer's undivided ownership share of the eligible credit property will be treated for purposes of section 6418 as a separate eligible credit property owned by such eligible taxpayer, and the eligible taxpayer may make a transfer election in the manner provided in this section for any eligible credit(s) determined with respect to such eligible credit property.
(iii)
Members of a consolidated group.
A member of a consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1) is required to make a transfer election in the manner provided in this section to transfer any eligible credit determined with respect to the member.
See
§ 1.1502-77 (providing rules regarding the status of the common parent as agent for its members).
(iv)
Partnerships and S corporations.
A partnership or an S corporation that determines an eligible credit with respect to any eligible credit property held directly by such partnership or S corporation may make a transfer election in the manner provided in § 1.6418-3(d) with respect to eligible credits determined with respect to such eligible credit property.
(v)
Grantors or others treated as owners of a trust.
If an eligible taxpayer is a grantor or any other person that is treated as the owner of any portion of a trust as described in section 671 of the Code, then the eligible taxpayer may make a transfer election in the manner provided in this section for eligible credits determined with respect to any eligible credit property held directly by the portion of the trust that
the eligible taxpayer is treated as owning under section 671.
(4)
Circumstances under which no transfer election can be made
—(i)
Prohibition on election or transfer with respect to progress expenditures.
No transfer election can be made with respect to any amount of an eligible credit that is allowed for progress expenditures pursuant to rules similar to the rules of section 46(c)(4) and (d) (as in effect on the day before the enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990).
(ii)
No election allowed if eligible credit transferred for non-cash consideration.
No transfer election is allowed if an eligible taxpayer receives any consideration other than cash (as defined in § 1.6418-1(f)) in connection with the transfer of a specified credit portion.
(iii)
No election allowed if eligible credits not determined with respect to taxpayer.
No transfer election is allowed for eligible credits that are not determined with respect to an eligible taxpayer as described in paragraph (d) of this section. For example, a section 45Q credit allowable to an eligible taxpayer because of an election made under section 45Q(f)(3)(B), or a section 48 credit allowable to an eligible taxpayer because of an election made under section 50(d)(5) and § 1.48-4, although described in § 1.6418-1(c)(2), is not an eligible credit that can be transferred by the taxpayer because such credit is not determined with respect to the eligible taxpayer.
(b)
Manner and due date of making a transfer election
—(1)
In general.
An eligible taxpayer must make a transfer election to transfer a specified credit portion of an eligible credit on the basis of a single eligible credit property. For example, an eligible taxpayer that determines eligible credits with respect to two eligible credit properties would need to make a separate transfer election with respect to any specified credit portion of the eligible credit determined with respect to each eligible credit property. Any transfer election must be consistent with the eligible taxpayer's pre-filing registration under § 1.6418-4.
(2)
Specific rules for certain eligible credits.
In the case of any section 45 credit, section 45Q credit, section 45V credit, or section 45Y credit that is an eligible credit, the rules in paragraph (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section apply.
(i)
Separate eligible credit property.
A transfer election must be made separately with respect to each eligible credit property described in § 1.6418-1(d)(2), (3), (5), and (7), as applicable, for which an eligible credit is determined.
(ii)
Time period.
A transfer election must be made for each taxable year an eligible taxpayer elects to transfer specified credit portions with respect to such an eligible credit property during the 10-year period beginning on the date such eligible credit property was originally placed in service (or, in the case of a section 45Q credit, for each taxable year during the 12-year period beginning on the date the single process train of carbon capture equipment was originally placed in service).
(3)
Manner of making a valid transfer election.
A transfer election is made by an eligible taxpayer on the basis of each specified credit portion with respect to a single eligible credit property that is transferred to a transferee taxpayer. To make a valid transfer election, an eligible taxpayer, as part of filing an annual tax return (or a return for a short year within the meaning of section 443 of the Code (short year return)), must include the following—
(i) A properly completed relevant source credit form for the eligible credit (such as Form 7207,
Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit,
if making a transfer election for a section 45X credit) for the taxable year that the eligible credit was determined, including the registration number received during the required pre-filing registration (as described in § 1.6418-4) related to the eligible credit property with respect to which a transferred eligible credit was determined;
(ii) A properly completed Form 3800,
General Business Credit
(or its successor), including reductions necessary because of the transferred eligible credit as required by the form and instructions and the registration number received during the required pre-filing registration (as described in § 1.6418-4) related to the eligible credit property with respect to which a transferred eligible credit was determined;
(iii) A schedule attached to the Form 3800 (or its successor) showing the amount of eligible credit transferred for each eligible credit property (such as for a section 45X election, the relevant lines that include the eligible credit property reported on Form 7207), except as otherwise provided in guidance;
(iv) A transfer election statement as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and
(v) Any other information related to the election specified in guidance.
(4)
Due date and original return requirement of a transfer election.
(i)
In general.
A transfer election by an eligible taxpayer with respect to a specified portion of an eligible credit must be made on an original return (including a superseding return or any revisions made on a superseding return) not later than the due date (including extensions of time) for the original return of the eligible taxpayer for the taxable year for which the eligible credit is determined. No transfer election may be made for the first time on an amended return, withdrawn on an amended return, or made or withdrawn by filing an administrative adjustment request under section 6227 of the Code. A numerical error with respect to a properly claimed transfer election may be corrected on an amended return or by filing an administrative adjustment request under section 6227 if necessary; however, the eligible taxpayer's original return, which must be signed under penalties of perjury, must contain all of the information, including a registration number, required by the section 6418 regulations. In order to correct an error on an amended return or administrative adjustment request under section 6227, an eligible taxpayer must have made an error in the information included on the original return such that there is a substantive item to correct; an eligible taxpayer cannot correct a blank item or an item that is described as being “available upon request.” There is no late-election relief available under §§ 301.9100-1 or 301.9100-3 of this chapter for a transfer election that is not timely filed; however, relief under § 301.9100-2(b) may apply if the eligible taxpayer has not received an extension of time to file a return after the original due date, has timely filed a return, takes corrective action under § 301.9100-2(c) within the six-month extension period, and meets the procedural requirements outlined in § 301.9100-2(d).
(ii)
Amending the amount of the eligible credit reported
—(A)
In general.
If an eligible taxpayer, after making a transfer election in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section on an original return in accordance with this paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, determines that the amount of the eligible credit reported on the eligible taxpayer's original return is incorrect, the eligible taxpayer may timely file an amended return, or administrative adjustment request under section 6227, if applicable, adjusting the amount of eligible credit.
(B)
Amending the amount of the credit determined to reflect an increased amount.
To the extent an eligible taxpayer corrects the amount of an eligible credit to reflect an increase in the amount of the eligible credit reported, such amount must be reflected on the credit source forms filed with the amended return, or administrative adjustment request under section 6227, if applicable, but cannot be reflected by either the eligible taxpayer or any transferee taxpayer as a transferred specified credit portion on the transfer election statement.
(C)
Amending the amount of the credit determined to reflect a decreased amount.
To the extent an eligible taxpayer corrects the amount of the eligible credit to reflect a decrease in the amount of the eligible credit reported, such amount must be reflected on the credit source forms filed with the amended return or administrative adjustment request, if applicable, and the transfer election statement reducing the amount of the credit reported in accordance with the following—
(I) The amount of such decrease first reduces the amount if any, of the eligible credit not transferred by the eligible taxpayer; and
(II) Any portion of the amount of such decrease that remains after applying the reduction described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C)(I) of this section, reduces the amount reported by the transferee taxpayer, or if the eligible credit was transferred to more than
one transferee taxpayer, reduces the amount of each transferee taxpayer's specified credit portion on a pro rata basis.
(D)
Treatment of cash consideration.
In the case of a decrease in the amount of the credit determined by the eligible taxpayer, any amount of the cash consideration retained by the eligible taxpayer after making an adjustment in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section that does not directly relate to the remaining specified credit portion must not be excluded from gross income as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(iii)
Examples.
The examples in this paragraph (b)(4)(iii) illustrate the application of paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(A)
Example 1.
A, a U.S. C corporation for Federal income tax purposes (as defined in section 1361(a)(2) of the Code), qualifies as an eligible taxpayer and determines a section 45V clean hydrogen tax credit of $100X in year 1. At the end of year 1, A transfers the entire $100X of the section 45V credit to B. A timely makes a transfer election and properly reports the transaction in accordance with § 1.6418-2(b) on its original return. In year 2, A concludes that the amount of section 45V credit determined in year 1 was $120X. A may file an amended return increasing the amount of the credit reported by $20X on the appropriate credit source forms. A cannot increase the amount of the credit reported on the transfer election statement, and B cannot increase the amount of credit claimed on its return.
(B)
Example 2.
Same facts as
Example 1
except that, in year 2, A concludes that the amount of section 45V credit determined in year 1 was $80X. On an amended return, A decreases the amount of the credit reported by $20X on the appropriate credit source forms. A should then reduce the amount of the credit reported on the transfer election statement. To avoid a determination of an excessive credit transfer, B should file a qualified amended return pursuant to § 1.6664-2(c)(3) reducing the amount of credit claimed on its return by $20X.
(C)
Example 3.
C, a U.S. C corporation for Federal income tax purposes (as defined in section 1361(a)(2) of the Code), qualifies as an eligible taxpayer and determines a section 45Y clean electricity production tax credit of $100X in year 1. At the end of year 1, C transfers $80X of the 45Y credit determined to D, E, and F, with D receiving $40X, E receiving $32X, and F receiving $80X. C timely makes the transfer election and properly reports the transaction in accordance with § 1.6418-2(b) on its original return. In year 2, C concludes that the amount of section 45Y credit determined in year 1 was $60X. C files an amended return decreasing the amount of the credit reported by $40X on the appropriate credit source forms to reflect $60X of section 45Y credit on its credit source forms. As a result of the $40X decrease in the credit determined, C reduces the $20X of section 45Y credit retained by C to $0X, and reduces the amount of section 45Y credit transferred to D, E, and F to $30X, $24X, and $6X, respectively (their respective pro rata shares of the reduced amount). Each of D, E, and F should file a qualified amended return under § 1.6664-2(c)(3) reducing the amount of the credit claimed on their returns to avoid a determination of an excessive credit transfer.
(5)
Transfer election statement
—(i)
In general.
A transfer election statement is a written document that describes the transfer of a specified credit portion between an eligible taxpayer and transferee taxpayer. Unless otherwise provided in guidance, an eligible taxpayer and transferee taxpayer must each attach a transfer election statement to their respective return as required under paragraphs (b)(3)(iv) and (f)(4)(ii) of this section. Unless otherwise provided in guidance, an eligible taxpayer and transferee taxpayer can use any document (such as a purchase and sale agreement) that meets the conditions in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section but must label the document a “Transfer Election Statement” before attaching such labeled document to their respective returns. The information required in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section does not otherwise limit any other information that the eligible taxpayer and transferee taxpayer may agree to provide in connection with the transfer of any specified credit portion. The statement must be signed under
penalties of perjury by an individual with authority to legally bind the eligible taxpayer. The statement must also include the written consent of an individual with authority to legally bind the transferee taxpayer.
(ii)
Information required in transfer election statement.
A transfer election statement must, at a minimum, include each of the following:
(A) Name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the transferee taxpayer and the eligible taxpayer. If the transferee taxpayer or eligible taxpayer is a member of a consolidated group, then only include information for the group member that is the transferee taxpayer or eligible taxpayer (if different from the return filer).
(B) A statement that provides the necessary information and amounts to allow the transferee taxpayer to take into account the specified credit portion with respect to the eligible credit property, including—
(
1
) A description of the eligible credit (for example, advanced manufacturing production credit for a section 45X transfer election), the total amount of the credit determined with respect to the eligible credit property, and the amount of the specified credit portion;
(
2
) The taxable year of the eligible taxpayer and the first taxable year in which the specified credit portion will be taken into account by the transferee taxpayer;
(
3
) The amount(s) of the cash consideration and date(s) on which paid by the transferee taxpayer; and
(
4
) The registration number related to the eligible credit property.
(C) Attestation that the eligible taxpayer (or any member of its consolidated group) is not related to the transferee taxpayer (or any member of its consolidated group) within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1).
(D) A statement or representation from the eligible taxpayer that it has or will comply with all requirements of section 6418, the section 6418 regulations, and the provisions of the Code applicable to the eligible credit, including, for example, any requirements for bonus credit amounts described in § 1.6418-1(c)(3) (if applicable).
(E) A statement or representation from the eligible taxpayer and the transferee taxpayer acknowledging the notification of recapture requirements under section 6418(g)(3) and the section 6418 regulations (if applicable).
(F) A statement or representation from the eligible taxpayer that the eligible taxpayer has provided the required minimum documentation (as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section) to the transferee taxpayer.
(iii)
Timing of transfer election statement.
A transfer election statement can be completed at any time after the eligible taxpayer and transferee taxpayer have sufficient information to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, but the transfer election statement cannot be completed for any year after the earlier of:
(A) The filing of the eligible taxpayer's return for the taxable year for which the specified credit portion is determined with respect to the eligible taxpayer; or
(B) The filing of the return of the transferee taxpayer for the year in which the specified credit portion is taken into account.
(iv)
Required minimum documentation.
The eligible taxpayer must provide to a transferee taxpayer the following minimum documentation—
(A) Information that validates the existence of the eligible credit property, which could include evidence prepared by a third party (such as a county board or other governmental entity, a utility, or an insurance provider);
(B) If applicable, documentation substantiating that the eligible taxpayer has satisfied the requirements to include any bonus credit amounts (as defined in § 1.6418-1(c)(3)) in the eligible credit that was part of the transferred specified credit portion; and
(C) Evidence of the eligible taxpayer's qualifying costs in the case of a transfer of an eligible credit that is part of the investment credit or the amount of qualifying production activities and sales amounts, as relevant, in the case of a transfer of an eligible credit that is a production credit.
(v)
Transferee recordkeeping requirement.
Consistent with § 1.6001-1(e), the transferee taxpayer must retain the required minimum documentation provided by the eligible taxpayer as long as the contents thereof may become
material in the administration of any internal revenue law.
(c)
Limitations after a transfer election is made
—(1)
Irrevocable.
A transfer election with respect to a specified credit portion is irrevocable.
(2)
No additional transfers.
A specified credit portion may only be transferred pursuant to a transfer election once. A transferee taxpayer cannot make a transfer election of any specified credit portion transferred to the transferee taxpayer.
(d)
Determining the eligible credit
—(1)
In general.
An eligible taxpayer may only transfer eligible credits determined with respect to the eligible taxpayer (paragraph (a)(4) of this section disallows transfer elections in other situations). An eligible credit is determined with respect to an eligible taxpayer if the eligible taxpayer owns the underlying eligible credit property and conducts the activities giving rise to the credit or, in the case of section 45X (under which ownership of eligible credit property is not required), is considered (under the regulations under section 45X) the taxpayer with respect to which the section 45X credit is determined. All rules that relate to the determination of the eligible credit, such as the rules in sections 49 and 50(b) of the Code, apply to the eligible taxpayer and therefore can limit the amount of eligible credit determined with respect to an eligible credit property that can be transferred. Rules relating to the amount of an eligible credit that is allowed to be claimed by an eligible taxpayer, such as the rules in sections 38(c) or 469 of the Code, do not limit the eligible credit determined, but do apply to a transferee taxpayer as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(2)
Application of section 49 at-risk rules to determination of eligible credits for partnerships and S corporations.
Any amount of eligible credit determined with respect to investment credit property held directly by a transferor partnership or transferor S corporation that is eligible credit property (eligible investment credit property) must be determined by the partnership or S corporation taking into account the section 49 at-risk rules at the partner or shareholder level as of the close of the taxable year in which the eligible investment credit property is placed in service. Thus, if the credit base of an eligible investment credit property is limited to a partner or an S corporation shareholder by section 49, then the amount of the eligible credit determined by the transferor partnership or transferor S corporation is also limited. A transferor partnership or transferor S corporation that transfers any specified credit portion with respect to an eligible investment credit property must request from each of its partners or shareholders, respectively, that is subject to section 49, the amount of such partner's or shareholder's nonqualified nonrecourse financing with respect to the eligible investment credit property as of the close of the taxable year in which the property is placed in service. Additionally, the transferor partnership or transferor S corporation must attach to its tax return for the taxable year in which the eligible investment credit property is placed in service, the amount of each partner's or shareholder's section 49 limitation with respect to any specified credit portion transferred with respect to the eligible investment credit property. Changes to at-risk amounts under section 49 for partners or S corporation shareholders after the close of the taxable year in which the eligible investment credit property is placed in service do not impact the eligible credit determined by the transferor partnership or transferor S corporation, but do impact the partner(s) or S corporation shareholder(s) as described in § 1.6418-3(a)(6)(ii).
(e)
Treatment of payments made in connection with a transfer election
—(1)
In general.
An amount paid by a transferee taxpayer to an eligible taxpayer is in connection with a transfer election with respect to a specified credit portion only if it is paid in cash (as defined in § 1.6418-1(f)), directly relates to the specified credit portion, and is not described in § 1.6418-5(a)(3) (describing payments related to an excessive credit transfer).
(2)
Not includible in gross income.
Any amount paid to an eligible taxpayer that is described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is not includible in the gross income of the eligible taxpayer.
(3)
Not deductible.
No deduction is allowed under any provision of the Code with respect to any amount paid by a transferee taxpayer that is described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(4)
Anti-abuse rule
—(i)
In general.
A transfer election of any specified credit portion, and therefore the transfer of that specified credit portion to a transferee taxpayer, may be disallowed, or the Federal income tax consequences of any transaction(s) effecting such a transfer may be recharacterized, when the parties to the transaction have engaged in the transaction or a series of transactions with a principal purpose of avoiding any Federal tax liability beyond the intent of section 6418. For example, an amount of cash paid by a transferee taxpayer will not be considered as paid in connection with the transfer of a specified credit portion under paragraph (e)(1) of this section if a principal purpose of a transaction or series of transactions is to allow an eligible taxpayer to avoid gross income. Conversely, an amount of cash paid by a transferee taxpayer will be considered paid in connection with the transfer of a specified credit portion under paragraph (e)(1) of this section if a principal purpose of a transaction or series of transactions is to increase a Federal income tax deduction of a transferee taxpayer.
(ii)
Example 1.
Taxpayer A, an eligible taxpayer, generates $100 of an eligible credit with respect to an eligible credit property in the course of its trade or business. Taxpayer A also provides services to customers. Taxpayer A offers Customer B, a transferee taxpayer that cannot deduct the cost of the services, the opportunity to be transferred $100 of eligible credit for $100 while receiving Taxpayer A's services for free. Taxpayer A normally charges $20 for the same services without the purchase of the eligible credit, and an arm's length price of the eligible credit without regard to other commercial relationships is $80 paid in cash for $100 of the eligible credit. Taxpayer A is engaged in a transaction in which it is undercharging for services to Customer B to avoid recognizing $20 of gross income. This transaction is subject to recharacterization under the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, and Taxpayer A will be treated as transferring $100 of the eligible credit for $80, and have $20 of gross income from the services provided to Customer B.
(iii)
Example 2.
Taxpayer C, an eligible taxpayer, generates $100 of an eligible credit with respect to an eligible credit property in the course of its trade or business. Taxpayer C also sells property to customers. Taxpayer C offers Customer D, a transferee taxpayer that can deduct the purchase of property, the opportunity to receive the $100 of eligible credit for $20 while purchasing Taxpayer C's property for $80. Taxpayer C normally charges $20 for the same property without the transfer of the eligible credit, and an arm's length price of the eligible credit without regard to other commercial relationships is $80 paid in cash for $100 of the eligible credit. Taxpayer C is willing to accept the higher price for the property because Taxpayer C has a net operating loss carryover to offset any taxable income from the transaction. This transaction is subject to recharacterization under the anti-abuse rule under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, and Taxpayer C will be treated as selling the property for $20 and transferring $100 of the eligible credit for $80, and Customer D will have a $20 deduction related to the purchase of the property instead of $80.
(f)
Transferee taxpayer's treatment of eligible credit
—(1)
Taxable year in which credit taken into account
—(i)
In general.
In the case of any specified credit portion transferred to a transferee taxpayer pursuant to a transfer election under this section, the transferee taxpayer takes the specified credit portion into account in the transferee taxpayer's first taxable year ending with or ending after the taxable year of the eligible taxpayer with respect to which the eligible credit was determined. Thus, to the extent the taxable years of an eligible taxpayer and a transferee taxpayer end on the same date, the transferee taxpayer will take the specified credit portion into account in that taxable year. To the extent the taxable years of an eligible taxpayer and a transferee taxpayer end on different dates, the transferee taxpayer will take
the specified credit portion into account in the transferee taxpayer's first taxable year that ends after the taxable year of the eligible taxpayer.
(ii)
Rule for 52
-
53-week taxable years.
For purposes of determining the taxable year in which a credit is taken into account under section 6418(d) and paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, a 52-53-week taxable year of an eligible taxpayer and transferee taxpayer is deemed to end on or close on the last day of the calendar month nearest to the last day of the 52-53-week taxable year, as the case may be.
(2)
No gross income for a transferee taxpayer upon claiming a transferred specified credit portion.
A transferee taxpayer does not have gross income upon claiming a transferred specified credit portion even if the amount of cash paid to the eligible taxpayer was less than the amount of the transferred specified credit portion, assuming all other requirements of section 6418 are met. For example, a transferee taxpayer who paid $9X for $10X of a specified credit portion that the transferee taxpayer then claims on its return does not result in the $1X difference being included in the gross income of the transferee taxpayer.
(3)
Transferee treated as the eligible taxpayer
—(i)
In general.
A transferee taxpayer (and not the eligible taxpayer) is treated as the taxpayer for purposes of the Code with respect to the transferred specified credit portion. An eligible taxpayer must apply the rules necessary to determine the amount of an eligible credit prior to making the transfer election for a specified credit portion, and therefore a transferee taxpayer does not re-apply rules that relate to a determination of an eligible credit, such as the rules in sections 49 or 50(b). However, a transferee taxpayer must apply rules that relate to computing the amount of the specified credit portion that is allowed to be claimed in the taxable year by the transferee taxpayer, such as the rules in section 38 or 469, as applicable.
(ii)
Application of section 469.
A specified credit portion transferred to a transferee taxpayer is treated as determined in connection with the conduct of a trade or business and, if applicable, such transferred specified credit portion is subject to the rules in section 469. In applying section 469, unless a transferee taxpayer owns an interest in the eligible taxpayer's trade or business at the time the work was done, the fact that the specified credit portion is treated as determined in connection with the conduct of a trade or business does not cause the transferee taxpayer to be considered to own an interest in the eligible taxpayer's trade or business at the time the work was done and does not change the characterization of the transferee taxpayer's participation (or lack thereof) in the eligible taxpayer's trade or business by using any of the grouping rules under § 1.469-4(c).

Transferee taxpayer requirements to take into account a transferred specified credit portion.
In order for a transferee taxpayer to take into account in a taxable year (as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section) a specified credit portion that was transferred by an eligible taxpayer, as part of filing a return (or short year return), an amended return, or a request for an administrative adjustment under section 6227 of the Code, the transferee taxpayer must include the following—
(i) A properly completed Form 3800,
General Business Credit
(or its successor), to take into account the transferred specified credit portion as a current general business credit, and including all registration number(s) related to the transferred specified credit portion;
(ii) The transfer election statement described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section attached to the return; and
(iii) Any other information related to the transfer election specified in guidance.
(g)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years ending on or after April 30, 2024. For taxable years ending before April 30, 2024, taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of this section and §§ 1.6418-1, -3, and -5, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.

§ 1.6418-3
Additional rules for partnerships and S corporations.
(a)
Rules applicable to both partnerships and S corporations
—(1)
Partnerships and S corporations as eligible taxpayers and transferee taxpayers.
Under section 6418, a partnership or an S corporation may qualify as a transferor partnership or a transferor S corporation and may elect to make a transfer election to transfer a specified credit portion to a transferee taxpayer. A partnership or an S corporation may also qualify as a transferee partnership or a transferee S corporation. This section provides rules applicable to transferor partnerships and transferor S corporations and transferee partnerships and transferee S corporations. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules applicable solely to partnerships. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules applicable solely to S corporations. Paragraph (d) of this section provides guidelines for the manner and due date for which a partnership or an S corporation makes an election under section 6418(a). Paragraph (e) of this section contains examples illustrating the operation of the provisions of this section. Except as provided in this section, the general rules under section 6418 and the section 6418 regulations apply to partnerships and S corporations.
(2)
Treatment of cash received for a specified credit portion.
In the case of any specified credit portion determined with respect to any eligible credit property held directly by a partnership or an S corporation, if such partnership or S corporation makes a transfer election with respect to such specified credit portion—
(i) Any amount of cash payment received as consideration for the transferred specified credit portion will be treated as tax exempt income for purposes of sections 705 and 1366 of the Code; and
(ii) A partner's distributive share of such tax exempt income will be as described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
(3)
No partner or shareholder level transfers.
In the case of an eligible credit property held directly by a partnership or an S corporation, no transfer election by any partner or S corporation shareholder is allowed under § 1.6418-2 or this section with respect to any specified credit portion determined with respect to such eligible credit property.
(4)
Disregarded entity ownership.
In the case of an eligible credit property held directly by an entity disregarded as separate from a partnership or an S corporation for Federal income tax purposes, such eligible credit property will be treated as held directly by the partnership or S corporation for purposes of making a transfer election.
(5)
Treatment of tax exempt income.
Tax exempt income resulting from the receipt of consideration for the transfer of a specified credit portion by a transferor partnership or transferor S corporation is treated as arising from an investment activity and not from the conduct of a trade or business within the meaning of section 469(c)(1)(A). As such, any tax exempt income is not treated as passive income to any direct or indirect partners or shareholders who do not materially participate within the meaning of section 469(c)(1)(B).
(6)
Certain recapture events not requiring notice
—(i)
Indirect dispositions under section 50
—(A)
Treatment of transferor partnership or transferor S corporation and transferee taxpayer.
For purposes of section 6418(g)(3)(B) only, the disposition of a partner's interest under § 1.47-6(a)(2) or an S corporation shareholder's interest under § 1.47-4(a)(2) in an eligible taxpayer that is treated as a transferor partnership or transferor S corporation is disregarded. As such, provided the investment credit property that is eligible credit property owned by the transferor partnership or transferor S corporation is not disposed of, and continues to be investment credit property with respect to such transferor partnership or transferor S corporation, a transferor partnership or transferor S corporation is not required to provide notice to a transferee taxpayer of an interest disposition by the partner or shareholder because the disposition does not result in recapture under section 6418(g)(3)(B) to which the transferee taxpayer is liable, and thus, the transferee taxpayer does not have to calculate a recapture amount.
(B)
Treatment of partner or shareholder.
A partner or an S corporation shareholder that has disposed of an interest in a transferor partnership or transferor S corporation is subject to the rules relating to such disposition under § 1.47-6(a)(2) or § 1.47-4(a)(2), respectively. Any recapture to a disposing partner is calculated based on the partner's share of the basis (or cost) of the section 38 property to which the specified credit portion was determined in accordance with § 1.46-3(f). Any recapture to a disposing shareholder is calculated based on the shareholder's pro rata share of the basis (or cost) of the section 38 property to which the specified credit portion was determined in accordance with § 1.48-5.
(ii)
Changes in at-risk amounts under section 49
—(A)
Treatment of transferor partnership or transferor S corporation and transferee taxpayer.
For purposes of section 6418 only, a change in the nonqualified nonrecourse financing (as defined in section 49(a)(1)(D)) amount of any partner or shareholder of a transferor partnership or transferor S corporation, respectively, after the close of the taxable year in which the investment credit property is placed in service and the specified credit portion is determined, is disregarded. A transferor partnership or transferor S corporation is not required to provide notice to a transferee taxpayer of the change because the change does not cause recapture under section 6418(g)(3)(B) to which the transferee taxpayer is liable, and thus, the transferee taxpayer does not have to calculate a recapture amount.
(B)
Treatment of partner or shareholder.
A partner or shareholder in a transferor partnership or transferor S corporation, respectively, must apply the rules under section 49 at the partner or shareholder level if there is a change in nonqualified nonrecourse financing with respect to the partner or shareholder after the close of the taxable year in which the investment credit property is placed in service and the specified credit portion is determined. If there is an increase in nonqualified nonrecourse financing to a partner, any adjustment under the rules of section 49(b) is calculated based on the partner's share of the basis (or cost) of the section 38 property to which the specified credit portion was determined in accordance with § 1.46-3(f). If there is an increase in nonqualified nonrecourse financing to a shareholder, any adjustment under the rules of section 49(b) is calculated based on the shareholder's pro rata share of the basis (or cost) of the section 38 property to which the specified credit portion was determined in accordance with § 1.48-5. If there is a decrease in nonqualified nonrecourse financing, any increase in the credit base is taken into account by the partner or shareholder as provided under section 49, and any resulting credit is not eligible for transfer under section 6418.
(b)
Rules applicable to partnerships
—(1)
Allocations of tax exempt income amounts generally.
A transferor partnership must generally determine a partner's distributive share of any tax exempt income resulting from the receipt of consideration for the transfer based on such partner's proportionate distributive share of the eligible credit that would otherwise have been allocated to such partner absent the transfer of the specified credit portion (otherwise eligible credit). A partner's distributive share of an otherwise eligible credit is determined under §§ 1.46-3(f) and 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii). Tax exempt income resulting from the receipt of consideration for the transfer of a specified credit portion by a transferor partnership is treated as received or accrued, including for purposes of section 705 of the Code, as of the date the specified credit portion is determined with respect to the transferor partnership (such as, for investment credit property, the date the property is placed in service).
(2)
Special rule for allocations of tax exempt income amounts and eligible credits for an election to transfer less than all eligible credits determined with respect to an eligible credit property.
In the event a transferor partnership elects to transfer one or more specified credit portions of less than all eligible credits determined with respect to an eligible credit property held directly by the partnership, the partnership may allocate any tax exempt income resulting from the receipt of consideration for
the specified credit portion(s) in accordance with the rules in this paragraph (b)(2).
(i) First, the partnership must determine each partner's distributive share of the otherwise eligible credits with respect to such eligible credit property in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section (partner's eligible credit amount).
(ii) Thereafter, the transferor partnership may determine, in any manner described in the partnership agreement, or as the partners may agree, the portion of each partner's eligible credit amount to be transferred, and the portion of each partner's eligible credit amount to be retained and allocated to such partner. The partnership may allocate to each partner its agreed upon share of eligible credits, tax exempt income resulting from the receipt of consideration for the specified credit portion(s), or both, as the case may be, provided that—
(A) The amount of eligible credits allocated to each partner cannot exceed such partner's eligible credit amount; and
(B) Each partner is allocated its proportionate share of tax exempt income resulting from the transfer(s).
(iii) Each partner's proportionate share of tax exempt income resulting from the transfer(s) is equal to the total amount of tax exempt income resulting from the transfer(s) of the specified credit portion(s) by the partnership multiplied by a fraction—
(A) The numerator of which is such partner's eligible credit amount minus the amount of eligible credits actually allocated to such partner with respect to the eligible credit property for the taxable year; and
(B) The denominator of which is the specified credit portion(s) transferred by the partnership with respect to the eligible credit property for the taxable year.
(3)
Transferor partnerships in tiered structures.
If a partnership (upper-tier partnership) is a direct or indirect partner of a transferor partnership and directly or indirectly receives—
(i) An allocation of an eligible credit, the upper-tier partnership is not an eligible taxpayer under section 6418 with respect to any eligible credit allocated by a transferor partnership; or
(ii) An allocation of tax exempt income resulting from the receipt of consideration for the transfer of a specified credit portion by a transferor partnership, the upper-tier partnership must determine its partners' distributive shares of such tax exempt income in proportion to the partners' distributive shares of the otherwise eligible credit as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(4)
Partnership as a transferee taxpayer
—(i)
Eligibility under section 6418.
A partnership may qualify as a transferee partnership to the extent it is not related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) to an eligible taxpayer. A transferee partnership is subject to the no additional transfer rule in § 1.6418-2(c)(2), however, an allocation of a transferred specified credit portion to a direct or indirect partner of a transferee partnership under section 704(b) is not a transfer for purposes of section 6418.
(ii)
Treatment of a cash payment for a transferred specified credit portion.
A cash payment by a transferee partnership as consideration for a transferred specified credit portion is treated as an expenditure described in section 705(a)(2)(B).
(iii)
Allocations of transferred specified credit portions.
A transferee partnership must determine each partner's distributive share of any transferred specified credit portion based on such partner's distributive share of the nondeductible expenses for the taxable year used to fund the purchase of such transferred specified credit portion. Each partner's distributive share of the nondeductible expenses used to fund the purchase of any transferred specified credit portion is determined by the partnership agreement, or, if the partnership agreement does not provide for the allocation of nondeductible expenses paid pursuant to section 6418, then the allocation of the specified credit portion is based on the transferee partnership's general allocation of nondeductible expenses.
(iv)
Transferred specified credit portion treated as an extraordinary item.
A transferred specified credit portion is treated as an extraordinary item and
must be allocated among the partners of a transferee partnership as of the time the transfer of the specified credit portion to the transferee partnership is treated as occurring in accordance with this paragraph (b)(4)(iv) and § 1.706-4(e)(1) and (e)(2)(ix). If the transferee partnership and eligible taxpayer have the same taxable years, the transfer of a specified credit portion to a transferee partnership is treated as occurring on the first date that the transferee partnership makes a cash payment to the eligible taxpayer as consideration for the specified credit portion. If the transferee partnership and eligible taxpayer have different taxable years, the transfer of a specified credit portion to a transferee partnership is treated as occurring on the later of—
(A) The first date of the taxable year that the transferee partnership takes the specified credit portion into account under section 6418(d); or
(B) The first date that the transferee partnership makes a cash payment to the eligible taxpayer for the specified credit portion.
(v)
Transferee partnerships in tiered structures.
If an upper-tier partnership is a direct or indirect partner of a transferee partnership and directly or indirectly receives an allocation of a transferred specified credit portion, the upper-tier partnership is not an eligible taxpayer under section 6418 with respect to the transferred specified credit portion. The upper-tier partnership's distributive share of the transferred specified credit portion is treated as an extraordinary item to the upper-tier partnership and must be allocated among the partners of the upper-tier partnership as of the time the transfer of the specified credit portion to the transferee partnership is treated as occurring in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section and § 1.706-4(e)(1) and (e)(2)(ix), regardless of whether the transferee partnership and upper-tier partnership have different taxable years under section 706(b). The upper-tier partnership must report the credits to its partners in accordance with guidance.
(c)
Rules applicable to S corporations
—(1)
Pro rata shares of tax exempt income amounts.
Each shareholder of a transferor S corporation must take into account such shareholder's pro rata share (as determined under section 1377(a) of the Code) of any tax exempt income resulting from the receipt of consideration for the transfer. Tax exempt income resulting from the receipt of consideration for the transfer of a specified credit portion by a transferor S corporation is treated as received or accrued, including for purposes of section 1366, as of the date the specified credit portion is determined with respect to the transferor S corporation (such as, for investment credit property, the date the property is placed in service).
(2)
S corporation as a transferee taxpayer
—(i)
Eligibility under section 6418.
An S corporation may qualify as a transferee taxpayer to the extent it is not related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) to an eligible taxpayer (transferee S corporation). A transferee S corporation is subject to the no additional transfer rule in § 1.6418-2(c)(2), however, an allocation of a transferred specified credit portion to a direct or indirect shareholder of a transferee S corporation is not a transfer for purposes of section 6418.
(ii)
Treatment of a cash payment for a transferred specified credit portion.
A cash payment by a transferee S corporation as consideration for a transferred specified credit portion is treated as an expenditure described in section 1367(a)(2)(D) of the Code.
(iii)
Pro rata shares of transferred specified credit portions.
Each shareholder of a transferee S corporation must take into account such shareholder's pro rata share (as determined under section 1377(a)) of any transferred specified credit portion. If the transferee S corporation and eligible taxpayer have the same taxable years, the transfer of a specified credit portion is treated as occurring to a transferee S corporation during the transferee S corporation's permitted year (as defined under sections 444 and 1378(b)) that the transferee S corporation first makes a cash payment as consideration to the eligible taxpayer for the specified credit portion. If the transferee S corporation and eligible taxpayer have different taxable years, then the transfer of a specified credit portion is treated as occurring to a transferee S corporation
during the transferee S corporation's first permitted year (as defined under sections 444 and 1378(b)) ending with or after, the taxable year of the eligible taxpayer to which the transferred specified credit portion was determined.
(d)
Transfer election by a partnership or an S corporation
—(1)
In general.
A partnership or an S corporation may make a transfer election to transfer a specified credit portion under section 6418 if it files an election in accordance with the rules set forth in this paragraph (d). A transfer election is made on the basis of an eligible credit property and only applies to the specified credit portion identified in the transfer election by such partnership or S corporation in the taxable year for which the election is made.
(2)
Manner and due date of making a transfer election.
A transfer election for a specified credit portion must be made in the manner provided in § 1.6418-2(b)(1) through (3). All documents required in § 1.6418-2(b)(1) through (3) must be attached to the partnership or S corporation return for the taxable year during which the transferred specified credit portion was determined. For the transfer election to be valid, the return must be filed not later than the time prescribed by §§ 1.6031(a)-1(e) and 1.6037-1(b) (including extensions of time) for filing the return for such taxable year. No transfer election may be made for the first time on an amended return, withdrawn on an amended return, or made or withdrawn by filing an administrative adjustment request under section 6227 of the Code. A numerical error with respect to a properly claimed transfer election may be corrected on an amended return or by filing an administrative adjustment request under section 6227 if necessary; however, the partnership or S corporation's original return, which must be signed under penalties of perjury, must contain all of the information, including a registration number, required by these final regulations. In order to correct an error on an amended return or administrative adjustment request under section 6227, a partnership or an S corporation must have made an error in the information included on the original return such that there is a substantive item to correct; a partnership or an S corporation cannot correct a blank item or an item that is described as being “available upon request.” There is no late-election relief available under §§ 301.9100-1 or 301.9100-3 of this chapter for a transfer election that is not timely filed; however, relief under § 301.9100-2(b) may apply if the partnership or S corporation has not received an extension of time to file a return after the original due date, has timely filed a return, takes corrective action under § 301.9100-2(c) within the six-month extension period, and meets the procedural requirements outlined in § 301.9100-2(d).
(3)
Irrevocable election.
A transfer election by a partnership or an S corporation is irrevocable.
(e)
Examples.
The examples in this paragraph (e) illustrate the application of paragraphs (a)(6), (b), and (c) of this section.
(1)
Example 1. Transfer of all eligible credits by a transferor partnership
—(i)
Facts.
A and B each contributed $150X of cash to AB partnership for the purpose of investing in energy property. The partnership agreement provides that A and B share equally in all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit of AB partnership. AB partnership invests $300X in an energy property in accordance with section 48 and places the energy property in service on date X in year 1. As of the end of year 1, AB partnership has $90X of eligible credits under section 48 with respect to the energy property. Before AB partnership files its tax return for year 1, AB partnership transfers the $90X of eligible credits to an unrelated transferee taxpayer, Transferee Taxpayer X for $80X and executes a transfer election statement with Transferee Taxpayer X.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under § 1.6418-3(b)(1), AB partnership allocates the tax exempt income resulting from the transfer of the specified credit portion proportionately among the partners based on each partner's distributive share of the otherwise eligible section 48 credit as determined under §§ 1.46-3(f) and 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii). Under § 1.46-3(f)(2), each partner's share of the basis of the energy property is determined in accordance
with the ratio in which the partners divide the general profits (or taxable income) of the partnership. Under the AB partnership agreement, A and B share partnership profits equally. Thus, each partner's share of the basis of the energy property under § 1.46-3(f) and distributive share of the otherwise eligible credits under § 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii) is 50 percent. The transfer made pursuant to section 6418(a) causes AB partnership's eligible credits under section 48 with respect to the energy property to be reduced to zero, and the consideration of $80X received by AB partnership for the transferred specified credit portion is treated as tax exempt income. Because the tax exempt income is allocated in the same proportion as the otherwise eligible credit would have been allocated, A and B will each be allocated $40X of tax exempt income. Each of partner A's and partner B's basis in its partnership interest and capital account will be increased by $40X. Also in year 1, the basis in the energy property held by AB partnership and with respect to which the credit is calculated is reduced under section 50(c)(3) by 50 percent of the amount of the credit so determined, or $45X. A's and B's basis in their partnership interests and capital accounts will be appropriately adjusted to take into account adjustments made to the energy property under section 50(c)(5) and § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(
j
). The tax exempt income received or accrued by AB partnership as a result of the transferred specified credit portion is treated as received or accrued, including for purposes of section 705, as of date X in year 1, which is the date the transferred specified credit portion was determined with respect to AB partnership.
(2)
Example 2. Recapture to a transferor partnership
—(i)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1
), except in year 3, within the recapture period related to the energy property, A reduces its proportionate interest in the general profits of the partnership by 50 percent causing a recapture event to A under § 1.47-6(a)(2). The energy property is not disposed of by AB partnership and continues to be energy property with respect to AB partnership.
(ii)
Analysis.
AB partnership should not provide notice of recapture to Transferee Taxpayer X as a result of the recapture event under § 1.47-6(a)(2) with respect to A. Transferee Taxpayer X is not liable for any recapture amount. A, however, is subject to recapture as provided in § 1.47-6(a)(2) and based on its share of the basis (or cost) of the energy property to which the eligible credits were determined under § 1.46-3(f)(2).
(3)
Example 3. Transfer of a portion of eligible credits by a transferor partnership
—(i)
Facts.
C and D each contributed cash to CD partnership for the purpose of investing in a qualified wind facility. The partnership agreement provides that until a flip point, C is allocated 99 percent of all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of CD partnership and D is allocated the remaining 1 percent of such items. After the flip point, C is allocated 5 percent of all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of CD Partnership and D is allocated 95 percent of such items. CD partnership invests in a qualified wind facility and places the facility in service in year 1. CD partnership generates $100X of credit under section 45(a) for year 1. Before the due date for CD partnership's year 1 tax return (with extension), C and D agree that D's share of the eligible credit will be transferred, and C will be allocated its share of eligible credit. CD partnership transfers $1X of the eligible credit to an unrelated transferee taxpayer for $1X. The flip point has not been reached by the end of year 1.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, CD partnership must first determine each partner's eligible credit amount, which is equal to such partner's distributive share of the otherwise eligible section 45(a) credit as determined under § 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii). Under § 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii), for an eligible credit that is not an investment tax credit and that arises from receipts of a partnership, allocations of credit are deemed to be in accordance with the partners' interests in the partnership if the credit is allocated in the same proportion as the partners' distributive shares of the receipts that give rise to the credit. The CD partnership agreement provides that until the flip point,
C is allocated 99 percent of all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of CD partnership and D is allocated the remaining 1 percent of such items. Assuming all requirements of the safe harbor provided for in Revenue Procedure 2007-65, 2007-2 CB 967 are met, CD partnership's allocations of the otherwise eligible credits would be respected as in accordance with section 704(b). Thus, partner C's and partner D's distributive share of the otherwise eligible credit is 99 percent and 1 percent, respectively. C and D have agreed to sell D's eligible credit amount of $1X for full value and to allocate to C its eligible credit amount of $99X. The transfer made pursuant to section 6418(a) causes CD partnership's eligible credits under section 45(a) with respect to the wind facility to be reduced to $99X, and the consideration of $1X received by CD partnership is treated as tax exempt income. D is allocated $1X of tax exempt income from the transfer of the eligible credits, and C is allocated $99X of eligible credits under section 45(a) with respect to the wind facility. Neither C nor D is allocated more eligible credits than its eligible credit amount. Additionally, D is allocated an amount of tax exempt income equal to $1X × (1 − 0)/1 and C is allocated none of the tax exempt income. The allocations of eligible credits and tax exempt income are permissible allocations under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4)
Example 4. Upper-tier partnership of a transferor partnership
—(i)
Facts.
E, F, and G each contributed $100X of cash to EFG partnership for the purpose of investing in an energy property. E, F, and G are partnerships for Federal income tax purposes. The partnership agreement provides that E, F and G share equally in all items of income, gain, loss, and deduction of EFG partnership. EFG partnership invests $300X in an energy property in accordance with section 48 and places the energy property in service in year 1. As of the end of year 1, EFG partnership has $90X of eligible credits under section 48 with respect to the energy property. Before the due date for EFG partnership's year 1 tax return (with extension), E, F and G agree that E's share of the eligible credits will be transferred, and F and G will each be allocated their shares of eligible credits (or basis). EFG partnership transfers $30X of the eligible credits to an unrelated transferee taxpayer for $25X. Assuming the allocations to E, F and G of the eligible credits and tax exempt income resulting from the receipt of cash for the transferred specified credit portion are permissible allocations under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, E is allocated $25X of tax exempt income from the transfer of the eligible credits and F and G are each allocated $30X of eligible credits with respect to the energy property.
(ii)
Analysis.
E must allocate the $25X of tax exempt income to its partners as if it had retained its share of the eligible credits. Under § 1.46-3(f)(2), each partner's share of the basis of the section 48 energy property is determined in accordance with the ratio in which the partners divide the general profits (or taxable income) of the partnership. The E partnership agreement provides for equal allocations of income, gain, deduction, and loss to its partners, and thus, E partnership must allocate the otherwise eligible credits in the same manner. Therefore, E partnership must allocate the $25X of tax exempt income equally among its partners. In accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, F and G do not qualify as an eligible taxpayer for purposes of section 6418 and thus, are not permitted to make a transfer election for any portion of the $30X of eligible credit allocated to them by EFG partnership. Under § 1.46-3(f)(2), each partner's share of the basis of the section 48 energy property is determined in accordance with the ratio in which the partners divide the general profits (or taxable income) of the partnership. The F and G partnership agreements provide for equal allocations of income, gain, deduction, and loss to its partners, and F and G must allocate the basis from the energy property to their partners in the same manner.
(5)
Example 5. Transferee partnership
—(i)
Facts.
Y and Z each contributed $50X of cash to YZ partnership for the purpose of purchasing eligible section 45 credits under section 6418. The partnership agreement provides that all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and
credit are shared equally among Y and Z. The partnership agreement also provides that any nondeductible expenses used to fund the purchase of any transferred specified credit portion will be shared equally among Y and Z. On date X in year 1, YZ partnership qualifies as a transferee taxpayer and makes a cash payment of $80X to an eligible taxpayer for $100X of a transferred specified credit portion. The eligible credits will be determined with respect to the eligible taxpayer as of the end of year 1. Both YZ partnership and the eligible taxpayer are calendar year taxpayers.
(ii)
Analysis.
The cash payment of $80X made by YZ partnership for the transferred specified credit portion is treated as a nondeductible expenditure under section 705(a)(2)(B). Under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, YZ partnership must determine each partner's distributive share of the transferred specified credit portion based on such partner's distributive share of the nondeductible expenses for the taxable year used to fund the purchase of such transferred specified credit portion. The YZ partnership agreement provides that nondeductible expenses used to fund the purchase of any transferred specified credit portion will be shared equally among Y and Z and thus, the transferred specified credit portion is also shared equally among Y and Z. The transferred specified credit portion is treated as an extraordinary item under § 1.706-4(e)(2)(ix) that is deemed to occur on date X in year 1. As of date X in year 1, each of Y and Z are allocated $40X of a section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditure with respect to the cash payment for the transferred specified credit portion and $50X of transferred section 45 credits.
(6)
Example 6. Upper-tier partnership of a transferee partnership
—(i)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section (
Example 5
), except Y is a partnership for Federal tax purposes, and Z is a U.S. C corporation for Federal tax purposes (as defined in section 1361(a)(2) of the Code).
(ii)
Analysis.
In accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section, Y does not qualify as an eligible taxpayer for purposes of section 6418 for that portion of the transferred specified credit portion allocated to it by YZ partnership. Under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, Y must determine each partner's distributive share of the transferred specified credit portion based on such partner's distributive share of the nondeductible expenses for the taxable year used to fund the purchase of such transferred specified credit portion. The Y partnership agreement provides that all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit are shared equally. The partnership agreement also provides that any nondeductible expenses used to fund the purchase of any specified credit portion are shared equally. Thus, the transferred specified credit portion must be shared equally among the partners of Y. Y's distributive share of the transferred specified credit portion is treated as an extraordinary item to Y and must be allocated among the partners of Y as of date X in year 1, which is when the item is deemed to occur to YZ partnership, regardless of whether Y and YZ partnership have the same taxable years under section 706(b).

Example 7. Transferor S corporation
—(i)
Facts.
V and W each contributed $150X of cash to an S corporation for the purpose of investing in energy property. The S corporation invests $300X in an energy property in accordance with section 48 and places the energy property in service on date X in year 1. As of the end of year 1, the S corporation has $90X of eligible credits under section 48 with respect to the energy property. Before the due date for the S corporation's year 1 tax return (with extension), the S corporation transfers the $90X of eligible credits to an unrelated transferee taxpayer for $80X.
(ii)
Analysis.
The transfer made pursuant to section 6418(a) causes the S corporation's eligible credits under section 48 with respect to the energy property to be reduced to zero, and the consideration of $80X received by the S corporation for the transferred specified credit portion is treated as tax exempt income. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each of V and W must take into account its pro rata share (as determined under section 1377(a)) of any tax exempt income resulting from the receipt of consideration for the transfer of the eligible credit, or $40X.
Under section 1367(a)(1)(A), each of the shareholder's basis in its stock will be increased by $40X. Also in year 1, the basis in the energy property with respect to which the credit is calculated is reduced under section 50(c)(3) by 50 percent of the amount of the credit so determined, or $45X. The tax exempt income received or accrued by the S corporation as a result of the transfer of the specified credit portion is treated as received or accrued, including for purposes of section 1366, as of date X in year 1, which is the date the transferred specified credit portion was determined with respect to the transferor S corporation.
(8)
Example 8. Transferee S corporation
—(i)
Facts.
J and K each contributed $50X of cash to an S corporation for the purpose of purchasing eligible section 48 credits under section 6418. At the beginning of year 2, the S corporation qualifies as a transferee taxpayer and makes a cash payment of $80X to an eligible taxpayer for $100X of a transferred specified credit portion. The transferred specified credit portion was determined with respect to the eligible taxpayer for energy property placed in service in year 1. Both the S corporation and the eligible taxpayer are calendar year taxpayers.
(ii)
Analysis.
The cash payment of $80X made by the S corporation for the transferred specified credit portion is treated as an expenditure described in section 1367(a)(2)(D). Each of J and K must take into account its pro rata share (as determined under section 1377(a)) of the transferred specified credit portion. The transferred specified credit portion is deemed to arise for purposes of sections 1366 and 1377 during year 2 of the S corporation. For year 2, each of J and K take into account $40X of a section 1367(a)(2)(D) expenditure with respect to the cash payment for the transferred specified credit portion and $50X of transferred section 48 credits.
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years ending on or after April 30, 2024. For taxable years ending before April 30, 2024, taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of this section and §§ 1.6418-1, -2, and -5, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.

§ 1.6418-4
Additional information and registration.
(a)
Pre-filing registration and election.
As a condition of, and prior to, any specified credit portion being transferred by an eligible taxpayer to a transferee taxpayer pursuant to an election under § 1.6418-2, or a specified credit portion being transferred by a partnership or an S corporation pursuant to § 1.6418-3, the eligible taxpayer is required to satisfy the pre-filing registration requirements in paragraph (b) of this section. An eligible taxpayer that does not obtain a registration number under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and report the registration number on its return pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, is ineligible to make a transfer election for a specified credit portion under § 1.6418-2 or § 1.6418-3, with respect to the eligible credit determined with respect to the specific eligible credit property for which the eligible taxpayer has failed to obtain and report a registration number. However, completion of the pre-filing registration requirements and receipt of a registration number does not, by itself, mean the eligible taxpayer is eligible to transfer any specified credit portion determined with respect to the eligible credit property.
(b)
Pre-filing registration requirements
—(1)
Manner of pre-filing registration.
Unless otherwise provided in guidance, eligible taxpayers must complete the pre-filing registration process electronically through an IRS electronic portal and in accordance with the instructions provided therein.
(2)
Pre-filing registration and election for members of a consolidated group.
A member of a consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1) is required to complete pre-filing registration to transfer any eligible credit determined with respect to the member.
See
§ 1.1502-77 (providing rules regarding the status of the common parent as agent for its members).
(3)
Timing of pre-filing registration.
An eligible taxpayer must satisfy the pre-
filing registration requirements of this paragraph (b) and receive a registration number under paragraph (c) of this section prior to making a transfer election under § 1.6418-2 or § 1.6418-3 for a specified credit portion on the taxpayer's return for the taxable year at issue.
(4)
Each eligible credit property must have its own registration number.
An eligible taxpayer must obtain a registration number for each eligible credit property with respect to which a transfer election of a specified credit portion is made.
(5)
Information required to complete the pre-filing registration process.
Unless modified in future guidance, an eligible taxpayer is required to provide the following information to the IRS to complete the pre-filing registration process:
(i) The eligible taxpayer's general information, including its name, address, taxpayer identification number, and type of legal entity;
(ii) Any additional information required by the IRS electronic portal, such as information establishing that the entity is an eligible taxpayer;
(iii) The taxpayer's taxable year, as determined under section 441;
(iv) The type of annual tax return(s) normally filed by the eligible taxpayer, or that the eligible taxpayer does not normally file an annual tax return with the IRS;
(v) The type of eligible credit(s) for which the eligible taxpayer intends to make a transfer election;
(vi) Each eligible credit property that the eligible taxpayer intends to use to determine a specified credit portion for which the eligible taxpayer intends to make a transfer election;
(vii) For each eligible credit property listed in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section, any further information required by the IRS electronic portal, such as—
(A) The type of eligible credit property;
(B) Physical location (that is, address and coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the eligible credit property);
(C) Supporting documentation relating to the construction or acquisition of the eligible credit property (such as State, Indian Tribal, or local government permits to operate the eligible credit property, certifications, evidence of ownership that ties to a land deed, lease, or other documented right to use and access any land or facility upon which the eligible credit property is constructed or housed, and U.S. Coast Guard registration numbers for offshore wind vessels);
(D) The beginning of construction date, and the placed in service date of the eligible credit property; and
(E) Any other information that the eligible taxpayer believes will help the IRS evaluate the registration request;
(viii) The name of a contact person for the eligible taxpayer. The contact person is the person whom the IRS may contact if there is an issue with the registration. The contact person must either:
(A) Possess legal authority to bind the eligible taxpayer; or
(B) Must provide a properly executed power of attorney on Form 2848,
Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative;
(ix) A penalties of perjury statement, effective for all information submitted as a complete application, and signed by a person with personal knowledge of the relevant facts that is authorized to bind the registrant; and
(x) Any other information the IRS deems necessary for purposes of preventing duplication, fraud, improper payments, or excessive payments under this section that is provided in guidance.
(c)
Registration number
—(1)
In general.
The IRS will review the registration information provided and will issue a separate registration number for each eligible credit property for which the eligible taxpayer provided sufficient verifiable information.
(2)
Registration number is only valid for one taxable year.
A registration number is valid with respect to an eligible taxpayer only for the taxable year in which the credit is determined for the eligible credit property for which the registration is completed, and for a transferee taxpayer's taxable year in which the eligible credit is taken into account under § 1.6418-2(f).
(3)
Renewing registration numbers.
If an election to transfer an eligible credit will be made with respect to an eligible credit property for a taxable year
after a registration number under this section has been obtained, the eligible taxpayer must renew the registration for that subsequent taxable year in accordance with applicable guidance, including attesting that all the facts previously provided are still correct or updating any facts.
(4)
Amendment of previously submitted registration information if a change occurs before the registration number is used.
As provided in instructions to the pre-filing registration portal, if specified changes occur with respect to one or more eligible credit properties for which a registration number has been previously obtained, but not yet used, an eligible taxpayer must amend the registration (or may need to submit a new registration) to reflect these new facts. For example, if the owner of a facility previously registered for a transfer election under § 1.6418-2 or § 1.6418-3 for eligible credits determined with respect to that facility and the facility undergoes a change of ownership (incident to a corporate reorganization or an asset sale) such that the new owner has a different employer identification number (EIN) than the owner who obtained the original registration, the original owner of the facility must amend the original registration to disassociate its EIN from the eligible credit property and the new owner must submit separately an original registration (or if the new owner previously registered other credit properties, must amend its original registration) to associate the new owner's EIN with the previously registered eligible credit property.
(5)
Reporting of registration number by an eligible taxpayer and a transferee taxpayer
—(i)
Eligible taxpayer reporting.
As part of making a valid transfer election under § 1.6418-2 or § 1.6418-3, an eligible taxpayer must include the registration number of the eligible credit property on the eligible taxpayer's return (as provided in § 1.6418-2(b) or § 1.6418-3(d)) for the taxable year the specified credit portion was determined. The IRS will treat a transfer election as ineffective if an eligible taxpayer fails to include the registration number of the eligible credit property on the eligible taxpayer's return.
(ii)
Transferee taxpayer reporting.
A transferee taxpayer must report the registration number received (as part of the transfer election statement as described in § 1.6418-2(b) or otherwise) from a transferor taxpayer on the Form 3800,
General Business Credit,
as part of the return for the taxable year that the transferee taxpayer takes the transferred specified credit portion into account. The specified credit portion will be disallowed to the transferee taxpayer if the transferee taxpayer does not include the registration number on the return.
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years ending on or after April 30, 2024.
[T.D. 9993, 89 FR 34800, Apr. 30, 2024; 89 FR 67860, Aug. 22, 2024]
§ 1.6418-5
Special rules.
(a)
Excessive credit transfer tax imposed
—(1)
In general.
If any specified credit portion that is transferred to a transferee taxpayer pursuant to an election in § 1.6418-2(a) or § 1.6418-3 is determined to be an excessive credit transfer (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section), the tax imposed on the transferee taxpayer by chapter 1 (regardless of whether such entity would otherwise be subject to chapter 1 tax) for the taxable year in which such determination is made will be increased by an amount equal to the sum of—
(i) The amount of such excessive credit transfer; and
(ii) An amount equal to 20 percent of such excessive credit transfer.
(2)
Taxable year of the determination.
The taxable year of the determination for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section is the taxable year during which the excessive credit transfer determination is made and not the taxable year during which the eligible credit was originally determined by the eligible taxpayer, unless those are the same taxable years.
(3)
Payments related to excessive credit transfer.
Any payments made by a transferee taxpayer to an eligible taxpayer that directly relate to the excessive credit transfer (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) are not subject to section 6418(b)(2), section 6418(b)(3), or § 1.6418-2(e). The amount of a payment that directly relates to
the excessive credit transfer is equal to the total consideration paid in cash by the transferee taxpayer for the specified credit portion multiplied by the ratio of the amount of the excessive credit transferred to the transferee taxpayer to the amount of the transferred specified credit portion claimed by the transferee taxpayer.
(4)
Reasonable cause.
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply if the transferee taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the IRS that the excessive credit transfer resulted from reasonable cause. Determination of reasonable cause is made based on the relevant facts and circumstances. Generally, the most important factor is the extent of the transferee taxpayer's efforts to determine that the amount of specified credit portion transferred by the eligible taxpayer to the transferee taxpayer is not more than the amount of the eligible credit determined with respect to the eligible credit property for the taxable year in which the eligible credit was determined and has not been transferred to any other taxpayer. Circumstances that may indicate reasonable cause can include, but are not limited to, review of the eligible taxpayer's records with respect to the determination of the eligible credit (including documentation evidencing eligibility for bonus credit amounts), reasonable reliance on third party expert reports, reasonable reliance on representations from the eligible taxpayer that the total specified credit portion transferred (including portions transferred to other transferee taxpayers if an eligible taxpayer makes multiple transfer elections with respect to a single credit property) does not exceed the total eligible credit determined with respect to the eligible credit property for the taxable year, and review of audited financial statements provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission (and underlying information), if applicable.
(5)
Recapture events.
A recapture event under section 45Q(f)(4), 49(b), or 50(a) is not an excessive credit transfer.
(b)
Excessive credit transfer defined
—(1)
In general.
The term
excessive credit transfer
means, with respect to an eligible credit property for which a transfer election is made under § 1.6418-2 or § 1.6418-3 for any taxable year, an amount equal to the excess of—
(i) The amount of the transferred specified credit portion claimed by the transferee taxpayer with respect to such eligible credit property for such taxable year; over
(ii) The amount of the eligible credit that, without the application of section 6418, would be otherwise allowable under the Code with respect to such eligible credit property for such taxable year.
(2)
Multiple transferees treated as one.
All transferee taxpayers are considered as one transferee for calculating whether there was an excessive credit transfer and the amount of the excessive credit transfer. If there was an excessive credit transfer, then the amount of excessive credit transferred to a specific transferee taxpayer is equal to the total excessive credit transferred multiplied by the ratio of the transferee taxpayer's portion of the total specified credit to the total specified credit portions transferred to all transferees. The rule in this paragraph (b)(2) is applied on an eligible credit property basis, as applicable.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b):
(i)
Example 1—No excessive credit transfer.
Taxpayer A claims $40x of an eligible credit and transfers $60x of an eligible credit to Transferee Taxpayer B related to a single facility that was expected to generate $100x of such eligible credit. In a subsequent year it is determined that the facility only generated $60x of such eligible credit. There is no excessive credit transfer in this case because the amount of the eligible credit claimed by Transferee Taxpayer B of $60x is equal to the amount of the credit that would be otherwise allowable with respect to such facility for the taxable year the transfer occurred. Taxpayer A is disallowed the $40x of the eligible credit claimed.
(ii)
Example 2—Excessive credit transfer.
Same facts as in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section (
Example 1
) except that Taxpayer A transfers $75x of the $100x of eligible credit to Transferee Taxpayer B in exchange for a cash payment of $67.5x. Taxpayer A claims $25x
of the eligible credit and Transferee Taxpayer B claims $75x of the eligible credit. In this situation, a $40x reduction in credit results in a $15x excessive credit transfer to Transferee Taxpayer B because the amount of the credit claimed by Transferee Taxpayer B ($75x) exceeds the amount of credit otherwise allowable with respect to the facility ($60x) by $15x. Therefore, Transferee Taxpayer B's tax is increased for the determination year by $18x, which is equal to the amount of the excessive credit transfer plus 20 percent of the excessive credit transfer as provided in paragraph (a) of this section and section 6418(g)(2)(A). If Transferee Taxpayer B can show reasonable cause as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and section 6418(g)(2)(B), then Transferee Taxpayer B will only have a tax increase of $15x. Taxpayer A is disallowed the $25x of the eligible credit claimed. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the portion of the cash payment of $67.5x made by Transferee Taxpayer B that is attributable to the excessive credit transfer is $13.5x and is equal to Transferee Taxpayer B's cash payment of $67.5x multiplied by the ratio of the excessive credit transfer ($15x) to the transferred specified credit portion claimed by Transferee Taxpayer B ($75x). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the payment of $13.5x made to Taxpayer A from Transferee Taxpayer B that directly relate to the excessive credit transfer are not subject to section 6418(b)(2), 6418(b)(3), or § 1.6418-2(e).
(iii)
Example 3
—
Excessive credit with multiple transferees.
Same facts as in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section (
Example 1
) except that Taxpayer A transfers $50x of the eligible credit to Transferee Taxpayer B and $30x of the eligible credit to Transferee Taxpayer C. In exchange for transfer of the credit, Transferee Taxpayer B made a cash payment of $45x and Transferee Taxpayer C made a cash payment of $27x. Taxpayer A claims $20x of the eligible credit, Transferee Taxpayer B claims $50x of the eligible credit, and Transferee Taxpayer C claims $30x of the eligible credit. In this situation, because there are multiple transferees, all transferees are treated as one transferee for determining the excessive credit transfer amount under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. There is a total excessive credit transfer of $20x because the amount of the credit claimed by the transferees in total ($80x) exceeds the amount of credit otherwise allowable with respect to the facility ($60x) by $20x. The excessive credit transfer to Taxpayer B is equal to ($50x/$80x * $20x) = $12.5x, and the excessive credit transfer to Taxpayer C is equal to ($30x/$80x * $20x) = $7.5x. Therefore, Transferee Taxpayer B and Transferee Taxpayer C are subject to the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section. Transferee Taxpayer B's and Transferee Taxpayer C's tax is increased for the determination year by the respective excessive credit transfer amount and 20 percent of the excessive credit transfer amount ($15x for Transferee Taxpayer B and $9x for Transferee Taxpayer C) as provided in paragraph (a) of this section and section 6418(g)(2)(A). If Transferee Taxpayer B or Transferee Taxpayer C can show reasonable cause as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and section 6418(g)(2)(B), then the tax increase will only be $12.5x or $7.5x, respectively. Taxpayer A is disallowed the $20x of eligible credit claimed. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the portion of the cash payment of $45x made by Transferee Taxpayer B that is attributable to its portion of the excessive credit transfer is $11.25x and is equal to Transferee Taxpayer B's cash payment of $45x multiplied by the ratio of the excessive credit transfer ($12.5x) to the transferred specified credit portion claimed by Transferee Taxpayer B ($50x). Similarly, the portion of the cash payment of $27x made by Transferee Taxpayer C that is attributable to its portion of the excessive credit transfer is $6.75x and is equal to Transferee Taxpayer C's cash payment of $27x multiplied by the ratio of the excessive credit transfer ($7.5x) to the transferred specified credit portion claimed by Transferee Taxpayer B ($30x). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the payments made to Taxpayer A by Transferee Taxpayer B ($11.25x) and Transferee Taxpayer C ($6.75x) that directly relate to the excessive credit transfer are not subject
to section 6418(b)(2), 6418(b)(3), or § 1.6418-2(e).
(c)
Basis reduction under section 50(c).
In the case of any transfer election under § 1.6418-2 or § 1.6418-3 with respect to any specified credit portion described in § 1.6418-1(c)(2)(ix) through (xi), section 50(c) will apply to the applicable investment credit property (as defined in section 50(a)(6)(A)) as if such credit was allowed to the eligible taxpayer.
(d)
Notification and impact of recapture under section 50(a)
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any election under § 1.6418-2 or § 1.6418-3 with respect to any specified credit portion described in § 1.6418-1(c)(2)(ix) through (xi), if, during any taxable year, the applicable investment credit property (as defined in section 50(a)(6)(A)) is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be investment credit property with respect to the eligible taxpayer, before the close of the recapture period (as described in section 50(a)(1)(A)), other than as described in § 1.6418-3(a)(6), such eligible taxpayer and the transferee taxpayer must follow the notification process in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, with recapture impacting the transferee taxpayer and eligible taxpayer as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Rules similar to the rules of this paragraph (d) apply in determining the amount of and liability for any section 49(b) recapture as between an eligible taxpayer and the transferee taxpayer.
(2)
Notification requirements
—(i)
Eligible taxpayer.
The eligible taxpayer must provide notice of the occurrence of recapture to the transferee taxpayer. This notice must provide all information necessary for a transferee taxpayer to correctly compute the recapture amount (as defined under section 50(c)(2)), and the notification must occur in sufficient time to allow the transferee taxpayer to compute the recapture amount by the due date of the transferee taxpayer's return (without extensions) for the taxable year in which the recapture event occurs. The eligible taxpayer and transferee taxpayer can contract with respect to the form of the notice and any specific time periods that must be met, so long as the terms of the contractual arrangement do not conflict with the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2)(i). Any additional information that is required or other specific time periods that must be met may be prescribed by the IRS in guidance issued with respect to this notification requirement.
(ii)
Transferee taxpayer.
The transferee taxpayer must provide notice of the recapture amount (as defined in section 50(c)(2)), if any, to the eligible taxpayer. This must occur in sufficient time to allow the eligible taxpayer to calculate any basis adjustment with respect to the investment credit property by the due date of the eligible taxpayer's return (without extensions) for the taxable year in which the recapture event occurs. The eligible taxpayer and transferee taxpayer can contract with respect to the form of the notice and any specific time periods that must be met, so long as the terms of the contractual arrangement do not conflict with the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii). Any additional information that is required or other specific time periods that must be met may be provided in guidance prescribed by the IRS issued with respect to this notification requirement.
(3)
Impact of recapture
—(i)
Section 50(a) recapture event.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, the transferee taxpayer is responsible for any amount of tax increase under section 50(a) upon the occurrence of a recapture event, provided that if an eligible taxpayer retains any amount of an eligible credit determined with respect to an investment credit property directly held by the eligible taxpayer, the amount of the tax increase under section 50(a) that the eligible taxpayer is responsible for is equal to the recapture amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total credit amount that the eligible taxpayer retained, and the denominator of which is the total credit amount determined for the eligible credit property. The amount of the tax increase under section 50(a) that the transferee taxpayer is responsible for is equal to the recapture amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the specified credit portion transferred to the transferee taxpayer, and the denominator of which is the total credit
amount determined for the eligible credit property.
(ii)
Impact of section 50(a) recapture event on basis of investment credit property held by eligible taxpayer.
The eligible taxpayer must increase the basis of the investment credit property (immediately before the event resulting in such recapture) by an amount equal to the recapture amount provided to the eligible taxpayer by the transferee taxpayer under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section and the recapture amount on any credit amounts retained by the eligible taxpayer in accordance with section 50.
(iii)
Impact of partner or shareholder recapture under § 1.6418-3(a)(6).
To the extent that a partner in a transferor partnership or a shareholder in a transferor S corporation recognizes an amount of tax increase under section 50(a) or section 49(b) (that is, a recapture amount) for an investment tax credit determined with respect to investment credit property held directly by the transferor partnership or transferor S corporation that does not result in recapture liability to a transferee taxpayer pursuant to § 1.6418-3(a)(6), that amount reduces the remaining recapture amount under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section with respect to the investment credit property, and thus reduces the remaining recapture amounts to which a transferee taxpayer and eligible taxpayer (to the extent of retained credit amounts that have not been previously recaptured) is liable. The amount of the reduction to the transferee taxpayer is proportionate to the amount of the tax increase for the transferred specified credit portion (based on the partner's or shareholder's distributive share or pro rata share of tax exempt income, respectively, resulting from the transfer).
(iv)
Example (1). Impact of transferor partner recapture event to transferee taxpayer
—(A)
Facts.
A, B, C, and D are equal partners in ABCD partnership, a partnership for Federal tax purposes that accounts for tax items on a calendar year basis. The partnership agreement provides that A, B, C and D share equally in all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit of ABCD partnership. ABCD partnership invests $1,000x in an energy property in accordance with section 48 and places the energy property in service on September 30, 2024. As of the end of 2024, ABCD partnership has $300x of eligible credits under section 48 with respect to energy property. Under § 1.6418-3(b)(2)(iv), each of A's, B's, C's, and D's distributive shares of the otherwise eligible section 48 credits is determined under §§ 1.46-3(f) and 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii) and is equal to $75x (based on each of A, B, C and D being allocated $250x of basis). Before the due date for ABCD partnership's 2024 tax return (with extension), A, B, C, and D agree that with respect to A's $75x distributive share of the otherwise eligible section 48 credits, $60x of eligible credits will be transferred and $15x of eligible credits (or $50x basis) will be allocated to A. A, B, C and D also agree that B, C, and D will each be allocated their respective $75x of the $250x of section 48 eligible credits (or basis). On November 15, 2024, ABCD partnership transfers $60x of its eligible section 48 investment credits to Y, an unrelated taxpayer. On January 1, 2025, A sells 50 percent of its interest in ABCD partnership, which results in recapture under § 1.47-6(a)(2).
(B)
Analysis—recapture from partner A's disposition.
Pursuant to § 1.6418-3(a)(6)(i), A is subject to the rules relating to recapture caused by the disposition of its interest under § 1.47-6(a)(2), and A calculates recapture based on half of its share of the basis of the investment credit property ($125x of basis) because A disposed of 50 percent of its interest in ABCD partnership. This results in a recapture amount of $37.5x to A (that is, the amount of the tax increase that A is responsible for due to the recapture event). Of the $37.5x recapture amount, $7.5x relates to $15x of credits retained by A, and $30x relates to the $60x of A's distributive share of the otherwise eligible section 48 credits that were transferred. This recapture event reduces the total potential recapture with respect to the investment credit property from $300x to $262.5x. Y is not subject to recapture because of partner A's disposition, but, if a recapture event with respect to the energy property takes place at a later date, the rules in § 1.6418-5(d)(3)(i) will
take partner A's disposition and recapture amount into account when determining Y's recapture amount at that date.
(v)
Example (2). Impact of recapture from ABCD partnership's disposition of the investment credit property
—(A)
Facts.
Same facts as Example (1), except that on October 15, 2025, ABCD partnership sells the investment credit property to an unrelated third party.
(B)
Analysis—recapture event from ABCD partnership's disposition.
As a result of ABCD partnership's disposition of the energy property to a third party after one year, but before two years after placing the energy property into service, under section 50(a)(1)(B), the recapture percentage is 80 percent. This means that 80 percent of the remaining $262.5x of eligible section 48 credits (or $210x) is subject to recapture. Because ABCD partnership retained eligible credits related to the energy property, the $210x recapture amount, which is the amount of the tax increase under section 50(a), must be split between ABCD partnership and Y. Under § 1.6418-5(d)(3)(i), ABCD partnership must recapture $186x of the $210x credit amount, which is determined by multiplying the $210x by a fraction, the numerator of which is $232.5x ($240x of retained eligible credits less $7.5x of retained eligible credits already recaptured by A) and the denominator of which is $262.5x ($300x of total credits determined for the energy property less $37.5x credits recaptured with respect to A's distributive share of the otherwise eligible section 48 credits transferred by ABCD partnership to Y and A's distributive share of the eligible credits retained by A). Also under § 1.6418-5(d)(3)(i), Y has a $24x recapture amount determined by multiplying the $210x recapture amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is $30x ($60x specified credit portion transferred to Y less the $30x recaptured by A that relates to A's distributive share of the otherwise eligible section 48 credits transferred by ABCD partnership to Y), and the denominator of which is $262.5x ($300x of total credits determined for the energy property less $37.5x credits recaptured with respect to A's distributive share of the otherwise eligible section 48 credits transferred by ABCD partnership to Y and A's distributive share of the eligible credits retained by A).

Notification and impact of recapture under section 45Q(f)(4)
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any election under § 1.6418-2 or § 1.6418-3 with respect to any specified credit portion described in § 1.6418-1(c)(2)(iii), if, during any taxable year, there is recapture of any section 45Q credit allowable with respect to any qualified carbon oxide that ceases to be captured, disposed of, or used as a tertiary injectant in a manner consistent with section 45Q, before the close of the recapture period (as described in § 1.45Q-5(f)), such eligible taxpayer and the transferee taxpayer must follow the notification process in paragraph (e)(2) of this section with recapture impacting the transferee taxpayer as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(2)
Notification requirements.
The notification requirements for the eligible taxpayer are the same as for an eligible taxpayer that must report a recapture event as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, except that the recapture amount that must be computed is defined in § 1.45Q-5(e).
(3)
Impact of recapture.
The transferee taxpayer is responsible for any amount of tax increase under section 45Q(f)(4) and § 1.45Q-5 upon the occurrence of a recapture event, provided that if an eligible taxpayer retains any amount of an eligible credit determined with respect to a component of carbon capture equipment owned by the eligible taxpayer within a single process train described in § 1.45Q-2(c)(3), the amount of the tax increase under section 45Q(f)(4) that the eligible taxpayer is responsible for is equal to the recapture amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total credit amount that the eligible taxpayer retained, and the denominator of which is the total credit amount determined for the eligible credit property. The amount of the tax increase under section 45Q(f)(4) that the transferee taxpayer is responsible for is equal to the recapture amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the specified credit portion transferred to the transferee taxpayer, and the denominator of which is the total credit
amount determined for the eligible credit property.
(f)
Notification and impact of recapture under section 48(a)(10)(C)
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any election under § 1.6418-2 or § 1.6418-3 with respect to any specified credit portion described in § 1.6418-1(c)(2)(ix), if, during any taxable year, there is recapture under section 48(a)(10)(C) of the Code and § 1.48-13(c)(4) of any increased credit amount under section 48(a)(9)(B)(iii) before the close of the recapture period (as described in § 1.48-13(c)(6)), such eligible taxpayer and the transferee taxpayer must follow the notification process in paragraph (f)(2) of this section with the Federal income tax consequences of recapture impacting the transferee taxpayer as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(2)
Notification requirements.
The notification requirements for the eligible taxpayer are the same as for an eligible taxpayer that must report a recapture event as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, except that the recapture amount that must be computed is defined in § 1.48-13(c)(5).
(3)
Impact of recapture
—(i)
Section 48(a)(10)(C) recapture event.
The transferee taxpayer is responsible for any amount of tax increase under section 48(a)(10)(C) and § 1.48-13(c)(5) upon the occurrence of a recapture event under § 1.48-13(c)(4), provided that if an eligible taxpayer retains any amount of an eligible credit determined with respect to an energy property directly held by the eligible taxpayer, the amount of the tax increase under section 48(a)(10)(C) and § 1.48-13(c)(5) that the eligible taxpayer is responsible for is equal to the recapture amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total credit amount that the eligible taxpayer retained, and the denominator of which is the total credit amount determined for the energy property. The amount of the tax increase under section 48(a)(10)(C) that the transferee taxpayer is responsible for is equal to the recapture amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the specified credit portion transferred to the transferee taxpayer, and the denominator of which is the total credit amount determined for the energy property.
(ii)
Impact of section 48(a)(10)(C) recapture event on basis of energy property held by eligible taxpayer.
The eligible taxpayer must increase the basis of the energy property (as of the first day of the taxable year in which the recapture event occurs) by an amount equal to the recapture amount provided to the eligible taxpayer by the transferee taxpayer pursuant to the notification required under paragraph (f)(2) of this section and the recapture amount on any credit amounts retained by the eligible taxpayer in accordance with section 48(a)(10)(C) and § 1.48-13(c)(4).
(g)
Impact of an ineffective transfer election by an eligible taxpayer.
An ineffective transfer election means that no transfer of an eligible credit has occurred for purposes of section 6418, including section 6418(b). Section 6418 does not apply to the transaction and the tax consequences are determined under any other relevant provisions of the Code. For example, an ineffective election results if an eligible taxpayer tries to elect to transfer a specified credit portion, but the eligible taxpayer did not register and receive a registration number with respect to the eligible credit property (or otherwise satisfy the requirements for making a transfer election under the section 6418 regulations) with respect to which the specified credit portion was determined.
(h)
Carryback and carryforward.
A transferee taxpayer can apply the rules in section 39(a)(4) of the Code (regarding the carryback and carryforward period for applicable credits) to a specified credit portion to the extent the specified credit portion is described in section 6417(b) (list of applicable credits, taking into account any placed in service requirements in section 6417(b)(2), (3), and (5)).
(i)
Rules applicable to real estate investment trusts
—(1)
Treatment of eligible credits prior to transfer.
If a real estate investment trust has eligible credits that it may transfer, the value of those credits is not included in either the numerator or denominator in determining the value of the REIT's total assets in section 856(c)(4) of the Code.
(2)
Treatment of eligible credit transfer for purposes of section 857 safe harbor rules.
The transfer of a specified credit
portion pursuant to a valid transfer election under section 6418 is not a sale for purposes of section 857(b)(6)(C)(iii) and section 857(b)(6)(D)(iv) of the Code.
(j)
Applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, this section applies to taxable years ending on or after April 30, 2024. For taxable years ending before April 30, 2024, taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of this section and §§ 1.6418-1 through 1.6418-3 provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent manner.

Paragraph (f) of this section.
Paragraph (f) of this section applies to taxable years ending on or after December 12, 2024.
[T.D. 9993, 89 FR 34800, Apr. 30, 2024; 89 FR 67860, Aug. 22, 2024, as amended by T.D. 10015, 89 FR 100660, Dec. 12, 2024]
§ 1.6425-1
Adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax by corporation.
(a)
In general.
Any corporation which has made an overpayment of estimated income tax for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1967, may file an application for an adjustment of such overpayment. The right to file an application for an adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax is limited to corporations.
(b)
Contents of application.
(1) The application for an adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax shall be filed on Form 4466. The application shall be filled out in accordance with the instructions accompanying the form, and all information required by the form and instructions must be furnished by the corporation. The application shall be verified in the manner prescribed by section 6065 as in the case of a return of the corporation.
(2) An application for an adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax does not constitute a claim for credit or refund. If such application is disallowed by the district director, or director of a service center, in whole or in part, no suit may be maintained in any court for the recovery of any tax based on such application. The filing of an application for an adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax will not constitute the filing of a claim for credit or refund within the meaning of section 6511 for the purpose of determining whether a claim for refund was filed prior to the expiration of the applicable period of limitation. The corporation, however, may file a claim for credit or refund under section 6402 at any time prior to the expiration of the applicable period of limitation and may maintain a suit based on such claim if it is disallowed or if the district director, or director of a service center, does not act on the claim within 6 months from the date it is filed. Such claim may be filed before, simultaneously with, or after the filing of the application for the adjustment of overpayment of estimated tax. A claim for credit or refund under section 6402 filed after the filing of an application for an adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax is not to be considered an amendment of such application. Such claim, however, in proper cases, may constitute an amendment to a prior claim filed under section 6402.
(c)
Time and place for filing application.
(1) The application for an adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax shall be filed after the last day of the taxable year and on or before the 15th day of the third month thereafter, or before the date on which the corporation first files its income tax return for such taxable year (whether or not it subsequently amends the return), whichever is earlier.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of § 301.6091-1 of this chapter (relating to hand-carried documents), the application on Form 4466 shall be filed with the internal revenue officer designated in instructions applicable to such form.

§ 1.6425-2
Computation of adjustment of overpayment of estimated tax.
(a)
Income tax liability defined.
For purposes of § 1.6425-1, this section, §§ 1.6425-3 and 1.6655-7, relating to excessive adjustment, the term
income tax liability
means the excess of—
(1) The sum of—
(i) The tax imposed by section 11 or 1201(a), or subchapter L of chapter 1 of
the Internal Revenue Code, whichever is applicable; plus
(ii) The tax imposed by section 55; over
(2) The credits against tax provided by part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(b)
Computation of adjustment.
The amount of an adjustment under section 6425 is an amount equal to the excess of the estimated income tax paid by the corporation during the taxable year over the amount which, at the time of filing Form 4466, the corporation estimates as its income tax liability for the taxable year.
(c)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (a) of this section is applicable to applications for adjustments of overpayments of estimated income tax that are filed in taxable years beginning after September 6, 2007.
[T.D. 7059, 35 FR 14547, Sept. 17, 1970, as amended by T.D. 9347, 72 FR 44348, Aug. 7, 2007]
§ 1.6425-3
Allowance of adjustments.
(a)
Limitation.
No application under section 6425 shall be allowed unless the amount of the adjustment is (1) at least 10 percent of the amount which, at the time of filing Form 4466 the corporation estimates as its income tax liability for the taxable year, and (2) at least $500.
(b)
Time prescribed.
The Internal Revenue Service shall act upon an application for an adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax within a period of 45 days from the date on which such application is filed.
(c)
Examination.
Within the 45-day period described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service shall make, to the extent it deems practicable in such period, a limited examination of the application to discover omissions and errors therein. The Service shall calculate the adjustment, which calculation must be set forth in the application for such adjustment, in the manner provided in section 6425(c)(2) for the determination by the corporation of such adjustment. The Service, however, may correct any material error or omission that is discovered upon examination of the application. In determining the adjustment, the Service may correct any mathematical error appearing on the application, and it may likewise make any modification required by the law to correct the corporation's computation of the adjustment. If the required modification has not been made by the corporation and the Service has available the necessary information to make such modification within the 45- day period, it may make such modification. The examination of the application and the allowance of the adjustment shall not prejudice any right of the Service to claim later that the adjustment was improper.
(d)
Disallowance in whole or in part.
If the Internal Revenue Service finds that an application for an adjustment of overpayment of estimated tax contains material omissions or errors, the Service may disallow such application in whole or in part without further action. If, however, the Service deems that any omission or error can be corrected by it within the 45-day period, it may do so and allow the application in whole or in part. In the case of a disallowance or modification, the Service shall notify the corporation of such action. The Service's determination as to whether it can correct any omission or error shall be conclusive. Similarly, its action in disallowing, in whole or in part, any application for an adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax shall be final and may not be challenged in any proceeding. The corporation in such case, however, may file a claim for credit or refund under section 6402, and may maintain a suit based on such claim if it is disallowed or if the Service does not act upon the claim within 6 months from the date it is filed.
(e)
Application of adjustment.
If the Internal Revenue Service allows the adjustment, it may first credit the amount of the adjustment against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the part of the corporation which is due and payable on the date of the allowance of the adjustment before making payment of the balance to the corporation. In such a case, the Service shall notify the corporation of the credit, and refund the balance of the adjustment.
(f)
Effect of adjustment.
(1) For purposes of all sections of the Internal
Revenue Code except section 6655, relating to additions to tax for failure to pay estimated income tax, any adjustment under section 6425 is to be treated as a reduction of prior estimated tax payments as of the date the credit is allowed or the refund is paid. For the purpose of sections 6655(a) through (g), (i), and (j), credit or refund of an adjustment is to be treated as if not made in determining whether there has been any underpayment of estimated income tax and, if there is an underpayment, the period during which the underpayment existed. However, an excessive adjustment under section 6425 is taken into account in applying the addition to tax under section 6655(h).
(2) For the effect of an excessive adjustment under section 6425, see § 1.6655-7.
(3)
Effective/applicability date:
This paragraph (f) is applicable to applications for adjustments of overpayments of estimated income tax that are filed in taxable years beginning after September 6, 2007.
[T.D. 7059, 35 FR 14547, Sept. 17, 1970, as amended by T.D. 9347, 72 FR 44348, Aug. 7, 2007]

# ADDITIONS TO THE TAX, ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS, AND ASSESSABLE PENALTIES
§ 1.6654-1
Addition to the tax in the case of an individual.
(a)
In general.
(1) Section 6654 imposes an addition to the taxes under chapters 1 and 2 of the Code in the case of any underpayment of estimated tax by an individual (with certain exceptions described in section 6654(d)), including any underpayment of estimated qualified State individual income taxes which are treated pursuant to section 6361(a) as if they were imposed by chapter 1. This addition to the tax is in addition to any applicable criminal penalties and is imposed whether or not there was reasonable cause for the underpayment. The amount of the underpayment for any installment date is the excess of:
(i) The following percentages of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year or, if no return was filed, of the tax for such year, divided by the number of installment dates prescribed for such taxable year:
(A) 80 percent in the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, of individuals not referred to in section 6073(b) (relating to income from farming or fishing);
(B) 70 percent in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, of such individuals; and
(C) 66
2/3
percent in the case of individuals referred to in section 6073(b); over
(ii) The amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the last day prescribed for such payment.
(2) The amount of the addition is determinated at the annual rate referred to in the regulations under section 6621 upon the underpayment of any installment of estimated tax for the period from the date such installment is required to be paid until the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year, or the date such underpayment is paid, whichever is earlier. For purposes of determining the period of the underpayment (i) the date prescribed for the payment of any installment of estimated tax shall be determined without regard to any extension of time, and (ii) a payment of estimated tax on any installment date, to the extent that it exceeds the amount of the installment determined under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph for such installment date, shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment.
(3) In determining the amount of the installment paid on or before the last day prescribed for payment thereof, the estimated tax shall be computed without any reduction for the amount which the taxpayer estimates as his credit under section 31 (relating to tax withheld at source on wages), and the amount of such credit shall be deemed a payment of estimated tax. An equal part of the amount of such credit shall be deemed paid on each installment date (determined under section 6153) for the taxable year unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld. In the latter case, all amounts withheld shall be considered as payments of estimated tax on the dates such amounts were actually withheld. Under section 31 the entire amount withheld during a
calendar year is allowed as a credit against the tax for the taxable year which begins in such calendar year. However, where more than one taxable year begins in any calendar year no portion of the amount withheld during the calendar year will be treated as a payment of estimated tax for any taxable year other than the last taxable year beginning in such calendar year. The rules prescribed in this subparagraph for determining the time as of which the amount withheld shall be deemed paid are applicable even though such amount was withheld during a taxable year preceding that for which the credit is allowed.
(4) The term
tax
when used in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall mean:
(i) The tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code (other than by section 56 or, for taxable years ending before September 30, 1968, the tax surcharge imposed by section 51), including any qualified State individual income taxes which are treated pursuant to section 6361(a) as if they were imposed by chapter 1, plus—
(ii) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, the tax imposed by chapter 2 of the Code, minus
(iii) All credits allowed by part IV, subchapter A of chapter 1, except the credit provided by section 31, relating to tax withheld at source on wages, minus
(iv) In the case of an individual who is subject to one or more qualified State individual incomes taxes, the sum of the credits allowed against such taxes pursuant to section 6362(b)(2) (B) or (C) or section 6362(c)(4) and paragraph (c) of § 301.6362-4 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) (relating to the credit for income taxes of other States or political subdivisions thereof) and paragraph (c)(2) of § 301.6361-1 (relating to the credit for tax withheld from wages on account of qualified State individual income taxes), and minus
(v) For taxable years ending after February 29, 1980, the individual's overpayment of windfall profit tax imposed by section 4986 of the Code for the taxable year. For this purpose, the amount of such overpayment is the sum of (A) the amount by which such individual's aggregate windfall profit tax liability for the taxable year as a producer of crude oil is exceeded by withholding of windfall profit tax for the taxable year, and (B) any amount treated under section 6429 or 6430 as an overpayment of windfall profit tax for crude oil removed during the taxable year. The deemed payment date in section 4995(a)(4)(B) for the amount of windfall profit tax withheld with respect to payments for crude oil shall have no effect in the determination of the overpayment of windfall profit tax.
(b)
Statement relating to underpayment.
If there has been an underpayment of estimated tax as of any installment date prescribed for its payment and the taxpayer believes that one or more of the exceptions described in § 1.6654-2 precludes the assertion of the addition to the tax under section 6654, he should attach to his income tax return for the taxable year a Form 2210 showing the applicability of any exception upon which he relies.
(c)
Examples.
The method prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section for computing the addition to the tax may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
An individual taxpayer files his return for the calendar year 1972 on April 15, 1973, showing a tax (income and self-employment tax) of $30,000. He had paid a total of $20,000 of estimated tax in four installments of $5,000 on each of the four installment dates prescribed for such year. No other payments were made prior to the date the return was filed. Since the amount of each installment paid by the last date prescribed for payment thereof is less than one-quarter of 80 percent of the tax shown on the return, the addition to the tax is applicable in respect of the underpayment existing as of each installment date and is computed as follows:
(1) Amount of tax shown on return
$30,000
(2) 80 percent of item (1)
24,000
(3) One-fourth of item (2)
6,000
(4) Deduct amount paid on each installment date
5,000
(5) Amount of underpayment for each installment date (item (3) minus item (4))
1,000
(6) Addition to the tax:
1st installment—period 4-15-72 to 4-15-73
60
2nd installment—period 6-15-72 to 4-15-73
50
3rd installment—period 9-15-72 to 4-15-73
35
4th installment—period 1-15-73 to 4-15-73
15
Total
$160

# Example 2.
An individual taxpayer files his return for the calendar year 1955 on April 15, 1956, showing a tax of $30,000. The requirements of section 6015(a) were first met after April 1 and before June 2, 1955, and a total of $18,000 of estimated tax was paid in three equal installments of $6,000 on each of the three installment dates prescribed for such year. Since the amount of each installment paid by the last date prescribed for payment thereof is less than one-third of 70 percent of the tax shown on the return, the addition to the tax is existing as of each installment date and is applicable in respect of the underpayment computed as follows:
(1) Amount of tax shown on return
$30,000
(2) 70 percent of item (1)
21,000
(3) One-third of item (2)
7,000
(4) Deduct amount paid on each installment date
6,000
(5) Amount of underpayment for each installment date (item (3) minus item (4))
1,000
(6) Addition to the tax:
1st installment—period 6-15-55 to 4-15-56
$50
2d installment—period 9-15-55 to 4-15-56
35
3d installment—period 1-15-56 to 4-15-56

§ 1.6654-2
Exceptions to imposition of the addition to the tax in the case of individuals.
(a)
In general.
The addition to the tax under section 6654 will not be imposed for any underpayment of any installment of estimated tax if, on or before the date prescribed for payment of the installment, the total amount of all payments of estimated tax made equals or exceeds the lesser of the amount in § 1.6654-2(a)(1) or the amount in § 1.6654-2(a)(2).
(1)(i) The amount which would have been required to be paid on or before the date prescribed for payment if the estimated tax were the tax shown on the return for the preceding taxable year, provided that the preceding taxable year was a year of 12 months and a return showing a liability for tax was filed for such year. However, this subparagraph shall not apply with respect to any taxable year which ends on or after September 30, 1968, for which a tax is imposed by section 51 (relating to tax surcharge), in the case of a payment of estimated tax the time prescribed for payment of which is on or after September 15, 1968.
(ii)
Special rule for taxable years beginning in 2009.
For any taxable year beginning in 2009, for a qualified individual, the amount described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is reduced to 90 percent of that amount.
(A)
Qualified individual
means any individual whose adjusted gross income shown on the individual's return for the preceding taxable year is less than $500,000 and who certifies, as prescribed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(D) of this section, that more than 50 percent of the gross income shown on the return for the preceding taxable year was income from a small business.
(B)
Income from a small business
means income from the operation of a bona fide trade or business of which the individual was an owner during calendar year 2009, and that on average had fewer than 500 employees in calendar year 2008.
(C) The trade or business may be organized as, or take the legal form of, a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or sole proprietorship.
(D) A qualified individual shall file a certification of the individual's qualification in the manner and at the time prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms, publications, or other guidance.
(2) The amount which would have been required to be paid on or before the date prescribed for payment if the estimated tax were an amount equal to a percentage of the tax computed by placing on an annual basis the taxable income for the calendar months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid. That percentage is 80 percent in the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, of individuals not referred to in section 6073(b) (relating to income from farming or fishing),
70 percent in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, of such individuals, and 66
2/3
percent in the case of individuals referred to inferred to in section 6073(b). With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, the adjusted self-employment income shall be taken into account in determining the amount referred to in this subparagraph if net earnings from self-employment (as defined in section 1402(a)) for the taxable year equal or exceed $400. For purposes of this subparagraph:
(i) Taxable income shall be placed on an annualized basis:
(A) For taxable years beginning after 1976, by:
(
1
) Multiplying by 12 (or the number of months in the taxable year if less than 12) the adjusted gross income and the itemized deductions for the calendar months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid,
(
2
) Dividing the resulting amounts by the number of such calendar months,
(

) Increasing the amount of the annualized adjusted gross income by the unused zero bracket amount, if any, determined by reference to the annualized itemized deductions, or decreasing the amount of the annualized adjusted gross income by the excess itemized deductions, if any, determined by reference to the annualized itemized deductions (the amount resulting under this step is annualized tax table income), and
(
4
) Deducting from the annualized tax table income the deduction for personal exemptions (such personal exemptions being determined as of the date prescribed for payment of the installment).
If the taxpayer would be eligible to use the tax tables on the basis of annualized tax table income, the amount which would have been required to be paid for purposes of this subparagraph may be determined by applying the tax tables to annualized tax table income. the amount resulting under (3).
(B) For taxable years beginning before 1977, by:
(
1
) Multiplying by 12 (or the number of months in the taxable year if less than 12) the taxable income (computed without the standard deduction and without the deduction for personal exemptions), or the adjusted gross income if the standard deduction is to be used for the calendar months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid,
(
2
) Dividing the resulting amount by the number of such calendar months, and
(
3
) Deducting from such amount the standard deduction, if applicable, and the deduction for personal exemptions (such personal exemptions being determined as of the date prescribed for payment of the installment).
(ii) The term “adjusted self-employment income” means:
(A) The net earnings from self-employment (as defined in section 1402(a)) for the calendar months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid, computed as if such months constituted the taxable year, but not more than
(B) The excess of:
(
1
) For taxable years beginning after 1966, $6,600
(
2
) For taxable years beginning after 1971, $9,000,
(
3
) For taxable years beginning after 1972, $10,800,
(
4
) For taxable years beginning after 1973, $13,200, and
(
5
) For taxable years beginning after 1974, an amount equal to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act) which is effective for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, over the amount of the wages (within the meaning of section 1402(b)) for such calendar months placed on an annual basis. For this purpose, wages are annualized by multiplying by 12 (or the number of months in the taxable year in the case of a taxable year of less than 12 months) the wages for such calendar months and dividing the resulting amount by the number of such months.
(3) An amount equal to 90 percent of the tax computed, at the rates applicable to the taxable year, on the basis of
the actual taxable income for the calendar months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid, as if such months constituted the entire taxable year. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, such computation shall include the tax imposed by chapter 2 on the actual self-employment income for such months. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “actual self-employment income” means:
(i) The net earnings from self-employment (as defined in section 1402(a))for such calendar months, computed as if such months constituted the taxable year, but not more than
(ii) The excess of:
(A) For taxable years beginning after 1966, $6,600,
(B) For taxable years beginning after 1971, $9,000,

(D) For taxable years beginning after 1973, $13,200, and
(E) For taxable years beginning after 1974, an amount equal to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act) which is effective for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, over the amount of wages (within the meaning of section 1402(b)) for such months.
(4) The amount which would have been required to be paid on or before the date prescribed for payment if the estimated tax were an amount equal to a tax determined on the basis of the tax rates and the taxpayer's status with respect to personal exemptions under section 151 for the taxable year, but otherwise on the basis of the facts shown on the return for the preceding taxable year and the law applicable to such year, in the case of an individual required to file a return for such preceding taxable year.
In the case of a taxpayer whose taxable year consists of 52 or 53 weeks in accordance with section 441(f), the rules prescribed by § 1.441-2(c) shall be applicable in determining, for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, whether a taxable year was a year of 12 months and, for purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, the number of calendar months in a taxable year preceding the date prescribed for payment of an installment of estimated tax. For the rules to be applied in determining taxable income for any period described in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph in the case of a taxpayer who employs accounting periods (e.g., thirteen 4-week periods or four 13-week periods) none of which terminates with the end of the applicable period described in subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph, see paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.6655-2.
(b)
Meaning of terms.
As used in this section and § 1.6654-3:
(1) The term “tax” means:
(i) The tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code (other than by section 56), including any qualified State individual income taxes which are treated pursuant to section 6361(a) as if they were imposed by chapter 1, plus
(ii) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, the tax imposed by chapter 2 of the Code, minus
(iii) The credits against tax allowed by part iv, subchapter A, chapter 1 of the Code, other than the credit against tax provided by section 31 (relating to tax withheld on wages), and without reduction for any payments of estimated tax, minus
(iv) In the case of an individual who is subject to one or more qualified State individual income taxes, the sum of the credits allowed against such taxes pursuant to section 6262(b)(2) (B) or (C) or section 6262(c)(4) and paragraph (c) of § 301.6362-4 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) (relating to the credit for income taxes of other States or political subdivisions thereof) and paragraph (c)(2) of § 301.6361-1 (relating to the credit for tax withheld from wages on account of qualified State individual income taxes), and minus
(v) For taxable years ending after February 29, 1980, the individual's overpayment of windfall profit tax imposed by section 4986 of the Code for the taxable year. For this purpose, the amount of such overpayment is the sum of (A) the amount by which such individual's aggregate windfall profit tax liability for the taxable year as producer of crude oil is exceeded by withholding of windfall profit tax for
the taxable year, and (B) any amount treated under section 6429 or 6430 as an overpayment of windfall profit tax for crude oil removed during the taxable year. The deemed payment date in section 4995(a)(4)(B) for the amount of windfall profit tax withheld with respect to payments for crude oil shall have no effect in the determination of the overpayment of windfall profit tax.
(2) The credits against tax allowed by part IV, subchapter A, chapter 1 of the Code, are:
(i) In the case of the exception described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the credits shown on the return for the preceding taxable year,
(ii) In the case of the exceptions described in paragraph (a)(2) and (3) of this section, the credits computed under the law and rates applicable to the current taxable year, and
(iii) In the case of the exception described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the credits shown on the return for the preceding taxable year, except that if the amount of any such credit would be affected by any change in rates or status with respect to personal exemptions, the credits shall be determined by reference to the rates and status applicable to the current taxable year.
A change in rate may be either a change in the rate of tax, such as a change in the rate of the tax imposed by section 1 or section 1401, or a change in a percentage affecting the computation of the credit, such as a change in the rate of withholding under chapter 3 of the Code or a change in the percentage of a qualified investment which is specified in section 46 for use in determining the amount of the investment credit allowed by section 38.
(3) The term “return for the preceding taxable year” means the income tax return for such year which is required by section 6012(a)(1) and, in the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, the self-employment tax return for such year which is required by section 607.
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of the exceptions to the imposition of the addition to the tax for an underpayment of estimated tax, in the case of an individual whose taxable year is the calendar year:

# Example 1.
A, a married man with one child and a dependent parent, files a joint return with his spouse, B, for 1955 on April 15, 1956, showing taxable income of $44,000 and a tax of $16,760. A and B had filed a joint declaration of estimated tax on April 15, 1955, showing an estimated tax of $10,000 which was paid in four equal installments of $2,500 each on April 15, June 15, and September 15, 1955, and January 15, 1956. The balance of $6,760 was paid with the return. A and B have an underpayment of estimated tax of $433 (
1/4
of 70 percent of $16,760, less $2,500) for each installment date. The 1954 calendar year return of A and B showed a liability of $10,000. Since the total amount of estimated tax paid by each installment date equalled the amount that would have been required to be paid on or before each of such dates if the estimated tax were the tax shown on the return for the preceding year, the exception described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies and no addition to the tax will be imposed.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the joint return of A and B for 1954 showed taxable income of $32,000 and a tax liability of $10,400. Assume further that only two personal exemptions under section 151 appeared on the 1954 return. The exception described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section would not apply. However, A and B are entitled to four exemptions under section 151 for 1955. Taxable income for 1954 based on four exemptions, but otherwise on the basis of the facts shown on the 1954 return, would be $30,800. The tax on such amount in the case of a joint return would be $9,836. Since the total amount of estimated tax paid by each installment date exceeds the amount which would have been required to be paid on or before each of such dates if the estimated tax were $9,836, the exception described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section applies and no addition to the tax will be imposed.

# Example 3.
C, who is self-employed (other than as a farmer or fisherman), has annualized taxable income of $6,900 for the period January 1, 1967, through August 31, 1967, the income tax on which is $1,171. For the same period his net earnings from self-employment are $5,000 and his wages are $2,000. The estimated tax payments made by C for 1967 on or before September 15, 1967, total $1,200. For the purposes of the exception described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the adjusted self-employment income is $3,600, computed as follows:
(1) Net earnings from self-employment
$5,000
(2) $6,600 minus annualized wages ($6,600−3,000 ($2,000 × 12 ÷ 8))
3,600
(3) Lesser of (1) or (2)
3,600
The tax on C's adjusted self-employment income would be $230.40 ($3,600 × 6.4 percent). Since the total amount of estimated tax paid on or before September 15, 1967, exceeds $1,121.12, that is, 80 percent of $1,401.40 ($1,171 + 230.40), the exception described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies and no addition to tax will be imposed.

# Example 4.
D, who is self-employed (other than as a farmer or fisherman), has actual taxable income of $3,800 for the period January 1, 1967, through August 31, 1967, the income tax on which is $586. For the same period his net earnings from self-employment are $5,000 and his wages are $2,000. The estimated tax payments made by D for 1967 on or before September 15, 1967, total $840. For the purposes of the exception described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the actual self-employment income for this period is $4,600, computed as follows:
(1) Net earnings from self-employment
$5,000
(2) $6,600 minus wages ($6,600−2,000)
4,600
(3) Lesser of (1) or (2)
4,600
The tax on D's actual self-employment income would be $294.40 ($4,600 × 6.4 percent). Since the total amount of estimated tax paid by September 15, 1967, exceeds $792.36, that is, 90 percent of $880.40 ($586 + 294.40), the exception described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section applies and no addition to tax will be imposed.

# Example 5.
E and F, his spouse, filed a joint return for the calendar year 1967, showing a tax liability of $10,000. The liability, attributable primarily to income received during the last quarter of the year, included both income and self-employment tax. Their aggregate payments of estimated tax on or before September 15, 1967, total $1,350, representing three installments of $450 paid on each of the first three installment dates prescribed for the taxable year. Since each installment paid, $450, was less then $2,000 (
1/4
of 80 percent of $10,000), there was an underpayment on each of the installment dates. Assume that the exceptions described in paragraph (a) (1) and (4) of this section do not apply. Actual taxable income for the three months ending March 31, 1967, was $2,000 and for the five months ending May 31, 1967, was $4,500. Actual self-employment income, for the same periods, was $2,000 and $4,000, respectively. Since the amounts paid by the April 15 and June 15 installment dates, $450 and $900, respectively, exceed $376.20 and $873.90, respectively (90 percent of the income tax on the actual taxable income of $2,000 and $4,500, respectively, determined on the basis of a joint return, and the self-employment tax on the actual self-employment income of $2,000 and $4,000, respectively), the exception described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section applies and no addition to the tax will be imposed for the underpayments on the April 15 and June 15 installment dates. For the eight months ending August 31, 1967, actual taxable income, assuming E and F did not elect to use the standard deduction, was $7,500; net earnings from self-employment were $6,000 and wages were $2,700. Since the total amount paid by the September 15 installment date, $1,350, was less than $1,381.14 (90 percent of the income tax on the actual taxable income of $7,500 determined on the basis of a joint return and the self-employment tax on actual self-employment income of $3,900 ($6,600−2,700)), the exception described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section does not apply to the September 15 installment. Furthermore, the exception described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply, as illustrated by the following computation:
(1) Income tax:
Taxable income for the period ending Aug. 31, 1967 (without deduction for personal exemptions) on an annual basis ($8,700 × 12 ÷ 8)
$13,050.00
Deduction for two personal exemptions
1,200.00
11,850.00
Tax on $11,850 (on the basis of a joint return)
2,227.00
(2) Self-employment tax:
Net earnings from self-employment
6,000.00
Adjusted self-employment income ($6,600−4,050 annualized wages ($2,700 × 12 ÷ 8))
2,550.00
Tax on adjusted self-employment income ($2,550 × 6.4 percent)
163.20
(3) Total tax ($2,227.00 + 163.20)
2,390.20
(4)
3/4
of 80 percent of $2,390.20
1,434.12
Amount paid by Sept. 15, 1967
1,350.00
An addition to the tax will thus be imposed for the underpayment of $1,550 ($2,000−450) on the September 15 installment.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in example (5) and assume further that adjusted gross income for the eight months ending August 31, 1967, was $9,200 and the amount of deductions (other than the deduction for personal exemptions) not allowable in determining adjusted gross income aggregate only $500. If E and F elect, they may use the standard deduction in computing the tax for purposes of the exceptions described in paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this section. Taxable income for purposes of the exception described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section would be reduced to $7,080 ($9,200 less $1,200 for two personal exemptions and $920 for the standard deduction). The income tax thereon is $1,205.20; income tax and self-employment tax total $454.80 ($1,205.20 + 249.60 ($3,900 × 6.4 percent)). Since the amount paid by the September 15 installment date, $1,350, exceeds $1,309.32 (90 percent of $1,454.80), the exception described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section applies. However, the exception described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply, as illustrated by the following computation:
Adjusted gross income for period ending Aug. 31, 1967
$9,200.00
Adjusted gross income annualized ($9,200 × 12 ÷ 8)
13,800.00
Taxable income annualized ($13,800 minus $1,200 for two personal exemptions and $1,000 for the standard deduction)
11,600.00
Tax on $11,600 (on basis of joint return)
2,172.00
Self-employment tax on adjusted self-employment income ($2,550 × 6.4 percent)
163.20
Total tax ($2,172.00 + 163.20
2,335.20
3/4
of 80 percent of $2,335.20
1,401.12
Amount paid by Sept. 15, 1967
1,350.00

# Example 7.
G was a married individual, 73 years of age, who filed a joint return with his wife, H, for the calendar year 1956. H, who was 70 years of age, had no income during the year. G had taxable income in the amount of $7,000 for the eight-month period ending on August 31, 1956, which included $2,000 of dividend income (after excluding $50 under section 116) and $900 of rental income. The $7,000 figure also reflected a deduction of $2,400 for personal exemptions ($600 × 4), since G and H are both over 65 years of age. The application of the exception described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to an underpayment of estimated tax on the September 15 installment date may be illustrated by the following computation:
Taxable income for the period ending Aug. 31, 1956 (without deduction for personal exemptions) on an annual basis ($9,400 × 12 ÷ 8)
$14,100.00
Deduction for personal exemptions

# Example 8.
C, an unmarried individual for whom another taxpayer is entitled to a deduction under section 151(e), has adjusted gross income of $4,000 for the period January 1, 1977, through August 31, 1977. All of C's income is non-exempt interest. For the same period C, who is entitled to one personal exemption, has itemized deductions amounting to $300. C is entitled to no credits other than the general tax credit. C filed a declaration of estimated tax on April 15, 1977, and on or before September 15, 1977, makes estimated tax payments for 1977 which total $460. For purposes of determining whether the exception described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies, the following computations are necessary:
Adjusted gross income for the period ending Aug. 31, 1977, on an annual basis ($4,000 × 12 ÷ 8)
$6,000.00
Itemized deductions for the period ending Aug. 31, 1977, on an annual basis ($300 × 12 ÷ 8)

# Example 9.
An unmarried taxpayer entitled to one exemption, has adjusted gross income of $16,000 and itemized deductions of $2,000 for the period for the period January 1, 1977, through August 31, 1977. D has no net earnings from self-employment and is entitled to no credits other than the general tax credit. D files a declaration of estimated tax on April 15, 1977, and on or before September 15, 1977, makes estimated tax payments for 1977 which total $3,000. For purposes of determining whether the exception in paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies, the following computations are necessary:
Adjusted gross income for the period ending Aug. 31, 1977, on an annual basis ($16,000 × 12 ÷ 8)

(d)
Determination of taxable income for installment periods
—(1)
In general.
(i) In determining the applicability of the exceptions described in paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this section, there must be an accurate determination of the amount of income and deductions for the calendar months in the taxable year preceding the installment date as of which the determination is made, that is, for the period terminating with the last day of the third, fifth, or eighth month of the taxable year. For example, a taxpayer distributes year-end bonuses to his employees but does not determine the amount of the bonuses until the last month of the taxable year. He may not deduct any portion of such year-end bonuses in determining his taxable income for any installment period other than the final installment period for the taxable year, since deductions are not allowable until paid or accrued, depending on the taxpayer's method of accounting.
(ii) If a taxpayer on an accrual method of accounting wishes to use either of the exceptions described in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section, he must establish the amount of income and deductions for each applicable period. If his income is derived from a business in which the production, purchase, or sale of merchandise is an income-producing factor requiring the use of inventories, he will be unable to determine accurately the amount of his taxable income for the applicable period unless he can establish, with reasonable accuracy, his cost of goods sold for the applicable installment period. The cost of goods sold for such period shall be considered, unless a more exact determination is available, as such part of the cost of goods sold during the entire taxable year as the gross receipts from sales for such installment period is of gross receipts from sales for the entire taxable year.
(2)
Members of partnerships.
The provisions of this subparagraph shall apply in determining the applicability of the exceptions described in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section to an underpayment of estimated tax by a taxpayer who is a member of a partnership.
(i) For purposes of determining taxable income, there shall be taken into account:
(A) The partner's distributive share of partnership items set forth under section 702,
(B) The amount of any guaranteed payments under section 707(c), and
(C) Gains or losses on partnership distributions which are treated as gains or losses on sales of property.
(ii) For purposes of determining net earnings from self-employment (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966) there shall be taken into account:
(A) The partner's distributive share of income or loss, described in section 702(a)(9), subject to the special rules set forth in section 1402(a) and §§ 1.1402(a)-1 to 1.1402(a)-16, inclusive, and
(B) The amount of any guaranteed payments under section 707(c), except for payments received from a partnership not engaged in a trade or business within the meaning of section 1402(c) and § 1.1402(c)-1.
In determining a partner's taxable income and, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, net earnings from self-employment, for the months in his taxable year which precede the month in which the installment date falls, the partner shall take into account items set forth in sections 702 and 1402(a) for any partnership taxable year ending with or within his taxable year to the extent that such items are attributable to months in such partnership taxable year which precede the month in which the installment date falls. For special rules used in computing a partner's net earnings from self-employment in the case of the termination of his taxable year as a result of death, see section 1402(f) and § 1.1402(f)-1. In addition, a partner shall include in his taxable income and, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, net earnings from self-employment, for the months in his taxable year which precede the month in which the installment date falls guaranteed payments from the partnership to the extent that such guaranteed payments are includible in his taxable
income for such months. See section 706(a), section 707(c), paragraph (c) of § 1.707-1 and section 1402(a).
(iii) The provisions of subdivision (i) (A) and (B) of this subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, whose taxable year is the calendar year, is a member of a partnership whose taxable year ends on January 31. A must take into account, in determining his taxable income for the installment due on April 15, 1973, all of his distributive share of partnership items described in section 702 and the amount of any guaranteed payments made to him which were deductible by the partnership in the partnership taxable year beginning on February 1, 1972, and ending on January 31, 1973. A must take into account, in determining his net earnings from self-employment, his distributive share of partnership income or loss described in section 702(a)(9), subject to the special rules set forth in section 1402(a) and §§ 1.1402(a)-1 to 1.1402(a)-16, inclusive.

# Example 2.
Assume that the taxable year of the partnership of which A, a calendar year taxpayer, is a member ends on June 30. A must take into account in the determination of his taxable income and net earnings from self-employment for the installment due on April 15, 1973, his distributive share of partnership items for the period July 1, 1972, through March 31, 1973; for the installment due on June 15, 1973, he must take into account such amounts for the period July 1, 1972, through May 31, 1973; and for the installment due on September 15, 1973, he must take into account such amounts for the entire partnership taxable year of July 1, 1972, through June 30, 1973 (the date on which the partnership taxable year ends).
(3)
Beneficiaries of estates and trusts.
In determining the applicability of the exceptions described in paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this section as of any installment date, the beneficiary of an estate or trust must take into account his distributable share of income from the estate or trust for the applicable period (whether or not actually distributed) if the trust or estate is required to distribute income to him currently. If the estate or trust is not required to distribute income currently, only the amounts actually distributed to the beneficiary during such period must be taken into account. If the taxable year of the beneficiary and the taxable year of the estate or trust are different, there shall be taken into account the beneficiary's distributable share of income, or the amount actually distributed to him as the case may be, during the months in the taxable year of the estate or trust ending within the taxable year of the beneficiary which precede the month in which the installment date falls. See subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for examples of a similar rule which is applied when a partner and the partnership of which he is a member have different taxable years.
(e)
Special rule in case of change from joint return or separate return for the preceding taxable year
—(1)
Joint return to separate returns.
In determining the applicability of the exceptions described in paragraph (a) (1) and (4) of this section to an underpayment of estimated tax, a taxpayer filing a separate return who filed a joint return for the preceding taxable year shall be subject to the following rule: The tax:
(i) Shown on the return for the preceding taxable year, or
(ii) Based on the tax rates and personal exemptions for the current taxable year but otherwise determined on the basis of the facts shown on the return for the preceding taxable year, and the law applicable to such year,
shall be that portion of the tax which bears the same ratio to the whole of the tax as the amount of the tax for which the taxpayer would have been liable bears to the sum of the taxes for which the taxpayer and his spouse would have been liable had each spouse filed a separate return for the preceding taxable year. For rules with respect to the allocation of joint payments of estimated tax, see § 1.6654-2(e)(5).
(2)
Examples.
The rule in paragraph (i) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
H and W filed a joint return for the calendar year 1955 showing taxable income of $20,000 and a tax of $5,280. Of the $20,000 taxable income, $18,000 was attributable to H, and $2,000 was attributable to W. H and W filed separate returns for 1956. The tax shown on the return for the preceding taxable year, for purposes of determining the applicability of the exception described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to an underpayment of estimated tax by H for 1956, is determined as follows:
Taxable income of H for 1955
$18,000
Tax on $18,000 (on basis of separate return)
6,200
Taxable income of W for 1955
2,000
Tax on $2,000 (on basis of separate return)
400
Aggregate tax of H and W (on basis of separate returns)
6,600
Portion of 1955 tax shown on joint return attributable to H (6200/6600 × 5280)
4,960

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) and that H and W file a joint declaration of estimated tax for 1956 and pay estimated tax in amounts determined on the basis of their eligibility for three rather than two exemptions for 1956. H and W ultimately file separate income tax returns for 1956. Assume further that the exception described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply. The tax based on the tax rates and personal exemptions for 1956 but otherwise determined on the basis of the facts shown on the return for 1955 and the law applicable to 1955, for purposes of determining the applicability of the exception described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section to an underpayment of estimated tax by H for 1956, is determined as follows:
Taxable income of H and W for 1955 based on additional personal exemption for 1956
$19,400
Tax on 1955 income based on joint return rate for 1956
5,076
Portion of 1955 tax attributable to H (computed as in example (1) but allowing benefit of additional exemption to H)
5900/6300
Portion of tax attributable to H based on tax rates and personal exemptions for 1956 but otherwise on facts on 1955 return ($5900/6300 × $5,076)
$4,754

# Example 3.
Assume that H and W had the same taxable income in 1972 as in 1955, and that they filed a joint return for 1972 and separate returns for 1973. Assume further that H's taxable income for 1972 included net earnings from self-employment in excess of the $9,000 maximum base for the self-employment tax for 1972, and that the joint return filed by H and W for 1972 showed tax under Chapter 1 (other than section 56) and tax under Chapter 2 totaling $5,055. The tax shown on the return for 1972, for purposes of determining the applicability of the exception described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to an underpayment of estimated tax by H for 1973, is determined as follows:
Taxable income of H for 1972
$18,000
Chapter 1 tax (other than section 56 tax) on $18,000 (on basis of separate return)
5,170
Self-employment income of H for 1972
9,000
Chapter 2 tax on $9,000
$675
Total of such taxes
$5,845
Taxable income of W for 1972
2,000
Chapter 1 tax (other than section 56 tax) on $2,000 (on basis of separate return)
310
Aggregate tax on H and W (on basis of separate returns)
$6,155
Portion of 1972 tax shown on joint return attributable to H (5845/6155 × $5,055)
$4,800.40
(3)
Separate return to joint return.
In the case of a taxpayer who files a joint return for the taxable year with respect to which there is an underpayment of estimated tax and who filed a separate return for the preceding taxable year:
(i) The tax shown on the return for the preceding taxable year, for purposes of determining the applicability of the exception described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, shall be the sum of both the tax shown on the return of the taxpayer and the tax shown on the return of the taxpayer's spouse for such preceding year, and
(ii) The facts shown on both the taxpayer's return and the return of his spouse for the preceding taxable year shall be taken into account for purposes of determining the applicability of the exception described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(4)
Example.
The rules described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
H and W filed separate income tax returns for the calendar year 1954 showing tax liabilities of $2,640 and $350, respectively. In 1956 they married and participated in the filing of a joint return for that year. In the filing of a joint return for that year. Thus, for the purpose of determining the applicability of the exceptions described in paragraph (a)(1) and (4) of this section to an underpayment of estimated tax for the year 1955, the tax shown on the return for the preceding taxable year is $2,990 ($2,640 plus $350).
(Secs. 6015, 6154, 6654, 6655, and 7805, Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (96 Stat. 2395 and 2396, 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 6015, 6154, 6654, 6655, and 7805))
(5)
Joint payments of estimated tax
—(i)
In general.
A husband and wife may make a joint payment of estimated tax even though they are not living together. However, a joint payment of estimated tax may not be made if the husband and wife are separated under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance. A joint payment of estimated tax may not be made if the taxpayer's spouse is a nonresident alien (including a nonresident alien who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico or a possession to which section 931 applies during the entire taxable year), unless an election is in effect for the taxable year under section 6013(g) or (h) and the regulations. In addition, a joint payment of estimated tax may not be made if the taxpayer's spouse has a taxable year
different from that of the taxpayer. If a joint payment of estimated tax is made, the amount estimated as the income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code must be computed on the aggregate estimated taxable income of the spouses (see section 6013(d)(3) and § 1.2-1), whereas, if applicable, the amount estimated as the self-employment tax imposed by chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code must be computed on the separate estimated self-employment income of each spouse. See sections 1401 and 1402 and § 1.6017-1(b)(1). The liability with respect to the estimated tax, in the case of a joint payment, shall be joint and several.
(ii)
Application to separate returns.
(A) Although a husband and wife may make a joint payment of estimated tax, they, nevertheless, can file separate returns. If they make a joint payment of estimated tax and file separate returns for the same taxable year with respect to which the joint payment was made, the payment made on account of the estimated tax for that taxable year may be treated as a payment on account of the tax liability of either the husband or wife for the taxable year, or may be divided between them in such manner as they may agree.
(B) In the event the husband and wife fail to agree to a division of the estimated tax payment, such payment shall be allocated between them in accordance with the following rule. The portion of such payment to be allocated to a taxpayer shall be that portion of the aggregate of all such payments as the amount of tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code shown on the separate return of the taxpayer (plus, if applicable, the amount of tax imposed by chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code shown on the return of the taxpayer) bears to the sum of the taxes imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code shown on the separate returns of the taxpayer and the spouse (plus, if applicable, the sum of the taxes imposed by chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code shown on the separate returns of the taxpayer and the spouse).
(6)
Example.
The rule described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) H and W make a joint payment of estimated tax of $19,500 for the taxable year. H and W subsequently file separate returns for the taxable year showing tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code in the amount of $11,500 and $8,000, respectively. In addition, H's return shows a tax imposed by chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code in the amount of $500. H and W fail to agree to a division of the estimated tax paid. The amount of the aggregate estimated tax payments allocated to H is determined as follows:
(A) Chapter 1 tax shown on H's return—$11,500
(B) Plus: Amount of tax imposed by chapter 2 shown on H's return—$500
(C) Total taxes imposed by chapter 1 and by chapter 2 shown on H's return—$12,000
(D) Amount of tax imposed by chapter 1 shown on W's return—$8,000
(E) Total taxes imposed by chapter 1 and by chapter 2 on both H's and W's—$20,000 returns
(F) Proportion of taxes shown on H's return to total amount—($12,000/$20,000) 60% of taxes shown on both H's and W's returns
(G) Amount of estimated tax payments allocated to H (60% of $19,500)—$11,700
(ii) Accordingly, H's return would show a balance due in the amount of $300 ($12,000 taxes shown less $11,700 estimated tax allocated).
(7)
Death of spouse.
(i) A joint payment of estimated tax may not be made after the death of either the husband or wife. However, if it is reasonable for a surviving spouse to assume that there will be filed a joint return for himself and the deceased spouse for his taxable year and the last taxable year of the deceased spouse, he may, in making a separate payment of estimated tax for his taxable year which includes the period comprising such last taxable year of his spouse, estimate the amount of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code on his and his spouse's taxable income on an aggregate basis and compute his estimated tax with respect to chapter 1 tax in the same manner as though a joint return had been filed.
(ii) If a husband and wife make a joint payment of estimated tax and thereafter one spouse dies, no further payments of joint estimated tax liability are required from the estate of the decedent. The surviving spouse, however, shall be liable for the payment of any subsequent installments of the joint estimated tax. For the purpose of
making an amended payment of estimated tax by the surviving spouse, and the allocation of payments made pursuant to a joint payment of estimated tax between the surviving spouse and the legal representative of the decedent in the event a joint return is not filed, the payment of estimated tax may be divided between the decedent and the surviving spouse in such proportion as the surviving spouse and the legal representative of the decedent may agree.
(iii) If the surviving spouse and the legal representative of the decedent fail to agree to a division of a payment, such payment shall be allocated in accordance with the following rule. The portion of such payment to be allocated to the surviving spouse shall be that portion of the aggregate amount of such payments as the amount of tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code shown on the separate return of the surviving spouse (plus, if applicable, the amount of tax imposed by chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code shown on the return of the surviving spouse) bears to the sum imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code shown on the separate returns of the surviving spouse and of the decedent (plus, if applicable, the sum of the taxes imposed by chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code shown on the returns of the surviving spouse and of the decedent); and the balance of such payments shall be allocated to the decedent. This rule may be illustrated by analogizing the surviving spouse described in this rule to H in the example contained in paragraph (e)(6) of this section and the decedent in this rule to W in that example.
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section applies to any taxable year beginning in 2009 and does not apply to any taxable years beginning before or after 2009.

§ 1.6654-3
Short taxable years of individuals.
(a)
In general.
The provisions of section 6654, with certain modifications relating to the application of section 6654(d), which are explained in paragraph (b) of this section, are applicable in the case of a short taxable year.
(b)
Rules as to application of section 6654(d).
(1) In any case in which the taxable year for which an underpayment of estimated tax exists is a short taxable year due to a change in annual accounting periods, in determining the tax:
(i) Shown on the return for the preceding taxable year (for purposes of section 6654(d)(1)), or
(ii) Based on the personal exemptions and rates for the current taxable year but otherwise on the basis of the facts shown on the return for the preceding taxable year, and the law applicable to such year (for purposes of section 6654(d)(4)),
the tax will be reduced by multiplying it by the number of months in the short taxable year and dividing the resulting amount by 12.
(2) If the taxable year for which an underpayment of estimated tax exists is a short taxable year due to a change in annual accounting periods, in annualizing the taxable income for the months in the taxable year preceding an installment date, for purposes of section 6654(d)(1)(C), the personal exemptions allowed as deductions under section 151 shall be reduced to the same extent that they are reduced under section 443(c) in computing the tax for a short taxable year.
(3) If “the preceding taxable year” referred to in section 6654(d)(4) was a short taxable year, for purposes of determining the applicability of the exception described in section 6654(d)(4), the tax, computed on the basis in the facts shown on the return for the preceding year, shall be the tax computed on the annual basis in the manner described in section 443(b)(1) (prior to its reduction in the manner described in the last sentence thereof). If the tax rates or the taxpayer's status with respect to personal exemptions for the taxable year with respect to which the underpayment occurs differ from such
rates or status applicable to the preceding taxable year, the tax determined in accordance with this subparagraph shall be recomputed to reflect the rates and status applicable to the year with respect to which the underpayment occurs.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12149, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7427, 41 FR 34033, Aug. 12, 1976; T.D. 9224, 70 FR 52301, Sept. 2, 2005]
§ 1.6654-4
[Reserved]
§ 1.6654-5
Payments of estimated tax.
(a)
In general.
A payment of estimated tax by an individual shall be determined on Form 1040-ES. For the purpose of determining the estimated tax, the amount of gross income which the taxpayer can reasonably expect to receive or accrue, depending upon the method of accounting upon which taxable income is computed, and the amount of the estimated allowable deductions and credits to be taken into account in computing the amount of estimated tax, shall be determined upon the basis of the facts and circumstances existing at the time prescribed for determining the estimated tax, as well as those reasonably to be anticipated for the taxable year. If, therefore, the taxpayer is employed at the date prescribed for making an estimated tax payment at a given wage or salary, the taxpayer should presume, in the absence of circumstances indicating the contrary, for the purpose of the estimated tax payment that such employment will continue to the end of the taxable year at the wage or salary received by the taxpayer as of such date. In the case of income other than wages and salary, the regularity in the payment of income, such as dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and income arising from estates and trusts is a factor to be taken into consideration. Thus, if the taxpayer owns shares of stock in a corporation, and dividends have been paid regularly for several years upon the stock, the taxpayer should, in the absence of information indicating a change in the dividend policy, include the prospective dividends from the corporation for the taxable year as well as those actually received in such year prior to determining the estimated tax. In the case of a taxpayer engaged in business on his own account, there shall be made an estimate of gross income and deductions and credits in the light of the best available information affecting the trade, business, or profession.
(b)
Computation of estimated tax.
In computing the estimated tax the taxpayer should take into account the taxes, credits, and other amounts listed in § 1.6654-1(a)(4).
[T.D. 9224, 70 FR 52301, Sept. 2, 2005]
§ 1.6654-6
Nonresident alien individuals.
(a)
In general.
A nonresident alien individual is required to make a payment of estimated tax if that individual's gross income meets the requirements of section 6654 and § 1.6654-1. In making the determination under section 6654 as to whether the amount of the gross income of a nonresident alien individual is such as to require making a payment of estimated income tax, only the filing status relating to a single individual (other than a head of household) or to a married individual not entitled to file a joint return shall apply, unless an election is in effect 1 for the taxable year under section 6013(g) or (h) and the regulations.
(b)
Determination of gross income.
To determine the gross income of a nonresident alien individual who is not, or does not expect to be, a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico or a possession to which section 931 applies during the entire taxable year, see section 872 and §§ 1.872-1 and 1.872-2. To determine the gross income of a nonresident alien individual who is, or expects to be, a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico or a possession to which section 931 applies during the entire taxable year, see section 876 and the regulations. For rules for determining whether an individual is a bona fide resident of a United States possession (including Puerto Rico), see section 937 and the regulations.
[T.D. 9224, 70 FR 52301, Sept. 2, 2005]
§ 1.6654-7
Applicability.
Section 6654 is applicable only with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1954. Section 294(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939
shall continue in force with respect to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1955.

[T.D. 9347, 72 FR 44348, Aug. 7, 2007, as amended by T.D. 9870, 84 FR 33692, July 15, 2019]
§ 1.6655-1
Addition to the tax in the case of a corporation.
(a)
In general.
Section 6655 imposes an addition to the tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code in the case of any underpayment of estimated tax by a corporation. An addition to tax due to the underpayment of estimated taxes is determined by applying the underpayment rate established under section 6621 to the amount of the underpayment, for the period of the underpayment. This addition to the tax is in addition to any applicable criminal penalties and is imposed whether or not there was reasonable cause for the underpayment.
(b)
Amount of underpayment.
The amount of the underpayment for any required installment is the excess of—
(1) The required installment; over
(2) The amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the last date prescribed for such payment.
(c)
Period of the underpayment.
The period of the underpayment of any required installment runs from the date the installment was required to be paid to the 15th day of the 3rd month following the close of the taxable year, or to the date such underpayment is paid, whichever is earlier. For purposes of determining the period of the underpayment a payment of estimated tax will be credited against unpaid required installments in the order in which such installments are required to be paid.
(d)
Amount of required installment
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section and §§ 1.6655-2 through 1.6655-7, the amount of any required installment is 25 percent of the lesser of—
(i) 100 percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year (or, if no return is filed, 100 percent of the tax for such year); or
(ii) 100 percent of the tax shown on the return for the preceding taxable year.
(2)
Exception.
This paragraph (d)(1)(ii) does not apply if the preceding taxable year was not a taxable year of 12 months or the corporation did not file a return for the preceding taxable year showing a liability for tax.
(e)
Large corporation required to pay 100 percent of current year tax
—(1)
In
general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply in the case of a large corporation (as defined in § 1.6655-4).
(2)
May use last year's tax for first installment.
Paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply for purposes of determining the amount of the 1st required installment for any taxable year. Any reduction in such 1st installment by reason of the preceding sentence is recaptured by increasing the amount of the next required installment determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section by the amount of such reduction and, if the next required installment is reduced by use of the annualized income installment method under § 1.6655-2 or the adjusted seasonal installment method under § 1.6655-3, by increasing subsequent required installments determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section to the extent that the reduction has not previously been recaptured.
(f)
Required installment due dates
—(1)
Number of required installments.
Unless otherwise provided, corporations must make 4 required installments for each taxable year.
(2)
Time for payment of installments
—(i)
Calendar year.
Unless otherwise provided, in the case of a calendar year taxpayer, the due dates of the required installments are as follows:
1st April 15
2nd June 15
3rd September 15
4th December 15
(ii)
Fiscal year.
In the case of a taxpayer other than a calendar year taxpayer, the due dates of the required installments are as follows:
1st 15th day of 4th month of the taxable year
2nd 15th day of 6th month of the taxable year
3rd 15th day of 9th month of the taxable year
4th 15th day of 12th month of the taxable year
(iii)
Short taxable year.
See § 1.6655-5 for rules regarding required installments for corporations with a short taxable year.
(iv)
Partial month.
Except as otherwise provided, for purposes of determining the due date of any required installment, a partial month is treated as a full month.
(g)
Definitions.
(1) The term
tax
as used in this section and §§ 1.6655-2 through 1.6655-7 means the excess of—
(i) The sum of—
(A) The tax imposed by section 11, section 1201(a), or subchapter L of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever is applicable;
(B) The tax imposed by section 55; plus
(C) The tax imposed by section 887; over
(ii) The credits against tax provided by part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(2)(i) In the case of a foreign corporation subject to taxation under section 11, section 1201(a), or subchapter L of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, the tax imposed by section 881 is treated as a tax imposed by section 11.
(ii) In the case of a partnership that is treated, pursuant to regulations issued under section 1446(f)(2), as a corporation for purposes of this section, the tax imposed by section 1446 is treated as a tax imposed by section 11.
(iii) Unless otherwise provided in the Internal Revenue Code or Treasury regulations, for purposes of the definition of “tax” as used in this section, a recapture of tax, such as a recapture provided by section 50(a)(1)(A), and any other similar provision, is not considered to be a tax imposed by section 11.
(iv) For the purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, the return for the preceding taxable year is the Federal income tax return for such taxable year that is required by section 6012(a)(2). However, if an amended Federal income tax return has been filed before the due date of an installment, then the return for the preceding taxable year is the Federal income tax return as amended. If an amended Federal income tax return has been filed on or after the due date for an installment, then the return for the preceding taxable year does not include for such installment period the Federal income tax return as amended subsequent to the due date for such installment. Paragraph (d) of this section will apply without regard to whether the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year is filed in a timely manner.
(h)
Special rules for consolidated returns
For special rules relating to the determination of the amount of the underpayment in the case of a corporation whose income is included in a consolidated return, see § 1.1502-5(b).
(i)
Overpayments applied to subsequent taxable year's estimated tax
—(1)
In general.
If a taxpayer elects under the provisions of sections 6402(b) and 6513(d) and the regulations to apply an overpayment in year one against the estimated tax liability for year two, the overpayment will be applied to the required installment payments for year two in the order due and to the extent necessary to satisfy such installments, similar to the manner in which an actual overpayment of one installment is carried forward to the next installment. No interest is accrued or paid on an overpayment if the election to apply the overpayment against estimated tax is made.
(2)
Subsequent examinations.
If a deficiency is determined in an examination of a return for a taxable year that originally reflected an overpayment that was applied against estimated tax for the succeeding taxable year, interest on the deficiency will not begin to accrue on an amount applied until that amount is used to satisfy a required estimated tax payment in such taxable year. Regardless of whether the taxpayer anticipated the application of such overpayment from the prior taxable year in calculating and paying its required estimated tax installment liabilities for the current taxable year, the subsequently determined underpayment and interest computation thereon will not change the taxpayer's original election to apply the overpayment against the estimated tax liability of the succeeding taxable year. Any changes to the usage of the original overpayment from the prior taxable year are hypothetical only and solely for the purpose of computing deficiency interest. Overpayment interest will not be impacted. For further guidance, see Rev. Rul. 99-40 (1999-2 CB 441), (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).

Examples.
The method prescribed in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) X, a calendar year corporation, estimates its tax liability for its taxable year ending December 31, 2009, will be $85,000. X is not a large corporation as defined in section 6655(g)(2) and § 1.6655-4. X reported a liability of $74,900 on its return for the taxable year ended December 31, 2008, with no credits against tax. X paid four installments of estimated tax, each in the amount of $18,725 (25 percent of $74,900), on April 15, 2009, June 15, 2009, September 15, 2009, and December 15, 2009, respectively. X reported a tax liability of $88,900 on its return due March 15, 2010. X had a $5,000 credit against tax for tax year 2009 as provided by part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. X did not underpay its estimated tax for tax year 2009 for any of the four installments, determined as follows:
(A) Tax as defined in paragraph (g) of this section for 2009 ($88,900−$5,000) = $83,900
(B) Tax as defined in paragraph (g) of this section for 2008 = $74,900
(C) 100% of the lesser of this paragraph (j),
Example 1
(i)(A) or (i)(B) = $74,900
(D) Amount of estimated tax required to be paid on or before each installment date (25% of $74,900) = $18,725
(E) Deduct amount paid on or before each installment date = $18,725
(F) Amount of underpayment for each installment date = $0
(ii) [Reserved]

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
Y, a calendar year corporation, estimates its tax liability for its taxable year ending December 31, 2009, will be $70,000. Y is not a large corporation as defined in section 6655(g)(2) and § 1.6655-4. Y reported a Federal income tax liability of $90,000 for its taxable year ending December 31, 2008. Y paid no installment of estimated tax on or before April 15, 2009, June 15, 2009, or September 15, 2009, but made a payment of $63,000 on December 15, 2009. On March 15, 2010, Y filed its income tax return showing a tax of $70,000. Y had no credits against tax for tax year 2009. Of the $63,000 paid by Y on December 15, 2009, $17,500 is applied to each of the first three installments due on April 15, June 15, and September 15, 2009, and the remaining $10,500 is applied to the fourth installment. Y has an underpayment of estimated tax for each of the first three installments of $17,500 and for the fourth installment of $7,000. The addition to tax under section 6655(a) is computed as follows:
(A) Tax as defined in paragraph (g) of this section for 2009 = $70,000
(B) Tax as defined in paragraph (g) of this section for 2008 = $90,000
(C) 100% of the lesser of this paragraph (j),
Example 2
(i)(A) or (i)(B) = $70,000
(D) Amount of estimated tax required to be paid on or before each installment date (25% of $70,000) = $17,500
(E) Amount paid on or before the first, second, and third installment dates = $0
(F) Amount paid on or before the fourth installment date = $63,000
(G) Amount of underpayment for each of the first, second, and third installment dates = $17,500
(H) Amount of underpayment for the fourth installment date = $7,000
(ii)
Addition to tax.
Assuming that neither the annualized income installment method nor the adjusted seasonal installment method described in §§ 1.6655-2 and 1.6655-3 would result in a lower payment for any installment period, and the addition to tax is computed under section 6621(a)(2) at the rate of 8 percent per annum for the applicable periods of underpayment, the addition to tax is determined as follows:
(A) First installment (underpayment period 4-16-09 through 12-15-09), computed as 244/365 × $17,500 × 8% = $936
(B) Second installment (underpayment period 6-16-09 through 12-15-09), computed as 183/365 × $17,500 × 8% = $702
(C) Third installment (underpayment period 9-16-09 through 12-15-09), computed as 91/365 × $17,500 × 8% = $349
(D) Fourth installment (underpayment period 12-16-09 through 3-15-10), computed as 90/365 × $7,000 × 8% = $138
(E) Total of this paragraph (j),

[T.D. 9347, 72 FR 44349, Aug. 7, 2007]
§ 1.6655-2
Annualized income installment method.
(a)
In general.
In the case of any required installment, if the corporation establishes that the annualized income installment determined under this section, or the adjusted seasonal installment determined under § 1.6655-3, is less than the amount determined under § 1.6655-1—
(1) The amount of such required installment is the annualized income installment (or, if less, the adjusted seasonal installment); and
(2) Any reduction in a required installment resulting from the application of this section will be recaptured by increasing the amount of the next required installment determined under § 1.6655-1 by the amount of such reduction (and, if the next required installment is similarly reduced, by increasing subsequent required installments to the extent that the reduction has not previously been recaptured).
(b)
Determination of annualized income installment—in general.
In the case of any required installment, the annualized income installment is the excess (if any) of—
(1) The product of the applicable percentage and the tax (after reducing the annualized tax by the amount of any allowable credits) for the taxable year computed by annualizing the taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income—
(i) For the first 3 months of the taxable year, in the case of the first required installment;
(ii) For the first 3 months of the taxable year, in the case of the second required installment;
(iii) For the first 6 months of the taxable year, in the case of the third required installment; and
(iv) For the first 9 months of the taxable year, in the case of the fourth required installment; over
(2) The aggregate amount of any prior required installments for the taxable year.
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
Applicable percentage.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.6655-5(d) with respect to short taxable years—
In the case of the
following required
installments
The applicable percentage is
1st
25
2nd
50
3rd

100
(2)
Partial month.
Except as otherwise provided, for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section a partial month is treated as a month.
(3)
Annualization period not a short taxable year.
An annualization period is not treated as a short taxable year for purposes of determining the taxable income of an annualization period.
(d)
Election of different annualization periods.
(1) If the taxpayer timely files Form 8842, “Election to Use Different Annualization Periods for Corporate Estimated Tax,” in accordance with section 6655(e)(2)(C)(iii), and elects Option 1—
(i) Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will be applied by using the language “2 months” instead of “3 months”;
(ii) Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section will be applied by using the language “4 months” instead of “3 months”;
(iii) Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section will be applied by using the language “7 months” instead of “6 months”; and
(iv) Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section will be applied by using the language “10 months” instead of “9 months”.
(2) If the taxpayer timely files Form 8842, in accordance with section 6655(e)(2)(C)(iii), and elects Option 2—
(i) Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section will be applied by using the language “5 months” instead of “3 months”;
(ii) Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section will be applied by using the language “8 months” instead of “6 months”; and
(iii) Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section will be applied by using the language “11 months” instead of “9 months”.
(3) The application of the annualized income installment method is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) ABC, a calendar year corporation, had a taxable year of less than twelve months for tax year 2008 and no credits against tax for tax year 2009. ABC made an estimated tax payment of $15,000 on the installment dates of April 15, 2009, June 15, 2009, September 15, 2009, and December 15, 2009, respectively. Assume that, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, ABC elected Option 1 by timely filing Form 8842, in accordance with section 6655(e)(2)(C)(iii), and determined that its taxable income for the first 2, 4, 7 and 10 months was $25,000, $64,000, $125,000, and $175,000 respectively. The income for each period is annualized as follows:
$25,000 × 12/2 = $150,000
$64,000 × 12/4 = $192,000
$125,000 × 12/7 = $214,286
$175,000 × 12/10 = $210,000
(ii)(A) To determine whether the installment payment made on April 15, 2009, equals or exceeds the amount that would have been required to have been paid if the estimated tax were equal to 100 percent of the tax computed on the annualized income for the 2-month period, the following computation is necessary:
(
1
) Annualized income for the 2 month period = $150,000
(
2
) Tax on this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(ii)(A)(
1
) = $41,750
(
3
) 100% of this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(ii)(A)(
2
) = $41,750
(
4
) 25% of this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(ii)(A)(
3
) = $10,438
(B) Because the total amount of estimated tax that was timely paid on or before the first installment date ($15,000) exceeds the amount required to be paid on or before this date if the estimated tax were 100 percent of the tax determined by placing on an annualized basis the taxable income for the first 2-month period ($10,438), the exception described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section applies, and no addition to tax will be imposed for the installment due on April 15, 2009.
(iii)(A) To determine whether the installment payments made on or before June 15, 2009, equal or exceed the amount that would have been required to have been paid if the estimated tax were equal to 100 percent of the tax computed on the annualized income for the 4-month period, the following computation is necessary:
(
1
) Annualized income for the 4 month period = $192,000
(
2
) Tax on this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(iii)(A)(
1
) = $58,130
(
3
) 100% of this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(iii)(A)(
2
) = $58,130
(
4
) 50% of this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(iii)(A)(
3
) less $10,438 (amount due with the first installment) = $18,627
(B) Because the total amount of estimated tax actually paid on or before the second installment date ($19,562 ($15,000 second required installment payment plus $4,562 overpayment of first required installment)) exceeds the amount required to be paid on or before this date if the estimated tax were 100 percent of the tax determined by placing on an annualized basis the taxable income for the first 4-month period ($18,627), the exception described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section applies, and no addition to tax will be imposed for the installment due on June 15, 2009.
(iv)(A) To determine whether the installment payments made on or before September 15, 2009, equal or exceed the amount that would have been required to have been paid if the estimated tax were equal to 100 percent of the tax computed on the annualized income for the 7-month period, the following computation is necessary:
(
1
) Annualized income for the 7 month period = $214,286
(
2
) Tax on this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(iv)(A)(
1
) = $66,821
(
3
) 100% of this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(iv)(A)(
2
) = $66,821
(
4
) 75% of this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(iv)(A)(
3
) less $29,065 (amount due with the first and second installment) = $21,051
(B) Because the total amount of estimated tax actually paid on or before the third installment date ($15,935 ($15,000 third required installment payment plus $935 overpayment of second required installment)) does not equal or exceed the amount required to be paid on or before this date if the estimated tax were 100 percent of the tax determined by placing on an annualized basis the taxable income for the first 7-month period ($21,051), the exception described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section does not apply, and an addition to tax will be imposed with respect to the underpayment of the September 15, 2009, installment unless another exception applies to this installment payment.
(v)(A) To determine whether the installment payments made on or before December 15, 2009, equal or exceed the amount that would have been required to have been paid if the estimated tax were equal to 100 percent of the tax computed on the annualized income for the 10-month period, the following computation is necessary:
(
1
) Annualized income for the 10 month period = $210,000
(
2
) Tax on this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(v)(A)(
1
) = $65,150
(
3
) 100% of this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(v)(A)(
2
) = $65,150
(
4
) 100% of this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(v)(A)(
3
) less $50,116 (amount due with the first, second and third installment) = $15,034
(B) Because the total amount of estimated tax payments made on or before the fourth installment date that is available to be applied to the estimated tax due for the fourth installment ($9,884 ($15,000 fourth required installment payment less $5,116 underpayment for the third installment of estimated tax ($21,051 third installment of estimated tax due less $15,935 payments available to be applied to the third installment of estimated tax))) does not equal or exceed the amount required to be paid on or before this date if the estimated tax were 100 percent of the tax determined by placing on an annualized basis the taxable income for the first 10-month period ($15,034), the exception described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section does not apply, and an addition to tax will be imposed with respect to the underpayment of the December 15, 2009, installment unless another exception applies to this installment payment.
(vi) Assuming that no other exceptions apply and the addition to tax is computed under section 6621(a)(2) at the rate of 8 percent per annum for the applicable periods of underpayment, the amount of the addition to tax is as follows:
(A) First installment (no underpayment) = $0
(B) Second installment (no underpayment) = $0
(C) Third installment (underpayment period 9-16-09 through 12-15-09), computed as
91/365
× $5,116 × 8% = $102
(D) Fourth installment (underpayment period 12-16-09 through 3-15-10), computed as
90/365
× $5,150 × 8% = $102
(E) Total of this paragraph (d)(3),
Example
(vi)(A) through (D) = $204
(e)
52-53 week taxable year.
(1) Generally, except as provided in the alternative rule in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, in the case of a taxpayer whose taxable year constitutes 52 or 53 weeks in accordance with section 441(f), the rules prescribed by § 1.441-2 are applicable in determining—
(i) Whether a taxable year is a taxable year of 12 months; and
(ii) When the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, or 11-month period (whichever is applicable) commences and ends for purposes of paragraphs (b)(1), (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.
(2) If a taxpayer employs four 13-week periods or thirteen 4-week accounting periods and the end of any accounting period employed by the taxpayer does not correspond to the end of the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, or 11-month period (whichever is applicable), then, provided the taxpayer has at least one full 4-week or 13-week accounting period, as appropriate, within the applicable period, annualized taxable income for the applicable period is—
(i) [(x/(y*13))*z], in the case of a taxpayer using four 13-week periods, if—
(A) x = Taxable income for the number of full 13-week periods in the applicable period;
(B) y = The number of full 13-week periods in the applicable period; and
(C) z = The number of weeks in the taxable year; or
(ii) [(x/(y*4))*z], in the case of a taxpayer using thirteen 4-week periods, if—
(A) x = Taxable income for the number of full 4-week periods in the applicable period;
(B) y = The number of full 4-week periods in the applicable period; and
(C) z = The number of weeks in the taxable year.
(3) If a taxpayer employs four 13-week periods and the taxpayer does not have at least one 13-week period within the applicable 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, or 11-month period, the taxpayer
is permitted to determine annualized taxable income for the applicable period based upon—
(i) The taxable income for the number of weeks in the applicable period; or
(ii) The taxable income for the full 13-week periods that end before the due date of the required installment.
(4) As an alternative to using the 52/53 week taxable year rules provided in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3) of this section, a taxpayer whose taxable year constitutes 52 or 53 weeks in accordance with section 441(f) may base its annualization period on the month that ends closest to the end of its applicable 4-week period or 13-week period that ends within the applicable annualization period. This alternative may only be used if it is used for determining annualization periods for all required installments for the taxable year.
(5) The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1.
Corporation ABC, an accrual method taxpayer, uses a 52/53 week year-end ending on the last Friday in December and uses four thirteen-week periods. For its year beginning December 28, 2007, ABC uses the annualized income installment method under section 6655(e)(2)(A)(i) to calculate all of its required installments. For purposes of computing its first and second required installments, the first 3 months of A's taxable year under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will end on March 28th, the thirteenth Friday of ABC's taxable year. For purposes of its third required installment, the first 6 months of ABC's taxable year will end on June 27th, the twenty-sixth Friday of ABC's taxable year. For purposes of its fourth required installment, the first 9 months of ABC's taxable year will end on September 26th, the thirty-ninth Friday of ABC's taxable year.

# Example 2.
Same facts as
Example 1
except that ABC uses thirteen four-week periods and there are 52 weeks during ABC's taxable year beginning December 28, 2007, and ending December 26, 2008. For purposes of computing ABC's first and second required installments, ABC's annualized taxable income for the first three months will be the taxable income for the first three four-week periods of ABC's taxable year (December 28, 2007, through March 21, 2008) divided by 12 (number of full four-week periods in the first three months (3) multiplied by 4) and multiplied by 52 (the number of weeks in the taxable year). For purposes of computing ABC's third required installment, ABC's annualized taxable income for the first six months will be the taxable income for the first six four-week periods of ABC's taxable year (December 28, 2007, through June 13, 2008) divided by 24 and multiplied by 52. For purposes of computing ABC's fourth required installment, ABC's annualized taxable income for the first nine months will be the taxable income for the first nine four-week periods of ABC's taxable year (December 28, 2007, through September 5, 2008) divided by 36 and multiplied by 52.

# Example 3.
Same facts as
Example 1
except that ABC uses the alternative method under paragraph (e)(4) of this section for computing its required installments for 2008. For purposes of computing its first and second required installments, the first three months of ABC's taxable year under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will end on March 31, 2008, the month that ends closest to the end of ABC's applicable thirteen-week period for the first and second required installments. For purposes of ABC's third required installment, the first six months of ABC's taxable year will end on June 30, 2008, the month that ends closest to the end of ABC's applicable thirteen-week period for the third required installment. For purposes of ABC's fourth required installment, the first nine months of ABC's taxable year will end on September 30, 2008, the month that ends closest to the end of ABC's applicable thirteen-week period for the fourth required installment.
(f)
Determination of taxable income for an annualization period
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (f) applies for purposes of determining the applicability of the exception described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section (relating to the annualization of income) and the exception described in § 1.6655-3 (relating to annualization of income for corporations with seasonal income). An item of income, deduction, gain or loss is to be taken into account in determining the taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income (and applicable tax and alternative minimum tax) for an annualization period in the manner provided in this paragraph (f). An item may not be taken into account in determining taxable income for any annualization period unless the item is properly taken into account by the last day of that annualization period and the item is properly taken into account in determining the taxpayer's taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income (and applicable tax and alternative minimum tax) for the taxable year that includes the annualization period.
(i)
Items of income.
An item of income is taken into account in the annualization period in which the item is properly includible under the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer with respect to the item and in accordance with the appropriate provision of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, section 451 for accrual method taxpayers, section 453 for installment sales or section 460 for long-term contracts).
(ii)
Items of deduction.
An item of deduction is taken into account in the annualization period in which the item is properly deductible under the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer with respect to the item and in accordance with the appropriate provision of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, the deduction must be paid under § 1.461-1(a)(1) and be otherwise deductible in computing taxable income; under an accrual method of accounting, the deduction must be incurred under § 1.461-1(a)(2) and be otherwise deductible in computing taxable income). Section 170(a)(2) and § 1.170A-11(b) (charitable contributions by accrual method corporations) and § 1.461-5 (recurring item exception) may not be taken into consideration by an accrual method taxpayer in any annualization period in determining whether an item of deduction has been incurred under § 1.461-1(a)(2) during that annualization period.
(iii)
Losses.
An item of loss is to be taken into account during the annualization period in which events have occurred that permit the loss to be taken into account under the appropriate provision of the Internal Revenue Code.
(2)
Certain deductions required to be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner
—(i)
In general.
The following deductions allowed for a taxable year must be allocated throughout the taxable year in a reasonably accurate manner (as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section), regardless of the annualization period in which the item is paid or incurred:
(A) Real property tax deductions.
(B) Employee and independent contractor bonus compensation deductions (including the employer's share of employment taxes related to such compensation).
(C) Deductions under sections 404 (deferred compensation) and 419 (welfare benefit funds).
(D) Items allowed as a deduction for the taxable year by reason of section 170(a)(2) and § 1.170A-11(b) (certain charitable contributions by accrual method corporations), § 1.461-5 (recurring item exception) or § 1.263(a)-4(f) (12-month rule).
(E) Items of deduction designated by the Secretary by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(ii)
Application of the reasonably accurate manner requirement to certain charitable contributions, recurring items, and 12-month rule items.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(i)(D) of this section, the total amount of the item deducted in the computation of taxable income for the taxable year must be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner, notwithstanding the fact that section 170(a)(2) and § 1.170A-11(b), § 1.461-5, or § 1.263(a)-4(f) applies to only a portion of the total amount of the item deducted for the taxable year. For example, if a portion of a taxpayer's rebate liabilities are deducted in the computation of taxable income under the recurring item exception, all rebate liabilities deducted in the computation of taxable income for the taxable year must be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner.
(iii)
Reasonably accurate manner defined.
(A) An item is allocated throughout the taxable year in a reasonably accurate manner if the item is allocated ratably throughout the taxable year or if the allocation provides a reasonably accurate estimate of taxable income for the taxable year based upon the facts known as of the end of the annualization period. In determining that an allocation of an item provides a reasonably accurate estimate of taxable income for the taxable year, relevant considerations include—
(
1
) The extent to which the allocation is consistent with the taxpayer's accounting for the item on its non-tax books and records;
(
2
) The extent to which the allocable portion of the item becomes fixed and
determinable (under § 1.461-1(a)(2)) during the applicable annualization period; and
(
3
) The extent to which the allocation, if compared to the ratable allocation of the item, results in a better matching of the item of deduction to revenue, earnings, the use of property or the provision of services occurring during the annualization period.
(B) None of the relevant considerations above override the general requirement that the allocation must be done in a reasonably accurate manner based upon the facts known as of the end of the annualization period. For example, the fact that a liability for an annual expense becomes fixed and determinable during an annualization period will not establish that allocating all of the expense to that annualization period has been done in a reasonably accurate manner if the facts known as of the end of the annualization period indicate otherwise.
(iv)
Special rule for certain real property tax liabilities.
Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, real property tax liabilities for which an election under section 461(c) is in effect must be allocated ratably throughout the taxable year for purposes of this section.
(v)
Examples.
Unless otherwise stated, the following examples assume that the taxpayer uses the 3-3-6-9 annualization period:

# Example 1.
(i) Corporation ABC, a calendar year taxpayer, uses an accrual method of accounting and the annualized income installment method under section 6655(e)(2)(A)(i) to calculate all of its required installment payments for its 2008 taxable year. ABC has adopted a plan under which ABC pays an annual bonus to its employees. As of March 31, 2008, ABC estimates that it will pay a year-end bonus of $500,000 to its employees if earnings remain constant throughout the tax year. ABC does not pay any of the estimated bonus liability as of March 31, 2008. On October 31, 2008, ABC declares a $600,000 bonus to its employees which is paid out on November 15, 2008, and properly deducted in ABC's December 31, 2008, tax year. No other bonus liabilities are incurred by ABC during the tax year.
(ii) Under the general rule provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, ABC is required to allocate its employee bonus liability in a reasonably accurate manner for annualization purposes. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, ABC's employee bonus liability will be deemed to be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner if the item is allocated ratably throughout the taxable year. Therefore, ABC is permitted to recognize a $150,000 bonus deduction (one quarter of the $600,000 bonus liability properly recognized by ABC in the tax year ending December 31, 2008) in the first annualization period ending March 31, 2008.

# Example 2.
(i) Corporation ABC, a calendar year taxpayer, uses an accrual method of accounting and the annualized income installment method under section 6655(e)(2)(A)(i) to calculate all of its required installment payments for its 2008 taxable year. ABC has adopted a plan under which ABC pays an annual bonus to its employees. ABC's employee bonus plan generally calls for an annual bonus equal to 2% of earnings. A bonus reserve for this amount is reported each quarter in ABC's non-tax books and records. ABC's quarterly revenues throughout the year are $10,000,000; $6,000,000; $7,000,000; and $7,000,000 respectively. As of March 31, 2008, ABC estimates that it will pay a year-end bonus of $800,000 ($10,000,000 × 4 × 2%) to its employees if earnings remain constant throughout the year. ABC does not pay any of the estimated bonus payment as of March 31, 2008. On December 31, 2008, ABC declares a $600,000 bonus to its employees which is paid out on January 15, 2009, and properly deducted in ABC's December 31, 2008, tax year.
(ii) Under the general rule provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, ABC must allocate its employee bonus liability in a reasonably accurate manner for annualization purposes. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, ABC's employee bonus liability will be deemed to be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner if the allocation provides a reasonable estimate of taxable income based upon the facts known as of the end of the annualization period. Based upon its earnings activities and other information available as of March 31, 2008, ABC estimated that its total deduction for employee bonuses for the taxable year ending December 31, 2008, would be $800,000 ($10,000,000 first quarter earnings × 4 × 2%). Allocating $200,000 ($10,000,000 × 2%) of ABC's annual bonus liability of $600,000 to ABC's first quarter based upon earnings during the quarter represents a better matching of ABC's bonus expense to earnings in the quarter as compared to allocating $150,000 to ABC's first quarter under a ratable accrual method and is consistent with the allocation provided in ABC's non-tax books and records. Accordingly, allocating ABC's employee bonus deductions based upon ABC's earnings will be considered allocated in a reasonably accurate manner.

# Example 3.
(i) Corporation ABC, a calendar year taxpayer, uses an accrual method of accounting and the annualized income installment method under section 6655(e)(2)(A)(i) to calculate all of its required installment payments for its 2008 taxable year. ABC has adopted a plan under which ABC pays a bonus to its employees each quarter based upon earnings for that quarter. On March 31, 2008, ABC pays out $2,000,000 to its employees as a quarterly bonus based upon the earnings of ABC for the period January 1, 2008, through March 31, 2008. The $2,000,000 bonus is recognized as an expense on ABC's audited financial statements in the quarter ending March 31, 2008. As of March 31, 2008, ABC anticipates that its earnings will continue throughout the year resulting in future quarterly bonus payments in 2008 similar to the $2,000,000 first quarter payment.
(ii) Under the general rule provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, ABC is required to allocate its employee bonus liability in a reasonably accurate manner for annualization purposes. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section , ABC's employee bonus liability will be deemed to be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner if the item is allocated ratably throughout the taxable year. Therefore, ABC may recognize a $500,000 bonus deduction (one quarter of the $2,000,000 bonus liability properly recognized by ABC in the tax year ending December 31, 2008) in the first annualization period ending March 31, 2008 (as well as one quarter of any additional bonus liability properly recognized by ABC in the tax year ending December 31, 2008).
(iii) In addition, paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section provides that an allocation will be considered reasonable if the allocation provides an accurate estimate of taxable income for the taxable year based upon the facts known as of the end of the annualization period. Based upon its earnings activities and other information available as of March 31, 2008, ABC estimates that its total deduction for employee bonuses for the taxable year ending December 31, 2008, would be $8,000,000. In addition, the $2,000,000 bonus liability became fixed and determinable during the first quarter. Allocating $2,000,000 to ABC's first quarter earnings is also consistent with ABC's non-tax books and records and represents a better matching of ABC's bonus expense to earnings in the quarter as compared to a ratable accrual. Accordingly, allocating ABC's bonus liability based upon earnings will be considered a reasonably accurate manner for estimated tax purposes.
