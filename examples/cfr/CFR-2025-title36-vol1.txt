# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

(e) The regulations in this chapter are intended to treat a mobility-impaired person using a manual or motorized wheelchair as a pedestrian, and are not intended to restrict the activities of such a person beyond the degree that the activities of a pedestrian are restricted by the same regulations.
(f) In Alaska, unless otherwise provided, only the public lands (federally owned lands) within Park area boundaries are deemed a part of that Park area, and non-public lands (including state, Native, and other non-federally owned lands, including submerged lands and the waters flowing over

There is a meaningful association between the park area and the events, and the observance contributes to visitor understanding of the significance of the park area, and a permit therefor has been
issued by the superintendent. A permit shall be denied if such activities would:
(1) Cause injury or damage to park resources; or
(2) Be contrary to the purposes for which the natural, historic, development and special use zones were established; or unreasonably impair the atmosphere of peace and tranquility maintained in wilderness, natural, historic, or commemorative zones.
(3) Unreasonably interfere with interpretive, visitor service, or other program activities, or with the administrative activities of the National Park Service; or
(4) Substantially impair the operation of public use facilities or services of National Park Service concessioners or contractors; or
(5) Present a clear and present danger to the public health and safety; or
(6) Result in significant conflict with other existing uses.
(b) An application for such a permit shall set forth the name of the applicant, the date, time, duration, nature and place of the proposed event, an estimate of the number of persons expected to attend, a statement of equipment and facilities to be used, and any other information required by the superintendent. The application shall be submitted so as to reach the superintendent at least 72 hours in advance of the proposed event.
(c) As a condition of permit issuance, the superintendent may require:
(1) The filing of a bond payable to the Director, in an amount adequate to cover costs such as restoration, rehabilitation, and cleanup of the area used, and other costs resulting from the special event. In lieu of a bond, a permittee may elect to deposit cash equal to the amount of the required bond.
(2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the acquisition of liability insurance in which the United States is named as co-insured in an amount sufficient to protect the United States.
(d) The permit may contain such conditions as are reasonably consistent with protection and use of the park area for the purposes for which it is established. It may also contain reasonable limitations on the equipment used and the time and area within which the event is allowed.
(e) Violation of the terms and conditions of a permit issued in accordance with this section is prohibited and may result in the suspension or revocation of the permit.

§ 3.1
What is the applicability and scope of this part?
The applicability of the regulations in this part is described in § 1 .2 of this chapter.
§ 3.2
Do other boating laws and regulations apply to me when I operate my boat on park waters?
(a) In addition to the regulations contained in this part, the NPS adopts applicable laws and regulations of the United States Coast Guard. The USCG laws and regulations are found in Title 14 United States Code, Title 33 United States Code, Title 46 United States Code, and 33 CFR chapter I, 46 CFR chapter I and III and 49 CFR chapter IV. NPS applies the adopted laws and regulations to vessels and their operation on all waters (navigable and non-navigable) subject to NPS jurisdiction. Therefore, Federal regulations authorizing an action by the “captain of the port” or another officer or employee of the United States Coast Guard, authorize a like action by the superintendent.
(b) Except to the extent that directives of the United States Coast Guard have expressly or implicitly preempted inconsistent state laws and regulations or as otherwise provided by subsection (a), vessels and their operation on all waters subject to NPS jurisdiction are governed by non-conflicting boating safety laws and regulations of the State within whose interior boundaries a park area or portion thereof is located.
§ 3.3
Am I required to obtain a permit to operate a vessel in a park area?
Generally, you are not required to obtain a permit to operate a vessel in a park area. However, in certain circumstances, taking into consideration public safety, protection of park resources, and weather and park management objectives, the superintendent may require a permit for use of a vessel within a park area, under §§ 1.5 and 1.7, and will issue permits consistent with § 1.6 of this chapter.
§ 3.4
For what purposes may my vessel be inspected?
(a) An authorized person may at any time stop and/or board a vessel to examine documents, licenses or permits relating to operation of the vessel, and to inspect the vessel to determine compliance with regulations pertaining to
safety equipment, vessel capacity, marine sanitation devices, and other pollution and noise abatement requirements.
(b) An authorized person who identifies a vessel being operated without sufficient life saving or firefighting devices, in an overloaded or other unsafe condition, as defined in United States Coast Guard regulations, or in violation of a noise level specified in § 3.15(a) of this part, may direct the operator to suspend further use of the vessel until the condition is corrected.
§ 3.5
Do I have to report an accident involving a vessel to the National Park Service?
(a) The operator of a vessel involved in an accident must report the accident to the superintendent as soon as practical, but in any event within 24 hours of the accident, if the accident involves:
(1) Total property damage of $2000 or more; or
(2) Injury, or death or disappearance of a person
(b) If the operator is physically incapable of making the report, the owner or an occupant of the vessel must report the accident to the superintendent.
(c) Filing a report with the superintendent may satisfy applicable United States Coast Guard, State, and local accident reporting requirements. Superintendents will forward the accident report to the appropriate reporting authority in a timely manner that complies with the requirements of 33 CFR 173.55.
§ 3.6
What are the requirements to operate a power driven vessel?
(a) To operate a power-driven vessel on park waters, a person must be either:
(1) At least 16 years old; or
(2) Between 12 and 15 years old and accompanied on the vessel by a person at least 18 years old.
(b) If a park area is located within a State having different age requirements, then the applicable State law is adopted in lieu of paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) If a park area is located within a State having a mandatory boater education requirement, then that State requirement is adopted.
§ 3.7
What are the NPS Personal Floatation Device (PFD) requirements?
(a) All requirements in Title 33 CFR part 175 related to PFDs are adopted.
(b) The Superintendent may require that a PFD be worn or carried on designated waters, at designated times and/or during designated water based activities in accordance with §§ 1.5 and 1.7 of this chapter.
§ 3.8
What vessel operations are prohibited?
(a) The following operations are prohibited:
(1) Launching or operating an airboat.
(2) Launching or recovering a vessel, except at a launch site designated by the superintendent.
(3) Operating a power-driven vessel on waters not accessible by road.
(4) Operating a vessel in excess of a length, width, or horsepower restriction established by the superintendent in accordance with §§ 1.5 and 1.7 of this chapter. For the purposes of this paragraph, vessel length is measured according to criteria established in 46 CFR chapter I or 33 CFR chapter I.
(b) The following operations are inherently unsafe and therefore prohibited:
(1) Operating a power-driven or sailing vessel within 100 feet of a diver's flag except a vessel in support of dive operations, which may not be operated in excess of flat wake speed.
(2) Failing to observe restriction(s) established by a regulatory marker.
(3) Operating a vessel in excess of flat wake speed in designated areas.
(4) Operating a vessel in excess of flat wake speed within 100 feet of:
(i) A downed water skier;
(ii) A person swimming, wading, fishing from shore or floating with the aid of a flotation device;
(iii) A designated launch site; or
(iv) A manually propelled, anchored or drifting vessel. If the park is located within a State specifying different conditions, then that State law is adopted in lieu of this paragraph.
(5) Unless a designated area is marked otherwise, operating a power-
driven or sailing vessel within 500 feet of a shoreline designated as a swimming beach. This prohibition does not apply in locations such as a river, channel, or narrow cove where passage is restricted to less than 500 feet. In such restrictive locations where swim beaches are designated, the operation of a vessel in excess of a flat wake speed is prohibited.
(6) Operating a power-driven vessel while a person is riding on the decking over the bow, gunwales, top edge of the transom, motor cover, or in any other unsafe position when the vessel is being operated. This provision does not apply when that portion of the vessel is designed and constructed for the purpose of carrying passengers safely at all speeds or when the vessel is maneuvering for anchoring, docking or mooring.
(7) Operating a power driven vessel engine/s or generator with a person sitting, riding or hanging on to a swim platform or swim ladder.
(8) Operating a vessel, or knowingly allowing another person to operate a vessel in a negligent manner, by failing to exercise that degree of care which a reasonable person, under like circumstances, would demonstrate in order to prevent the endangering of the life, limb, or property of a person(s) through the operator's lack of knowledge, inattention, or general carelessness.
(9) Operating a vessel or knowingly allowing another person to operate a vessel in a grossly negligent manner, by willfully and wantonly creating an unreasonable risk of harm to person(s) or property, regardless of whether the operator intended to cause harm.
§ 3.9
May I operate my personal watercraft (PWC) in park waters?
(a) A person may operate a PWC only in park areas where authorized by special regulation. Special regulations may only be promulgated in the 21 parks listed in the following table:

(b) Where authorized, operation of a PWC on park waters is subject to the following conditions:
(1) No person may operate a PWC unless each person aboard is wearing a Type I, II, III, or V PFD approved by the United States Coast Guard.
(2) A person operating a PWC equipped by the manufacturer with a lanyard-type engine cut-off switch must attach such lanyard to his person, clothing, or PFD, as appropriate for the specific vessel.
(3) No person may operate a PWC anytime between sunset and sunrise.
(4) No person may operate a PWC by jumping the wake, becoming partially airborne or completely leaving the water while crossing the wake of another vessel within 100 feet of the vessel creating the wake.
(5) If a park area is located within a State that has more restrictive regulations for the operation of PWC, then applicable State law applies in lieu of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section.
§ 3.10
What are the regulations regarding operating a vessel while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs?
(a) Operating or being in actual physical control of a vessel is prohibited while:
(1) Under the influence of alcohol, a drug or drugs, or any combination thereof, to a degree that renders the operator incapable of safe operation; or
(2) The alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath is 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.
(b) If State law that applies to operating a vessel while under the influence of alcohol establishes more restrictive limits of alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath, those limits apply rather than the limits specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) The provisions of this section also apply to an operator who is or has been legally entitled to use alcohol or drugs.
§ 3.11
When is testing for alcohol or drugs required?
(a) At the request or direction of an authorized person who has probable cause to believe that an operator of a vessel has violated provisions of § 3.10, the operator must submit to one or more testing procedures of the blood, breath, saliva or urine for the purpose of determining blood alcohol and/or drug content.
(1) Refusal by an operator to submit to a test is prohibited and proof of refusal may be admissible in any related judicial proceeding.
(2) Any test or tests for the presence of alcohol and drugs must be determined by and administered at the direction of an authorized person.
(3) Any test must be conducted by using accepted scientific methods and equipment of proven accuracy and reliability operated by personnel certified in its use.
(b) The results of chemical or other quantitative tests are intended to supplement the elements of probable cause used as the basis for the arrest of an operator charged with a violation of § 3.10. If the alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath at the time of testing is less than alcohol concentrations specified in § 3.10(a)(2), this fact does not give rise to any presumption that the operator is or is not under the influence of alcohol.
(c) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are not intended to limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether the operator, at the time of the alleged violation, was under the influence of alcohol, or a drug, or drugs, or any combination thereof.

(a) Operating or being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle is prohibited while:
(1) Under the influence of alcohol, or a drug, or drugs, or any combination thereof, to a degree that renders the operator incapable of safe operation; or
(2) The alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath is 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Provided however, that if State law that applies to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol establishes more restrictive limits of alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath, those limits supersede the limits specified in this paragraph.
(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section also apply to an operator who is or has been legally entitled to use alcohol or another drug.
(c)
Tests.
(1) At the request or direction of an authorized person who has probable cause to believe that an operator of a motor vehicle within a park area has violated a provision of paragraph (a) of this section, the operator shall submit to one or more tests of the breath, saliva, or urine for the purpose of determining blood alcohol and drug content.
(2) Refusal by an operator to submit to a test under paragraph (c)(1) is prohibited and proof of refusal may be admissible in any related judicial proceeding.
(3) Absent exigent circumstances, an operator cannot ordinarily be required to submit blood samples for the purpose of determining blood alcohol and drug content unless it occurs through a search warrant. An authorized person who has probable cause to believe that an operator of a motor vehicle within a park area has violated a provision of paragraph (a) of this section shall get a search warrant, except when exigent circumstances exist, to obtain any blood samples from the operator for the purpose of determining blood alcohol and drug content.
(4) Any test or tests for the presence of alcohol and drugs shall be determined by and administered at the direction of an authorized person.
(5) Any test shall be conducted by using accepted scientific methods and equipment of proven accuracy and reliability operated by personnel certified in its use.
(d)
Presumptive levels.
(1) The results of chemical or other quantitative tests are intended to supplement the elements of probable cause used as the basis for the arrest of an operator charged with a violation of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the alcohol concentration in the operator's blood or breath at the time of testing is less than alcohol concentrations specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, this fact does not give rise to any presumption that the operator is or is not under the influence of alcohol.
(2) The provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are not intended to limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether the operator, at the time of the alleged violation, was under the influence of alcohol, or a drug, or drugs, or any combination thereof.

Before doing so, the superintendent must ensure that all of the following requirements have been satisfied:
(1) The superintendent must complete a park planning document that addresses bicycle use on the specific trail and that includes an evaluation of:
(i) The suitability of the trail surface and soil conditions for accommodating bicycle use. The evaluation must include any maintenance, minor rehabilitation or armoring that is necessary to upgrade the trail to sustainable condition; and
(ii) Life cycle maintenance costs, safety considerations, methods to prevent or minimize user conflict, methods to protect natural and cultural resources and mitigate impacts, and integration with commercial services and alternative transportation systems (if applicable).
(2) The superintendent must complete either an environmental assessment (EA) or an environmental impact statement (EIS) evaluating the effects of bicycle use in the park and on the specific trail. The superintendent must provide the public with notice of the availability of the EA and at least 30 days to review and comment on an EA completed under this section.
(3) The superintendent must complete a written determination stating that the addition of bicycle use on the existing hiking or horse trail is consistent with the protection of the park area's natural, scenic and aesthetic values, safety considerations and management objectives, and will not disturb wildlife or park resources.
(4)(i) If under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the resulting Finding of No Significant Impact, Record of Decision (ROD), or an amended ROD concludes that bicycle use on the specific trail will have no significant impacts, the superintendent must publish a notice in the
Federal Register
providing the public at least 30 days to review and comment on the written determination required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section. After consideration of the comments submitted, the superintendent must obtain the Regional Director's written approval of the determination required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section; or
(ii) If under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the conclusion is that bicycle use on the specific trail may have a significant impact, the superintendent with the concurrence of the Regional Director must complete a concise written statement for inclusion in the project files that bicycle use cannot be authorized on the specific trail.

§ 5.2
Alcoholic beverages; sale of intoxicants.
(a) The sale of alcoholic, spirituous, vinous, or fermented liquor, containing more than 1 percent of alcohol by weight, shall conform with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations (See also § 2.35 of this chapter.)
(b) No such liquor shall be sold on any privately owned lands under the legislative jurisdiction of the United States within Glacier, Lassen Volcanic Mesa Verde, Denali, Mount Rainier, Olympic, Rocky Mountain, Sequoia-Kings Canyon, Yellowstone, or Yosemite National Parks, unless a permit for the sale thereof has first been secured from the appropriate Regional Director.
(1) In granting or refusing applications for permits as herein provided, the Regional Directors shall take into consideration the character of the neighborhood, the availability of other liquor-dispensing facilities, the local laws governing the sale of liquor, and any other local factors which have a relationship to the privilege requested.
(2) A fee will be charged for the issuance of such a permit, corresponding to that charged for the exercise of similar privileges outside the park area boundaries by the State government, or appropriate political subdivision thereof within whose exterior boundaries the place covered by the permit is situated.
(3) The applicant or permittee may appeal to the Director from any final action of the appropriate Regional Director refusing, conditioning or revoking the permit. Such an appeal shall be filed, in writing, within 20 days after receipt of notice by the applicant or permittee of the action appealed from.

§ 5.3
Business operations.
Engaging in or soliciting any business in park areas, except in accordance with the provisions of a permit, contract, or other written agreement with the United States, except as such may be specifically authorized under special regulations applicable to a park area, is prohibited.
§ 5.4
Commercial passenger-carrying motor vehicles.
(a) The commercial transportation of passengers by motor vehicles except as authorized under a contract or permit from the Secretary or his authorized representative is prohibited in Crater Lake (prohibition is limited to sightseeing tours on the rim drive), Glacier (prohibition does not apply to nonscheduled tours on portions of the park road as defined in § 7.3 of this chapter), Grand Canyon (prohibition does not apply to the north rim or to nonscheduled tours as defined in § 7.4 of this chapter), Grand Teton (prohibition does not apply to those portions of Highways Nos. 26, 89, 187, and 287 commencing at the south boundary of the park and running in a general northerly direction to the east and north boundaries of the park), Mesa Verde (prohibition does not apply to transportation between points within the
park and outside points), Denali National Park and Preserve (prohibition does not apply to that portion of the Denali Park road between the Highway 3 junction and the Denali Park Railroad Depot), Sequoia-Kings Canyon, Yellowstone (prohibition does not apply to nonscheduled tours as defined in § 7.13 of this chapter, nor to that portion of U.S. Highway 191 traversing the northwest corner of the park) and Yosemite National Parks. The following principles will govern the interpretation and enforcement of the section:
(1) Transportation is commercial if it is operated primarily as a business activity or for profit of the operator, or if any person or organization may receive a profit, commission, fee, brokerage or other compensation for organizing, advertising, promoting, soliciting or selling the trip or tour of which such transportation is a part.
(2) Transportation is commercial if payment therefor is made directly or indirectly to the operator:
Provided,
That bona fide sharing of actual expenses will not be deemed a payment.
(3) Transportation by a motor vehicle licensed as a commercial vehicle, or of commercial type, will be presumed to be commercial unless otherwise established to the satisfaction of the Superintendent or his authorized representative.
(4) Transportation will not be deemed commercial for the sole reason that the motor vehicle is chartered or rented in good faith to the operator, by the owner, for general use at a charge based upon time or mileage or both. Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the operation of pleasure type automobiles rented without a driver on the normal terms from the owner.
(5) Subject to the provision of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, transportation is not commercial if it is a part of a trip or tour initiated, organized, and directed by an established bona fide school or college, institution, society or other organization, as a nonprofit activity of such organization, and if all passengers are students, faculty, members, or employees of such organization, or otherwise connected therewith, provided that credentials are presented at the park entrance from the head of such institution or organization indicating the trip is in accordance with the provisions stipulated herein. Clubs or associations having as a principal purpose the arranging of tours, trips, or transportation for their members will not qualify for admission into the above-named parks under the provision of this paragraph.

(f) The responsibility and liability of the operator (and the surety, if any) under the bond or security deposit must continue until the Regional Director determines that closure and post- closure care have been completed in accordance with the permit requirements. No portion of the performance bond or security deposit may be released until such a determination has been made.
(g) Within 30 calendar days after the Regional Director determines that all closure and post-closure care requirements have been successfully completed according to the permit, the Regional Director will notify the operator (and the surety, if any) that liability under the bond or security deposit has been terminated and the bond or security deposit released.

Because this concessioner is the sole provider at both of these areas, this regulation allows reallocation of snowmobiles between the North Entrance and Old Faithful as necessary, so long as the total daily number of snowmobiles originating from the two locations does not exceed 24. For example, the concessioner could operate 6 snowmobiles at Old Faithful and 18 at the North Entrance if visitor demand warranted it. This will allow the concessioner to respond to changing visitor demand for commercially guided snowmobile tours, thus enhancing the availability of visitor services in Yellowstone.
(xv) Paragraph (l)(10)(xiv) remains in effect until March 15, 2014.
(11)
How will the park monitor compliance with the required average and maximum size of transportation events?

(8)
Limitations on number of permits.
(i) The Superintendent may limit the total number of permits for motor vehicle travel on Seashore lands, and/or limit the number of permits issued for each category of eligible applicants listed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section as the Superintendent deems necessary for resource protection, public safety, or visitor enjoyment. In establishing or revising such limits, the Superintendent shall consider such factors as the type of use or purpose for which travel is authorized, the availability of other means of transportation, limits established by local jurisdictions, historic patterns of use, conflicts with other users, existing multiple permits held by individuals or a household, aesthetic and scenic values, visitor uses, safety, soil, weather, erosion, terrain, wildlife, vegetation, noise, and management capabilities. A revision of these limitations shall be published as a rule in the
Federal Register
except in emergency situations when closures may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of § 1.5 and § 1.7 of this chapter.
(ii) Limitations on permits for motor vehicle travel on Seashore lands, according to eligible applicant category, are as follows:
(A)
Year-round residents.
No more than 145 permits at any time are issued to year-round residents. A year-round resident who is denied a permit because the limit has been reached is placed on a waiting list. When the number of outstanding permits drops below 145, permits are issued in order of the date of receipt of the application. When multiple applications are received on the same day, priority is given to persons both living and working full time on the Island. One year-round resident permit is allowed per household. Permit applications are mailed by the Superintendent by December 1 of each year to those year-round residents eligible to renew their permit. The deadline for receipt of completed applications is January 31 of the permit year. Applications received after January 31 are not considered as renewals of existing permits. Should the 145 limit be reached, late applications are placed at the end of the waiting list.
(B)
Part-time residents.
Permits are issued only to part-time residents who held a residential permit as of January 1, 1978. No more than 100 part-time resident permits are issued. A part-time resident who becomes a year-round resident is eligible to apply for a year-round resident permit in accordance with paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(A) of this section. A year-round resident permit holder as of January 1, 1978, who no longer qualifies as a year-round resident, may be eligible to obtain a part-time resident permit as long as the 100 limit is not exceeded and the part-time resident definition is satisfied.
(C)
Holders of reserved rights of use and occupancy.
A holder of a reserved right of use and occupancy, or a lessee thereof, occupying a property acquired by the National Park Service in the eight-mile area described in the Act, is
issued a permit consistent with the terms under which the right of use and occupancy is retained.
(D)
Public utility and essential service vehicles.
No more than 30 permits at any time are issued to public utility and essential service vehicles. After consultation with the property owners' association of the appropriate unincorporated community or the village clerk for the Villages of Ocean Beach and Saltaire, the Superintendent may apportion permits to allow minimal service needs to each community.
(E)
Construction and business vehicles.
No more than 80 permits at any time are issued to construction and business vehicles. An operator of a construction or business vehicle who is denied a permit because the limit has been reached is placed on a waiting list. When the number of outstanding permits drops below 80, permits are issued in order of the date of receipt of the application. An operator of a construction or business vehicle may apply for either a 30-day-per-job permit or a one-year letter permit. Only a year-round construction firm or a year-round business is eligible for a one-year letter permit and only as long as the firm or business remains in year-round operation. Notwithstanding possession of either a 30-day permit or a one-year letter permit, when water transportation is available, a firm or business shall accomplish all transportation of materials, supplies, and crews by use of the nearest available ferry, freight, or other overwater transportation method. When water transportation is available, vehicles permitted under a 30-day permit may remain at the job site but must be removed upon the completion of the job.
(F)
Municipal employees.
A year-round resident who is a full-time employee of one of the two villages or of one of the 15 unincorporated communities identified in the Act is eligible for a permit if such employment necessitates year-round Island residence. Five (5) municipal employee permits are available for each village or community except on the basis of documented community need.
(G)
Recreational vehicles.
Recreational vehicles may travel between Smith Point and Long Cove along the route described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. A total of 5000 one-way trips per year are available for the recreational vehicle category. Permits for recreational vehicles may be obtained from the Smith Point Visitor Center. Annual recreational vehicle trip counts commence in September of each year and conclude the following June or when the 5000 trip limit is reached, whichever occurs first.
(9)
Permit limitations.
(i) No permit issued under these regulations shall be valid for more than one year. The superintendent may issue permits for lesser periods, as appropriate for the travel required or the time of year at which a permit is issued.
(ii) Permits for public utility, service, and official vehicles shall specify the number of vehicles and identify each vehicle whose use is authorized thereby. Permits for other motor vehicles will apply only to the single, specific vehicle for which issued.
(iii) Permits are not transferable to another motor vehicle or to a new owner or lessee of the vehicle for which issued.
(iv) Permits may specify a single or multiple uses or purposes for which travel on Seashore lands is permitted. The limitations and restrictions on authorized travel set forth in paragraph (a)(10) of this section shall apply, however, depending upon the specific use or purpose for which a permitted motor vehicle is being utilized at the time of travel.
(v) Permits may contain such other limitations or conditions as the Superintendent deems necessary for resource protection, public safety, or visitor enjoyment. Limitations may include, but will not be limited to, restrictions on locations where vehicle travel is authorized and times, dates, or frequency of travel, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (a).
(10)
Authorized travel.
(i) Except as specifically provided elsewhere in this paragraph (a)(10), travel across Seashore lands by motor vehicles with valid permits will be authorized only on those days in which the island location, which is the point of origin or destination of travel or is another point to which access by motor vehicle is permitted, is not served by alternative transportation.
When alternative transportation services satisfy the definition of alternative transportation in paragraph (a)(3), the schedule of transportation services available for the island community or communities named in the permit application shall determine the days when travel is not authorized for the motor vehicle to which that permit applies.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(10)(iii) of this section, on any day on which travel by motor vehicle is authorized due to a lack of alternative transportation, travel shall be limited to not more than one round trip per vehicle per day between the mainland and the Island, and may be performed at any time except the following periods:

On weekend days in September and October, a recreational vehicle may enter the Island until 9:00 a.m. A recreational vehicle that has entered the Island may then remain or may depart but may not re-enter the Island until after 6:00 p.m.
(iv) The Superintendent may, for situations where the restrictions in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) would create a severe hardship, authorize additional trips or travel at other hours.
(v) In the case of public utility, service, and official vehicles for which permits have been issued, the Superintendent may authorize travel on Seashore lands at any time that he determines travel by such vehicles is essential, notwithstanding the above limitations and restrictions on authorized travel.
(vi) Recurring travel conducted pursuant to paragraph (a)(10) (iv) or (v) of this section is authorized only pursuant to the terms and conditions of the original permit issued by the Superintendent; single occasion travel is authorized only pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit issued by the Superintendent on a case by case basis.
(vii) In an emergency involving the protection of life or a threatened substantial loss of property, travel by a motor vehicle which is under permit is authorized at any time.
(viii) The Superintendent may suspend any travel by motor vehicle otherwise permitted under this paragraph (a) when in his judgment such travel is inconsistent with the purpose of the Act or when such factors as weather, tides, or other physical conditions render travel hazardous or would endanger Seashore resources. Such suspension of travel shall be announced by the posting of appropriate signs or verbal order of the Superintendent.
(ix) In accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1.5 of this chapter, the Superintendent may establish a limit on the number of motor vehicles permitted on any portion of, or the entirety of, the Seashore lands at any one time when such limits are required in the interests of public safety, protection of the resources of the area, or coordination with other visitor uses.
(x) The provisions of this paragraph (a)(10) shall not apply to firefighting apparatus or to motor vehicles operated and owned or leased by a duly constituted law enforcement agency having jurisdiction within the Seashore.

Stock grazing.
(1) Privileges for the grazing of domestic livestock based on authorized use of certain areas at the time of approval of the Act of September 14, 1950 (64 Stat. 849, Pub. L. 787), shall continue in effect or shall be renewed from time to time, except for failure to comply with such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Superintendent in these regulations and after reasonable notice of default and subject to the following provisions of tenure:
(i) Grazing privileges appurtenant to privately owned lands located within the park shall not be withdrawn until title to the lands to which such privileges are appurtenant shall have vested in the United States except for failure to comply with the regulations applicable thereto after reasonable notice of default.
(ii) Grazing privileges appurtenant to privately owned lands located outside the park shall not be withdrawn for a period of twenty-five years after September 14, 1950, and thereafter shall continue during the lifetime of the original permittee and his heirs if they were members of his immediate family as described herein, except for failure to comply with the regulations applicable thereto after reasonable notice of default.
(iii) Members of the immediate family are those persons who are related to and directly dependent upon a person or persons, living on or conducting grazing operations from lands, as of September 14, 1950, which the National Park Service recognized as base lands appurtenant to grazing privileges in the park. Such interpretation excludes mature children who, as of that date, were established in their own households and were not directly dependent upon the base lands and appurtenant grazing recognized by the National Park Service.
(iv) If title to base lands lying outside the park is conveyed, or such base lands are leased to someone other than a member of the immediate family of the permittee as of September 14, 1950, the grazing preference shall be recognized only for a period of twenty-five years from September 14, 1950.
(v) If title to a portion or part of the base land either outside or inside the park is conveyed or such base lands are leased, the new owner or lessee will take with the land so acquired or leased, such proportion of the entire grazing privileges as the grazing capacity in animal unit months of the tract conveyed or leased bears to the original area to which a grazing privilege was appurtenant and recognized. Conveyance or lease of all such base lands will automatically convey all grazing privileges appurtenant thereto.
(vi) Grazing privileges which are appurtenant to base lands located either inside or outside the park shall not be conveyed separately therefrom.
(2) Where no reasonable ingress or egress is available to permittees or nonpermittees who must cross Park lands to reach grazing allotments on
non-Federal lands within the exterior boundary of the Park or adjacent thereto, the Superintendent will grant, upon request a temporary nonfee annual permit to herd stock on a designated driveway which shall specify the time to be consumed in each single drive. The breach of any of the terms or conditions of the permit shall be grounds for termination, suspension, or reduction of these privileges.
(3) Grazing preferences are based on actual use during the period March 15, 1938 through September 14, 1950 and no increase in the number of animals or animal unit months will be allowed on Federal lands in the park.
(4)(i) A permittee whose grazing privilege is appurtenant to privately owned lands within the park will be granted total nonuse or reduced benefits for one or more years without nullifying his privilege in subsequent years.
(ii) A permittee whose privilege is appurtenant to base lands outside the park may be granted total nonuse on a year to year basis not to exceed three consecutive years. Total nonuse beyond this time may be granted if necessitated for reasons clearly outside the control of the permittee. Total unauthorized nonuse beyond three consecutive years will result in the termination and loss of all grazing privileges.
(iii) Whenever partial or total non-use is desired, an application must be made in writing to the Superintendent.
(5) Grazing fees shall be the same as those approved for the Teton National Forest and will be adjusted accordingly.
(6) Permittees or nonpermittees who have stock on Federal lands within the park at any time or place, when or where herding or grazing is unauthorized may be assessed fifty cents per day per animal as damages.
(7) The Superintendent may accept a written relinquishment or waiver of any privileges; however, no such relinquishment or waiver will be effective without the written consent of the owner or owners of the base lands.
(8) Permits. Terms and conditions. The issuance and continued effectiveness of all permits will be subject, in addition to mandatory provisions required by Executive Order or law, to the following terms and conditions:
(i) The permittee and his employees shall use all possible care in preventing forest and range fires, and shall assist in the extinguishing of forest and range fires on, or within, the vicinity of the land described in the permit, as well as in the preservation of good order within the boundaries of the park.
(ii) The Superintendent may require the permittee before driving livestock to or from the grazing allotment to gather his livestock at a designated time and place for the purpose of counting the same.
(iii) Stock will be allowed to graze only on the allotment designated in the permit.
(iv) The permittee shall file with the Superintendent a copy of his stock brand or other mark.
(v) The permittee shall, upon notice from the Superintendent that the allotment designated in the permit is not ready to be grazed at the beginning of the designated grazing season, place no livestock on the allotment for such a period as may be determined by the Superintendent as necessary to avoid damage to the range. All, or a portion of the livestock shall be removed from the area before the expiration of the designated grazing season if the Superintendent determines further grazing would be detrimental to the range. The number of stock and the grazing period may be adjusted by the Superintendent at any time when such action is deemed necessary for the protection of the range.
(vi) No permit shall be issued or renewed until payment of all fees and other amounts due the National Park Service has been made. Fees for permits are due the National Park Service and must be paid at least 15 days in advance of the grazing period. No permit shall be effective to authorize grazing use thereunder until all fees and other amounts due the National Park Service have been paid. A pro rata adjustment of fees will be made in the event of reduction of grazing privileges granted in the permit, except that not more than 50 percent of the total annual grazing fee will be refunded in the event reduced grazing benefits are taken at the
election of the permittee after his stock are on the range.
(vii) No building or other structure shall be erected nor shall physical improvements of any kind be established under the permit except upon plans and specifications approved by the National Park Service. Any such facilities, structures, or buildings may be removed or disposed of to a successor permittee within three months following the termination of the permit; otherwise they shall become the property of the United States without compensation therefor.
(viii) The permittee shall utilize the lands covered by the permit in a manner approved and directed by the Superintendent which will prevent soil erosion thereon and on lands adjoining same.
(ix) The right is reserved to adjust the fees specified in the permit at any time to conform with the fees approved for Teton National Forest, and the permittee shall be furnished a notice of any change of fees.
(x) All livestock are considered as mature animals at six months of age and are so counted in determining animal unit months and numbers of animals.
(xi) The Superintendent may prescribe additional terms and conditions to meet individual cases.
(9) The breach of any of the terms or conditions of the permit shall be grounds for termination, suspension, or reduction of grazing privileges.
(10) Appeals from the decision of the Superintendent to the Regional Director and from the Regional Director to the Director shall be made in accordance with the National Park Service Order No. 14, as amended (19 FR 8824) and Regional Director, Order No. 3, as amended (21 FR 1494).

(b)
Stock grazing.
(1) Privileges for the grazing of domestic livestock based on authorized use of certain areas at the time of approval of the act of September 8, 1960 (74 Stat. 857, Pub. L. 86-729), shall continue in effect or shall be renewed from time to time, except for failure to comply with such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Superintendent in these regulations and after reasonable notice of default and subject to the following provisions of tenure:
(i) Grazing privileges appurtenant to privately owned lands located within
the Monument shall not be withdrawn until title to the lands to which such privileges are appurtenant shall have vested in the United States except for failure to comply with the regulations applicable thereto after reasonable notice of default.
(ii) Grazing privileges appurtenant to privately owned lands located outside the Monument shall not be withdrawn for a period of twenty-five years after September 8, 1960, and thereafter shall continue during the lifetime of the original permittee and his heirs if they were members of his immediate family as described herein except for failure to comply with the regulations applicable thereto after reasonable notice of default.
(iii) Members of the immediate family are those persons who are related to and directly dependent upon a person or persons, living on or conducting grazing operations from lands, as of September 8, 1960, which the National Park Service recognized as base lands appurtenant to grazing privileges in the monument. Such interpretation excludes mature children who, as of that date, were established in their own households and were not directly dependent upon the base lands and appurtenant grazing recognized by the National Park Service.
(iv) If title to base lands lying outside the monument is conveyed, or such base lands are leased to someone other than a member of the immediate family of the permittee as of September 8, 1960, the grazing preference shall be recognized only for a period of twenty-five years from September 8, 1960.
(v) If title to a portion or part of the base land either outside or inside the monument is conveyed or such base lands are leased, the new owner or lessee will take with the land so acquired or leased after September 8, 1960, such proportion of the entire grazing privileges as the grazing capacity in animal unit months of the tract conveyed or leased bears to the original area to which a grazing privilege was appurtenant and recognized. Conveyance or lease of all such base lands will automatically convey all grazing privileges appurtenant thereto.
(vi) Grazing privileges which are appurtenant to base lands located either inside or outside the monument as of September 8, 1960, shall not be conveyed separately therefrom.
(2) Where no reasonable ingress or egress is available to permittees or nonpermittees who must cross monument lands to reach grazing allotments or non-Federal lands within the exterior boundary of the monument or adjacent thereto, the Superintendent will grant, upon request, a temporary nonfee annual permit to herd stock on a designated driveway which shall specify the time to be consumed in each single drive.
(3) After September 8, 1960, no increase in the number of animal unit months will be allowed on Federal lands in the monument.
(4)(i) A permittee whose privileges are appurtenant to base lands either inside or outside the monument may be granted total nonuse on a year to year basis not to exceed three consecutive years. Total nonuse beyond this time may be granted if necessitated for reasons clearly outside the control of the permittee. Total unauthorized nonuse beyond three consecutive years will result in the termination and loss of all grazing privileges.
(ii) Whenever partial or total non-use is desired an application must be made in writing to the Superintendent.
(5) Grazing fees shall be the same as those approved for the Bureau of Land Management and will be adjusted accordingly.
(6) Permittees or nonpermittees who have stock on Federal lands within the monument at any time or place, when or where herding or grazing is unauthorized may be assessed fifty cents per day per cow or horse and ten cents per day per sheep as damages.
(7) The Superintendent may accept a written relinquishment or waiver of any privileges; however, no such relinquishment or waiver will be effective without the written consent of the owner or owners of the base lands.
(8) Permits. Terms and conditions. The issuance and continued effectiveness of all permits will be subject, in addition to mandatory provisions required by Executive Order or law, to the following terms and conditions:

(v) The permittee shall, upon notice from the Superintendent that the allotment designated in the permit is not ready to be grazed at the beginning of the designated grazing season, place no livestock on the allotment for such a period as may be determined by the Superintendent as necessary to avoid damage to the range. All, or a portion of the livestock shall be removed from the area before the expiration of the designated grazing season if the Superintendent determines further grazing would be detrimental to the range. The number of stock and the grazing period may be adjusted by the Superintendent at any time when such action is deemed necessary for the protection of the range.
(vi) No permit shall be issued or renewed until payment of all fees and other amounts due the National Park Service has been made. Fees for permits are due the National Park Service and must be paid at least 15 days in advance of the grazing period. No permit shall be effective to authorize grazing use thereunder until all fees and other amounts due the National Park Service have been paid. A pro rata adjustment of fees will be made in the event of reduction of grazing privileges granted in the permit, except that not more than 50 percent of the total annual grazing fee will be refunded in the event reduced grazing benefits are taken at the election of the permittee after his stock are on the range.
(vii) No building or other structure shall be erected nor shall physical improvements of any kind be established under the permit except upon plans and specifications approved by the National Park Service. Any such facilities, structures, or buildings may be removed or disposed of to a successor permittee within three months following the termination of the permit; otherwise they shall become the property of the United States without compensation therefor.
(viii) The permittee shall utilize the lands covered by the permit in a manner approved and directed by the Superintendent which will prevent soil erosion thereon and on lands adjoining same.
(ix) The right is reserved to adjust the fees specified in the permit at any time to conform with the fees approved for the Bureau of Land Management, and the permittee shall be furnished a notice of any change of fees.

§ 9.4
Surface disturbance moratorium.
(a) For a period of four years after September 28, 1976, no operator of a claim located within the boundaries of Death Valley National Monument, Mount McKinley National Park, or Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument (see also claims subject to § 9.10(a)(3)) shall disturb for purposes of mineral exploration or development the surface of any lands which had not been significantly disturbed for purposes of mineral extraction prior to February 29, 1976, except as provided in this section. However, where a claim is subject, for a peroid of four years after September 28, 1976, to this section solely by virtue of § 9.10(a)(3), the date before which there must have been significant disturbance for purposes of mineral extraction is January 26, 1977.
(b) An operator of a claim in one of these units seeking to enlarge an existing excavation or otherwise disturb the surface for purposes of mineral exploration or development shall file with the Superintendent an application stating his need to disturb additional surface in order to maintain production at an annual rate not to exceed an average annual production level of said operations for the three calendar years 1973, 1974, and 1975. Accompanying the application shall be a plan of operations which complies with § 9.9 and verified copies of production records for the years 1973, 1974, and 1975.
(c) If the Regional Director finds that the submitted plan of operations complies with § 9.9, that enlargement of the existing excavation of an individual mining operation is necessary in order to make feasible continued production therefrom at an annual rate not to exceed the average annual production level of said operation for the three calendar years 1973, 1974, and 1975, and that the plan of operations meets the applicable standard of approval of
§ 9.10(a)(1), he shall issue a permit allowing the disturbance of the surface of the lands contiguous to the existing excavation to the minimum extent necessary to effect such enlargement. For the purpose of this section “lands contiguous to the existing excavation” shall include land which actually adjoins the existing excavation or which could logically become an extension of the excavation; for example, drilling to determine the extent and direction to which the existing excavation should be extended may be permitted at a site which does not actually adjoin the excavating.
(d) The appropriate reclamation standard to be applied will be determined by the nature of the claim. (See §§ 9.11(a)(1) and (a)(2).)
(e) Operations conducted under a permit pursuant to this section shall be subject to all the limitations imposed by this part.
(f) For the purposes of this section, each separate mining excavation shall be treated as an individual mining operation.
§ 9.5
Recordation.
(a) Any unpatented mining claim in a unit in existence on September 28, 1976, which was not recorded on or before September 28, 1977, in accordance with the Notice of October 20, 1976 (41 FR 46357) or 36 CFR 9.5 as promulgated on January 26, 1977, is, pursuant to section 8 of the Act, conclusively presumed to be abandoned and shall be void.
(b) Any unpatented mining claim in a unit established after September 28, 1976, or in an area added to an existing unit after that date, shall be recorded with the Bureau of Land Management in accordance with the provisions of section 314 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), 90 Stat. 2769, 43 U.S.C. 1744, and regulations implementing it (43 CFR 3833.1).
(c) A claimant of an unpatented mining claim in any unit must file annually with the Bureau of Land Management a notice of intention to hold a claim or evidence of annual assessment work required by section 314 of FLPMA, as implemented by 43 CFR 3833.2. A copy of each such filing will be provided to the Superintendent of the appropriate unit by the Bureau of Land Management.
(d) The effect of failure to file the instruments required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be controlled by 43 CFR 3833.4. Recordation or filing under this section shall not render any claim valid which would not otherwise be valid under applicable law and shall not give the claimant any rights to which he is not otherwise entitled by law.
(Act of September 28, 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1901
et seq.
), Act of August 25, 1916 (16 U.S.C. 1 and 2-4) and 245 DM (42 FR 12931), as amended)
[44 FR 20427, Apr. 5, 1979]
§ 9.6
Transfers of interest.
(a) Whenever a claimant who has recorded his unpatented claim(s) with the Superintendent pursuant to the requirements of § 9.5 sells, assigns, bequeaths, or otherwise conveys all or any part of his interest in his claim(s), the Superintendent shall be notified within 60 days after completion of the transfer of: The name of the claim(s) involved; the name and legal address of the person to whom an interest has been sold, assigned, bequeathed, or otherwise transferred; and a description of the interest conveyed or received. Copies of the transfer documents will be provided by the Superintendent to the Bureau of Land Management. Failure to so notify the Superintendent shall render any existing access permit void.
(b) If the transfer occurs within the period of 12 months from the effective date of the Act and the prior owner has not recorded the unpatented claim with the Superintendent in accordance with these regulations, the holder by transfer shall have the remainder of the 12-month period to record the unpatented claim. Failure to record shall be governed by the provisions of § 9.5(c).
§ 9.7
Assessment work.
(a) An access permit and approved plan of operations must be obtained by a claimant prior to the performance of any assessment work required by Revised Statute 2324 (30 U.S.C. 28) on a claim in a unit.
(b) Permits will be issued in accordance with the following:
(1) In units subject to the surface disturbance moratorium of section 4 of the Act and § 9.4, no access permits will be granted for the purpose of performing assessment work.
(2) It has been determined that in all other units the Secretary will not challenge the validity of any unpatented claim within a unit for the failure to do assessment work during or after the assessment year commencing September 1, 1976. The Secretary expressly reserves, however, the existing right to contest claims for failure to do such work in the past. No access permits will be granted solely for the purpose of performing assessment work in these units except where claimant establishes the legal necessity for such permit in order to perform work necessary to take the claim to patent, and has filed and had approved a plan of operations as provided by these regulations. (For exploratory or development type work, see § 9.9.)
§ 9.8
Use of water.
(a) No operator may use for operations any water from a point of diversion which is within the boundaries of any unit unless authorized in writing by the Regional Director. The Regional Director shall not approve a plan of operations requiring the use of water from such source unless the right to the water has been perfected under applicable State law, has a priority date prior to the establishment of the unit and there has been a continued beneficial use of that water right.
(b) If an operator whose operations will require the use of water from a point of diversion within the boundaries of the unit can show that he has a perfected State water right junior to the reserved water right of the United States and can demonstrate that the exercise of that State water right will not diminish the Federal right, which is that amount of water necessary for the purposes for which the unit was established, he will be authorized to use water from that source for operations, if he has complied with all other provisions of these regulations.
§ 9.9
Plan of operations.
(a) No operations shall be conducted within any unit until a plan of operations has been submitted by the operator to the Superintendent and approved by the Regional Director. All operations within any unit shall be conducted in accordance with an approved plan of operations.
(b) The proposed plan of operations shall relate, as appropriate, to the proposed operations (e.g. exploratory, developmental or extraction work) and shall include but is not limited to:
(1) The names and legal addresses of the following persons: The operator, the claimant if he is not the operator, and any lessee, assignee, or designee thereof;
(2) A map or maps showing the proposed area of operations; existing roads or proposed routes to and from the area of operations; areas of proposed mining; location and description of surface facilities, including dumps;
(3) A description of the mode of transport and major equipment to be used in the operations;
(4) A description of the proposed operations and an estimated timetable for each phase of operations and the completion of operations;
(5) The nature and extent of the known deposit to be mined. When the claim is located in a National Monument in Alaska and is unpatented, a completed Supplemental Claim Information Statement shall be submitted describing the quantity, quality, and any previous production of the deposit;
(6) A mining reclamation plan demonstrating compliance with the requirements of § 9.11;
(7) All steps taken to comply with any applicable Federal, State, and local laws or regulations, including the applicable regulations in 36 CFR, chapter I;
(8) In units subject to the surface disturbance moratorium of section 4 of the Act and § 9.4, proof satisfactory to the Regional Director that the surface of the area on which the operation is to occur was significantly disturbed for purposes of mineral extraction prior to February 29, 1976, or if the area was not so disturbed, proof, including production records for the years 1973, 1974, and 1975, that new disturbance is necessary to maintain an average annual rate of production not to exceed that of the years 1973, 1974, and 1975;
(9) An environmental report analyzing the following:
(i) The environment to be affected by the operations,
(ii) The impacts of the operations on the unit's environment,
(iii) Steps to be taken to insure minimum surface disturbance,
(iv) Methods for disposal of all rubbish and other solid and liquid wastes,
(v) Alternative methods of extraction and the environmental effects of each,
(vi) The impacts of the steps to be taken to comply with the reclamation plan, and
(10) Any additional information that is required to enable the Regional Director to effectively analyze the effects that the operations will have on the preservation, management and public use of the unit, and to make a decision regarding approval or disapproval of the plan of operations and issuance or denial of the access permit.
(c) In all cases the plan must consider and discuss the unit's Statement for Management and other planning documents, and activities to control, minimize or prevent damage to the recreational, biological, scientific, cultural, and scenic resources of the unit.
(d) Any person conducting operations on January 26, 1977, shall be required to submit a plan of operations to the Superintendent. If otherwise authorized, operations in progress on January 26, 1977, may continue for 120 days from that date without having an approved plan. After 120 days from January 26, 1977, no such operations shall be conducted without a plan approved by the Regional Director, unless access is extended under the existing permit by the Regional Director. (See § 9.10(g).)
[42 FR 4835, Jan. 26, 1977, as amended at 44 FR 11069, Feb. 27, 1979]
§ 9.10
Plan of operations approval.
(a) The Regional Director shall not approve a plan of operations:
(1) For existing or new operations if the claim was patented without surface use restriction, where the operations would constitute a nuisance in the vicinity of the operation, or would significantly injure or adversely affect federally owned lands; or
(2) For operations which had not significantly disturbed the surface of the claim for purposes of mineral extraction prior to January 26, 1977, if the claim has not been patented, or if the patent is subject to surface use restrictions, where the operations would preclude management for the purpose of preserving the pristine beauty of the unit for present and future generations, or would adversely affect or significantly injure the ecological or cultural resources of the unit. No new surface mining will be permitted under this paragraph except under this standard; or
(3) For operations which had significantly disturbed the surface of the claim for purposes of mineral extraction prior to January 26, 1977, if the claim has not been taken to patent, or the patent is subject to surface use restrictions, where the operations would constitute a nuisance in the vicinity of the operation, or would significantly injure or adversely affect federally owned lands. Provided, however, operations under this paragraph shall be limited by the provisions of § 9.4, notwithstanding the limitation of that section's applicability to the three enumerated units;
(4) Where the claim, regardless of when it was located, has not been patented and the operations would result in the destruction of surface resources, such as trees, vegetation, soil, water resources, or loss of wildlife habitat, not required for development of the claim; or
(5) Where the operations would constitute a violation of the surface disturbance moratorium of section 4 of the Act; or
(6) Where the plan does not satisfy each of the requirements of § 9.9.
(b) Within 60 days of the receipt of a proposed plan of operations, the Regional Director shall make an environmental analysis of such plan, and
(1) Notify the operator that he has approved or rejected the plan of operations; or
(2) Notify the operator of any changes in, or additions to the plan of operations which are necessary before such plan will be approved; or
(3) Notify the operator that the plan is being reviewed, but that more time, not to exceed an additional 30 days, is necessary to complete such review, and
setting forth the reasons why additional time is required;
Provided, however,
That days during which the area of operations is inaccessible for such reasons as inclement weather, natural catastrophy, etc., for inspection shall not be included when computing either this time period, or that in paragraph (b) of this section; or
(4) Notify the operator that the plan cannot be considered for approval until forty-five (45) days after a final environmental impact statement, if required, has been prepared and filed with the Council on Environmental Quality.
(c) Failure of the Regional Director to act on a proposed plan of operations and related permits within the time period specified shall constitute an approval of the plan and related permits for a period of three (3) years.
(d) The Regional Director's analysis may include:
(1) An examination of the environmental report filed by the operator;
(2) An evaluation of measures and timing required to comply with reclamation requirements;
(3) An evaluation of necessary conditions and amount of the bond or security deposit to cover estimated reclamation costs;
(4) An evaluation of the need for any additional requirements in access permit; and
(5) A determination regarding the impact of this operation and the cumulative impact of all operations on the management of the unit.
(e) Prior to approval of a plan of operations, the Regional Director shall determine whether any properties included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places or National Registry of Natural Landmarks may be affected by the proposed activity. This determination will require the acquisition of adequate information, such as that resulting from field surveys, in order to properly determine the presence of and significance of cultural resources within the area to be affected by mining operations. Whenever National Register properties or properties eligible for inclusion in the National Register would be affected by mining operations, the Regional Director shall comply with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as implemented by 36 CFR part 800.
(1) The operator shall not injure, alter, destroy, or collect any site, structure, object, or other value of historical, archeological, or other cultural scientific importance. Failure to comply with this requirement shall constitute a violation of the Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431-433) (see 43 CFR part 3).
(2) The operator shall immediately bring to the attention of the Superintendent any cultural and/or scientific resource that might be altered or destroyed by his operation and shall leave such discovery intact until told to proceed by the Superintendent. The Superintendent will evaluate the discoveries brought to his attention, and will determine within ten (10) working days what action will be taken with respect to such discoveries.
(3) The responsibility for, and cost of investigations and salvage of such values that are discovered during operations will be that of the operator, where the claim is unpatented.
(f) The operator shall protect all survey monuments, witness corners, reference monuments and bearing trees against destruction, obliteration, or damage from mining operations, and shall be responsible for the reestablishment, restoration, or referencing of any monuments, corners and bearing trees which are destroyed, obliterated, or damaged by such mining operations.
(g) Pending approval of the plan of operations, the Regional Director may approve, on a temporary basis, the continuation of existing operations if necessary to enable timely compliance with these regulations and with Federal, State, or local laws, or if a halt to existing operations would result in an unreasonable economic burden or injury to the operator. Such work must be conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, and in a manner prescribed by the Regional Director and designed to minimize or prevent significant environmental effects.
(h) Approval of each plan of operations is expressly conditioned upon
the Superintendent having such reasonable access to the claim as is necessary to properly monitor and insure compliance with the plan of operations.
§ 9.11
Reclamation requirements.
(a) As contemporaneously as possible with the operations, but in no case later than six (6) months after completion of operations and within the time specified in an approved mining reclamation plan, unless a longer period is authorized in writing by the Regional Director, each operator shall initiate reclamation as follows:
(1) Where the claim was patented without surface use restriction, the operator shall at a minimum:
(i) Remove all above ground structures, equipment, and other manmade debris used for operations; and
(ii) Rehabilitate the area of operations to a condition which would not constitute a nuisance; or would not adversely affect, injure or damage, federally owned lands.
(2) On any claim which was patented with surface use restrictions or is unpatented, each operator must take steps to restore natural conditions and processes, which steps shall include, but are not limited to:
(i) Removing all above ground structures, equipment and other manmade debris;
(ii) Providing for the prevention of surface subsidence;
(iii) Replacing overburden and spoil, wherever economically and technologically practicable;
(iv) Grading to reasonably conform the contour of the area of operations to a contour similar to that which existed prior to the initiation of operations, where such grading will not jeopardize reclamation;
(v) Replacing the natural topsoil necessary for vegetative restoration; and
(vi) Reestablishing native vegetative communities.
(b) Reclamation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is unacceptable unless it provides for the safe movement of native wildlife, the reestablishment of native vegetative communities, the normal flow of surface and reasonable flow of subsurface waters, the return of the area to a condition which does not jeopardize visitor safety or public use of the unit, and return of the area to a condition equivalent to its pristine beauty.
(c) Reclamation required by this section shall apply to operations authorized under this part, except that all terms relating to reclamation of previously issued special use permits revoked by this part for operations to be continued under an approved plan of operations shall be incorporated into the operator's reclamation plans.
§ 9.12
Supplementation or revision of plan of operations.
(a) An approved plan of operations may require reasonable revision or supplementation to adjust the plan to changed conditions or to correct oversights.
(1) The Regional Director may initiate an alteration by notifying the operator in writing of the proposed alteration and the justification therefor. The operator shall have thirty (30) days to comment on the proposal.
(2) The operator may initiate an alteration by submitting to the Superintendent a written statement of the proposal, and the justification therefor.
(b) Any proposal initiated under paragraph (a) of this section by either party shall be reviewed and decided by the Regional Director in accordance with § 9.10. Where the operator believes he has been aggrieved by a decision under this paragraph, he may appeal the decision pursuant to § 9.14.
§ 9.13
Performance bond.
(a) Upon approval of a plan of operations the operator shall be required to file a suitable performance bond with satisfactory surety, payable to the Secretary or his designee. The bond shall be conditioned upon faithful compliance with applicable regulations, the terms and conditions of the permit, lease, or contract, and the plan of operations as approved, revised or supplemented.
(b) In lieu of a performance bond, an operator may elect to deposit with the Secretary, or his designee, cash or negotiable bonds of the U.S. Government. The cash deposit or the market value of such securities shall be at least equal to the required sum of the bond.
(c) The bond or security deposit shall be in an amount equal to the estimated cost of completion of reclamation requirements either in their entirety or in a phased schedule for their completion as set forth in the approved, supplemented or revised plan of operations.
(d) In the event that an approved plan of operations is revised or supplemented in accordance with § 9.12, the Superintendent may adjust the amount of the bond or security deposit to conform to the plan of operations as modified.
(e) The operator's and his surety's responsibility and liability under the bond or security deposit shall continue until such time as the Superintendent determines that successful reclamation of the area of operations has occurred.
(f) When all required reclamation requirements of an approved plan of operations are completed, the Superintendent shall notify the operator that performance under the bond or security deposit has been completed and that it is released.
§ 9.14
Appeals.
(a) Any operator aggrieved by a decision of the Regional Director in connection with the regulations in this part may file with the Regional Director a written statement setting forth in detail the respects in which the decision is contrary to, or in conflict with, the facts, the law, these regulations, or is otherwise in error. No such appeal will be considered unless it is filed with the Regional Director within thirty (30) days after the date of notification to the operator of the action or decision complained of. Upon receipt of such written statement from the aggrieved operator, the Regional Director shall promptly review the action or decision and either reverse his original decision or prepare his own statement, explaining that decision and the reasons therefor, and forward the statement and record on appeal to the Director, National Park Service, for review and decision. Copies of the Regional Director's statement shall be furnished to the aggrieved operator, who shall have 20 days within which to file exceptions to the Regional Director's decision. The Department has the discretion to initiate a hearing before the Office of Hearing and Appeals in a particular case. (See 43 CFR 4.700.)
(b) The official files of the National Park Service on the proposed plan of operations and any testimony and documents submitted by the parties on which the decision of the Regional Director was based shall constitute the record on appeal. The Regional Director shall maintain the record under separate cover and shall certify that it is the record on which his decision was based at the time it is forwarded to the Director of the National Park Service. The National Park Service shall make the record available to the operator upon request.
(c) If the Director considers the record inadequate to support the decision on appeal, he may provide for the production of such additional evidence or information as may be appropriate, or may remand the case to the Regional Director, with appropriate instructions for further action.
(d) On or before the expiration of forty-five (45) days after his receipt of the exceptions to the Regional Director's decision, the Director shall make his decision in writing;
Provided, however,
That if more than forty-five (45) days are required for a decision after the exceptions are received, the Director shall notify the parties to the appeal and specify the reason(s) for delay. The decision of the Director shall include (1) a statement of facts, (2) conclusions, and (3) reasons upon which the conclusions are based. The decision of the Director shall be the final administrative action of the agency on a proposed plan of operations.
(e) A decision of the Regional Director from which an appeal is taken shall not be automatically stayed by the filing of a statement of appeal. A request for a stay may accompany the statement of appeal or may be directed to the Director. The Director shall promptly rule on requests for stays. A decision of the Director on request for a stay shall constitute a final administrative decision.
§ 9.15
Use of roads by commercial vehicles.
(a) After January 26, 1977, no commercial vehicle shall use roads administered by the National Park Service without first being registered with the Superintendent.
(1) A fee shall be charged for such registration based upon a posted fee schedule, computed on a ton-mile basis. The fee schedule posted shall be subject to change upon 60 days notice.
(2) An adjustment of the fee may be made at the discretion of the Superintendent where a cooperative maintenance agreement is entered into with the operator.
(b) No commercial vehicle which exceeds roadway load limits specified by the Superintendent shall be used on roads administered by the National Park Service unless authorized by written permit from the Superintendent.
(c) Should a commercial vehicle used in operations cause damage to roads or other facilities of the National Park Service, the operator shall be liable for all damages so caused.
§ 9.16
Penalties.
Undertaking any operation within the boundaries of any unit in violation of this part shall be deemed a trespass against the United States, and the penalty provisions of 36 CFR part 1 are inapplicable to this part.
§ 9.17
Public inspection of documents.
(a) Upon receipt of the plan of operations the Superintendent shall publish a notice in the
Federal Register
advising the availability of the plan for public review.
(b) Any document required to be submitted pursuant to the regulations in this part shall be made available for public inspection at the Office of Superintendent during normal business hours. The availability of such records for inspection shall be governed by the rules and regulations found at 43 CFR part 2.
§ 9.18
Surface use and patent restrictions.
(a) The regulations in 43 CFR 3826.2-5 and 3826.2-6, 3826.4-1(g) and 3826.4-1(h), and 3826.5-3 and 3826.5-4 will apply to any claimant who wishes to take his claim to patent in Olympic National Park, Glacier Bay National Monument or Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.
(b) The additional provisions of 43 CFR subpart 3826 and 36 CFR 7.26 and 7.45(a) will continue to apply to existing permits until 120 days after January 26, 1977, unless extended by the Regional Director. (See § 9.10(g).

# Source:
81 FR 77992, Nov. 4, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

# Purpose and Scope
§ 9.30
What is the purpose and scope of this subpart?
(a) The purpose of this subpart is to ensure that operators exercising non-federal oil and gas rights within a System unit outside of Alaska use technologically feasible, least damaging methods to:
(1) Protect federally owned or administered lands, waters, or resources of System units;
(2) Protect NPS visitor uses or experiences, or visitor or employee health and safety; and
(3) Protect park resources and values under the statute commonly known as the NPS Organic Act;
(b) This subpart applies to all operators conducting non-federal oil or gas operations on lands or waters within System units outside of Alaska, regardless of the ownership or legislative jurisdiction status of those lands or waters.
(c) We do not intend for this subpart to result in a taking of a property interest. Application of this subpart is intended to reasonably regulate operations within System units that may affect federally owned or administered lands, waters, and resources, visitor uses and experiences, and visitor and employee health and safety.
§ 9.31
When does this subpart apply to me?
(a) This subpart applies to you if you are an operator who conducts or proposes to conduct non-federal oil or gas operations outside of Alaska.
(b) If you were operating outside of a System unit and your operation has been included within an existing System unit as a result of a change to the boundary, or included within a newly established System unit, you are subject to §§ 9.50 through 9.53.
(c) If you were operating under an exemption because your operation accessed oil and gas rights inside the System unit boundary from a surface location outside the boundary, and your surface location has been included within an existing System unit as a result of a change to the boundary, or included within a newly established System unit, you are subject to §§ 9.50 through 9.53.
§ 9.32
What authorization do I need to conduct operations?
(a) Except as provided in §§ 9.70 through 9.73, you must obtain a temporary access permit under §§ 9.60 through 9.63 or an operations permit under §§ 9.80 through 9.90 before conducting operations.
(b) You must demonstrate that you have the right to operate in order to conduct activities within a System unit.
§ 9.33
If I am already operating under an NPS authorization, what do I need to do?
(a) If you already have an NPS-approved plan of operations, you may continue to operate according to the terms and conditions of that approval, subject to the provisions of this subpart. For purposes of this subpart, we consider your approved plan of operations to be either a temporary access permit or operations permit.
(b) This section applies to you if we have granted you an exemption to the plan of operations requirement because your operation accesses oil and gas rights inside a System unit boundary from a surface location outside the boundary. You may continue to operate under the exemption provided that your operations comply with the general terms and conditions of §§ 9.120 through 9.122. You are also subject to the prohibitions and penalties in §§ 9.180 through 9.182.

The exercise of valid commercial fishing rights or privileges obtained prior to December 2, 1980, pursuant to existing law in Cape Krusenstern National Monument, the Malaspina Glacier Forelands area of the Wrangell-St. Elias National Preserve, and the Dry Bay area of Glacier Bay National Preserve, including the use of these park areas for existing campsites, cabins and other structures, motorized vehicles, and aircraft landings on existing airstrips, may continue provided that all such use is directly incident to the exercise of those rights or privileges.
(1)
Restrictions.
The Superintendent may restrict or revoke the exercise of a valid commercial fishing right or privilege based upon specific findings, following public notice and an opportunity for response, that continuation of such use of a park area constitutes a direct threat to or significant impairment of the values and purposes for which the park area was established.
(2)
Expansion of uses.
(i) A person holding a valid commercial fishing right or privilege may expand his or her level of use of a park area beyond the level of such use in 1979 only pursuant to the terms of a permit issued by the Superintendent.
(ii) The Superintendent may deny a permit or otherwise restrict the expanded use of a park area directly incident to the exercise of such rights or privileges, if the Superintendent determines, after conducting a public hearing in the affected locality, that the expanded use constitutes either:
(A) A significant expansion of the use of a park area beyond the level of such use during 1979 (taking into consideration the relative levels of use in the general vicinity, as well as the applicant's levels of use); or
(B) A direct threat to, or significant impairment of, the values and purposes for which the park area was established.
(d)
Use of native species as bait.
Use of species native to Alaska as bait for fishing is allowed in accordance with non-conflicting State law and regulations.
(e)
Closures and restrictions.

§ 13.42
Taking of wildlife in national preserves.
(a) Hunting and trapping are allowed in national preserves in accordance with applicable Federal and non-conflicting State law and regulation.
(b) Violating a provision of either Federal or non-conflicting State law or regulation is prohibited.
(c) Engaging in trapping activities as the employee of another person is prohibited.
(d) It shall be unlawful for a person having been airborne to use a firearm or any other weapon to take or assist in taking any species of bear, caribou, Sitka black-tailed deer, elk, coyote, arctic and red fox, mountain goat, moose, Dall sheep, lynx, bison, musk ox, wolf and wolverine until after 3 a.m. on the day following the day in which the flying occurred. This prohibition does not apply to flights on regularly scheduled commercial airlines between regularly maintained public airports.
(e) Persons transporting wildlife through park areas must identify themselves and the location where the wildlife was taken when requested by NPS law enforcement personnel.
(f) Using bait is prohibited except for taking furbearers with a trap under a trapping license. Using bait to attract or take bears is prohibited.
(g) [Reserved]
(h) The Superintendent may prohibit or restrict the non-subsistence taking of wildlife in accordance with the provisions of § 13.50.
(i) A person may not intentionally obstruct or hinder another person's lawful hunting or trapping by:
(1) Placing oneself in a location in which human presence may alter the behavior of the game that another person is attempting to take or the imminent feasibility of taking game by another person; or
(2) Creating a visual, aural, olfactory, or physical stimulus in order to alter the behavior of the game that another person is attempting to take.
(j) Collecting, capturing, or possessing living wildlife is prohibited unless expressly authorized by federal statute or pursuant to § 2.5 of this chapter. A falconry permit or other permit issued by the State of Alaska does not provide the required authorization. These collecting activities are not hunting or trapping activities and therefore are not allowed in national preserves under paragraph (a) of this section. This regulation does not prohibit the use of trained raptors for hunting activities where authorized by applicable federal and state law.
(k) The paragraphs of this section are separate and severable from one another. If any paragraph or portion of this section is stayed or determined to be invalid, or the applicability of any paragraph of this section to any person or entity is held invalid, it is NPS's intention that the validity of the remainder of those parts shall not be affected, with the remaining sections to continue in effect.

(1) Leaving personal property longer than 4 months is prohibited. The Superintendent may authorize property to be left in place for more than 4 months.
(2) Identification information is required for all personal property left in park areas. Identification information consists of the owner's name, home address, telephone number, date that the property was left, and the type of fuel if the property contains fuel. This information must be—
(i) Labeled on the property; or
(ii) Provided to the Superintendent.
(3) All property must be stored in such a manner that wildlife is unable to access the contents. Storing property in a manner that wildlife can access contents is prohibited.

Failure to properly contain or prevent spillage is prohibited.
(6) Leaving property unattended for longer than 24 hours on facilities is prohibited unless authorized by the Superintendent.
(7) Property left in violation of this section is prohibited and subject to impoundment and, if abandoned, disposal or forfeiture.
(c) The Superintendent may designate areas where personal property may not be left unattended for any time period, establish limits on the amount and type of personal property that may be left unattended, prescribe the manner in which personal property may be left unattended, or establish limits on the length of time personal property may be left unattended.

§ 13.50
Closure and restriction procedures.
(a)
Applicability and authority.
The Superintendent will follow the provisions of this section to close an area or restrict an activity, or terminate or relax a closure or restriction, in NPS areas in Alaska.
(b)
Factors.
In determining whether to close an area or restrict an activity, or whether to terminate or relax a closure or restriction, the Superintendent must ensure that the activity or area is managed in a manner compatible with the purposes for which the park area was established. The Superintendent's decision under this paragraph must therefore be guided by factors such as public health and safety, resource protection, protection of cultural or scientific values, subsistence uses, conservation of endangered or threatened species, and other management considerations.
(c)
Rulemaking requirements.
This paragraph applies only to a closure or restriction, or the termination or relaxation of such, which is of a nature, magnitude and duration that will result in a significant alteration in the public use pattern of the area; adversely affect the area's natural, aesthetic, scenic, or cultural values; or require a long-term modification in the resource management objectives of the area. Except in emergency situations, the closure or restriction, or the termination or relaxation of such, must be published as a rulemaking in the
Federal Register
.
(d)
Written determination.
Except in emergency situations, prior to implementing or terminating a closure or restriction, the superintendent shall prepare a written determination justifying the action. That determination shall set forth the reasons the closure or restriction authorized by paragraph (a) of this section has been established. This determination will be posted on the NPS Web site at
www.nps.gov.
(e)
Restrictions on taking fish or wildlife.
(1) Except in emergencies, the NPS will consult with the State agency having responsibility over fishing, hunting, or trapping and provide an opportunity for public comment, including one or more public meetings near the affected NPS unit, prior to implementing a closure or restriction on taking fish or wildlife.
(2) Emergency closures or restrictions may not exceed a period of 60 days and may not be extended without following the nonemergency procedures of this section.
(f)
Notice.
A list of closures and restrictions will be compiled in writing and updated annually. The list will be posted on the NPS Web site at
www.nps.gov
and made available at park headquarters. Additional means of notice reasonably likely to inform residents in the affected vicinity will also be provided where available, such as:
(1) Publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the State or in local newspapers;
(2) Use of electronic media, such as the internet and email lists;
(3) Radio broadcast; or
(4) Posting of signs in the local vicinity.
(g) Violating a closure or restriction is prohibited.

§ 13.162
Permit issuance.
(a) In making a decision on a permit application, the Superintendent shall consider whether the use by local rural residents of a cabin or other structure for subsistence purposes is customary and traditional in that park area and shall determine whether the use and occupancy of a new or existing cabin or structure is “necessary to reasonably accommodate” the applicant's subsistence uses. In making this determination, the Superintendent shall examine the applicant's particular circumstances, including but not limited to his or her past patterns of subsistence uses and his or her future subsistence use plans, reasonable subsistence use alternatives, the specific nature of the subsistence uses to be accommodated by the cabin or structure, the impacts of the cabin or structure on other local rural residents who depend on subsistence uses and the impacts of the proposed structure and activities on the values and purposes for which the park area was established.
(b) The Superintendent may permit the construction of a new cabin or other new structure for subsistence purposes only if a tent or other temporary facility would not adequately and reasonably accommodate the applicant's subsistence uses without significant hardship and the use of no other type of cabin or other structure provided for in this subpart can adequately and reasonably accommodate the applicant's subsistence uses with a lesser impact on the values and purposes for which the park area was established.
§ 13.164
Permit terms.
The Superintendent shall, among other conditions, establish terms of a permit that:
(a) Allow for use and occupancy during the harvest or gathering of subsistence resources, at such times as may be reasonably necessary to prepare for a harvest season (

(b) Prohibit residential use in conjunction with subsistence activities; and
(c) Limit the term of a permit to a period of five years or less.
§ 13.166
Temporary facilities.
A temporary facility or structure directly and necessarily related to the taking of subsistence resources may be constructed and used by a qualified subsistence user without a permit so long as such use is for less than thirty days and the site is returned to a natural condition. The Superintendent may establish conditions and standards governing the use or construction of these temporary structures and facilities which shall be published annually in accordance with § 1.7 of this chapter.
§ 13.168
Shared use.
In any permit authorizing the construction of a cabin or other structure necessary to reasonably accommodate authorized subsistence uses, the Superintendent shall provide for shared use of the facility by the permittee and other local rural residents rather than for exclusive use by the permittee.

In the case of an application to renew a permit issued pursuant to this section and § 13.186, if no circumstance relating to the permittee's occupancy and use of the structure has changed in the interim, applicable material submitted by the permittee to satisfy the original application requirements is considered sufficient and need not be resubmitted. The following information is required to be included in a permit application:
(a) An explanation of the applicant's need for the temporary facility, including a description of the applicant's hunting and fishing activities relevant to his or her need for the facility;
(b) A diagram, sketch or photograph of the temporary facility;
(c) A map that shows the geographic location of the temporary facility; and
(d) A description of both the past use (if any) and the desired use of the temporary facility, including a schedule for its projected use and removal. All information may be provided orally except the diagram, sketch or photograph of the facility and the map.
§ 13.186
Permit issuance.
(a) In making a decision on a permit application, the Superintendent shall determine whether a temporary facility is “directly and necessarily related to” the applicant's legitimate hunting and fishing activities by examining the applicant's particular circumstances, including, but not limited to his or her reasonable need for a temporary facility and any reasonable alternatives available that are consistent with the applicant's needs. The Superintendent shall also consider whether the proposed use would constitute an expansion of existing facilities or use and would be detrimental to the purposes for which the national preserve was established. If the Superintendent finds that the proposed use would either constitute an expansion above existing levels or be detrimental to the purposes of the preserve, he/she shall deny
the permit. The Superintendent may authorize the replacement or relocation within the national preserve of an existing temporary facility or structure.
(b) The Superintendent shall deny an application for a proposed use that would exceed a ceiling or allocation established pursuant to the national preserve's General Management Plan.
§ 13.188
Permit terms.
The Superintendent shall allow for use and occupancy of a temporary facility only to the extent that such facility is directly and necessarily related to the permittee's hunting and fishing activities, and shall provide that the temporary facility be used and maintained in a manner consistent with the protection of the values and purposes of the park area in which it is located. The Superintendent may also establish permit terms that:
(a) Limit use to a specified period, not to exceed the applicable hunting or fishing season and such additional brief periods necessary to maintain the facility before and after the season;
(b) Require the permittee to remove a temporary facility and all associated personal property from the park area upon termination of the permittee's hunting and fishing activities and related use of the facility or on a specific date;
(c) Require reasonable seasonal relocation of a temporary facility in order to protect the values and purposes for which the park area was established;
(d) Require that a temporary facility be used on a shared basis and not exclusively by the permittee; and
(e) Limit the overall term of a permit to a reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year.
Subpart D [Reserved]

# Subpart E—Special Visitor Services
§ 13.300
Applicability and scope.
(a) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, the regulations contained in this part apply to visitor services provided within all national park areas in Alaska.
(b) The rights granted by this subpart to historical operators, preferred operators, and Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated are not exclusive. The Director may authorize other persons to provide visitor services on park lands. Nothing in this subpart shall require the Director to issue a visitor services authorization if not otherwise mandated by statute to do so. Nothing in this subpart shall authorize the Director to issue a visitor services authorization to a person who is not capable of carrying out its terms and conditions in a satisfactory manner.
(c) This subpart does not apply to the guiding of sport hunting or sport fishing.
§ 13.305
Definitions.
The following definitions apply to this subpart:
Best offer
means a responsive offer that best meets, as determined by the Director, the selection criteria contained in a competitive solicitation for a visitor services authorization.
Controlling interest
means, in the case of a corporation, an interest, beneficial or otherwise, of sufficient outstanding voting securities or capital of the business so as to permit the exercise of managerial authority over the actions and operations of the corporation or election of a majority of the board of directors of the corporation.
Controlling interest
in the case of a partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, or individual entrepreneurship, means a beneficial ownership of or interest in the entity or its capital so as to permit the exercise of managerial authority over the actions and operations of the entity. In other circumstances,
controlling interest
means any arrangement under which a third party has the ability to exercise management authority over the actions or operations of the business.
Director
means the Director of the National Park Service or an authorized representative.
Historical operator
, except as otherwise may be specified by a statute other than ANILCA, means the holder of a valid written authorization from the Director to provide visitor services within a park area that:
(1) On or before January 1, 1979, was lawfully engaged in adequately providing such visitor services in the applicable park area;
(2) Has continued, as further defined in § 13.310, to lawfully provide that visitor service since January 1, 1979, without a change in controlling interest; and
(3) Is otherwise determined by the Director to have a right to continue to provide such services or similar services pursuant to § 13.310.
Local area
means an area in Alaska within 100 miles of the location within the park area where any of the applicable visitor services is authorized to be provided.
Local resident
means:
For individuals.
Those individuals who have lived within the local area for 12 consecutive months before issuance of a solicitation of offers for a visitor services authorization for a park area and who maintain their primary, permanent residence and business within the local area and whenever absent from this primary, permanent residence, have the intention of returning to it. Factors demonstrating the location of an individual's primary, permanent residence and business may include, but are not limited to, the permanent address indicated on licenses issued by the State of Alaska, tax returns and voter registration.
For corporations.
A corporation in which the controlling interest is held by an individual or individuals who qualify as
local resident(s)
within the meaning of this subpart. For non-profit corporations a majority of the board members and a majority of the officers must qualify individually as local residents.
Native Corporation
means the same as defined in section 102(6) of ANILCA.
Preferred operator
means a Native Corporation that is determined under § 13.325 to be “most directly affected” by the establishment or expansion of a park area by ANILCA, or a local resident as defined in this subpart.
Responsive offer
is one that is timely received and meets the terms and conditions of a solicitation for a visitor services authorization.
Visitor services authorization
is a written authorization from the Director to provide visitor services in a park area. Such authorization may be in the form of a concession permit, concession contract, or other document issued by the Director under National Park Service policies and procedures.
§ 13.310
Historical operators.
(a) A historical operator will have a right to continue to provide visitor services in a park area under appropriate terms and conditions contained in a visitor services authorization issued by the Director as long as such services are determined by the Director to be consistent with the purposes for which the park area was established. A historical operator may not operate without such an authorization. The authorization will be for a fixed term. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the authorization will result in cancellation of the authorization and consequent loss of historical operator rights under this subpart.
(b) Nothing in this subpart will prohibit the Director from permitting persons in addition to historical operators to provide visitor services in park areas at the Director's discretion as long as historical operators are permitted to conduct a scope and level of visitor services equal to those provided before January 1, 1979, under terms and conditions consistent with this subpart. A historical operator may be permitted by the Director under separate authority to increase the scope or level of visitor services provided prior to January 1, 1979, but no historical operating rights will be obtained in such increase.
(c) If a historical operator applies for a visitor services authorization in the form of a joint venture, the application will not be considered as validly made unless the historical operator demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Director, that it has the controlling interest in the joint venture.
(d) A historical operator may apply to the Director for an authorization or amended authorization to provide visitor services similar to those it provided before January 1, 1979. The Director will grant the request if such visitor services are determined by the Director to be:
(1) Consistent with the protection of park resources and the purposes for which the park area was established;
(2) Similar in kind and scope to the visitor services provided by the historical operator before January 1, 1979; and
(3) Consistent with the legal rights of any other person.
(e) When a historical operator's visitor services authorization expires, and if the applicable visitor services continue to be consistent with the purposes for which the park area was established as determined by the Director, the Director will offer to renew the authorization for a fixed term under such new terms and conditions as the Director determines are in the public interest.
(f) If the Director determines that authorized visitor services must be curtailed or reduced in scope, level, or season to protect park resources, or for other purposes, the Director will require the historical operator to make such changes in visitor services. If more than one historical operator providing the same type of visitor services is required to have those services curtailed, the Director will establish a proportionate reduction of visitor services among all such historical operators, taking into account historical operating levels and other appropriate factors so as to achieve a fair curtailment of visitor services among the historical operators. If the level of visitor services must be so curtailed that only one historical operator feasibly may continue to provide the visitor services, the Director will select one historical operator to continue to provide the curtailed visitor services through a competitive selection process.
(g) Any of the following will result in loss of historical operator status:
(1) Revocation of an authorization for historic types and levels of visitor services for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the authorization.
(2) A historical operator's declination of a renewal of the authorization made pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
(3) A change in the controlling interest of the historical operator through sale, assignment, devise, transfer, or by any other means, direct or indirect. A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator that results only in the acquisition of the controlling interest by an individual or individuals who were personally engaged in the visitor services activities of the historical operator before January 1, 1979, will not be deemed a change in the historical operator's controlling interest for the purposes of this subpart.
(4) A historical operator's failure to provide the authorized services for more than 24 consecutive months.
(h) The Director may authorize other persons to provide visitor services in a park area in addition to historical operators.
§ 13.315
Preferred operators.
(a) In selecting persons to provide visitor services for a park area, the Director will, if the number of visitor services authorizations is to be limited, give a preference (subject to any rights of historical operators or CIRI under this subpart) to preferred operators determined qualified to provide such visitor services.
(b) In such circumstances, the Director will publicly solicit competitive offers for persons to apply for a visitor services authorization, or the renewal of such an authorization, to provide such visitor services pursuant to 36 CFR part 51 and/or other National Park Service procedures. All offerors, including preferred operators, must submit a responsive offer to the solicitation in order to be considered for the authorization. If the best offer from a preferred operator is at least substantially equal to the best offer from a non-preferred operator, the preferred operator will receive authorization. If an offer from a person besides a preferred operator is determined to be the best offer (and no preferred operator submits a responsive offer that is substantially equal to it), the preferred operator who submitted the best offer from among the offers submitted by preferred operators will be given the opportunity, by amending its offer, to meet the terms and conditions of the best offer received. If the amended offer of such a preferred operator is considered by the Director as at least substantially equal to the best offer,
the preferred operator will receive the visitor service authorization. If a preferred operator does not amend its offer to meet the terms and conditions of the best offer, the Director will issue the authorization to the person who submitted the best offer in response to the solicitation.
(c) The Native Corporation(s) determined to be “most directly affected”under this subpart and local residents have equal preference. The rights of preferred operators under this section take precedence over the right of preference that may be granted to existing satisfactory National Park Service concessioners pursuant to the Concessions Policy Act (16 U.S.C. 20) and its implementing regulations and procedures, but do not take precedence over the rights of historical operators or CIRI as described in this subpart.
(d) An offer from a preferred operator under this subpart, if the offer is in the form of a joint venture, will not be considered valid unless it documents to the satisfaction of the Director that the preferred operator holds the controlling interest in the joint venture.
(e) Nothing in this subpart will prohibit the Director from authorizing persons besides preferred operators to provide visitor services in park areas as long as the procedures described in this section have been followed. Preferred operators are not entitled by this section to provide all visitor services in a park area.
(f) The preferences described in this section may not be sold, assigned, transferred or devised, directly or indirectly.
§ 13.320
Preference to Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated.
(a) The Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated (CIRI), in cooperation with village corporations within the Cook Inlet region when appropriate, will have a right of first refusal to provide new visitor services within that portion of Lake Clark National Park and Preserve that is within the boundaries of the Cook Inlet region. In order to exercise this right of first refusal, the National Park Service will publicly solicit competitive offers for the visitor services authorization pursuant to 36 CFR part 51 or other applicable National Park Service procedures. CIRI must submit a responsive offer within 90 days of such solicitation. If CIRI makes such an offer and is determined by the Director to be capable of carrying out the terms and conditions of the visitor services authorization, it will receive the authorization. If it does not, the authorization may be awarded to another person pursuant to usual National Park Service policies and procedures if otherwise appropriate.
(b) The CIRI right of first refusal will have precedence over the rights of preferred operators. An offer from CIRI under this section, if the offer is in the form of a joint venture, will not be considered valid unless it demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that CIRI has a controlling interest in the joint venture.
(c) The CIRI right of first refusal may not be sold, transferred, devised or assigned, directly or indirectly.
§ 13.325
Most directly affected Native Corporation.
(a) Before the award of the first visitor service authorization in a park area to be made after the effective date of this subpart, the Director will provide an opportunity for any Native Corporation interested in providing visitor services within the applicable park area to submit an application to the superintendent to be determined the Native Corporation most directly affected by the establishment or expansion of the park area by or under the provisions of ANILCA. An application from an interested Native Corporation will include the following information:
(1) Name, address, and phone number of the Native Corporation; date of incorporation; its articles of incorporation and structure;
(2) Location of the corporation's population center or centers; and
(3) An assessment of the socioeconomic impacts, including historical and traditional use and land-ownership patterns and their effects on the Native Corporation as a result of the expansion or establishment of the applicable park area by ANILCA.
(4) Any additional information the Native Corporation considers relevant
or the Director may reasonably require.
(b) Upon receipt of all applications from interested Native Corporations, the Director will determine the “most directly affected” Native Corporation considering the following factors:
(1) Distance and accessibility from the corporation's population center and/or business address to the applicable park area; and
(2) Socioeconomic impacts, including historical and traditional use and landownership patterns, on Native Corporations and their effects as a result of the expansion or establishment of the applicable park area; and
(3) Information provided by Native Corporations and other information considered relevant by the Director to the particular facts and circumstances of the effects of the establishment or expansion of the applicable park area.
(c) In the event that more than one Native Corporation is determined to be equally affected within the meaning of this section, each such Native Corporation will be considered as a preferred operator under this subpart.
(d) The Director's most directly affected Native Corporation determination applies to the award of all future visitor service authorizations for the applicable park area. However, a Native Corporation that did not apply for this determination in connection with an earlier visitor services authorization may apply for a determination that it is an equally affected Native Corporation for the applicable park area in connection with a later visitor services authorization. Such subsequent applications must contain the information required by paragraph (a) of this section, and must be made in a timely manner as described by the Director in the applicable solicitation document so as not to delay the consideration of offers for the visitor services authorization.
§ 13.330
Appeal procedures.
An appeal of the denial of rights with respect to providing visitor services under this subpart may be made to the next higher level of authority. Such an appeal must be submitted in writing within 30 days of receipt of the denial. Appeals must set forth the facts and circumstances that the appellant believes support the appeal. The appellant may request an informal meeting to discuss the appeal with the National Park Service. After consideration of the materials submitted by the appellant and the National Park Service record of the matter, and meeting with the appellant if so requested, the Director will affirm, reverse, or modify the denial appealed and will set forth in writing the basis of the decision. A copy of the decision will be forwarded to the appellant and will constitute the final administrative decision in the matter. No person will be considered to have exhausted administrative remedies with respect to a denial of rights to provide visitor services under this subpart until a final administrative decision has been made pursuant to this section.
§ 13.335
Information collection.
(a) The information collection requirements contained in this part have received emergency approval from the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507,
et seq.,
for the basic contracting program under OMB clearance number 1024-0125. The information is being collected as part of the process of reviewing the procedures and programs of State and local governments participating in the national historic preservation program. The information will be used to evaluate those procedures and programs. The obligation to respond is required to obtain a benefit.
(b) The public reporting burden for the collection of information is estimated to be 480 hours for large operations and 240 hours for small operations, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed and completing and reviewing the collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Information Collection Officer, National Park Service, 800 North Capitol Street, Washington, DC 20013; and the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of Interior (1024-0125), Washington, DC 20503.

# Subpart F—Subsistence
§ 13.400
Purpose and policy.
(a) Consistent with the management of fish and wildlife in accordance with recognized scientific principles and the purposes for which each park area was established, designated, or expanded by ANILCA, the purpose of this subpart is to provide the opportunity for local rural residents engaged in a subsistence way of life to do so pursuant to applicable State and Federal law.
(b) Consistent with sound management principles, and the conservation of healthy populations of fish and wildlife, the utilization of park areas is to cause the least adverse impact possible on local rural residents who depend upon subsistence uses of the resources of the public lands in Alaska.
(c) Nonwasteful subsistence uses of fish, wildlife and other renewable resources by local rural residents shall be the priority consumptive uses of such resources over any other consumptive uses permitted within park areas pursuant to applicable State and Federal law.
(d) Whenever it is necessary to restrict the taking of a fish or wildlife population within a park area for subsistence uses in order to assure the continued viability of such population or to continue subsistence uses of such population, the population shall be allocated among local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses in accordance with a subsistence priority system based on the following criteria:
(1) Customary and direct dependence upon the resource as the mainstay of one's livelihood;
(2) Local residency; and
(3) Availability of alternative resources.
(e) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as permitting a level of subsistence use of fish and wildlife within park areas to be inconsistent with the conservation of healthy populations, and within a national park or monument to be inconsistent with the conservation of natural and healthy populations, of fish and wildlife.
[71 FR 69333, Nov. 30, 2006, as amended at 80 FR 64344, Oct. 23, 2015]

§ 13.450
Prohibition of aircraft use.
(a) Notwithstanding the provisions 43 CFR 36.11(f) the use of aircraft for access to or from lands and waters within a national park or monument for purposes of taking fish or wildlife for subsistence uses within the national park or monument is prohibited except as provided in this section.
(b)
Exceptions.
(1) In extraordinary cases where no reasonable alternative exists, the Superintendent shall permit, pursuant to specified terms and conditions, a local rural resident of an “exempted community” to use aircraft for access to or from lands and water within a national park or monument for purposes of taking fish or wildlife for subsistence uses.
(i) A community shall quality as an “exempted community” if, because of the location of the subsistence resources upon which it depends and the extraordinary difficulty of surface access to these subsistence resources, the local rural residents who permanently reside in the community have no reasonable alternative to aircraft use for access to these subsistence resources.
(ii) A community which is determined, after notice and comment (including public hearing in the affected local vicinity), to meet the description of an “exempted community” set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be included in the appropriate special regulations for each park and monument in this part.
(iii) A community included as an “exempted community” in the special regulations of this part may be deleted therefrom upon a determination, after notice and comment (including public hearing in the affected local vicinity), that it does not meet the description of an “exempted community” set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(2) Any local rural resident aggrieved by the prohibition on aircraft use set forth in this section may apply for an exception to the prohibition pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 13.495. In extraordinary cases where no reasonable alternative exists, the Superintendent may grant the exception upon a determination that the location of the subsistence resources depended upon and the difficulty of surface access to these resources, or other emergency situation, requires such relief.
(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the use of aircraft for access to lands and waters within a national park or monument for purposes of engaging in any activity allowed by law other than the taking of fish and wildlife. Such activities include, but are not limited to, transporting supplies.
§ 13.460
Use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams, and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams, and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses is permitted within park areas except at those times and in those areas restricted or closed by the Superintendent.
(b) The Superintendent may restrict or close a route or area to use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams, or other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses if the Superintendent determines that such use is causing or is likely to cause an adverse impact on public health and safety, resource protection, protection of historic or scientific values, subsistence uses, conservation of endangered or threatened species, or the purposes for which the park area was established.
(c) No restrictions or closures shall be imposed without notice and a public hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate. In the case of emergency situations, restrictions or closures shall not exceed sixty (60) days and shall not be extended unless the Superintendent establishes, after notice and public hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate, that such extension is justified according to the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Notice of the proposed or emergency restrictions or closures and the reasons therefore shall be published in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the State and in at least one local newspaper if appropriate, and information about such proposed or emergency actions shall also be made available for broadcast on local radio stations in a manner reasonably calculated to inform local rural residents in the affected vicinity. All restrictions and closures shall be designated on a map which shall be available for public inspection at the office of the Superintendent of the affected park area and the post office or postal authority of every affected community within or near the park area, or by the posting of signs in the vicinity of the restrictions or closures, or both.
(d) Motorboats, snowmobiles, dog teams, and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses shall be operated:
(1) In compliance with applicable State and Federal law;
(2) In such a manner as to prevent waste or damage to the park areas; and
(3) In such a manner as to prevent the herding, harassment, hazing or driving of wildlife for hunting or other purposes.
(e) At all times when not engaged in subsistence uses, local rural residents may use snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams, and other means of surface transportation in accordance with 43 CFR 36.11(c), (d), (e), and (g).
§ 13.470
Subsistence fishing.
Fish may be taken by local rural residents for subsistence uses in park areas where subsistence uses are allowed in compliance with applicable Federal law and regulation, including the provisions of §§ 2.3 and 13.40 of this chapter. Local rural residents in park areas where subsistence uses are allowed may fish with a net, seine, trap, or spear; or use native species as bait, where permitted by applicable Federal law and regulation.
[80 FR 64344, Oct. 23, 2015]
§ 13.480
Subsistence hunting and trapping.
(a) Local rural residents may hunt and trap wildlife for subsistence uses in park areas where subsistence uses are allowed in compliance with this chapter and 50 CFR part 100.
(b)(1) The following types of bait may be used to take bears for subsistence uses:
(i) Parts of legally taken native fish or wildlife that are not required to be salvaged; or
(ii) Remains of native fish or wildlife that died of natural causes.
(2) The use of any other type of bait to take bears for subsistence uses is prohibited except under the terms and conditions of a permit issued under paragraph (d) of § 13.1902.

§ 13.930
Do I need a permit to operate a motor vehicle on the Denali Park road west of the Savage River?
Yes, you must obtain a permit from the superintendent to operate a motor vehicle on the restricted section of the Denali Park road. The restricted section begins at the west end of the Savage River Bridge (mile 14.8) and continues to the former Mt. McKinley National Park boundary north of Wonder Lake (mile 87.9).
§ 13.932
How many permits will be issued each summer?
The superintendent is authorized, under this subpart, to issue no more than 10,512 motor vehicle permits each year for access to the restricted section of the road. The superintendent will issue the permits for the period that begins on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend and continues through the second Thursday following Labor Day or September 15, whichever comes first. Each permit allows one vehicle one entry onto the restricted portion of the Park road.
§ 13.934
How will the superintendent manage the permit program?
(a) The superintendent will apportion motor vehicle permits among authorized users following the procedures in § 13.55. Authorized users are individuals, groups and governmental entities who are allowed by law or policy to use the restricted section of the road.
(b) The superintendent will establish an annual date to evaluate permit requests and publish that date, along with the results of the annual apportionment, in the superintendent's compendium of rules and orders. The superintendent's compendium is available to the public upon request.

# Snowmachine (Snowmobile) Operations
§ 13.950
What is the definition of a traditional activity for which Section 1110(a) of ANILCA permits snowmachines to be used in the former Mt. McKinley National Park (Old Park) portion of Denali National Park and Preserve?
A
traditional activity
is an activity that generally and lawfully occurred in the Old Park contemporaneously with the enactment of ANILCA, and that was associated with the Old Park, or a discrete portion thereof, involving the consumptive use of one or more natural resources of the Old Park such as hunting, trapping, fishing, berry picking or similar activities. Recreational use of snowmachines was not a traditional activity. If a traditional activity generally occurred only in a particular area of the Old Park, it would be considered a traditional activity only in the area where it had previously occurred. In addition, a traditional activity must be a legally permissible activity in the Old Park.
§ 13.952
May a snowmachine be used in that portion of the park formerly known as Mt. McKinley National Park (Old Park)?
No, based on the application of the definition of traditional activities within the park to the factual history of the Old Park, there are no traditional activities that occurred during periods of adequate snow cover within the Old Park; and, thus, Section 1110(a) of ANILCA does not authorize snowmachine access. Hunting and trapping were not and are not legally permitted activities in the Old Park at any time of the year. Sport fishing has not taken place in the Old Park during periods of adequate snow cover due to weather conditions that are adverse to sport fishing, and the limited fishery resources within the Old Park. During periods of adequate snow cover, berry picking is not feasible, and has not taken place in the Old Park. Under the definition, recreational use of snowmachines is not a traditional activity. There are no villages, homesites or other valid occupancies within the Old Park. Access by snowmachine through the Old Park in transit to homesites, villages and other valid occupancies was not lawful prior to the enactment of ANILCA and is available through routes outside the Old Park that have been historically used for that purpose. Therefore, the use of snowmachines is not authorized by section 1110(a) for such travel. Further, Congress did not authorize subsistence activities in the Old Park. In addition, the National Park Service has determined that the use of even a few snowmachines in the Old Park would be detrimental to the resource values of the area. Therefore, because no usage is authorized in the Old Park by section 1110(a) the Old Park remains closed to all snowmachine use in accordance with 36 CFR 2.18.
§ 13.954
Where can I operate a snowmachine in Denali National Park and Preserve?
You can use a snowmachine outside of the Old Park for traditional activities or travel to and from villages and homesites and other valid occupancies as authorized by 43 CFR 36.11(c), or when lawfully engaged in subsistence activities authorized by § 13.460.
§ 13.956
What types of snowmachines are allowed?
The types of snowmachines allowed are defined in § 13.1 under “snowmachine or snowmobile”.
§ 13.958
What other regulations apply to snowmachine use?
Snowmachine use is governed by regulations at § 2.18(a) of this chapter, traffic safety, § 2.18(b) of this chapter, state laws, and § 2.18(d) and (e) of this chapter, prohibited activities; and 43 CFR 36.11(a)(2) adequate snow cover, and 43 CFR 36.11(c) traditional activities.
§ 13.960
Who determines when there is adequate snow cover?
The superintendent will determine when snow cover is adequate for snowmachine use. The superintendent will follow the procedures in §§ 1.5 and 1.7 of this chapter to inform the public.
§ 13.962
Does the Superintendent have other regulatory authority?
Nothing in this subpart shall limit the authority of the superintendent to restrict or limit uses of an area under other statutory authority.
